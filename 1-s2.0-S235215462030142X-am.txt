Abstract
Throughout life, we might seek a calling, companions, skills, entertainment, truth, self-knowledge,
beauty, and ediﬁcation. The practice of curiosity can be viewed as an extended and open-ended search for
valuable information with hidden identity and location in a complex space of interconnected information.
Despite its importance, curiosity has been challenging to computationally model because the practice
of curiosity often ﬂourishes without speciﬁc goals, external reward, or immediate feedback. Here, we
show how network science, statistical physics, and philosophy can be integrated into an approach that
coheres with and expands the psychological taxonomies of speciﬁc-diversive and perceptual-epistemic cu-
riosity. Using this interdisciplinary approach, we distill functional modes of curious information seeking
as searching movements in information space. The kinesthetic model of curiosity oﬀers a vibrant coun-
terpart to the deliberative predictions of model-based reinforcement learning. In doing so, this model
unearths new computational opportunities for identifying what makes curiosity curious.

Seeking information with the potential value to learn diverse skills, understand the world, form social rela-
tions, and promote individual well-being is essential to ﬂourishing throughout life [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Humans
encounter information in an ever-expanding and shape-shifting search space of knowledge that is vast and
complex [8, 9]. The stream of encounters can bring about averse states of uncertainty, pleasurable states of
interest, or expectations of usefulness for learning and action, thereby guiding future exploratory strategies
[1, 4]. However, inferring the hedonic or utilitarian value of information to guide behavior is costly and
time-consuming in complex spaces [10, 11, 3]. Curiosity may have evolved to overcome these costs, promot-
ing eﬃcient search strategies to encounter potentially valuable information without prior knowledge of the
information’s identity and location [12, 13, 3].
We propose to understand the kinesthetic modes of search strategies associated with curiosity using network
science, statistical physics, and philosophy [14, 15, 16, 17]. Since antiquity, investigations of curiosity have
contemplated its essential components [15]. However, we argue that curiosity is best characterized by its
searching function [15]. In a model called kinesthetic curiosity, we distill three major modes of potentially
many functions described by movement embedded within information landscapes: the busybody scouts for
loose threads of novelty, the hunter pursues speciﬁc answers in a projectile path, and the dancer leaps in
creative breaks with tradition [15]. Each mode of function is linked with a distinct signature of searching
movement (Figure 1). The paths of movement from one piece of information to another are threads creating
webs of interlinked information, which we call knowledge networks. As the byproduct of searching movement,
knowledge network structures may support learning, creativity, and social behavior, without the need for
task-speciﬁc goals, utility, and feedback [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28].
In this review, we ﬁrst describe the kinesthetic curiosity model of eﬃcient search (Section 1). We then
explain how kinesthetic curiosity integrates existing theories of curiosity and reinforcement learning (Section
2). Next, we consider the evolutionary origins of kinesthetic curiosity and hypothesize neural mechanisms
(Section 3). Last, we propose that analyses of knowledge network structure and growth quantify previ-
ously qualitative descriptions of curiosity and test contemporary theories of information seeking (Section 4).
Broadly, we oﬀer a perspective that expands our understanding of the practice of curiosity beyond states
and traits by positing a computational model of kinesthetic curiosity.
1
Knowledge network growth principles
The kinesthetic curiosity model posits open-ended and intrinsically motivated movements in an information
space (Figure 1). What is the elementary rule of such movements? To answer this question, we observe
that humans often behave quickly and automatically when they must consider many options in complex and
changing environments [11]. Thus, a natural rule to consider is that of a random walk. Mathematically, the
probability of walking across a path in a network is directly related to the weighted strength of that path. As
a computational process, random walk models of behavior can explain several intelligent behaviors including
navigation, memory recall, and creativity [18, 13, 19, 24]. As a movement principle, random walks explain
patterns of exploration and foraging [13]. When applied to human information seeking, random exploration
is economical in that it requires little computational capacity, but can oversample the environment and thus
be ineﬃcient [37, 38, 10].
The random walk model therefore requires additional principles that account for the kinesthetic signatures
of discovery and search [39, 40, 41, 42]. Two parsimonious movement principles generate the kinesthetic
signatures of the busybody, hunter, and dancer, as well as the diverse spectra in between [15, 16]. First,
movements to discover new information can be biased by memory of the familiar; second, search patterns
can be biased to eﬃciently explore a space. The principle of memory for the familiar can be formalized by
the notion of edge reinforcement, and that of eﬃcient search can be formalized by the notion of a L´evy ﬂight.
In isolating these principles of discovery and search, it becomes possible to model curious behavior that
shifts continuously between the archetypal modes of the busybody, hunter, and dancer, as well as individual
2
Figure 1: The kinesthetic curiosity model: the concept, associated network representations, and an operationaliza-
tion in an ecological experiment. (A) The kinesthetic curiosity model posits that curiosity is best explained by movement
through information space. Three such movements are conceptually operationalized by the historical archetypes of the
busybody, the hunter, and the dancer [15]. Selected quotes from the 1st to 20th centuries describe each of the modes
[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. (B) The information-seeking movements of the kinesthetic curiosity model can be formalized
in the abstract. Each movement is a walk on an underlying collective (or otherwise a priori existing) knowledge network.
As each person takes this walk, they build their own individualized knowledge network composed of informational units
(nodes) and informational relations (edges) [14, 17]. Busybodies construct loose networks, hunters build tight networks,
and dancers bridge seemingly disparate modules [14, 15].
By adjusting two parsimonious model parameters distilling
movement principles of discovery and search, a person may shift continuously between these three modes. Here we show
simulated knowledge networks that we generated using a computational model of network growth (see main text) [16].
Modules are colored according to the WalkTrap algorithm [36]. (C) To make the kinesthetic curiosity model concrete to
the reader, we consider the example information network of Wikipedia, whose 5.8 million nodes are articles and whose edges
are article-to-article hyperlinks. As humans browse, they walk from article to article by hyperlinks, the search bar, or the
random page generator; the distance traversed by the walk reﬂects the similarity of word usage between documents. The
sequence of steps can be used to test and validate the kinesthetic curiosity model of knowledge network growth [16]. Indi-
vidual diﬀerences in the sequence reﬂect a unique architectural style of information seeking [16]: knowledge networks with
more hunter-like dynamics (versus busybody-like) were associated with higher sensitivity to uncertainty, lower enjoyment
of exploration, and lower sensation seeking.
3
diﬀerences in preferences for exhibiting each mode [16].
1.1
Principle 1: Edge reinforcement
How do humans discover knowledge [41]? Put simply, people learn and innovate by revisiting remnants of
the past with a fresh perspective. New ﬂickering patterns emerge from well-trodden hubs that shape the
ﬂow of information seeking into new directions, expanding the known unknown to explore newly adjacent
possibilities [40, 41].
In the kinesthetic curiosity model, random walkers individually vary in their preference for either new or
familiar information by the mechanism of edge reinforcement [41]. Edge reinforcement is a memory of fa-
miliarity that increases the probability of taking previously traversed paths. Mathematically, random walks
across a path will increase the weighted value of that path, thereby increasing its future transition proba-
bility. As a computational process, edge reinforcement is supported by accurate and rapid learning for a
vast visual and social memory of familiarity [43, 44]. As a movement principle, edge reinforcement resembles
the recurrent dynamics of many other existing models for exploration and foraging [45, 19, 46, 47]. When
applied to human information seeking, edge reinforcement is associated with the personality trait of depri-
vation sensitivity, a dimension of curiosity associated with aversion to uncertainty and gaps of knowledge
[4, 1, 16].
Seeking information until a chosen knowledge gap is ﬁlled characterizes a persistent and eﬀortful form of
speciﬁc exploration that resolves an unknown by incorporating new information into existing knowledge
[1, 48, 49]. Hunter-like individuals have high deprivation curiosity, creating tighter knowledge networks with
greater edge reinforcement as they encounter new information, recognize gaps in their knowledge, and revisit
concepts in an iterative cycle of ﬁlling in knowledge gaps [50, 51, 16].
1.2
Principle 2: L´evy ﬂight
A pervasive scarcity of resources induces organisms to eﬃciently search for value despite lacking prior knowl-
edge of the search space, location of targets, and identity of targets [42, 52, 53, 45, 54]. Yet, potential
value may be unpredictable across the lifespan, between unique individuals, and in high-dimensional en-
vironments [55, 56]. Therefore, we assume that potentially valuable information is sparsely and randomly
(unpredictably) distributed in a complex, unknown environment.
In these environmental conditions, long-term search eﬃciency across the lifespan and evolution is often mod-
eled with respect to energetic cost [57]. Eﬃciency is the ratio of resource encounters to energy expenditure,
operationalized by the number of steps taken in both spatial and abstract landscapes and the total distance
traversed [42, 58, 59, 60]. Consequently, eﬃciency depends upon the distribution of step distances. The
optimal distribution of step distances is thought to be a power-law [42], which L´evy ﬂights produce in their
fractal movement patterns characterized by many small steps and a few large steps [42, 52, 53, 45]. While
L´evy ﬂights have been frequently studied in environments where reward is sparse and randomly distributed,
the dynamics are theoretically optimal in random search across a variety of environmental conditions [42, 45].
However, especially in smaller spaces or shorter timescales, other qualities of search, such as speed, reliability,
and robustness, may prove more relevant for diverse individuals and walks of life [57, 61, 62]. With respect to
other search qualities, the least costly paths are not necessarily the most worthwhile [57, 49, 63]. Therefore,
long-term ineﬃciency does not imply individual deﬁciency.
In the kinesthetic curiosity model, a sequence of steps in the random walk weaves a thread through the
underlying network. The distance is deﬁned as the number of edges traversed between semantic units [64].
Semantically dissimilar units are connected by paths of greater distance.
Mathematically, to assess the
existence and extent of L´evy ﬂight dynamics, we consider the manner in which the probability of a step
4
decays as a function of distance. The steepness of decay is directly related to the exponent deﬁning the
function’s form.
Particularly, we measure the exponent of the decaying probability distribution by the
step distance of the empirically observed behavior. As a computational process, L´evy ﬂight is supported
by widespread observations of its movement signatures across organisms, though its scope and prevalence
remain actively debated [62, 54]. As a movement principle, optimally eﬃcient L´evy ﬂight dynamics exist if
this exponent is approximately 2 [42]. When applied to human information seeking, recent work shows that
humans indeed exhibit an average exponent of 2.11±0.15 suggestive of L´evy-like dynamics in curiosity-driven
information seeking [16]. Eﬃciently searching space could explain how individuals acquire a large repertoire
of diverse information with limited resources, while avoiding information that is too diﬃcult or too easy to
learn [39, 10, 21, 3].

Integrating models of curiosity and learning
In this section, we posit that the movement principles of kinesthetic curiosity grow knowledge networks that
naturally become cognitive maps. Cognitive maps are internal models learned from the relational structure
of a stream of experience [69].
Hierarchically abstracting the structure of cognitive maps at coarser to
ﬁner levels can help people to plan, act, and generalize experiences to novel situations [58, 70, 71]. By
using information theory to assess the cost of constructing cognitive maps and of abstracting hierarchies, we
propose an integration of curiosity and reinforcement learning.
2.1
Map-taking and map-making
The predictive processing approaches, including intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning, propose learn-
ing predictive models of the world to ﬂexibly guide optimal actions and further learning [10, 72, 3, 70, 71].
The predictive models are cognitive maps incorporating prior knowledge of relevant environmental properties
[73, 74, 3, 6]. However, advance knowledge of the environment, including the identity of relevant properties,
is often inaccessible.
In unknown environments, inferring the value of potential actions becomes computationally prohibitive due
to ineﬃcient scaling with the number of explorable units [66, 71]. This limitation prompts us to consider
curiosity’s function of eﬃcient search [39, 52, 53, 45, 54, 3].
As the search unfolds, information seekers
build knowledge networks that naturally become maps due to the emergence of structure from the myriad
relationships inherent to sets of semantic units [59, 60] (Figure 2).
2.2
Eﬃcient search enhances the learnability of cognitive maps
The cognitive maps arising from kinesthetic curiosity might improve their learnability, conveying information
eﬃciently by omitting unnecessary detail [65, 26, 75, 76]. Recent work reported that to eﬃciently convey
information, network representations of that information should be characterized by highly connected hubs
and tightly linked modules [26, 77]. Hubs and modules are features of hierarchical organization exhibited
by diverse signatures of kinesthetic curiosity (Figure 2). Despite individual diﬀerences in edge reinforcement
and L´evy ﬂight dynamics, modularity is a core feature of knowledge networks [16].
People who experience a random sequence of sensory units from a network can learn the network’s emergent
structure [78, 79, 59, 80, 81, 82, 26, 83]. Similarly, current models of learning and decision-making, such as the
successor representation and model-based reinforcement learning, propose to predict, plan, and generalize by
hierarchically abstracting structure from sequences of experience [84, 66, 70, 71]. A sequence of experiences
can be direct, such as in information seeking; or it can be indirect, as in the memory replay of recollected
experiences [71]. To ﬂexibly abstract hierarchical structure from a direct or indirect sequence of experiences,
individuals would beneﬁt from cognitive maps that are diversely yet economically organized with hubs and
modules [84, 70, 58].

Figure 2: Knowledge network growth, form, and individual variation. A few simple principles generate diverse kinesthetic
signatures of curiosity. Here we show knowledge networks that were randomly generated using the kinesthetic curiosity
model encoded as a random walk biased by principles of edge reinforcement and L´evy ﬂight. Modules are colored by the
WalkTrap algorithm [36], and edges connecting modules are colored red. Varying two parameters modeling these principles
can characterize the archetypal modes of curious practice and the continuous patterns of behavior in between. The variation
evident in these graphs emphasizes the ﬂexibility of the model to ﬁt individual diﬀerences. Diﬀering kinesthetic modes may
produce dynamics that grow knowledge networks to be eﬃciently compressible by exploiting the network structure of hubs
and modules [65, 66, 26, 16]. Kinesthetic curiosity emphasizes ecological modes of function. Ecologically relevant behaviors
are those that individuals are expected to perform in interaction with their daily environments or with similar complexity
[67]. Greater ecological relevance instills conﬁdence that theories derived from the carefully designed self-report measures
and laboratory tasks generalize to some scope of real-world contexts. It equips researchers to study the evolving practice
of curiosity in diﬀering contexts throughout recorded history [13, 68, 15, 9]. Future work can address the cross-cultural
limitations of psychological assessments and models which over-sample homogeneous demographics [67]. In practice, the
ability to study uncontrived tasks may prove useful for studies in pediatric or clinical study samples, where tasks that are
too diﬃcult or unengaging can introduce statistical biases.

2.3
Compression progress theory integrates curiosity and learning
Let us now consider how to operationalize the learnability of cognitive map structure. We begin by noting
that kinesthetic curiosity is consistent with the compression progress theory of curiosity but diﬀers from the
learning progress hypothesis [85, 3]. Compression progress theory posits that individuals practice curios-
ity to seek information that improves compression of their mental model of the world or a sector thereof.
Information compression balances the compactness and accuracy of representations, possibly by exploit-
ing redundancy of knowledge network connections in hubs and modules [65, 86, 26]. Whereas compression
progress prioritizes compactness, learning progress prioritizes accuracy [85, 3]. The compression or abstrac-
tion of information in many models of learning, memory, and decision-making is achieved by discounting
potentially irrelevant information that is more distant in space or time [87, 74, 66, 72, 26].
We hypothesize that kinesthetic curiosity increases learnability by producing knowledge network growth
with increasing compressibility. Compressibility is operationalized as the information theoretic codelength
(bits per step) required to minimally encode random walks in the knowledge network [65]. Recalling that
humans and reinforcement learning algorithms abstract structure from random sequences of experience, the
codelength of a random walk in the knowledge network can be used to measure the cost, or learnability [65].
A decrease in codelength corresponds to a compression gain. Note, however, that coarser abstractions do
not always entail compression gains, because inaccurate coarseness demands overly frequent usage of fewer
abstracted components in the encoding.
We propose using the operationalization of compressibility as reduced codelength to make three predictions
testing the link between curiosity and learning. First, if kinesthetic curiosity is linked with compression
progress theory, then random walks biased by the two movement principles of edge reinforcement and L´evy
ﬂight will grow knowledge networks with increasing compressibility. Second, if kinesthetic curiosity is linked
with the learnability of cognitive maps, then the strength of hubs and modules in knowledge networks will
be linked to compressibility. Third, if kinesthetic curiosity is linked with hierarchical abstraction, then the
integrated compressibility that corresponds to ﬁner and coarser abstractions of the same knowledge network
will explain how the cost of information motivates discounts according to distance and time. Together, the
frameworks of kinesthetic curiosity and predictive processing can be bridged by examining whether knowledge
networks are built to be increasingly compressible [65, 66, 72, 27, 28, 26, 88].
3
Neural implementation and evolutionary origins
Here, we consider kinesthetic curiosity at the levels of evolution, as well as the micro-, meso-, and macro-scale
brain network. We begin by noting that the intrinsic motivation of curiosity purportedly evolved for long-
term learning despite rapidly growing complexity in the surrounding habitat [10, 2]. It is therefore critical to
assess how models of curiosity can contend with ecologically relevant complexity. For animals and organisms
with extensive limitations on computational capacity, it is challenging to trace the evolutionary history of
uncertainty monitoring [11, 89]. In contrast, the dynamics of kinesthetic curiosity have been observed in
the foraging movements of organisms and animals, perhaps evolving for a need to navigate habitats with
increasing complexity [42, 12, 90, 13, 52, 53, 45, 91, 54].
To modulate foraging behaviors at the micro-scale, the neural mechanisms of kinesthetic curiosity likely in-
volve dopaminergic function [13, 92]. Consistent with this proposition, prior curiosity research has reported
the involvement of dopaminergic brain areas associated with reward anticipation and subjective value, as well
as dopaminergic plasticity of the hippocampus in reward-driven associative learning [93, 7]. Dopaminergic
function for foraging predates function linked to reward anticipation and learning, suggestive of a potential
dual role of dopamine in reinforcement learning and kinesthetic curiosity [13, 94, 6].
At the meso-scale, and in contrast to prior curiosity research, we hypothesize a central and concerted role
7
of the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit in curiosity due to the mechanisms that underpin foraging-oriented
locomotion, cognitive maps of space, structure learning, and navigation [69, 79, 72, 59, 95, 96, 58, 97, 98, 6].
Recent neural and behavioral work has reexamined errors and noise due to limited computational capacity as
advantageous features of exploration and learning [57, 99, 26, 37, 38, 98]. Similarly, we posit that the limited
capacity to optimally choose from potential movement plans for foraging during the hippocampal replay
of model-based reinforcement learning results in random movement [99, 38, 98]. L´evy ﬂight dynamics may
emerge from the interaction between individuals with limited cognitive capacity and complex environments
[57, 12, 90, 72, 91, 54].
Last, we predict that macro-scale brain network structure and function moderate individual diﬀerences in
learning related to the compressibility of knowledge networks [85, 26, 27, 28]. We hypothesize the involvement
of network hubs in the frontoparietal circuit, which are thought to support executive function, learning,
and information compression, as well as the default-mode network associated with mind wandering and
hierarchical abstraction [66, 100, 101, 102, 88]. A set of brain regions across both networks are associated
with the reinforcement learning of implicit and explicit representations of experience [103, 98]. Together, the
neural circuitry shared by model-based reinforcement learning and kinesthetic curiosity suggests that the
models are functional counterparts, enacting more learnable experiences for predicting value.

Expanding current taxonomies of curiosity
An inﬂuential psychological taxonomy of curiosity describes the personality trait along the two axes of
speciﬁc-diversive and perceptual-epistemic [39, 1, 2, 4]. The kinesthetic curiosity framework accommodates
traditional state and trait approaches to modeling individual diﬀerences by characterizing behavior using a
computational model. The computational model can capture tendencies to prefer one mode over another
(trait), shifts between modes (state), and shifts between tendencies to prefer one mode over another (between
state and trait) [16]. Here we show how the movement principles and modes of kinesthetic curiosity can
quantify and expand these current qualitative frameworks.
In kinesthetic curiosity, interdigitations of the speciﬁc-diversive and perceptual-epistemic axes can be quan-
tiﬁed according to movement dynamics producing tight or loose knowledge networks [16]. Speciﬁc curiosity
is the desire for particular relevant pieces of information, while diversive curiosity is a general drive to ex-
plore diﬀerent information. These qualitative descriptions underscore the fact that novelty, diversity, and
unexpectedness are functions of the sequence or dynamics of information seeking, rather than properties
of each element of information [40, 41].
In contrast, the second classical axis of curiosity describes the
contents of each element of information with perceptual to epistemic properties [39]. Perceptual curiosity
is a drive to seek novel sensory information, whereas epistemic curiosity is the drive to learn conceptual
knowledge and regulate uncertainty [2]. Recent work applied kinesthetic curiosity to quantify the speciﬁc-
diversive axis of epistemic curiosity [16]. People who sought speciﬁc information during Wikipedia browsing
constructed knowledge networks that were tighter than those who sought diverse information. Future tests
of perceptual curiosity could apply kinesthetic curiosity to assess how people seek images and videos [104, 47].
Contemporary theories of epistemic curiosity state that information seeking is governed by a desire to
close an information gap between current uncertainty and preferred baseline uncertainty [50]. However, it
remains unclear how to deﬁne an individual’s preference for uncertainty [2, 10]. The information gap theory
addresses the question of what one needs to know, whereas kinesthetic curiosity addresses the question
of how one comes to know. The latter allows researchers to investigate the growth dynamics that arise
from extended preferences. Prior work has reported that individuals with a stronger personality trait of
deprivation sensitivity, a preference for certainty, produced tighter knowledge networks with closed cycles
and greater edge-reinforcement [4, 16]. Therefore, the preferred uncertainty is linked to the deprivation
sensitivity dimension of trait curiosity. A future test of the information gap theory could assess how modes
of movement ﬁll topological gaps in the knowledge network, as children ﬁll gaps in semantic networks when
8
learning language or explore when information is incomplete [48, 105].

Conclusion
The kinesthetic curiosity model can formalize, assess, and expand the classical psychological taxonomy of cu-
riosity. We present a computational model of curiosity that hues close to its ecological function in naturalistic
environments and to its need to eﬃciently contend with complexity. The implicit construction of learnable
knowledge networks accompanies the explicit learning of structure, as random search may arise from the
neural capacity limits for learning. The costs of abstracting hierarchical structure from cognitive maps could
link curiosity, creativity, social behavior, and learning under the framework of compression progress theory.
In our view, the practice of curiosity includes distinct modes of information seeking dynamics that pack-
age information into knowledge networks with unique structural signatures. Considering the philosophical
archetypes of curiosity embodied in the hunter, busybody, and dancer will help us to understand curiosity
throughout history, across cultures, and at the scales of individuals and societies.

reinforcement learning, temporal diﬀerence learning, and the free energy principle of information
theory.

Citation Diversity Statement
Recent work in neuroscience and other ﬁelds has identiﬁed a bias in citation practices such that papers from
women and other minorities are under-cited relative to the number of such papers in the ﬁeld [106, 107,
108, 109, 110]. Here we sought to proactively consider choosing references that reﬂect the diversity of the
ﬁeld in thought, form of contribution, gender, and other factors. We obtained predicted gender of the ﬁrst
and last author of each reference by using databases that store the probability of a name being carried by a
woman [110, 111]. By this measure (and excluding self-citations to the ﬁrst and last authors of our current
paper), our references contain 13.5% woman/woman, 21.3% woman/man, 12.4% man/woman, and 52.8%
man/man. This method is limited in that a) names, pronouns, and social media proﬁles used to construct
the databases may not, in every case, be indicative of gender identity and b) it cannot account for intersex,
non-binary, or transgender people. We look forward to future work that could help us to better understand
how to support equitable practices in science.
