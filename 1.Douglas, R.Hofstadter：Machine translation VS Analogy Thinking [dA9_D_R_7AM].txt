先简单的介绍一下我们这样一个活动
首先我介绍了我自己
我是来自北京示范大学系统科学学院
现在是一名老师
同时我也是我们今天这个活动的主办方
集职俱乐部的创始人
我的名字叫做张江
然后我们这个活动是我们跟腾讯研究院
一起合办的一个系列活动叫做AI & Society
这是系列活动的第五期
那么我们这个活动主要是聚焦在
就是现在人工智能对我们的社会的影响
以及人工智能技术对社会科学有哪些影响
做一系列的这种讨论活动
当然今天我们非常高兴
就请到了也是我们有史以来
无论是集职俱乐部有史以来
还是我们AI & Society这个活动的有史以来
非常重量级的嘉宾
也就是我们的这个猴道人先生
可能大家对猴老师
可能熟知的名字是猴氏达
但是这里中间其实还是有一些故事
有一些认知上的误差
那么他的现在的英文名应该是猴道人
所以大家这个名字很好记 对吧
猴道人嘛
所以很容易记得
现在猴老师当然是那个
他现在是印第安娜大学
认知科学的这方面的教授和专家
当然他为我们所熟知
主要是有他的这本名著
也就是我们大家都知道的
可能很多人也是根据这本书
莫名而来的
就是戈德尔艾奢尔巴赫这样一本剧著
可以说
但是今天猴老师会给大家
讲的不是关于这本书的内容
而是他们和战独一起来合作
出版了一本新书
也是我们猴先生和Emmanuel Sander
这是一个巴黎大学的
也是在认知科学方面的一个教授
然后合著的这本书
Surface and Incense
就是这样一本新的
中文翻译版的这个图书
那么好
那接下来呢
就让我们来介绍一下

ami author and the answer is, of course I did.
But I read it in English.
Have you read Crime and Punishment?
ok.
Have you ever been in the Parthenon?
You know where the Parthenon is?
Where's the Parthenon?
Si-La Right?
It's in greece.
of course i've been in the Parthenon.
But I was in the Parthenon in Tennessee.
What's going on?
I thought I pushed the right button.
There's the Parthenon.
That's the one I was in.
Was I in the Parthenon or not?
Yes or no?
Did I read crime and punishment?
Yes or no?
I read it in English.
Did I read it or did I not read it?
Have I been in the Parthenon or have I not been in the Parthenon?
Think about it.
What is translation?
What can it accomplish?
Okay, I'm going to give you a famous classical poem,
Lujai by Wang Wei.
You probably all know it.
You probably all know it by heart.
So let's look at it.
Lujai.
空山不見人,當文人與響,
凡影入山林,
復照青台上.
Oh, stop it, stop it, stop it.
If you've studied Chinese for 12 years,
you can't be applauded for saying 20 characters out loud.
Please, I don't need applause for that.
I did like the fact the little symmetry inside there.
You notice this.
I thought that was pretty nice.
And it impressed me and we'll come back to that later.
So this is a poem in Chinese.
I will now show eight attempts by thoughtful people
to convert this poem into an equivalent little poem
in the English language.
Let's go through them one by one.
Starting with probably the earliest one.
I don't know if it's the earliest ever,
but anyway,it's one of the earlier ones.
I hope you can read it.
If you can't,you can listen.
And each one of them I think has a different title.
Maybe a couple of them have the same title.
Dear Park Hermitage.
By the way,the character Jai.
I mean,of course,it's Jai.
And I guess it's an old character.
I don't really know what it means.
I couldn't find it in any of my dictionaries.
But I suppose it means something like a place
that somebody lives.
I don't know.
Or maybe it means a fenced-in enclosure.
I don't know.
In any case,it was the place
that was being talked about
was a place that Wang Wei lived in.
And it was in the country.
So just so that you understand
why it's called Lu Jai.
It's not obvious that it has anything to do
with deer or an enclosure
or anything like that.
But anyway,so here is the first translation.
There seems to be no one on the empty mountain.
And yet I think I hear a voice
where sunlight entering a grove
shines back to me from the green moss.
You can argue about some of these choices.
I wish those buttons were clearer,but okay.
There seems to be,I don't see where that was
in the original,but it's okay.
No one on the empty mountain.
And yet I think in the anthology
from which I took these translations
or some of them,there was
the person who anthologized
these translations was extremely critical
of almost all of the translations.
He attacked,he had 19 translations
or roughly 19,and he attacked
almost all of them vehemently
and bitterly and viciously,which is very weird
to make a collection of translations
of a poem and then to say how bad
they all are.But that's what he did.
His name is Elliot Weinberger.
Now,he hated, Weinberger
hated the factthat it's had the word
I in it.He said,there's no I in this poem.
Okay,that's a possible criticism.
I'm not going to try to criticize these poems.
I'm just going to point out some of their properties.
Where I criticize them is not so important.
Okay,the next one.
Dear Park,hills empty.
No one to be seen.
We hear only voices echoed.
With light coming back into the deep wood,
the top of the green moss is lit again.
And now here we can say we,who is we?
I don't know what that one is.
I don't know.
And what about the top of the green moss?
I'm not sure about that,but whatever.
Okay,just think about it.
The Dear Park.
Not the shadow of a man on the deserted hill.
And yet one hears voices passing.
Now it's one.
First it was I now.
Then it was we.
Now it's one.
Deep in the seclusion of the woods.
Stray shafts of the sun pick out the green moss.
Interesting choices.
I don't want to comment too much on them.
I want you to think about them.
But,you know,I...
Each one of them has its,let's say,
virtues and possibly its defects.
So let's go on.
Let's see.
Dear Forest Hermitage.
That's a pretty long translation of Lujai,but whatever.
Through the deep wood,the slanting sunlight casts motley patterns
on the jade green mosses.
Well,we started with the two last lines.
I don't know why.
No glimpse of man on this lonely mountain,yet faint voices
drift on the air.
It's poetic.It's interesting.
I'm hard to say whether it's how accurate it is,but it's interesting.
Here's one by a very famous American poet,Kenneth Rexroth,who decided for some reason
that I cannot fathom to use seven lines instead of four.
Now let's look at it.
Deep in the mountain wilderness where nobody ever comes,only once in a great while
something like the sound of a far-off voice.
What is the background noise here?
Like a radio on or something?
Oh,okay.
That's a little ironic to be having simultaneous translation of a talk on translation.
I mean,I do admire simultaneous translators enormously.
I hope it's not an attempt by simultaneous translators to do it by machine.
Is it human?
Okay.That's very good.
I hope they're translating the comments that I'm making right now.
Oh,okay.
No,I deeply admire simultaneous translators,and it's a wonderful art,an extraordinarily
difficult art.
And so that's...what?
Yes,that's great.That's fantastic.
Okay,so now I understand why there was noise in the background.
Yeah,yeah,okay.Great.
So,deep in the mountain wilderness where nobody ever comes,only once in a great whilesomething
like the sound of a far-off voice.
The low rays of the sunslip through the dark forest and gleam again on the shadowy moss.
Well,it's pretty amazing to see seven lines devoted to twenty characters.
I mean,it's really astonishing to me.
But here we have it.Lots of things here that weren't in the original.
But it's interesting.
And I must admit,I like the form.
Of course,in the original,it was probably not printed with centered lines.
It was probably all left justified.
But when they're centered,it makes a pretty pattern,right?
It's a pretty...kind of a pretty pattern.
And so,that's something that I like because it kind of echoes the geometrical prettiness of the original poem.
Okay,another one.
The Deer Park Village.It begins with a word that I don't even know in English.
I mean,I've seen it maybe a couple of times in my life,white.
No white is seen in the lonely hills around here.
The lens is wafting the human voice I hear.
So deep in the forest,the sunset glow can cross that it seems to linger on the moss.
Now,the rhythm here is very pretty,very nice.
Things like that.It's very pretty rhythm.
And it has rhymes,although they're not in the same place as the rhyme pattern of the original was ABAB.
Here,the rhyme pattern is AABB,but it's okay.It's not bad.
And the lines are very long.And this funny wence and wafting and white,old fashioned words.
But what's wrong with old fashioned words to translate a poem that comes from about 800?
What's wrong with that?It's interesting.
All right,we go on.
It's another recent translation.
In pathless hills,no man's in sight,but still I hear an echoing sound.
In gloomy forests,peeps no light,but sunbeams slant on mossy ground.
And this one does have rhymes again.Sight,sound,light,ground,and ABAB.
Interesting.Let's go on to one last one.
By a friend of mine,a very famous author,Vikram Sate.
And his is empty hills,no man in sight,just echoes of the voice of men.
In the deep wood,reflected light,shines on the blue-green moss again.
And I think it's very pretty.
I could make many comments on it,but I'm not going to because we have to go on.
All right,all of these poems,all of these translations involve great thought on the part of people who are very dedicated to trying to render this poem in English.
So many thoughts about the original,so many thoughts about poetic traditions in English.
So many thoughts about Chinese history,about Taoism or Buddhism.
Thoughts about Wang Wei's life and times,and so forth.
All of these entered into the translator's minds.
Every line involved innumerably many deeply subjective judgments,enormous amounts of human thought.
Each one is great in its own way.I would say that.I like them all.
I chose ones that I like.
Any English-language reader of any of these poems,or even of all of them,actually stood in the Parthenon of Wang Wei's original poem.
Have any of you stood in the Parthenon of Wang Wei's original poem,which was written about 1300 years ago.
Can you be in his skin?
So who has understood this poem most deeply?Very hard to say.
Anyway,some philosophical questions about the nature of translation.Could there be a perfect translation?
Could there be a perfect translation so that you,once you've read it,you have experienced everything there is to experience about that poem?
Well,sure,of course.Machine translation will give it to us.Machine translation.
Founded in 1947 by Warren Weaver,an American mathematician,statistician,who wrote this sentence.
When I look at an article in Russian,I say,this is really written in English,but it has been coded in some strange symbols.
I will now proceed to decode.Now,if you read that sentence and think about it,it implies that there must be exactly one translation.
Correct.Because decoding is a mechanical process that leads you to the right answer.
So if there is a right answer,then this will get it to you.Machine translation will give you the unique right answer if that's the philosophy behind it.
Long years of struggle followed the founding of machine translation.
And I'm going to go jump about twelve years from the founding,1947 to 1959.
When perhaps the most famous article ever written about machine translation was written by Yehoshua Bar-Hillel,an Israeli mathematician and philosopher and logician and linguist.
And he was very,very deeply involved in machine translation for many years.
But in the end,he became very critical of it,or even though he was involved in it,and he was an advocate of it,he nonetheless was very dubious about its possibility.
So let's look at this very famous article,as I say,probably the most famous article ever written about machine translation.
It was called a demonstration of the non-feasibility of fully automatic high quality machine translation.
And this,of course,this acronym,FAHQMT,very awkward acronym,but that's not the point.It became a well-known phrase.
That was the goal for machine translation.And he's saying a demonstration of the non-feasibility.
Here's a part of the article.The task of instructing a machine how to translate from one language that it does not understand into a different language.
But it also does not understand,presents a real challenge.If,in a translation task,some step has to be taken that depends on the machine's ability to understand the text in question.
Then the machine will simply be unable to make the step,and so the whole operation will come to a full stop.This was one of his claims.
So,I decided 59 years later,let's call it 60 to be rounded off,60 years later I decided to put Google translate to a test.
By the way,I also put many other machine translation programs to a test,the same test.
I did Microsoft,I did DeepL in Germany,and other translation programs.So,I'm not limiting myself to just Google translate.
But in this talk,I am limiting myself to Google translate.I try lots of different versions.
They're all about the same.They're all about the same,because they all use the same ideas.
Ok,this was taken.This is the most famous case of challenge to machine translation that was ever posed.It was from Yahoshua Bar Hillel's 1959 article.
And here's what it says.Little John was looking for his toy box.Finally he found it.The box was in the pen.John was very happy.
If you don't understand this,that's because you may not know that the word pen has two meanings.One is Yuan Zhubi.
And the other is Lao,as in Wang Yang,Bu Lao.So,those are the two meanings,and obviously this is the meaning that was meant.
Ok,so let's take a look at what Google translate did 60 years after this article was published.
In French,Little John cherchait son jouer boîe.Well,jouer boîe is an impossibly clumsy and meaningless French phrase.It doesn't mean anything.
If it means anything,it means a toy that is a box.If it means anything,but nobody in French,nobody who speaks French would ever say that.
In the end,he found it.The box was in the pen.John was very happy.
In the end,he found it.The box was in the pen.John was very happy.
I guess I can go to the red.So there we are.Still,today,the same problems in Chinese,in French,and in,of course,other languages as well.
This is the state of the art of M.T. 60 years after Yehoshua Barr Hillel's article was written.The state of the art.
Ok,his commentary,anticipating 60 years later,anticipating it,he says,
Why is a translating machine powerless to determine the meaning of pen in this sample of text?How did he know that 60 years later it would be powerless to detect the meaning?
He was right.The explanation is extremely simple.What makes any human reader grasp this meaning so unhesitatingly is knowledge of the relative sizes of toy boxes and pens in the sense of writing implements and pens in the sense of play pens.
So a play pen,of course,lao is not a lao in the sense of something to keep animals in this case.
A pen in this case is a play pen for a child,which is about the size.It's about a meter and a half on a side,and it's got little wooden things to keep the baby in.
And it's got a little mattress or a little plastic thing on the bottom.So it keeps a child inside a small area.
That's the meaning of a play pen.And that's what anyone would understand.A translating machine has no such knowledge.
When I pointed this out to one of my colleagues working on memt,his first reaction was,but why not envisage a system in which the translation machine has such knowledge?
Understandable as this reaction is,it is very easy to show its futility.
The idea that a translation machine should be supplied not only with a dictionary,but also with a universal encyclopedia is utterly comarical.
If you don't know that word,it means a fantastic,imaginary,ridiculous notion,impossible,and hardly deserves any further discussion.
This was written in 1959.MT,state of the art,today,means deep learning,which is many layered artificial neural networks trained with back propagation.
I'm not going to go into that.And big data,enormous bilingual databases.I'm not going to go into that either,but they are very,very,very enormous.That's for sure.
No world understanding is involved.Word disambiguation,that is whenever there's an ambiguity such as with the word pen,is made by statistical selection based on context,that is based on the surrounding text.
To show this technique,I'm going to give you a few experiments carried out with Google translate just a few days ago.
Okay,they all hinge on resolving the ambiguity of the word shingles,which usually means a kind of roofing material.That's what shingles usually means.
But it sometimes means a very painful skin disease,also nerve disease,I might say.
It has that meaning as well.So,I tried a few sentences using the word shingles,trying to give it context in which it would disambiguate the word correctly.
So,what happens in these cases?The word case here is a bit of a joke,because a case of shingles,it means a medical case of disease.
He had shingles on his waist.Now,that's the most common place for the shingles disease to take place,is on your waist.
So,I gave it a good context.Shingles on his waist.What more could you ask?Output.
他的腰想想想一下.Well,let's try to figure this out.Where did it get that?
What is shlu?Well,in particular,this SH.What's that doing there?
Well,that's the SH from here,and then the ING,I don't know what happened,but there's the LE right there,and there's the waist,you know,there's on his waist.
So,it took the ING as being some kind of a present participle,sort of as if it were translating a verb.All right.
Oops.Well,if you don't,if at first you don't succeed,try try again.Okay.
He had a case of shingles on his waist.Now,a case of shingles is also ambiguous,because a case can mean a box,or it can mean a medical case.
All right.But this sounds,well,let's see what it does with it.Okay.
他的腰,腰部有一块,带装炮臣一块.That's a weird word for it.I think you would agree.
Would you agree with me that quai is a very strange measure word to use here?Yes or no?Yes?Very strange.
So,so what do we give it?What grade will we give it?Mama.
Okay.Sort of it's okay.Kind of.At least it got the idea that it was the disease,right?Okay.
How about the next one?The roofer had a case of shingles in his pickup truck.Okay.
Now,in this case,I think it's extraordinarily obvious that we're talking about roofing material.I've said the roofer.
Let's see.The roof.Oops.Can we get this back?
Control L,sorry.Command L.Command L.Command L.Command L.Command L.
Yeah.All right.The roofer had a case of shingles in his pickup truck.Okay.
So,here we have 屋頂公在他的皮卡車上有一箱瓦片.So,what grade do we give it here?
Ah.Pretty good.All right.Now,let's go on to the next one.The roofer came down from the hospital roof carrying a case of shingles.
Now,we have the roofer and we have the roof,but we also have a hospital.
What's going to happen now?It's pretty obvious that if you're carrying a case of shingles,it's not on you in the sense of being a disease.All right.
Google asked me the following question.It didn't just translate it.It said,Oh,did you mean the roof came down from the hospital roof carrying a case of shingles?
As if that was a help for me.As if I had mistyped what I wanted to say.And actually the roof came down from the roof.What does that mean?
The roof came down from the roof carrying a case of shingles.Thank you very much Google translate for your extremely useful help.
No,but okay.So here we have what it gave.And what I think is very interesting is it came down from the roof carrying a box of a box of shingles.A box of the disease shingles.
The roofer came down from the roof carrying a box of the disease.Well,complete and utter nonsense.Oh,well,nobody's perfect.Okay.A third experiment.
Okay,how about Kongshan Bujianran,Yuxiang,and so forth.Let's see what it does with this.The empty mountain is not seen.Oh,really?
The empty mountain is not seen.That's not what it seems to me it said.But the people reverberate back into the deep forest to remake the moss.Oh,I didn't know that's what they were doing.Well,that's state of the art.
What happens if you add punctuation?So I added a comma,a period,a comma,and a period.And now it says empty mountains are not seen.Again,completely wrong.
But people speak loudly,returning to the deep forest on the moss.All right.Then what happens if we do it line by line?In other words,I just gave it one line at a time,independently.Empty mountain people.What does that mean?Empty mountain people.
If any native speaker of English who hears that hears mountain as modifying people.So it's saying and empty also as modifying people.So it's empty people,empty mountain people.What does that mean?It doesn't have anything to do with the original line.
But people speak loud.Okay.Returning to the deep forest on the moss.That's what we have.State of the art.Okay.We're not yet standing in the Parthenon,are we?Interlude on artificial intelligence.Founded in the United States and the United Kingdom in the late 1940s and early 1950s.
Driven mostly by philosophical goals such as what is thinking,can computers think,can computers be conscious.These were very admirable things to think about,and it was natural to use computers to try to figure,to make a new approach to these questions.
A very famous article written by Alan Turing in 1950 called Computing Machinery and Intelligence was all about these questions and about whether a machine could think.You probably know this article.I'm not going to talk about it.It's just a very famous and wonderful article,very stimulating philosophically.
Somewhat later,Joseph Weisenbaum,who was a researcher at MIT,wrote a program that interacted with people.It was intended to be a psychiatrist or acting like a psychiatrist who interacted with a patient.
The amazing thing about this program was that although it knew nothing and understood nothing and just used canned phrases,the people who interacted with it and didn't know what they were interacting with actually thought that the machine understood not only their language,but their human psychological problems.
They were deceived enormously and Weisenbaum was very upset at this fact and it was called the ELISA effect because the program was called ELISA and the ELISA effect was this notion that people attributed much more meaning to the words that a computer would print out than was actually there.
Because the only experiences that they had ever had with language were experiences where the language was generated by a human being who did know what they were saying.
And so it was natural to extend that idea to the source of the language even if it wasn't understanding.It was a temptation.
And it was a warning that Weisenbaum made that you should not overestimate the meaningfulness of words just because they are printed out by a computer.
Famous article.
Floods of hype such as the term deep learning and the predicted singularity.Many sources of confusion because the thing is that AI has had a number of remarkable successes as well as failures.
Let's talk a little bit about some of the big successes.Successes in chess and go as you all know world champion players today are computers.
Successes in speech recognition and understanding of rapid spoken speech.Understanding.I should not say understanding.I did not write understanding.I wrote recognition because it's not understanding.It's recognizing the words and transcribing them.
But there are successes in that.Successes in self driving cars.Quite impressive.Successes in music composition.This is quite dubious.
But I've given many lectures on this and you know I put a question mark here and I put these.Notice the color coding.I change the colors each time the colors.The color coding is meant to suggest that as we go down and the color changes.This is the most positive and most real success.This is a less strong.This is less strong.This is less strong.This is less strong.And I put a question mark.The next one will have two question marks.Successes in joke creation.Very weak actually.
And successes in machine translation.Three question marks.Now you can argue whether it's successful or not.And we're going to talk about that as we go on.Another experiment with Google translate.And a first one with Hofstadter translate.Okay.I am translating currently a book by Yang Jiang which many of you probably have read.Women sa.And it's a story about.It's a memoir I should say.
About herself and her husband.Qian Zhongshu who was a writer.And their daughter.And it's a sad story.But I'm not going to go into that.I just want to give you one little excerpt.That I thought I would.You know demonstrate how a machine translates it.And how a human translates it.And talk a little bit about it.Okay.So.
And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And I thought.And

學生在清朝中的學生中
《國際文化》
《國際文化》
完全和無奈的
不是你能夠理解任何東西
《喵哈喵拉》
從1959年來
只有在非常有趣的情況下
能夠參與《國際文化》
原因是
《國際文化》
利用他們的背景知識
主要是在解決
在解決這件事
那些機器都要解決
或解決某些機器的規定
每一天都會成為錯誤的證據
好,我們來看看人類的證據
與機器的證據相同
特別是我的兩本書
一本,一本新的
我會談談《G.E.B.》的證據
更多的細節
但這是從
我們會先談談《G.E.B.》
然後我們會談談《 surface and essences 》
《G.E.B. 》1979
好,在1986年
老師吳俞雲曾
來到大陸
我當時是一位教授
在我家裡留下了三天
我們有很多談論
他提出了
一名中國的權力證據
《燕富》
所以
他說
三個證據
《燕富》已被打擊
他們想要尊重這些證據
在《G.E.B. 》中的中國證據
《蜘蛛》
《蜘蛛》也就是
《蜘蛛》
《蜘蛛》的意識
《蜘蛛》的意識
《蜘蛛》的意識
他們的目標是非常有趣的
我完全同意他們
100%
不過
老師
用這個證據
為證據
彼此

護照

護照
他們會有幾千字的訊息
我非常擔心這件事
是我的思維是一樣的
我的思維是一樣的
我曾經為中國的代表
莫達威  David Moser
參加了這個訊息
他說
我必須相信他
他沒有任何訊息
但他成為了
副總裁
副總裁
是一個巨大的航航
走到這個位置
他成為副總裁
然後再回到另一個位置
做了很好的努力
因為他們走到
正確的正確位置
最後他們
做得正確的事
由於莫達威的
承諾和訊息
這是唯一的方法
這件事成了
很高級的訊息
我們談到的一個例子
在那些很早的日子
當他們在訊息中
有句話在書上
我不知道
可能在訊息中
說了 說話的天使
這句話是短的
我們沒有說過
整個訊息在英文
我們不常聽到這句話
我們只說
說話的天使
大家都知道
什麼意思
但這句話是短的
說話的天使
他會出現
我們說了
當你討論到人家
他們會出現
這句話
這是一個很有趣的方式
說話的天使
我和David
用這個詞語說
說 討 討 討 討
他們的隊伍
我不知道
他們是所有的隊伍
但基本上
他們有很好的支持
他們會說
如果用這個
會讓它聲音
像是如果
他們的名字
從中國發生了
然後發生了
中國的聲音
所以
他們的反應是
他們想要什麼
他們想要說
中國的惡劣
所以那是發生的
他們有改善了
他們用了
中國的詞語
並不是詞語
而是詞語
詞語
有一個類似的
歸於中國的文化
而不是
說話的天使
在一些歸於中國的文化
所以
這裡是一個很可愛的
詞語
我學會了
不久前
在介紹中
有一個部分
有音樂、音樂
還有 canons
這就是
不合理的
不重要
這是一個canon
它說的是
三部分canon
在名字上
英國的兒童歌
《三 blind mice》
它不論是
三 blind mice
它是關於
英文說話的歌曲
而是
翻譯的歌詞
所以在中國的版本上
這首 canon
在這首 canon
《八位黃河》
這是一個可愛的例子
好
OK
那是誰
這本大本書的 author
那是
蘿博特的
兒子
霍夫斯塔特
那是
《道德拉斯》
霍夫斯塔特
那是誰寫的
這本書
應該是合理的
因為我父親
已經有了
中國文化的名字
那是我父親的名字
根據中國人的意思
所以
他們沒有用過
他們沒有做過
他們決定給我
中國文化的名字
是不好的還是好
我沒有說過
我只是說
這是一個很有趣的問題
所以他們給了我
三...
好
我回來了
對
我其實是
大伯伯的第一中國教授
我會回到那裡
我會回到那裡
這本書是很有趣的
我會告訴你後來
所以
《侯世達》
抱歉
《侯道人》
那是下一本
《侯道人》
是大伯伯的第一中國教授
那是1983年或1984年
那是那個人
是誰我喜歡的
他們給《侯世達》
我不知道那名字
我明白了
我明白了
這是《哈斯特》
哈斯
特
哈斯特
它是一個H&S
它是一種
很大一張
我最後的名字
但是 into three syllables
instead of into five syllables
這是HDR
《侯道人》
哈斯特特
《杜克勒斯》
《李卓尼特》
那是HDR的名字
我以為那是好
反正這只是一個有趣的事
現在
我先前進
《上帝的天使》
我和Emmanuel Sander
這本書是誰
這本書寫的
這本書是法國版的
《心中的同意》
《心中的同意》
我抱歉
我們在一起
我和Emmanuel Sander
在20年代
寫了英文版
不知道這本書是怎樣的
所以這本書的名字是誰
這是一個有趣的問題
如果《侯世達》
三個字
Emmanuel Sander
他的名字應該是三個字
所以這本書
《杜克勒斯》
《霍夫士特特》
這本書應該是Emmanuel Sander
這本書應該是他
這本書應該是他
這本書的名字
這本書的名字
至少是類似
他們的文章
他們的文章
是法國名字
但不
這本書是不會這樣的
這本書是不會這樣的
很奇怪的
很奇怪的
很奇怪的
所以他們的文章
是一個很清楚的
詛咒
其他文章
是一個很中國式的名字
很有趣
好
我們來看一下
詛咒文章的例子
在《柳間》和《湖海》和《晨旗》
在《柳間》和《湖海》和《晨旗》
和《湖海》和《晨旗》
和《湖海》和《晨旗》
和《湖海》和《晨旗》
好
我的主題是
詛咒文章的例子
最不信心的
你對我們在表面上
最信心的
你對我們在表面上
這是我的提醒
你還記得嗎
挺好
《柳間》
對
你對表面上
是不信心的
所以你能夠
在深層的表面上信心
矛盾
一小段
不真實
不真實
所以
這是一個例子
如何讓飲品經理
選擇飲品
從各種機會
在菜單上
他們從來沒有吃過
這是第四個
我們說到這個
Emmanuel himself
是個很愛喝的飲品
然後他有一個很愛喝的飲品
他愛喝飲品
所以他寫了這個例子
然後他們怎麼做
如何飲品經理
選擇飲品
從各種機會
他們從來沒有吃過
任何飲品
他們做的飲品經理
他們知道飲品類似的
飲品從一個類似的區域
一個類似的時間
一個類似的循環
他們有各種方式
他們做的
然後他會說的
在幾個範圍上
所以
經理
然後他們如何
經理這個部分
寫的這範圍
經理
當然
所以在中國經理
經理的飲品
變成了
經理的飲品
整個範圍
是完全描述的
幾個範圍
所以是飲品
不是飲品
還是
如何從飲品經理
選擇哪種飲品
去用
從未煮過的醬汁
他們未煮過的醬汁
他們未煮過的醬汁
當然是經理的
還有
如何從經理的飲品經理
把這範圍
寫的這範圍
經理
當然
所以在中國經理的飲品
經理的飲品
變成了
經理的飲品
完全描述的
當然
程雲
Galore
我不會把這些
全部寫出來
但
這範圍
是
詳細的
一個範圍
可能是兩範圍長的
我發現
全部這些
程雲
可能他們不是
全是程雲
我還不確定
最後一範圍
會是程雲
或不
但
全部這些
兩範圍的文章
這範圍
是
寫的
一個
美國寫的
還有一範圍的文章
用12範圍
用兩範圍的文章
我愛這範圍
就是我所想的
就是我所想的
這範圍的整個想法
用程雲
是
正正的方式
用這範圍
用這範圍
用這範圍
所以
全是
正正的方式
用這範圍
用這範圍
是不一樣的
用這範圍
用這範圍
用這範圍
用這範圍
用這範圍
用這範圍
用這範圍
我不知道怎麼說
但
有人可以
解決
無論如何
這範圍
用這範圍
用這範圍
用這範圍
用你
用這範圍
用這範圍
用一個幻象
我的原則
我既然想
令你們
忌迫
我知道我的原則
很棒
我要你
平心
房東
再次在《王爵》中
你怎麼會在《王爵》中
你看到這八個詳細
有很多很多的詳細
在書中
在網上
但我驚訝
沒有任何詳細
尊敬20個
原來是20個
我認為
應該是20個
在英文
所以
他們應該不是20個
五個字
五個字
在每個字上
那好像很明顯
很明顯
所以
這是我來的

So anyway, there's it's it's 20 syllables, but I looked at that and I thought there's something wrong here. There's something I don't like. There's why is there a comma here?
There weren't any commas. Why is there a comma? Why is there a period? Why are there capital letters? It doesn't make any sense. So I revised it. Bleak peek no one's seen, but here snips of talk late.
Late light spins through Bosch shines back on Green Park. Green Park. Ah, I revised it again. I thought, gee, it was a geometrical pattern at one time. How about that? Bleak peek no one's seen, but here snips of talk.
Late light spins through Bosch shines back on Green Park. Green Park. I thought that's getting there, but then I thought, wait a minute, the original was vertical.
So, Bleak peek no one's seen, but here snips of talk.Late light spins through Bosch shines back on Green Park.
And I thought this doesn't look like Chinese. Let's make it. This is a character. This is a typeface called brush script brush.
So this is sort of like brushstrokes. I want to point something else out to you, which is
ren and ru or ru and ren. However, it goes beyond that. It goes a little beyond that.
On and no. And in fact, if you spell it backwards, on spins snips no. On spins snips no. I couldn't resist the temptation.
So I got quite a lot of, I said, wait a minute, Chinese characters, they are filled their square. They're not horizontal lines as in English. So I went a little further and I went like that.
Ok, I broke each word, each syllable into two pieces and placed them vertically. Alright, that was my translation.
As I said, I was proud of it. It may be silly in some ways, but I love it. And I have also translated a number of other poems that fit in 20 syllables in the same way.
So, would an English language reader of this translation have stood in the original Parthenon of Longway's original poem?
I'm not going to say yes or no. I'm just asking the question. I'm not saying it's perfect. I'm only asking you to bring you back to the original question that opened this lecture.
Ok.Kongshan Bujian Ren. It is at the top of a bleak peak.
So, some concluding thoughts.
Why is there such a vast difference between getting a computer to be able to play world class chess or go and getting a computer to be able to translate very simple sentences such as the box is in the pen reliably?
It is because today's MT, no matter how flashy or deep in quotes, it is, is empty.
It is because today's MT does not have any ideas behind the scenes.
It is because today's MT just throws symbols around without any notion that they might symbolize anything.
This is today's MT, which mostly reflects corporate goals, not philosophical goals.MT could have been otherwise, and MT might someday become totally different.
But today, the fact is that MT has no understanding of situations because it has no understanding of words because it doesn't know words stand for anything.
MT doesn't know what a hill or a voice is or what green is or what moss is.MT doesn't know about space.MT doesn't know about time.MT doesn't know about up or down.
MT doesn't know about big or little.MT doesn't know there are people.MT doesn't know there are things.MT doesn't know there is a world.
MT doesn't know that anything exists.MT doesn't know that anything happens.MT doesn't know anything at all.
MT isn't roughly understanding or sort of understanding the text it works on.MT is not understanding.
MT is empty, period.MT is empty, period.
