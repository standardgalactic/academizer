Still I rise. You may write me down in history with your bitter twisted lies.
You may trod me in the very dirt, but still like dust I'll rise. Does my
sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? Because I walk like I've got
oil wells pumping in my living room. Just like moons and like suns with a
certainty of ties.
