非常感谢侯先生给我们的这样一个精彩报道
我突然感觉自己已经不会说中文了
然后我们看到就是说
当我们这些理科生们
因为大部分在做的可能都是来自于这个
就是跟计算机
或者是人工智能相关的这个专业
当我们在感叹说
软件正在吃掉这个世界
对吧
然后我们人工智能站在竞军
所谓的传统的社会科学
语言学等等这些领域的时候
我们也不要忘记
今天侯先生给我们看到的
实际上现在的人工智能
现在的机器翻译
还有非常非常远的路去走
因为机器它不懂这个世界
它没有一个meaning在这里面
而我们人类却在观察这些语言也好
这个世界也好
它会从各种各样的侧面
来去观察不同的这种pattern
就像我们刚才看到的那个
那首诗一样
你可以从发音的角度
你可以从不同的这个
几个空间形状的角度等等
有多个侧面
所以这个世界还是比我们机器
更加的美好
一个非常真实的这样一个世界
好 那接下来呢
就让我们进入一个互动的环节
看大家有什么问题来提问

Professor Hofstetter
Oh OK
I come from the Swama Club
and I'm also a robotics researcher
I think tell
My name is Shi Xue Song
Sue Song means
see the kind of tree in a rare
My question is about
recent progress on artificial intelligence
and you mentioned
you gave some examples
where machine translation
was awkward or even ridiculous
and you also mentioned
that on some other tasks
like completing goals
or computer vision
or speech recognition
where city of the art
deep neural networks
played quite well
some hard problems
that had been thought to
require high-level intelligence
has not been solved to some extent
so would you share with us
your thoughts on those recent progress
of giving relatives?
I fully agree that there has been
some impressive progress
in some of the domains
that you just mentioned
and the question
of course we don't know
whether neural networks
deep neural networks
and deep learning
are going to be able to
go much further
there are lots of problems
with such approaches
adversarial examples
and so forth
we know that there are problems
and we also know
that there are limitations
the reasonperhaps behind
that I gave this talk
in the first place
was that about
a little over a year ago
there were articles in
the newspapers
like the New York Times
and othersthat suggested
that this new technology
deep neural nets
applied to machine translation
had revolutionized
machine translation
and made it roughly
as good as human translation
and as a defender
of the human mind
and somebody who
thinks the translation
is a deep art
I felt
firstly threatened
by that claim
and secondly skeptical
of that claim
and so I
had to investigate it
myself
and I did
and you saw
some of the results
I did it
with many languages
not just Chinese
but I did it
with many languages
and I found that
in the domain
of machine translation
there was no such
it was not at all true
it did not come
close to human
translation
they had
of course
done something
that was
it was impressive
in the sense
thatyou could take
a paragraph
and cut
and paste it
and put it into
your translation engine
and it would be translated
in one second
whereas a human
being might take
ten minutes to do it
and so in a sense
it's very impressive
but it's
it's like a dictionary
lookup
and it's a
lookup
it's not words
but it's phrases
and the phrases
are disambigrated
by context
but of course
it fails
in many cases
and sometimes
it does
a very impressive
job
nowin other
domains
such as
chess
and go
which are
far smaller
than understanding
the world
which is
what translation
requires
translation
involves
the entire world
chess doesn't
and similarly
with go
it's more squares
more dots
and so forth
but it's a very limited
world
very finite world
and those
in such domains
it does
you get deep neural nets
doing very good things
we don't know
where deep neural nets
are going to get us
you mentioned vision
vision is an interesting thing
it can
there are certainly
impressive programs
that can sometimes
recognize instances
of cats
and what not
very well
but they also
can be fooled
by things that
don't
that look
two pictures
that look identical
to a human
that'll say
this is a cat
and it'll say
something completely
differentfor the other
picture
because of the
adversarial example
so we still
have a long way to go
in terms of
that kind of thing
I don't know
where we're going
I agree that
there has been
I can't
I'm not a
futurologist
I can't predict
the future
I don't
look forward
to the day
when
if it arrives
in which
computers
reach the
human intelligence
level
I find that
a very threatening
idea
not a
positive one
but I
don't know
where we're going
it seems like
there is
momentum
towards
trying to
create
computers
that are
intelligent
I would have
understood that idea
of trying to
create computers
that are intelligent
four years ago
when there was
it seemed like
it was such a
far-off goal
that it was
it was mostly
just a
philosophical hope
but now
when it seems like
it might
possibly happen
we don't know
now
it is
not a goal
that I
am enthusiastic
about any longer
it's a goal
that I don't
like and
find disturbing
but
as I say
there's
sort of
an unstoppable
momentum
towards
it
and
where
that will
lead
nobody knows
it's a big
big big question
nobody knows

That's not appropriate.
A question is supposed to be a question, not the reading of an essay.
I'm sorry, I won't do that.
Okay.
大家还是盡量提问。
Okay, My question is up.
I'm sure your essay is well thought out and I respect your essay,
but I don't think it's appropriate to read an essay out loud as a question.
I think that's wrong.
Okay, okay.
I'm sorry.
My question.
Okay, I ask a question.
Yeah.
In your new book, you explore the theme that
the analogy is very important to help us.
What is important?
The analogy.
Analogy is very important.
It's very important to help us understand the essence of intelligence.
But obviously, making analogy needs to find a similarity between two appearing difficult things.
In order to achieve that, we need many daily experiences, including emotion and feeling and so on.
So do you think even if we understand the key role of making analogy,
we still be far away to understand the general mechanism of intelligence?
What's your point about the right thing?
No, that's a very good question.
I think that you put your finger on something very important, which is emotions.
And I agree with that totally.
For me,thinking and emotions are inseparably connected.
Inseparably.
They are linked intimately.
You can't have thinking without emotions.
Because emotions means having preferences.
I like this better than I like that.
I mean,how could I possibly have come up with a trance?
Let's just take that last thing that I just did.
Okay, I just went through that one way poem.
You saw that I felt emotional about it.
I said to myself,how is it possible that nobody did a 20-syllable thing?
That puzzled me.
That experience of puzzlement was a frustration,a confusion,a kind of an outrage.
The next thing was I tried very hard.
I looked and I looked and I looked with intense curiosity,intellectual curiosity,desire.
I was fascinated.
I had a passion to try to find 20-syllables,4 per line.
That excited me.It was exciting.
Then once I had done that,I wanted to take,then I saw there were flaws.
And I thought about it.I said,oh,take those commas and periods away.
Take the capitals out.
This was exciting to me.
Then,you know,each stage that I went through further was emotional.
It gripped me.It was a passion.
I couldn't possibly inconceivable for me to come up with that translation without being a deeply emotional human being.
Emotions were behind that translation from beginning to end.
Everything was emotional.
So,you're absolutely right.
And analogies.
I assume you were not at my talk yesterday,right?
You were not at my talk yesterday.
No.
Well,I talked about some analogies that involved emotions.
And many analogies and emotions are at the core of analogies.
And I gave some examples.I'm not going to give them today.
But you are completely right that emotions are very central to thinking.
And have to be part of what thinking is all about.
Absolutely right.
And I appreciate that contribution to the discussion.
It's very,very good. Thank you.
The next one.
Okay.
All right.
Hi,professor.
I'm a sophomore of U.S.S.P.
I'm in my gapcounter now.
I have a question about analogy.
I mean,I highly agree that analogy can be regarded as a fuel and fire of our thinking.
But how does this fire enlighten a new way?
In our science and common sense.
I mean,even now,reductionism and logical reasoning are still dominate approaches to science.
So,how will the awareness of analogy influence and guide our scientific research in the future?
I mean,do you believe there will be a paradigm shift in science which bases on the analogy and the metaphor?
I understand your question.
I think that you're wrong about the nature of science.
All good science is based on analogy and always has been.
I know that,but I mean,reductionism is dominate in the field of science now.
I mean,we should put more effort on the essence of analogy in science.
Well,let me,I still,let me,I'll try to reply to your question.
The great scientists,you know,I'll take physics as a science that I know the best.
Let's say,Newton,Faraday,Maxwell,Helmholtz,Plank,Boer,Einstein,Dirak,Schroedinger,Heisenberg,and on and on and on.
I looked at the fundamental discoveries made by these people because I gave a course on analogy making in physics.
And it turned out that every single discovery made was made through analogy.
It was not made through some kind of logical reasoning.It was made through analogy.
And nobody,all profound insights come that manner.
But very often what happens is that the analogies that gave rise to the deep insights get buried and get forgotten.
And then only the deep insights are given and are sort of defended as if they were logical,as if they had come out of some kind of pure logical deduction principle.
When you go back to the history of science and actually see how the things were discovered,it turns out that analogy is how they were always discovered.
So it's not as if we have to teach scientists to think by analogy.
What we could teach scientists to do is how to communicate more clearly what it is that they really do.
And to use more analogies in their discussion and to clarify things more by analogy.
In that sense,I think you're right,the analogy has to be brought more to the awareness of people.
And we shouldn't pretend that science is some kind of very strictly logical process,which it often is presented as being.
So I agree with that notion.
Actually,I mean,I really agree that analogy lies at the root of our all concept,not merely in our daily speaking,but also in the field of physics and mathematics.
Actually,I feel the academic trainers to think,to regard the science as something like a analogy.
How should us to put more effort to lie the scientists in the future to aware about the importance of analogy?
Well,as I said,I think it's good for scientists to expose their analogies rather than to hide them.
But any good scientist,any deep scientist is automatically thinking by analogy anyway.
They automatically do,because that's what humans do best.
And so we don't have to teach scientists to use analogy because they do it automatically.
We should try to get them to not be ashamed of it instead and to say it out loud.
But I thought of this by analogy.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Hey Douglas.
I'm from the Swarovga Club.
I'm a PhD student and my interest is in computation neuroscience and deep learning and dynamical systems.
One of the hot topics now in deep learning is a future learning.
That is learning an agent based just on a few examples.
For example,a child never see,never knows the knowledge about the giraffe.
But one day,her mom tells her,this is a giraffe.
And next weekend,her mom take her to the zoo and he knows everything,maybe everything about the giraffe.
That is a meta knowledge,I think.
And this is due to the evolution or this is due to the learning in the past when she is one year old or two years old.
So one of the way to do future learning is meta learning.
That is learning to learn.
And I think that the state of the art,the Google machine translator sometimes makes mistakes because it mainly care about current sentence.
Just this current sentence,not about the sentence in the context of the situation where it came from.
Well,it doesn't have any understanding of situations.
So it couldn't possibly use the context because it doesn't understand situations.
So my question is,what about add some meta knowledge to the translator?
Yeah,I mean,what you have to do is you have to add understanding of words.
No,the words stand for things.
The words symbolize things in the world.
They symbolize objects,they symbolize actions,they symbolize relationships.
And the phrases stand for things.
And if you're doing that,you're trying to get what Bar Hillel said was,getting an encyclopedia.
He said,an encyclopedic understanding.
And he said,that's utterly comarical.
Well,it may not be utterly comarical today because computers are much bigger than they were back then.
It's 60 years past and maybe giving computers knowledge of the world is a possible thing to do.
And having them interact with the world in such a way that words take on meanings
because these words stand for things in the world.
That could be thought of as an approach to the improvement,not only of machine translation,but of machine thinking.
And as I say,here we get on to what I think of as dangerous territory.
Because once you start going down that slippery slope,who knows where it's going to wind up?
Who knows whether we human beings are going to be superseded by a different kind of creature?
Superceded meaning taken over by,you know,rendered part of the past.
You know,are we creating,wittingly or unwittingly our own successors?
Do we want to create our own successors?
Or are we just going to ride the tsunami like a surferand say,what the hell,this is fun.
Oops,looks like I've been outmoded.
Looks like I and my children have been outmoded.
We're now trivia compared with computers that we have created or computational devices.
Do we really want that?It's not a future that I would look forward to myself.
I would like to get off.I would like humanity to get off of the wave.
But the wave is compelling to many people.
Now,I don't know in your case.I suspect in your case it's compelling to be on part of this wave out of some kind of intellectual desire.
But I think in the case of larger entities like corporations,it doesn't come out of any intellectual curiosity.
It comes out of money making.
And I think that money making,the desire to make money is something that is unstoppable,unfortunately.
So,I'm just worried.That's my feeling.
Hi,Professor Ho.Actually,I followed you to the Tsinghua event yesterday as well.
You can call me Isabelle.
And I'm not a science major.
I was a language major and then a journalism major.
So,I guess my questions are more liberal arts kind of.
My question,I have two questions,actually.
First question,it sounds like machines may not be good translators.
But they are already top players in chess competitions and other competitions.
That in itself is intimidating enough.
And many people are worried that it has already robbed many people of their jobs.
My question is,do you think that it's a big challenge to us already?
No matter how machines are unintelligent,they have already advanced in a lot of competitions and beat human beings in those competitions.
That's the first question.
Well,you know,I understand.
I don't know how many people have been put out of jobs.
And I feel that that is worrisome.
Yes,and that's troubling.
I'm not an expert on the social impact of artificial intelligence.
I don't know how much of an impact it has had so far.
But of course,as time progresses,it will have an ever larger impact.That's clear.
I mean,for example,we hear about the idea that drivers of taxis and drivers of Uber and things like that are going to all be replaced by machines and so forth.
I heard the other day indirectly through a friend that there was an attempt by Tang Xun to get a computer program or piece of software,hardware,whatever you want to call it,to do simultaneous translation at a conference recently.
I don't know where and I'm not aware of what.
I don't know anything about it.
And I was told by the person involved that it was not a very big success.
She didn't use,she didn't use,she used a word that was a little bit less flattering than that,but she wasn't very negative.
She said it just didn't work very well,something like that.
And I was very delighted to hear that.
And I was,I was,I wasn't surprised.
I thought it sounded like,you know,a very unlikely thing to succeed.
But at the same time,there's a profession that might be considered to be threatened,that of simultaneous translator.
I certainly hope it won't be,but and it would be shocking to me if it were.
But I can't predict what is going to happen.
So yes,I am worried about it.
I dislike it intensely.
But I had not foreseen this kind of thing back in 1975 when I was writing GEB.
I had not foreseen the idea that there would be things that would be challenging humans in very human domains.
I had not expected that.
I thought that computers were always,you know,for the next few hundred years anyway,going to be way below humans.
That was my intuition.
And that's what I expressed in some of the passages in GEB that turned out to be somewhat wrong.
You know,it's shocking and troubling to me.
So that's,you know,that's the reaction of one person.
My second question is,actually,there are robot journalists now as well.
Tenson has a dream writer who can write scripts without human intelligence.
It has already,well,many journalists are in the threat of losing jobs.
And so we are all deeply terrified.
And it sounds like you are also very worried because you're afraid of what will happen when AI has really advanced
out of our expectation.
Let's say if.
OK,if.
But the thing is,history evolves no matter what we want.
And what will happen will happen.
So no matter how unwilling we are of this technology advancing too much.
If it's going to happen,and what should we do now to kind of,how to say,to keep the value
of the human intelligence,no matter how technology advances in the speed that we cannot imagine.
You're asking questions that I have no answers to.
I couldn't possibly tell you what,how we should prepare.
But,you know,I don't know the answers to such questions.
But I will tell you that I have been worried about this for,about this kind of scenario.
By the way,you say that there are robot journalists who can,you're worried they might put you out of a job.
I find that very,very unlikely.
But,I mean,it is far too complex.
As you can see,Google Translate can't even understand the box was in the pen.
So,I don't think that there are going to be programs that can write better tech.
So then,it's a million times more complicated than boxes being created in pens.
So,if they can do so,they can do so in extraordinarily limited domains.
And,oh,if they can do so,it's only in extraordinarily limited domains.
And,I mean,you know,if I'm proven wrong,okay,what can I say?
But,I'm extremely skeptical of this happening,okay?
The other thing that I wanted to say,though,is that for about 25 years,
I've been worried about the future of artificial intelligence,getting progressively more worried.
But,at the same time,seeing all sorts of evidence
that we're not anywhere close yet,like I just showed today.
But,there are books written,of course,about the so-called singularity
by people like Ray Kurzweil and Hans Moravec right about the future.
Hans Moravec was a roboticist,a famous roboticist,wrote a book.
called,I think it was calledMind Children,Mind Children.
And,in it,he envisions a scenario in which computers take over.
They're much smarter than we are.
But,they're not only smarter.
They're also more compassionate,more generous,more cultured.
They're just better than we are.
And,he says,what could be better than to produce one's own successors?
He says,this is great.Mind Children,they will be our successors.
I mean,let's put it this way.I once wrote an article.
I called it,who will be we in 2493?
The word,we,is a tricky word.
We,the people in this room,use it to talk about humanity.
But,how about we,a thousand years ago?
Can I say,what were we doing?
What were we doing a thousand years ago?
What were we doing ten thousand years ago?
What were we doing a hundred thousand years ago?
Who does we refer to?
Who does we refer to when I say,I hope that we will be wiser in the future?
Who is it referring to?
How far in the future?
Three thousand years in the future?
What if we,three thousand years in the future,is not the people that were created by sexual intercourse,
but people,things,entities,thinking things that were created by technological advances,
and their computational beings.
They are our successors.
They are our mind children.
And,they're better than us.
They're nicer,and smarter,and sweeter,and more creative,and more generous.
Well,maybe that's what Hans Moravec says.
He welcomes that.
He thinks,what could be better than to have given rise to mind children like that?
That would be the best possible outcome.
That's his view.
I can understand that.
When I look at the world today,all I see is conflict,and horrible things happening.
And I think these human beings aren't so great after all,even though I admire the human mind.
The world is filled with disgusting,horrible things.
Maybe if we could create a race of thinking entities that is kinder than us,maybe that's better,maybe that's the best.
It's not what I really like,but maybe that's the way we're going.
As you say,history happens,things evolve.
We can't stop it.
Maybe it'll be better,maybe it won't.
We don't know.
我們現場提問這個環節就是暫告一個段落,然後下面進入我們的第二部分,
也就是關於大家都熟知的記憶幣這本書,就是歌德爾愛什巴赫.
這本書首先我想表達一下它對我的影響,
實際上在2003年的時候也是我們極致俱樂部的最開始的一個網站,
剛剛上線的時候,當時有兩本書深刻的影響了我,一本書就是complexity,
但不是後世達的學生翻譯的那本,而是一個叫world job,
然後技術的是聖塔菲研究所的故事,
這本書讓我決定走到複雜性領域裡面來去做研究,
然後第二本書就是這本記憶幣歌德爾愛什巴赫這本書影響了我,
然後它讓我下定決心,一輩子就幹這個了,
第一本書還不足以讓我下決心,
但是第二本書讓我下決心,
然後下了這個決心以後,其實才有慢慢有的這些網站,
才願意去奉獻很多的時間去做這件事情,
所以對我影響是非常的深,
然後後來到了這個大概是09年、10年左右的時候,
我們開始極致俱樂部組織線下的讀書會,
Reader group to read GB這本書,
在這個過程之中有非常多有意思的事情發生,
我就舉一個非常簡單的例子,
就是在當年記憶幣這本書裡面,
那麼其中有一個小小的實驗,
非常有意思,
就是我們可以把一個攝像機和一個電視連在一起,
形成一個視覺的一個反饋迴路,
這樣的話你攝像機射出來的畫面直接就反饋到電視屏幕上,
但是這個還不是關鍵,
因為關鍵的時候是在於對這款有一個簡單的視頻,
就是關鍵是在於,
就是說你這麼反饋以後,
你會看到就像兩邊鏡子對著照,
形成一個無窮遠的一個corridor,
一個走廊,
但是更有意思的是,
那個攝像機上有一個旋鈕,
叫做zoom in,
你可以放大這個畫面,
所以當我們看到一個無窮遠的一個亮點的時候,
我們可以zoom in它,
把它放大,
那這個時候就非常有意思,
當你調那個參數就brightness,
還有一個對比度這些東西,
你調合適的這個時候,
它就會突然產生了複雜的分型結構,
而這裡面是其中一個攝像機射出來的結果,
如果你換不同的攝像機,
特別是那些低保針的,
那種模擬線路的那種攝像機,
你看到的是另外一番景象,
很像那種新西的爆炸,宇宙的產生,
所以當時我在自己試驗出這個結果的時候,
我就真的是被電倒了,
被雷劈的那種記憶中的那種感覺,
然後我們在極致俱樂部,
曾經花過一整天的時間,
我們大概有十個人左右,
沒幹別的,
就一直在做這個實驗,
這是當天的一個情景,
就是我們在做那個實驗,
在3號會所,
那個現在3號會所已經拆了,
所以從這個角度來說,
實際上我們已經明明之中,
跟侯時達先生實際上有一個這種聯繫,
就是跟吉壁有這種聯繫,
所以呢,就是為了表達對這個,
我又說錯了,侯道仁先生,
這樣一個敬意,
也是對這本書,
吉壁的這個敬意呢,
我們送上我們準備的這個禮物,
謝謝你們,
這就是這本書,
這本書是寫的,
很多的團隊,
我們可以展示給觀眾看,
拍照,
所以,
這是其實,
中國的名字是
科學的極致,
因為我們的組織是極致俱樂部,
所以我們用同樣的詞,
科學的極致,
第二名的名字是,
是藝術教育,
在這本書,
有一個圖文,
我又轉換成英文了,
在這個書裡面,
有一個章節,
就是在介紹這個吉壁,
其實整本書,
都是在做,
在對這個人工智能,
做一個總體上的,
一個概懶性的一個介紹,
其中一個章節就是,
我寫的,
就是在介紹這個吉壁這邊,
書裡面的內容,
所以也是,
也希望那個侯先生,
能夠那個,
來讀一讀我們這個圖文,
謝謝,
謝謝,
OK,
OK,

我再次去看了10年後的作品
我突然間把自己的想法跟自己的想法都連接了
我已經做過了
當我當年輕人
但我從來沒有做過
但從來沒有想過
我的想法跟我的想法
跟我的想法跟我的想法
是甚麼
我的意識和心思

我們變成了非常親近的朋友
後來G.E.B.出生於1979
前兩個月前出生
我寫了六本書
我給了一本書給Don Bird
他在世界上是最有趣的一本書
兩、三個月前
Don在印度的學校
看見有人拿了一本書給G.E.B.
他沒想到這本書還沒發售
只要他知道
這本書有個人拿了一本書給G.E.B.
Don excitedly went up
ran up to him and said
Where did you get that book?
The guy said
Oh, I was over at Howard's bookstore
Now Howard's bookstore
was Bloomington's best bookstore at that time
It was rather small
It was about the size of this room
And David
This was Modaway as it turns out
David had been there earlier that day
Maybe an hour earlier
And he had walked in
And right at that moment
Howard was opening Howard the owner
Was opening a box on the floor
He was pulling open a box of books
Now the reason Howard had
Pre-publication copies
Was that his was the bookstore
In Bloomington, which is the city
Where the author resided
And they wanted to have
The first copies go to Bloomington
And so the box
Was the first box of G.E.B.
That was being opened
In any bookstore in the world
David watched Howard open the book
So the box
And he's looked at the title
And he said
I'll buy that book
He picked it up and bought it
He was the first person in the world
To buy G.E.B.
The first person
And Don saw him about an hour later
Walking across the campus
Don started getting to become friends
With David
And he introduced me to David
And we became very good friends
Of course David's name
Was not Motawe
David's name was David Moser
And David did not know
One word of Chinese
He had grown up in Oklahoma
Which is a state
In the middle of the United States
And his parents didn't speak
Any foreign languages
And David didn't speak
Any foreign languages
He had studied French
And German a little bit
But he didn't speak
Any foreign languages at all
Well, but he loved language
He was a writer, principally
And he was also, though
At the same time
A music graduate student
A student of composition
And so Don and David
Became very good friends
And I became a very good friend
And then it turned out
That Don and David
Both moved to Boston
In 1982 or so
1981 or 82
Well, I had a sabbatical
Year coming up
And I, for some reason
That I don't remember clearly
Decided to go spend it in Boston
At the MIT
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
In 1983-84
And one of the principal people
At the MIT
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
A hero to many people
In artificial intelligence
And probably most of you
Know this name
Was Marvin Minsky
And Marvin Minsky became
A good friend of Don's
A good friend of David's
A good friend of mine
And a good friend
Of my friend Dan Dennett
A philosopher of mine
We all used to hang out
At Marvin Minsky's house
In the evenings
Not every day
I mean but often
And they would often
Order Chinese food
And so there was a good
Chinese restaurant
Just around the corner
And so one day
The Chinese restaurant
Bought the food to the house
And they put it down
On the table in little white
Boxes
And on one of the
Boxes
I saw the following shape
G
G
Two lines
And I said
Oh that's probably chicken
And because you know
G or G
Depending on what the context
G I said
That's probably chicken
And on another one
I said
Oh that's probably rice
And David looked at me
Oh I forgot to say
About David
He grew up in Oklahoma
But his parents
Despite not speaking
Any foreign languages
And they had international students
Living with them
There was a small university
In the town
That they lived in
And they always had
International students
Some of them were from Africa
And some of them were from China
And David had been surrounded
By Chinese people
Ever since he was little
But he didn't know a word
Of Chinese
And he assumed
That it was impossible
For somebody
Who was not born in China
To speak Chinese
He assumed
That was an impossibility
A contradiction in terms
You had to be Chinese
In order to speak Chinese
And here was Doug Hofstadter
Looking at something
And saying
This must be chicken
And this must be rice
And he said
That's crazy
He is able to understand
Those symbols
Oh my god
Maybe I could do it too
And so I said
He got all excited
This is about
The role of emotions
And thinking
Talk about emotions
He got so excited
And I said
David, look
I've been studying Chinese
For a couple of years
A few years
I have a wonderful book
That I like
How about if I record
The first few lessons for you
I'll just go through it
Read it sentence by sentence
And he said
Great
So I recorded
The first eight lessons
In the Chinese reader
That I had
By John de Francis
And I gave
The little cassette tape
To David
And that way
That was David's
First lessons in Chinese
I was Maudawe's
First Chinese teacher
Hodauren was Maudawe's
First Chinese teacher
Unfortunately
I can no longer teach him
Anything in Chinese
Well, I may be one
I might know some unusual character
That he doesn't know
But basically
Anyway
That's not the point
He's infinitely better
Than I am
But so that was
That was kind of funny
David then came to
First he went to Taiwan
And he studied Chinese there
And then he came to Beijing
And became part of the
Translation team
Along with Guo Wei de
And other people
Many other people
Wang Pei
And Yan Yong
And Liu Haoming
And others
And they had a wonderful time
And David did Xiang Xiang
On television and so forth
David became a very famous person
In China
So
But I jumped the gun
Because I forgot
To tell you something interesting
In 1980
After GEB came out
I realized that it had
The chance of being translated
Into another language
But it was so filled
From beginning to end
With word play
And playfulness
And games
Well, games
Isn't quite the right word
But playfulness
And puns
And so forth
It was all filled
To the brim
With such things
I wanted them to be reproduced
I didn't want them to be
Explained in a foreign language
Reproduced doesn't mean
Copied exactly
It means approximately
Something similar
I wanted translation
To be done by analogy
And so I spent a year
1980-81
Annotating a copy of the book
I had a copy of the book
And I every page
I wrote tons of things
In red ink on every page
Hundreds and hundreds of pages
Hundreds and thousands
And thousands of remarks
For translators
I didn't know
Into what language
I just knew
That this was
What translators needed
Then when I found out
There were going to be
Some translations
Into foreign languages
I wrote a cover letter
That was many, many pages long
Explaining my philosophy
Of translation to these people
And then in 1982
I received a letter
From a person in France
Named of all things
Bob French
And Bob French was
Going to
Was a French translator
He was American
But he was a translator
Of French
From English into French
And French into English
And he's proposed
Writing
Doing a translation
With his partner
Jacline Henri
The two of them
Would translate
J.E.B. into French
And I could just tell
From the letter
That he was extremely smart
And that this would be
The perfect team
Well, so I went
To France in 1983
And met with Bob and Jacqueline
And as it happened
David Moser was there with us
In 1983
In Paris
As was another person
Ronald Yonkers
Who was going to be
The Dutch translator
Of G.E.B.
And so the
If I count correctly
Doug
David
Ronald
Bob
Jacline
Five people
We met day after day after day
In some cafes
In the
The Cartier-Latin
The student
The university area
Of Paris
Day after day
We would discuss
The translation issues
And it was extremely exciting
David was listening
He wasn't going to be
A translator
Ronald and Bob
And Jacqueline were
David was just interested
In making all sorts
Of intelligent comments
Little could he have known
Or ever suspected
That he was going to be
Part of the translation team
Into Chinese
A language of which
He knew not one word
At that time
Not one word
And that's really quite
A remarkable story
So that was in 1983
So I think
That's probably enough
I wanted to tell you these things
Because it's a fun story
I can tell you more
If you have questions
But I thought that would be
A good launching point
For some discussions about GED
非常感謝
讓我們還是再次感謝
所有參與
GED的翻譯的一則
真的是非常不容易
