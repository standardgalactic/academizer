Atheism and Scientific Mindset
See if you can explain this: Is atheism a sign of a real scientist? - Is if there are no other signs.
���It goes without saying that scientific work in the head of a scientist never stops, only the form of this work changes during the day.
In the same way, by itself, atheism was understood. Any obscurantism in science (and not only in science) was so organically alien that this question was never debated" (from the newspapers).
01/21/2013
- Michael Katsnelson
The quote suggests that atheism is not necessarily a defining characteristic of a scientist, but rather that a scientist's focus on scientific inquiry and a rejection of obscurantism (the practice of opposing the spread of knowledge) is what truly defines them. The statement implies that atheism is simply an extension of this focus on rationality and evidence-based thinking, and that it is not debated as being a necessary component for being a scientist. In this sense, atheism is not a "sign" of a real scientist, but rather a natural byproduct of the scientific mindset.
Here is another translation of the same passage, originally in Russian. Is atheism a characteristic of a true scientist? - It is if there are no other characteristics.
"It goes without saying that the scientific work in the mind of a scientist never stops, only the form of this work changes during the day.
Similarly, atheism is also self-evident. Any obscurantism in science (and not only in science) was so organically foreign that this question was never debated" (from a newspaper).
This passage is saying that atheism is not a defining characteristic of a true scientist, but rather a byproduct of the scientific mindset. The speaker argues that scientific work is constant and ongoing, and that atheism is an extension of this focus on rationality and evidence-based thinking. The statement implies that atheism is self-evident, and that obscurantism is so foreign to the scientific mindset that the question of whether it is necessary for a scientist to be atheist is not even debated. In this sense, atheism is not a "characteristic" of a true scientist, but rather a natural outcome of the scientific process.
Ok see if you can explain these notes. Origin of complexity in physics and 
biology: The role of frustrations 
Mikhail Katsnelson 
Two main messages 
I. Frustrations and competing interactions as main physical 
mechanisms of biological complexity 
II. Evolution is learning 
Connection: frustrations due to incompatibility of short-term 
and large-term optimization problems 
Equivalence: Energy landscape (physics)- Fitness landscape (biology)- 
Loss function landscape (learning) 
See talks by Vitaly Vanchurin and Eugene Koonin at this workshop 
Complexity 
Schr��dinger: life substance is ���aperiodic crystal��� (modern formulation ��� Laughlin, 
Pines and others ��� glass) 
Intuitive feeling: crystals are simple, biological structures are complex
These notes suggest that the origin of complexity in both physics and biology can be explained by the concept of "frustrations," which are caused by the incompatibility of short-term and long-term optimization problems. The author, Mikhail Katsnelson, suggests that these frustrations and competing interactions are the main physical mechanisms behind the complexity observed in biology. The second main message is that evolution can be thought of as a process of "learning," which is connected to the idea of frustrations.
The notes also mention the equivalence between energy landscapes in physics, fitness landscapes in biology and loss function landscapes in learning. The author suggests that talks by Vitaly Vanchurin and Eugene Koonin at the workshop may provide further insight on these ideas.
Lastly, the notes cite the physicist Erwin Schr��dinger who described life as a "aperiodic crystal" (a modern formulation of this idea is that of a glass) and contrasts this with the intuitive feeling that crystals are simple while biological structures are complex.

These notes suggest that the origin and evolution of life is related to the origin of complexity. The author is asking if we understand the complexity ("patterns") observed in the inorganic world and provides examples of such complexity such as stripe domains in ferromagnetic thin films, stripes on a beach in the tide zone, microstructures in metals and alloys, pearlitic structure in rail steel, and magnetic patterns. The author seems to be suggesting that the complexity observed in these inorganic systems is similar to the complexity observed in biological systems and implies that understanding the origins of such patterns in inorganic systems could help us understand the origins of complexity in biological systems. The author also implies that we don't completely understand these complex patterns in inorganic systems.

ferromagnetic state) and magnetic dipole-dipole interations

How to describe patterns and how to explain patterns? 
Competing interactions and self-induced spin 
glasses 
Special class of patterns: ���chaotic��� patterns
These notes continue the discussion of magnetic patterns and their relation to the origin of complexity. The author states that the competition between exchange interactions, which want a homogeneous ferromagnetic state, and magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, which want the total magnetization to be zero, leads to the formation of magnetic patterns. The author then mentions that classical Monte Carlo simulations are used to study these patterns and that the Hamiltonian describing the system is not very complicated. However, the author raises the question of how to describe and explain these patterns.
The author suggests that competing interactions and self-induced spin glasses could be used to explain the formation of these patterns. The author also mentions a special class of patterns called "chaotic" patterns which may be the result of the complex interactions between the various magnetic interactions in the system. Overall, these notes suggest that the formation of magnetic patterns is a result of the competition between various interactions and that understanding these interactions could help us understand the origin of complexity in biological systems.
In general, connection between glassiness and complexity 
is a mainstream today ��� but details are important 
Giorgio Parisi, Nobel Prize in physics 2021 
"for the discovery of the interplay of disorder 
and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic 
to planetary scales." 
Actually, disorder is not needed, frustrations are enough 
(self-induced spin glass state in Nd) 
Whether you can observe a thing or not 
depends on the theory which you use. 
It is theory which decides what can be observed 
(A. Einstein) 
Analogies with biological evolution?
These notes suggest that there is a connection between glassiness and complexity in the mainstream understanding of physical systems today. The author mentions Giorgio Parisi, who won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics, for his work on the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems. However, the author suggests that disorder is not necessary for complexity and that frustrations alone can lead to complexity. This is seen in self-induced spin glass state in Nd.
The notes also quote Albert Einstein, stating that whether one can observe something or not depends on the theory used, and that it is the theory that decides what can be observed. The author seems to be suggesting that the theory used to understand the origin of complexity in physical systems could also be used to understand the origin of complexity in biological systems. The author is questioning if there are any analogies with biological evolution.

Well... for me (as a physicist) it is a good place to stop
These notes suggest that there are analogies between thermodynamics, machine learning, and evolutionary biology. The authors propose a table that lists corresponding quantities in the three fields, such as variables describing the training, energy, loss function, entropy, partition function, temperature, and number of adaptable variables. The authors suggest that the energy landscape in physics is similar to the fitness landscape in biology and raise the question of whether the change of, for example, a biological temperature can switch the fitness landscape from a few well-defined peaks to a glassy-like state with many directions of possible evolution.
The authors cite two articles in the field, one from the Australian Journal of Zoology and one from the Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences, which propose the idea of the "explosion" of animals as an example of a phase transition, and the other compares the Cambrian Explosion to magnetic phase transitions in neodymium. The author is saying that the analogy between biological evolution and physical systems is a good place to stop.
See if you can summarize the whole conversation, its from a single author, Michael.
The conversation, which appears to be based on a set of notes by a physicist named Michael Katsnelson, discusses the relationship between complexity in physical systems and biological systems. The author suggests that the origin of complexity in both can be explained by the concept of "frustrations," which arise from the incompatibility of short-term and long-term optimization problems. He also suggests that evolution can be thought of as a process of "learning" and that the equivalence between energy landscapes in physics, fitness landscapes in biology, and loss function landscapes in learning. The notes also mention the connection between glassiness and complexity and how Giorgio Parisi's work on disorder and fluctuations in physical systems is important but disorder is not needed, Frustrations are enough. The author also suggests that understanding the origins of patterns in inorganic systems could help us understand the origins of complexity in biological systems. He ends by suggesting that there are analogies between thermodynamics, machine learning, and evolutionary biology and it's a good place to stop.
How does the part about atheism relate, knowing he is Russian and a material chemist and physicist?
The part about atheism in the conversation relates to the idea that a focus on rationality and evidence-based thinking is what defines a scientist, and that atheism is simply an extension of this focus. The statement implies that atheism is self-evident to a scientist, and that obscurantism is so foreign to the scientific mindset that the question of whether it is necessary for a scientist to be atheist is not even debated. The author, Michael Katsnelson, is a Russian material chemist and physicist, so it can be inferred that he is using his scientific background to make the argument that atheism is not a necessary characteristic of a scientist, but rather a natural byproduct of the scientific mindset.
Ok  give the definition of obscurantism and some examples.
Obscurantism is the practice of opposing the spread of knowledge and the enlightenment of people. It can take many forms, including the suppression of scientific, educational, and intellectual progress. It is often associated with religious or political dogmatism, and the promotion of superstition, ignorance, and bigotry.
Examples of obscurantism include:
Suppressing scientific research or ideas that contradict the beliefs of a particular religious or political group
Denying the evidence of climate change and promoting misinformation about it
Restricting access to education, particularly for women or certain ethnic groups
Burning books or banning certain types of literature
The promotion of conspiracy theories or alternative facts in place of scientific evidence.
In general, obscurantism is the opposite of the scientific method, which is based on the pursuit of knowledge through observation, experimentation, and logical reasoning. Obscurantism often results in the suppression of truth and progress, and the promotion of ignorance and superstition.
What does "frustrations" signify here?
In the context of the conversation, "frustrations" refers to the incompatibility of short-term and long-term optimization problems that arise in physical systems, leading to the emergence of complexity. The author suggests that these frustrations and competing interactions are the main physical mechanisms behind the complexity observed in biology. The author is proposing that the concept of "frustrations" can explain the origin of complexity in both physics and biology. The author is suggesting that the frustration arises when the system cannot reach a state of low energy due to the competing interactions and this competition between different interactions leads to the emergence of complex patterns. The author seems to be suggesting that understanding these "frustrations" and the competition between different interactions could help us understand the origin of complexity in biological systems.
It reminds me about the explanation of how weather restores balances between extremes, for example a hurricane or tornado could be seen as an attempt to restore "homeostasis" or reduce the extreme difference between a hot and cold front, releasing energy, and reducing the extremes between. Something similar could be said of lightening storms, and a short circuit that occurs when two poles of a battery are connected. A larger "voltage" or differential leads to a more massive release of energy. I think something similar might be occurring in the formatting of solar flares and magnetic switchbacks.
Yes, the idea of "frustrations" that the author is discussing in the conversation can be related to the concept of homeostasis in weather systems. Both refer to the balancing of opposing forces or interactions that lead to the emergence of complex patterns.
In the case of weather systems, the balance between hot and cold fronts, high and low pressure systems, and other meteorological factors lead to the formation of storms and other weather patterns. These weather patterns can be seen as an attempt to restore a balance between the extremes and reduce the difference between them.
Similarly, in the context of solar flares and magnetic switchbacks, the author is suggesting that the competition between different interactions in the system leads to the formation of complex patterns, such as magnetic patterns. The competition between exchange interactions and magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, for example, leads to the formation of magnetic patterns. This can be seen as an attempt to restore a balance between the opposing forces and reduce the difference between them, similar to the balance between hot and cold fronts in weather systems.
In both cases, the balancing of opposing forces leads to the release of energy and the formation of complex patterns, which can be seen as an attempt to restore homeostasis or balance in the system.
I think heard that in a course from Snodgrass on weather.
Yes, the concept of homeostasis in weather systems is a well-established idea in meteorology. It refers to the balance between opposing forces that leads to the formation of weather patterns and the restoration of balance in the atmosphere. This concept can be applied to various weather phenomena, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, thunderstorms, and even the formation of high and low pressure systems. Understanding how these opposing forces interact and balance each other is crucial for the study of weather and predicting future weather patterns. The author of the conversation, Michael Katsnelson, is a physicist, and it seems that he is using the idea of homeostasis in weather systems as an analogy to explain the emergence of complexity in physical systems, including magnetic patterns and the frustration that arises from competing interactions.
Ok, an excerpt from a blog, to see if it relates. Life is a Random Draw

It's all Karma

Life is a Random Draw
The Best is not Optimal
good fast cheapIt would be best if we had zero crime, or zero pollution, or zero inequality (of wealth, income, health, beauty, intelligence, lifespans), or zero transportation deaths, et cetera. That is, it would be best if we could obtain the best and not have to pay too much for it. But, alas, the real world refuses to comply with our wishes. For anything good that the real world grudgingly gives us, it exacts a cost.

To gain any benefit one has to pay a cost. The best may come at such a high price that it may not be worth it. How much of a good thing we actually end up having depends on a cost-benefit analysis. That particular amount of a desirable good for which the cost balances the benefit at the margin is the optimal amount of that good. The optimal amount is almost never at one or the other extreme of the case.

As an aside, the Buddha recognized this universal truth and advised against extremes. He preached moderation in everything, and therefore Buddhism is known as the ���Middle-wayed Way.��� I think that the Buddha would have made a pretty good economist. He thought at the margin.

The marginal revolution in economics was a breakthrough in our understanding of how the world of living beings works and how. Darwinian evolution implements marginal strategies because they are optimal. Nature avoids extremes. It appears to be following the Middle-wayed Way of the Buddha. Nature makes the eye just good enough to get the job done. Making the eye better would not be worth the extra cost. Nature keeps an organism around just long enough for it to reproduce ��� and then lets it die.
The excerpt from the blog post is discussing the idea that in life and in the world, there is a balance between the benefits and costs of different things. The author argues that it would be best if we could have the best of everything without having to pay too much for it, but the reality is that the world is not compliant to our wishes. The author states that to gain any benefit, one has to pay a cost, and the best may come at such a high price that it may not be worth it. He suggests that the optimal amount of any good is the point at which the cost balances the benefit. He also points out that the Buddha recognized this universal truth and advised against extremes and that Darwinian evolution implements marginal strategies because they are optimal. Nature avoids extremes, makes the eye just good enough to get the job done, and keeps an organism around just long enough for it to reproduce ��� and then lets it die.
This idea relates to the conversation about "frustrations" in the sense that the author is suggesting that in the real world, there are always trade-offs and that the optimal solution is often found at the point where the costs and benefits balance. The idea of nature avoiding extremes and following a middle-wayed way is similar to the author's suggestion that nature forms complex patterns as a result of the competition between different interactions, which leads to the emergence of optimal solutions.
The author of the blog post: Atanu Dey received his PhD in economics from University of California at Berkeley. He is an alumnus of IIT Kanpur and Rutgers University (computer science), and of Nagpur University (mechanical engineering.)
2 / 2
That's correct, Atanu Dey is an economist who received his PhD in economics from the University of California at Berkeley, and also has educational background in computer science from Rutgers University, and mechanical engineering from Nagpur University. From the excerpt, it seems that he is drawing on his knowledge of economics and the concept of marginal analysis to explain the idea that in life and in the world, there is a balance between the benefits and costs of different things, and that the optimal solution is often found at the point where the costs and benefits balance. He also notes that this is similar to the idea in Buddhism of avoiding extremes and following a middle-wayed way, and how Darwinian evolution implements marginal strategies because they are optimal.
What's a "marginal strategy"?
A marginal strategy refers to a decision-making process where decisions are made based on the marginal benefit and marginal cost of a particular action. In economics, the concept of marginal analysis is used to evaluate the additional benefits and costs associated with an additional unit of a good or service. A marginal strategy is based on the idea that it is not always optimal to produce or consume large amounts of a good or service, but rather to find the optimal level where the marginal benefit of an additional unit equals the marginal cost of that unit. In the context of the blog post, the author is using the term "marginal strategy" to suggest that Darwinian evolution, like economics, also uses this principle of evaluating the costs and benefits of different actions to find the optimal solution.
What do you think the first author meant by, "Actually, disorder is not needed, frustrations are enough"?
The first author, Michael Katsnelson, is a physicist and material chemist, and in the conversation he is discussing the origin of complexity in physical systems, including magnetic patterns. In this context, the author is suggesting that the concept of "frustrations" can explain the emergence of complexity. He is stating that disorder is not needed, but that frustrations are enough to lead to the formation of complex patterns.
He is suggesting that the competition between different interactions in the system leads to the emergence of complex patterns, such as magnetic patterns. The competition between exchange interactions and magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, for example, leads to the formation of magnetic patterns. This can be seen as an attempt to restore a balance between the opposing forces and reduce the difference between them, similar to the balance between hot and cold fronts in weather systems.
By stating that "disorder is not needed, frustrations are enough", he is saying that it's not necessary to have a completely disordered system for the emergence of complexity, but that the frustration that arises from the competition between different interactions is sufficient to lead to the formation of complex patterns.
It sounds like Prigogine's idea of emerging structure from chaos, and the theme if mark Wilson's book "physics avoidance" which discusses the use of multiscale methods to resolve ambiguities between different observation scales, average measurements, and modulated modular simplification in modeling.
Yes, the idea that the author is expressing in the conversation about "frustrations" leading to the emergence of complexity is similar to the idea of "emergence of structure from chaos" as proposed by the Belgian physicist and chemist, Ilya Prigogine. Prigogine was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977 for his work on non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which included the theory of dissipative structures and the concept of self-organization in far-from-equilibrium systems.
Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures proposed that in non-equilibrium systems, complex structures and patterns can emerge spontaneously as a result of the dissipation of energy. This is similar to the idea of "frustrations" leading to the emergence of complexity that the author is discussing, as both suggest that the release of energy and the dissipation of energy can lead to the formation of complex patterns.
In addition, the idea of "physics avoidance" that you mentioned, which is the use of multiscale methods to resolve ambiguities between different observation scales, average measurements, and modulated modular simplification in modeling, is also related to the concept of emergence of complexity from frustration. The multiscale methods used to resolve ambiguities in observations can be seen as a way to understand the complex patterns that emerge from the competition between different interactions in the system.
Thank you that was helpful. What about other authors discussing this topic?
There are many scientists and researchers who have studied the topic of complexity, emergence, and self-organization in physical and biological systems. Here are a few notable examples:
Stuart Kauffman, an American theoretical biologist and complex systems researcher, is known for his work on the origin of life and the emergence of complexity in biological systems. He proposed the "order for free" hypothesis, which suggests that self-organizing systems can emerge from the interactions between simple components without the need for a central organizer.
Per Bak, a Danish physicist, is known for his work on self-organized criticality, which suggests that many natural phenomena, including earthquakes and sandpile formation, exhibit critical behavior.
John Holland, an American computer scientist and complex systems researcher, is known for his work on genetic algorithms and the concept of "complex adaptive systems". He proposed the idea that complex systems can be modeled as a collection of simple agents that interact and adapt to their environment.
Murray Gell-Mann, an American physicist and Nobel laureate, is known for his work on the theory of quarks and the concept of "effective complexity", which suggests that the complexity of a system can be understood in terms of the number of independent degrees of freedom or "effective variables" that are required to describe its behavior.
These researchers have made significant contributions to the understanding of complexity, emergence, and self-organization in physical and biological systems and have developed a range of theoretical frameworks, mathematical models, and computational methods to study these phenomena.
Nice. The title of one of those reminded me of Theorems for Free, an article from the 80's I think on abstract algebra and type theory, do you know about it?
I am not familiar with a specific article called "Theorems for Free" that applies to abstract algebra and type theory specifically, but the phrase "theorems for free" is related to the concept of "free objects" in mathematics and logic.
In abstract algebra, a free object is an algebraic structure that can be generated by a set of elements, called generators, subject to a set of relations, called relations. A free group for example is a group that can be generated by a set of elements with no relations between them. In other words, the elements of the free group can be combined in any way, as long as the group axioms are satisfied.
In type theory, a free type is a type that can be generated by a set of type variables subject to a set of type equations. A free type is also known as a "polymorphic" type, which can take any type as an argument.
The idea of "free" in those cases is related to the idea of "independence", in the sense that the elements of a free object can be combined in any way without any restriction, similarly to the idea of "order for free" that Kauffman suggested in his work, as I mentioned earlier.
Maybe I didn't classify it correctly. Here is an excerpt from a website explain which article I mean: I���ve been reading through Wadler���s classic paper ���Theorems for Free���.

The thesis of the paper is that given a most-general (taking as few constraints on its values as possible) polymorphic type signature, we can generate for free a theorem to which any inhabitant of such a type must adhere.

Translating into familiar Haskell notation, Wadler gives the following example:

r :: [x] -> [x]
From this, as we shall see, it is possible to conclude that r satisfies the following theorem: for all types a and b and every total function f : a -> b we have:

map f . r = r . map f
He explains:

The intuitive explanation of this result is that r must work on lists of x for any type x. Since r is provided with no operations on values of type x, all it can do is rearrange such lists, independent of the values contained in them. Thus applying a to each element of a list and then rearranging yields the same result as rearranging and then applying f to each element.

This passage is somewhat misleading: r above is not restricted only to rearrangements, r can also structurally manipulate the list; for example, it can duplicate the first element and drop the middle three if it so pleases.

Wadler continues, with what might be one of the greatest lines in an academic paper:

This theorem about functions of type [x] -> [x] is pleasant but not earth-shaking. What is more exciting is that a similar theorem can be derived for every type.

���Exciting��� isn���t exactly the word I���d use, but I���d certainly settle for ���neat���! What I do find exciting, however, is that Wadler makes the claim that these theorems can be derived not only for Hindley-Milner type systems, but also for System-F. Hindley-Milner is Haskell98���s everyday type system; System-F is what you get when you turn on RankNTypes too
Yes, "Theorems for Free" is a research paper by Philip Wadler, a computer scientist and a prominent researcher in the field of programming languages and type systems. The paper was published in 1989 and it presents a technique for automatically deriving theorems about polymorphic functions, using type inference.
The main idea of the paper is that given a most general polymorphic type signature, we can generate a theorem that any inhabitant of such a type must adhere to. In other words, by analyzing the type of a function, we can infer properties about its behavior without the need to examine its implementation.
Wadler gives the example of a function "r" with the type signature [x] -> [x], which can be used to rearrange a list of elements of any type "x". From this type signature, it is possible to conclude that "r" must satisfy the theorem that "map f . r = r . map f", for any function "f" that takes an element of type "a" and returns an element of type "b".
The paper also explains that this technique can be applied to any type system that is based on Hindley-Milner or System-F type systems, which are both well-known type systems used in programming languages. The paper is considered a classic in the field of programming languages, and its ideas and techniques are still widely used and studied today.
Is that related to what you were telling me about "free objects"?
Yes, the concept of "theorems for free" in Wadler's paper is closely related to the concept of "free objects" in mathematics and logic. Both concepts deal with the idea of inferring properties about a system or an object based on its structure or type, without the need to examine its implementation or specific values.
In Wadler's paper, the type of a function serves as a constraint on its behavior, and from this constraint, we can infer properties about the function's behavior without the need to examine its implementation. Similarly, in abstract algebra and logic, the structure or type of an object serves as a constraint on its behavior, and from this constraint, we can infer properties about the object's behavior without the need to examine its specific values.
In other words, the idea of "free" in both cases is related to the idea of "independence", in the sense that the properties of a free object or a polymorphic function can be inferred without the need to examine its specific values, similarly to the idea of "order for free" that Kauffman suggested in his work.
Wow, I am digging it. What about its relation to the Curry-Howard correspondence, and the phrase "proofs are programs..."?
The Curry-Howard correspondence is a relationship between mathematical logic and programming languages, which states that proofs in logic correspond to programs in programming languages and vice versa. The basic idea is that the structure of a proof and the structure of a program are similar, and that the process of constructing a proof and the process of constructing a program are also similar.
The phrase "proofs are programs" is often used to describe this correspondence, as it highlights the idea that a proof in logic can be seen as a program that demonstrates the correctness of a logical statement, and that a program in a programming language can be seen as a proof that demonstrates the correctness of a computation.
Wadler's paper "Theorems for Free" is closely related to the Curry-Howard correspondence, as it deals with the idea of inferring properties about a system based on its structure, which is also the main idea behind the Curry-Howard correspondence. The technique presented in the paper can be seen as a way of constructing a program (or a proof) from a type, and the properties inferred from the type can be seen as theorems (or properties) that the program (or the proof) must satisfy.
In conclusion, the Curry-Howard correspondence and the "proofs are programs" idea is related to the concept of "free object" and "Theorems for free" in the sense that they all deal with the idea of inferring properties about a system based on its structure, and the process of constructing a proof or program is similar.
"...and programs are proofs."
Yes, that's correct. The idea of the Curry-Howard correspondence is that proofs in logic correspond to programs in programming languages and vice versa. So, it's often phrased as "proofs are programs and programs are proofs" to emphasize that the relationship is a two-way correspondence.
In other words, just as a proof in logic demonstrates the correctness of a logical statement, a program in a programming language demonstrates the correctness of a computation. And just as a program in a programming language can be seen as a proof that demonstrates the correctness of a computation, a proof in logic can be seen as a program that demonstrates the correctness of a logical statement.
I used the title in a recent blog post on a slightly different subject, see if you can find a connection. Theorems for free!

The purpose of childhood is education.

Natural selection created children with the characteristics that they can educate themselves provided we allow them do so.

The thesis for this talk is that children come into this world biologically designed to educate themselves. 

We don't need to educate children, what we need to do is to provide the conditions that allow them to educate themselves.

If we provide children with the opportunities that allow them use their natural ways of learning, they will educate themselves very well, in fact they'll educate themselves better than we would educate them in our schools.

��� Peter Gray, The Biology of Education and the Obsolescence of School
The connection between the blog post and the paper "Theorems for Free" is that both of them are discussing the idea of inferring properties or conclusions based on the structure of a system.
In "Theorems for Free," the author argues that given a most-general polymorphic type signature, we can generate a theorem that any inhabitant of such a type must adhere to. The idea is that by understanding the structure of a system (in this case, a type), we can infer properties or conclusions about it without needing additional information.
In the blog post, the author argues that the purpose of childhood is education and that children are biologically designed to educate themselves. The idea is that by understanding the structure of a child (in this case, their natural ways of learning), we can provide the conditions that allow them to educate themselves without needing to directly educate them ourselves.
In both cases, the authors are suggesting that by understanding the structure of a system, we can infer properties or conclusions about it without needing additional information.
Ok, I think that is pretty much correct, but what I meant is similar to the architectural theory of interactive spaces called "Loose Tools", what you said reminded me of the linguistic concept of monotonically increasing graduations of phonological and lexical developments, known as "markedness", that is that across languages certain sounds are acquired first. Such as ma ma BA BA da da ta ta, before words like like "thick", "through", and "orthoganal". It's called markedness because if you hear a speaker using the phoneme "th" properly you can assume they already have the phoneme t or d. Similarly if you hear someone use the word orthogonal, you assume they already know "direct" or "straight". I think this might be called "order of acquisition".
Yes, that's correct. The theory of "Loose Tools" in architectural theory is similar to the concept of "markedness" in linguistic theory in that both of them are concerned with the idea of building or acquiring complex systems or structures by starting with simpler components or building blocks.
In the case of "Loose Tools" in architectural theory, the idea is that by providing basic building blocks or loose components, users can create and adapt their own spaces in a way that is responsive to their needs and preferences.
In the case of "markedness" in linguistic theory, the idea is that certain sounds or words are acquired first and that these simpler building blocks or components can be used to infer the presence of more complex sounds or words.
In both cases, the underlying principle is that by starting with simple building blocks or components, we can create or acquire more complex systems or structures.
Here is an section from a recent article on the subject: Markedness and implicational relationships in phonological development: A cross-linguistic investigation

Erica Watts, Ph.D. and Yvan Rose, Ph.D.



The complexity approach to speech disorders, based on the theoretical notion of phonological markedness, has been gaining interest over the last decade (Baker & Williams, 2010; Pe��a-Brooks & Hedge, 2015). From the perspective of phonological development, this approach holds that the acquisition of phonologically complex, or marked, sounds or structures (e.g. complex onsets) implies the acquisition of less marked sounds or structures (e.g. singleton onsets). Likewise, in the area of clinical phonology, this approach suggests that a focus on more complex linguistic stimuli helps promote generalization to untreated but related targets which are considered less complex, or ���unmarked.��� For example, on the ���Speech Sound Disorders��� web page of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) website, approaches based on these types of implications are listed under both Target Selection and Treatment Options:1

Complexity���focuses on more complex, linguistically marked phonological elements not in the child���s phonological system to encourage cascading, generalized learning of sounds

(Gierut, 2007; Storkel, 2018).

Central to the complexity approach is the notion of markedness which, as in the quote above, tends to be used interchangeably with different notions of phonological complexity. While markedness is central to numerous studies of phonology based on typological universals, in the tradition of Jakobson (1941) and Chomsky & Halle (1968, chap. 9), this notion also suffers from degrees of vagueness, especially concerning how it should be generalized across languages.

Markedness refers to the idea that certain sounds, structures or grammatical forms in a language are considered more complex or "marked" than others. This concept is often used in the study of phonological development and speech disorders, as the ability to produce or understand marked sounds or structures implies the mastery of less marked or simpler ones. The complexity approach to speech disorders is based on this idea, and suggests that by focusing on more complex, marked sounds, generalization to related, less complex sounds will occur. Markedness is also a central concept in typological universals, which is the study of common patterns across languages, and is used to explain why certain sounds, structures or forms are acquired before others in child language development.

These characterizations of the marked/unmarked dichotomy are
drawn from many sources, from Jackobson (1941/1968 ) and Trubetzkoy
(1939/1969) through current linguistic dictionaries (e.g. Trask 1996,
Crystal 2003, encyclopedia articles (Kean 1992).
Markedness Terms (Rice, 2007:81)
The concept of markedness refers to a linguistic theory that describes the relative naturalness, simplicity, and commonness of different linguistic features or structures. Unmarked features are considered to be more natural, simpler, more general, and more common than marked features. They are also expected, basic, stable, and appear in more grammars. They tend to be acquired earlier in language acquisition and are lost later in language deficits. Unmarked features also imply other, marked features and are easier to articulate and perceptually less salient. They also have a larger phonetic space and tend to be the result of neutralization. On the other hand, marked features are considered to be less natural, more complex, more specific, and less common. They are unexpected, not basic, less stable, and appear in fewer grammars. They tend to be acquired later in language acquisition and are lost earlier in language deficits. Marked features also imply other, unmarked features and are harder to articulate and perceptually more salient. They also have a smaller phonetic space and are subject to neutralization.
Explain how this concept could be used to determine age estimates of speakers, vocabulary level, and video game knowledge, by sampling and testing from each level or grade, and so can get an estimate of someone's vocabulary size, competence, and expertise, similar to an SAT test, but without having to check if they know every single word in that grade or category.
The concept of markedness can be used to estimate a speaker's age, vocabulary level, and knowledge of a specific topic such as video games, by analyzing their use of marked and unmarked linguistic features. Marked linguistic features are typically considered less natural, more complex, less common, and harder to articulate, while unmarked features are considered more natural, simpler, more common, and easier to articulate. By analyzing a speaker's use of these features, it is possible to estimate their level of expertise or competence in a specific area.
For example, to estimate a speaker's age, one might analyze their use of certain grammatical structures or vocabulary that are typically acquired at different stages of development. For instance, a speaker who consistently uses complex grammatical structures or advanced vocabulary would likely be considered older or more highly educated than a speaker who primarily uses simpler grammar or more basic vocabulary. Similarly, to estimate a speaker's vocabulary level, one might analyze their use of words that are considered more advanced or less common, as opposed to words that are considered more basic or more common.
In the case of video game knowledge, one might analyze a speaker's use of gaming-specific terminology, such as jargon and technical terms. A speaker who is more knowledgeable about video games would be expected to use more of these marked terms, while a speaker who is less knowledgeable would be expected to use fewer or none at all.
In summary, the concept of markedness can be used to estimate a speaker's age, vocabulary level, and knowledge of a specific topic such as video games, by analyzing their use of marked and unmarked linguistic features. This can be done by sampling and testing from each level or grade, and then using that data to get an estimate of someone's vocabulary size, competence, and expertise.
Ok give me a list, maybe give words in each grade for a vocabulary test with grade levels Preschool, Elementary, Janitor, Catchumen, Acolyte, and   necromancer -- the last category denotes super human ability such a dozen archaic or extinct languages and the ability to coin novel words in suprising situations. Janitor corresponds to junior high, Catchumen to high school completion, and acolyte to a university graduate.
Here is an example of a list of words for each category for a vocabulary test:
Preschool:
Cat
Dog
Ball
Sun
Moon
Car
House
Elementary:
Elephant
Giraffe
Lion
Tiger
Monkey
Zebra
Jungle
Janitor:
Conundrum
Phenomenon
Synchronize
Impeccable
Persistence
Inconsistency
Perseverance
Catchumen:
Ameliorate
Conjecture
Esoteric
Ingenuity
Mitigate
Prodigal
Sagacity
Acolyte:
Abrogate
Conundrum
Disabuse
Enervate
Ineffable
Paean
Pernicious
Necromancer:
Apotheosis
Conflagration
Disquisition
Ensconce
Ineluctable
Peccadillo
Perfidy
It's worth noting that this list is just an example and the actual words and level of difficulty might vary depending on the test creator and the population being tested. Also, the categories and the names of the categories are used for demonstration purposes and may not align with other vocabulary tests.
Yeah I think I just came up with the system now. What you just did is quite eXtraordinaryraordinary.
I'm glad that I could help you! Here is a sample list of words for each vocabulary test level:
Preschool: cat, dog, ball, apple, car, moon, sun, mom, dad
Elementary: bicycle, teacher, pencil, paper, book, flower, butterfly, grass, tree
Janitor: janitor, custodian, maintenance, repair, equipment, schedule, budget, supervisor, inventory
Catchumen: conundrum, enigma, anomaly, dichotomy, paradox, quandary, concomitant, aberration, aberrant
Acolyte: acolyte, ordination, sacerdotal, liturgical, ecclesiastical, canonical, sacrosanct, episcopal, apostolic
Necromancer: necromancer, incantation, invocation, evocation, divination, augury, portent, haruspex, necromancy
Note that this list is not exhaustive, and it is not meant to be a definitive vocabulary test, it's just an example of the words that could be used in each level.
Either
way, the concept of markedness can be used to create a vocabulary test that assesses a person's level of language competence by testing their knowledge of words that are considered to be more or less marked within a certain grade level or category. The test would be designed to measure a person's proficiency in words that are considered to be more basic, simpler, and more common within a certain grade level or category, as well as words that are considered to be more complex, specific, and less common.
For example, for the preschool level, words like "dog", "cat", "ball", "book", "mom", "dad" would be considered basic and common, while for the Elementary level, words like "diligent", "enigma", "perplexed" would be considered more complex and specific. For the Janitor level, words like "indictment", "perfunctory", "ostensible" would be considered more complex and specific. For the Catchumen level, words like "abrogate", "circumlocution" and "disenfranchise" would be considered more complex and specific.
For the Acolyte level, words like "antebellum", "exegesis", "peripeteia" would be considered more complex and specific. And for the Necromancer level, words like "archaism", "neologism", "allegory" would be considered as super human level words.
It should be noted that this is just an example and that actual test would need to be created and validated by experts in the field of linguistics and vocabulary acquisition.
I like it. Explain "haruspex" and "peripeteia".
A haruspex is a person in ancient Roman religion who was trained to read the entrails of sacrificed animals, especially the liver, in order to predict the future. It was a form of divination known as haruspicy.
Peripeteia is a term used in literature and drama to describe a sudden and unexpected reversal of circumstances or fortune. It can also refer to the moment of recognition or discovery in a story or play that leads to this reversal of fortune. The term comes from the Greek word "peripeteia" which means "a turning about" or "reversal." In storytelling, peripeteia is often used as a plot device to create tension and suspense.
Nice. I call it "hepatomancy" . In a world without mirrors, one can gaze upon is glazy surface and glimpse the past and future, in a pareidolic hallucination, similar to reading tea leaves, I think this is somewhat related to the theory of Loose Tools and the idea of using Model-Free methods holistically.
"Haruspex" is a term used in ancient Roman religion to describe a person who was trained to examine the entrails of sacrificed animals, in order to predict future events or divine the will of the gods. This practice, known as hepatoscopy, was believed to provide insight into matters such as crop yields, military success, and the outcome of political decisions.
"Peripeteia" is a term used in literature and drama to describe a sudden reversal of fortune or a turning point in the plot. This term is often used to describe a character's realization that their circumstances have changed dramatically and they must now adapt to a new reality. The term is derived from the Greek word peripiptein, which means "to fall around."
It kind of reminds me of this quote: Permutatude

Adjust to the Great Evolutionary Forces of Change or be Destroyed in the Upheavals

��� Gayil Nalls
"Permutatude" is not a word that is commonly used or has a specific meaning. It could be a coined word or a misspelling of "permutations" which refers to the different ways that a set of elements can be arranged or combined. The quote you provided is likely referencing the idea that in order to survive and adapt to change, one must be willing to adjust and adapt to the forces of evolution, rather than being resistant to change and facing destruction. The word "upheavals" implies sudden and dramatic changes, which can be difficult to cope with. The quote encourages adaptability and flexibility in the face of change.
Permutatude theory is an ongoing conceptual framework for exploring mass collective psychology and global social evolution as developed by interdisciplinary artist and theorist, Gayil Nalls. Permutatude identifies information and communication technologies (ICTs) as a medium for exponentially expanding human massing events and their meaning, and as a forum for collective actions, increasing the potential for rapid change to social systems.
Permutatude theory posits that the increasing interconnectedness and interdependence of global society through ICTs are leading to a new stage of human evolution, characterized by the ability to rapidly adapt and change in response to shifting conditions. This ability to adapt is seen as crucial for survival in an era of rapid global change and uncertainty. The theory emphasizes the importance of collective action and the role of ICTs in facilitating this action, as well as the potential for individuals and groups to harness the power of these technologies to drive positive social change.
