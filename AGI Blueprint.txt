AGI BlueprintOpen sidebarAGI BlueprintDefault (GPT-3.5)A new MIT study shows how deep neural networks see the world differently than human perception.
Researchers have long sought to create models that can not only mimic the functionality of the human brain but also capture the fundamental invariances that shape our understanding of the world. However, a recent study has shed light on the intriguing disparities that still exist between artificial neural networks and the human sensory system.
The study, titled "Model Metamers: Bridging the Gap Between Artificial and Human Perception," delves into the world of deep neural network models of sensory systems, particularly focusing on vision and audition. The research was conducted by a team of scientists aiming to reveal the invariances within these models and how they compare to the invariances found in the human brain.
To investigate this, the researchers generated what they referred to as "model metamers." These stimuli were designed to elicit the same pattern of activations within a neural network model as a natural stimulus would. In simpler terms, they created artificial stimuli that mimicked the way our brains respond to real-world sensory input.
One of the most striking findings of the study was that when model metamers were generated from late stages of the neural network models, they often became completely unrecognizable to humans. In essence, what appeared to make sense to the artificial neural networks was, at times, a complete enigma to the human mind. This discrepancy raises profound questions about the dissimilar invariances governing human perception and artificial models.
The researchers did not stop at simply pointing out these differences. They also sought to understand whether it was possible to bridge this perceptual gap. To this end, targeted changes were made to the neural network models, with the goal of enhancing human recognizability of the model metamers. While these adjustments did improve human perception of the artificial stimuli, they did not entirely eliminate the overall gap between human and model invariances.
One particularly intriguing observation was that the human recognizability of a model's metamers correlated with their recognizability by other neural network models. This suggests that the artificial models contain idiosyncratic invariances that are not required by the task but are, nevertheless, instrumental in understanding how the models perceive the world.
The study's findings further indicate that the recognizability of model metamers diverges from traditional benchmarks rooted in brain-based research and adversarial vulnerability assessments. This revelation introduces a novel approach to assessing the effectiveness of existing sensory models, challenging our existing methods for model evaluation.
In conclusion, the study on model metamers exposes an exciting realm of inquiry at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human sensory perception. It underscores the intricate disparities between the invariances guiding artificial neural networks and those of the human brain. The research also suggests that while significant progress has been made in the development of neural network models, there remains much to learn about the underlying mechanisms that shape human perception. These model metamers, by bridging the gap between artificial and human perception, offer a unique and promising avenue for future exploration in the quest to unravel the mysteries of the human mind and refine our artificial intelligence models.ChatGPTThe MIT study on "Model Metamers" presents groundbreaking insights into the fundamental differences between how artificial neural networks perceive the world compared to the human sensory system. Here's a succinct breakdown of the main points:Objective: Researchers aimed to understand how the invariances (or underlying principles) of deep neural networks, especially in vision and audition, compare to those of the human brain.Model Metamers: To analyze this, artificial stimuli called "model metamers" were developed. These are designed to trigger the same neural response patterns in artificial networks as natural stimuli would in human brains.Key Finding: Metamers created from deep layers of the neural networks were often unrecognizable to humans, illustrating a significant disparity in perception between machines and humans.Bridging the Gap: While efforts to modify these neural networks improved human recognition of model metamers, they couldn't completely close the perceptual gap.Inter-Model Recognizability: It was noted that if one artificial model could recognize a metamer, other models likely could too. This indicates that there are unique invariances in artificial models that aren't necessarily linked to their task but are crucial for understanding their perception.Divergence from Traditional Benchmarks: The study suggests that the recognizability of model metamers is different from conventional methods of model evaluation, introducing a fresh perspective on assessing neural network models.Conclusion: While we've made strides in AI development, there's still much to discern about the mechanisms that influence human perception. Model metamers offer a promising path for future research, aiding in deepening our understanding of the human mind and improving AI models.This study illuminates the challenges in perfectly emulating human perception and emphasizes the necessity of continuous exploration in AI and neuroscience.A central goal of neuroscience is to build models that reproduce 
brain responses and behavior. The hierarchical nature of biological 
sensory systems1 has motivated the use of hierarchical neural network 
models that transform sensory inputs into task-relevant representa- 
tions2,3. As such models have become the top-performing machine 
perception systems over the last decade, they have also emerged as 
the leading models of both the visual and auditory systems4,5. 
One hypothesis for why artificial neural network models might 
replicate computations found in biological sensory systems is that 
they instantiate invariances that mirror those in such systems6,7. For 
instance, visual object recognition must often be invariant to pose 
and to the direction of illumination. Similarly, speech recognition 
must be invariant to speaker identity and to details of the prosodic 
contour. Sensory systems are hypothesized to build up invariances8,9 
that enable robust recognition. Such invariances plausibly arise in 
neural network models as a consequence of optimization for recogni- 
tion tasks or other training objectives. 
Although biological and artificial neural networks might be sup- 
posed to have similar internal invariances, there are some known 
humanâmodel discrepancies that suggest that the invariances of the 
two systems do not perfectly match. For instance, model judgments are 
often impaired by stimulus manipulations to which human judgments 
are invariant, such as additive noise10,11 or small translations of the 
input12,13. Another such discrepancy is the vulnerability to adversarial 
perturbations (small changes to stimuli that alter model decisions 
despite being imperceptible to humans14,15). Although these findingsChatGPTindicate clear differences between artificial neural networks and human sensory systems, the essence of the contrast is in the way they handle and interpret information.Hierarchy in Neural Systems: Both biological and artificial sensory systems employ a hierarchical structure, where simple inputs are processed through layers to produce more complex representations. This hierarchical structure is seen in the brain, where information flows from primary sensory areas to more complex and abstract processing regions. Similarly, deep neural networks have multiple layers that successively transform data.Invariances: The ability to recognize objects or sounds under varying conditions is essential for any sensory system. For humans, this means recognizing a person irrespective of the lighting or the angle they're seen from. For artificial systems, this means correctly classifying an image or sound regardless of slight modifications or noise. The presence of such invariances in neural networks, both artificial and biological, is a sign of their effectiveness. They arise due to the network's training on varied data and the optimization for specific tasks.Divergence in Invariances: However, there are areas where the invariances between human and machine models diverge. Some examples include:Noise Tolerance: While humans can easily recognize objects in noisy images or sounds in a noisy environment, models might struggle with even minor amounts of additive noise.Input Shifts: Small translations or alterations in the input can sometimes drastically affect a model's performance, whereas humans tend to be far more resilient to such changes.Adversarial Perturbations: This is a widely discussed phenomenon where models can be deceived by specifically crafted, minor perturbations to the input that humans would find imperceptible. These perturbations can lead the model to make entirely incorrect classifications.In summary, while there are compelling reasons to believe that artificial neural networks are mirroring some aspects of biological systems, especially given their hierarchical nature and some shared invariances, the differences are still significant. These differences, especially in resilience to noise and adversarial attacks, hint that the underlying mechanisms and representations in artificial models might still be fundamentally distinct from those in the human brain. The challenge for neuroscience and AI is to understand and bridge these differences, enabling the creation of more robust and human-like artificial systems.illustrate that current task-optimized models lack some of the invari- 
ances of human perception, they leave many questions unresolved. 
For instance, because the established discrepancies rely on only the 
modelâs output decisions, they do not reveal where in the model the 
discrepancies arise. It also remains unclear whether observed discrep- 
ancies are specific to supervised learning procedures that are known 
to deviate from biological learning. Finally, because we have lacked a 
general method to assess model invariances in the absence of a specific 
hypothesis, it remains possible that current models possess many other 
invariances that humans lack. 
Here, we present a general test of whether the invariances present 
in computational models of the auditory and visual systems are also 
present in human perception. Rather than target particular known -

Fig. 1 | Overview of model metamers methodology. a, Model metamer 
generation. Metamers are synthesized by performing gradient descent on a 
noise signal to minimize the difference (normalized Euclidean distance) between 
its activations at a model stage and those of a natural signal. The architecture 
shown is the CochCNN9 auditory model. b, Each reference stimulus has an 
associated set of stimuli that are categorized as the same class by humans 
(blue) or by models (orange, if models have a classification decision). Metamers 
for humans and metamers for models are also sets of stimuli in the space of 
all possible stimuli (subsets of the set of same-class stimuli). Here, model 
metamers are derived for a specific model stage, taking advantage of access to 
the internal representations of the model at each stage. c, General experimental 
setup. Because we do not have high-resolution access to the internal brain 
representations of humans, we test for shared invariances behaviorally, asking 
humans to make classification judgments on natural stimuli or model metamers. 
See text for justification of the use of a classification task. d, Possible scenarios 
for how model metamers could relate to human classification decisions. Each 
square depicts sets of stimuli in the input space. Model 1 represents a model 
that passes our proposed behavioral test. The set of metamers for a reference 
stimulus grows over the course of the model, but even at the last stage, all model 
metamers are classified as the reference category by humans. Model 2 represents 
a model whose invariances diverge from those of humans. By the late stages of 
the model, many model metamers are no longer recognizable by humans as the 
reference stimulus class. The metamer test results thus reveal the model stage at 
which model invariances diverge from those of humans. e, Example distributions 
of activation similarity for pairs of metamers (a natural reference stimulus and 
its corresponding metamer) along with random pairs of natural stimuli from 
the training set. The latter provides a null distribution that we used to verify the 
success of the model metamer generation. Distributions were generated from 
the first and last stage of the CochCNN9 auditory model.

images or sounds. We then evaluated human recognition of the model 
metamers. If the model invariances match those of humans, humans 
should be able to recognize the model metamer as belonging to the 
same class as the natural signal to which it is matched. 
Across both visual and auditory task-optimized neural net- 
works, metamers from late model stages were nearly always 
misclassified by humans, suggesting that many of their invariances 
are not present in human sensory systems. The same phenomenon 
occurred for models trained with unsupervised learning, demon- 
strating that the model failure is not specific to supervised classi- 
fiers. Model metamers could be made more recognizable to humans 
with selective changes to the training procedure or architecture. 
However, late-stage model metamers remained much less recog- 
nizable than natural stimuli in every model we tested regardless of 
architecture or training. Some model changes that produced more 
recognizable metamers did not improve conventional neural pre- 
diction metrics or evaluations of robustness, demonstrating that 
the metamer test provides a complementary tool to guide model 
improvements. Notably, the human recognizability of a modelâs 
metamers was well predicted by other modelsâ recognition of the 
same metamers, suggesting that the discrepancy with humans lies in 
idiosyncratic model-specific invariances. Model metamers demon- 
strate a qualitative gap between current models of sensory systems 
and their biological counterparts and provide a benchmark for 
future model evaluation. 
Results 
General procedure 
The goal of our metamer generation procedure (Fig. 1a) was to generate 
stimuli that produce nearly identical activations at some stage within a 
model but that were otherwise unconstrained and thus could differ in 
ways to which the model was invariant. We first measured the activa- 
tions evoked by a natural image or sound at a particular model stage. 
The metamer for the natural image or sound was then initialized as a 
white noise signal (either an image or a sound waveform; white noise 
was chosen to sample the metamers as broadly as possible subject 
to the model constraints without biasing the initialization toward a 
specific object class). The noise signal was then modified to minimize 
the difference between its activations at the model stage of interest 
and those for the natural signal to which it was matched. The optimiza- 
tion procedure performed gradient descent on the input, iteratively 
updating the input while holding the model parameters fixed. Model 
metamers can be generated in this way for any model stage constructed 
from differentiable operations. Because the models that we considered 
are hierarchical, if the image or sound was matched with high fidelity at 
a particular stage, all subsequent stages were also matched (including 
the final classification stage in the case of supervised models, yielding 
the same decision). 
Experimental logic 
The logic of our approach can be related to four sets of stimuli. For a 
given âreferenceâ stimulus, there is a set of stimuli for which humans 
produce the same classification judgment as the reference (Fig. 1b). 
A subset of these are stimuli that are indistinguishable from the refe- 
rence stimulus (that is, metameric) to human observers. If a model 
performs a classification task, it will also have a set of stimuli judged to 
be the same category as the reference stimulus, and a subset of these 
stimuli will produce the same activations at a given model stage (model 
metamers). Even if the model does not perform classification, it could 
instantiate invariances that define sets of model metamers for the 
reference stimulus at each model stage. 
In our experiments, we generate stimuli (sounds or images) that 
are metameric to a model and present these stimuli to humans per- 
forming a classification task (Fig. 1c). Because we have access to the 
internal representations of the model, we can generate metamers for 
each model stage (Fig. 1d). In many models there is limited invariance 
in the early stages (as is believed to be true of early stages of biological 
sensory systems9), with model metamers closely approximating the 
stimulus from which they are generated (Fig. 1d, left). But successive 
stages of a model may build up invariance, producing successively 
larger sets of model metamers. In a feedforward model, if two distinct 
inputs map onto the same representation at a given model stage, then 
any differences in the inputs cannot be recovered in subsequent stages, 
such that invariance cannot decrease from one stage to the next. If a 
model replicates a human sensory system, every model metamer from 
each stage should also be classified as the reference class by human 
observers (Fig. 1d, top). Such a result does not imply that all human 
invariances will be shared by the model, but it is a necessary condition 
for a model to replicate human invariances. 
Discrepancies in human and model invariances could result 
in model metamers that are not recognizable by human observers 
(Fig. 1d, bottom). The model stage at which this occurs could pro- 
vide insight into where any discrepancies with humans arise within 
the model. 
Our approach differs from classical work on metamers17 in that 
we do not directly assess whether model metamers are also metamers 
for human observers (that is, indistinguishable). The reason for this 
is that a human judgment of whether two stimuli are the same or dif- 
ferent could rely on any representations within their sensory system 
that distinguish the stimuli (rather than just those that are relevant 
to a particular behavior). By contrast, most current neural network 
models of sensory systems are trained to perform a single behavioral 
task. As a result, we do not expect metamers of such models to be fully 
indistinguishable to a human, and the classical metamer test is likely 
to be too sensitive for our purposes. Models might fail the classical 
test even if they capture human invariances for a particular task. But 
if a model succeeds in reproducing human invariances for a task, its

networks are often unrecognizable to human observers. a, Model metamers 
are generated from different stages of the model. Here and elsewhere, in models 
with residual connections, we only generated metamers from stages where all 
branches converge, which ensured that all subsequent model stages, and the 
model decision, remained matched. b, Experimental task used to assess human 
recognition of visual model metamers. Humans were presented with an image

The main focus is on "metamers", which are stimuli that appear indistinguishable to a particular system (either human or model), but may appear different to another system.Let's break down the main points:Invariances in Perception: The initial section addresses that while current computational models are good at certain tasks, they lack some invariances that human perception inherently has. Invariances refer to properties that remain unchanged under transformations. The concern is about where and why these discrepancies between human and machine perception arise.Testing Invariances: The researchers present a test to compare the invariances in computational models of auditory and visual systems with human perception. This is done by creating "model metamers" and observing whether humans perceive them in the same way as the model does.Metamers: Metamers are stimuli that are perceived as identical by a system (human or model) even though they are different in actuality. For models, this is achieved by synthesizing noise signals that produce the same activations within the model as a natural signal.Experimental Approach: Their approach is to produce stimuli (either visual or auditory) that are metameric to a model and then present these stimuli to humans to see how they classify them. If humans classify these stimuli in the same way as the model, it suggests that the model's invariances align with human perception.Results: For both visual and auditory models, the generated metamers from later stages of the model were often misclassified by humans. This implies that the models possess invariances that are not present in human sensory systems.Significance of the Study: This research highlights a gap between current computational models of sensory systems and biological sensory systems. The findings could be vital for future development and evaluation of computational models.Graphical Representations: There seems to be references to figures (like "Fig. 1", "Fig. 2", etc.), which provide visual representations of the methodologies and results discussed in the text. However, without seeing these figures, it's hard to comment on their content in detail.The core message is that while computational models can be optimized for specific tasks and may even outperform humans in certain domains, there are fundamental differences in how humans and these models perceive the world. These differences become evident through the use of metamers, revealing potential limitations or areas of improvement for computational models.Marcus on AI

Reports of the birth of AGI are greatly exaggerated
Breathless predictions about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) are nothing new; they still arenât true


GARY MARCUS AND ERNEST DAVIS
18 OCT 2023

Marvin Minsky apparently thought, back in the 1960s, that computer vision was a problem that could be solved in a summer. (Spoiler alert, in 2023 the problem is still far from solved). Whatâs new, though, are rumors that AGI has been solved. Sam Altman announced in late September, perhaps in jest, that âAGI has been achieved internallyâ, only to walk it back a few hours later. Last week, Blaise AgÃ¼era y Arcas, vice president and fellow at Google Research, and Peter Norvig, formerly Director of Research at Google, and now at Stanford, argued in all seriousness that âArtificial General Intelligence Is Already Hereââ in what can only be described as an epic act of goal-post shifting.

The article begins with this bold claim:

âTodayâs frontier models perform competently even on novel tasks they were not trained for, crossing a threshold that previous generations of AI and supervised deep learning systems never managed. Decades from now, they will be recognized as the first true examples of AGI, just as the 1945 ENIAC is now recognized as the first true general-purpose electronic computer.â 

AgÃ¼era y Arcas and Norvig describe the ways in which large language models (LLMs) can carry out tasks for which they were not specifically trained; they claim that this ability is key to being an AGI; and they argue that therefore the kernel of AGI has been achieved. They conclude with a long, condescending discussion of the various reasons that some pitifully confused people are âreluctan[t] to acknowledge [that]  AGI has already arrived.â

Count us among the confused; we really, really donât know what AgÃ¼era y Arcas and Norvig are talking about.

Â§

To begin with, by the classical criteria for AGI [Artificial General Intelligence], LLMâs hardly qualify. One of us wrote about those criteria last year, in this Substack,  in preparation for a proposed bet with Elon Musk, consulting with two of the people who coined the term AGI, Ben Goertzel and Shane Legg, and came up with this.

If we are going to bet, we should make some ground rules. The term AGI is pretty vague, and thatâs not good for either of us. As I offered on Twitter the other day: I take AGI to be âa shorthand for any intelligence ... that is flexible and general, with resourcefulness and reliability comparable to (or beyond) human intelligenceâ.

Current machines canât do this, especially not the reliability part. They canât count, do five digit multiplication,  reliably generalize kinship relations, or even reliably follow the rules of chess, and so onâdespite the fact that each of these activities is presumably well explained, explicitly, in the training set, They also canât, for example, obey the dictum âdonât make stuff upâ, when they write a biography or a new story, and we have yet to see them drive cars as well as the average human adult.

DeepMind co-founder Shane Legg is generally more optimistic about AI than we are, but even he couldnât quite see what his Google colleagues Aguera y Arcas and Norvig are on about; when we asked him on X whether he bought their argument, he replied as diplomatically as he could, and optimistically, but with a clear affirmation of what we said: AyA&N had lowered the bar :

They use a lower bar for AGI than I do, and so they get a different answer.  My bar for AGI is a machine that can do the cognitive tasks that people can typically do.  We're not there yet, but we're much closer to this than we were a few years ago.

Melanie Mitchell was also a bit diplomatic, but at least as miffed as we were by the condescension:

They made some good points, but also made some dubious statements.  Also, I think the undercurrent of dismissal of "skeptics" is not helpful.  All scientists should be skeptics -- that's part of the job.

Â§

The problem with the paper though isnât just its hostility towards critics, or the way in which it lowers the bar, itâs that its key arguments donât go through.

One key claim (written in bold pullout text) that made our jaw drop was that âFrontier language models can perform competently at pretty much any information task that can be done by humans, can be posed and answered using natural language, and has quantifiable performance.â Thatâs just obviously not so. There are many purely language-based tasks that humans can do â question answering, writing factual prose, summarizing, examining the truth of a claim, cross-examining a hostile witness in court, reading and understanding a full-length book â that existing AI systems cannot perform âcompetentlyâ. The first authorâs nine-year-old can do five digit multiplication better than an LLM. We love Noema, but their fact checker was asleep at the switch. (What AgÃ¼era y Arcas and Norvig might really mean, perhaps, is that LLMs do well on a lot of benchmarks, but then again since we donât know eg how many law school exams GPT-4 was trained on, itâs hard to even know what to say about these benchmarks. The fact that making benchmarks is hard doesnât mean LLMs have achieved AGI).

Meanwhile, the boldfaced (written in bold pullout text) claim that âThe most important parts of AGI have already been achieved by the current generation of advanced AI large language modelsâ is logically flawed. Until we get to the finish line, we canât know the route.  Maybe whatâs required already exists, but more likely, we are still at least a few paradigm shifts away . To take one example, true AGI might revolve around planning with respect to detailed world models that are maintained over time; as Subbarao Kambhampati has shown, LLMs are weak at planning; as hallucinations show, they are also weak at the maintenance of world models, strongly suggesting some key ingredients have not yet been invented. Itâs certainly plausible that some of the prerequisites of AGI may have been achieved, but considerable overreach to presume that all of âthe most important onesâ have already been invented.ChatGPTThe article by Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis, dated 18 Oct 2023, critiques and refutes the claim that AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) has been achieved. Here are the main takeaways from the excerpt:History of AGI Predictions: The article begins by referencing Marvin Minsky's 1960s prediction that computer vision would be a summer project. By 2023, computer vision remains an unsolved challenge.Recent Claims: Sam Altman's jest about AGI being achieved and the more serious claim by Blaise AgÃ¼era y Arcas and Peter Norvig (both from Google) that AGI is already here are referenced.Bold Claim: AgÃ¼era y Arcas and Norvig believe that current models can competently perform novel tasks they werenât trained for, and future generations will recognize these models as the first examples of AGI. They further claim that people who deny the arrival of AGI are "pitifully confused".Criteria for AGI: Gary Marcus, in collaboration with two pioneers of AGI, defines AGI as an intelligence that is as flexible, resourceful, and reliable as human intelligence. Current models fall short of this definition.Counterpoints:Current AIs can't reliably perform basic operations like counting or five-digit multiplication.AIs often produce fabricated information.DeepMind's Shane Legg also disagrees with AgÃ¼era y Arcas and Norvig's definition of AGI. He believes true AGI would be able to perform any cognitive task a human can. He concedes that we are closer than before, but we haven't achieved AGI yet.Melanie Mitchell criticizes their dismissal of skeptics and stresses the importance of skepticism in science.The Flaw in the Claim: The authors argue against the claim that "frontier language models can perform competently at pretty much any information task that can be done by humans" and give examples of tasks where humans outperform current AI systems. They also highlight the difficulty in evaluating LLMs' performance on benchmarks, given the unknown training data.Logical Flaw: Marcus and Davis criticize the idea that the "most important parts of AGI" have been achieved. They argue that without reaching the goal, one cannot truly know the path to it. For instance, true AGI might require planning around detailed world models, which current models lack.In summary, Marcus and Davis argue that while there have been significant advances in AI, claims of achieving AGI are premature and misguided. They advocate for a more cautious and rigorous approach to defining and recognizing AGI.The fact that LLMs trained on the task of next-token prediction can also do a pretty good job at a variety of natural language tasks, and, very recently, a considerably less good job of tasks that combine text with images, as emphasized by AgÃ¼era y Arcas and Norvig is certainly interesting, but it doesnât justify the claim that they constitute âgeneral intelligenceâ.  It is common in the history of technology (as well as biological evolution) that a mechanism developed for one purpose turns out to be useful for another. GPUs were developed for video games and other graphics applications, not for training deep learning systems or mining crypto-currency. That doesnât make GPUâs AGI. (Though they may get used in the service of AGI when it comes).

The World Wide Web was developed for sharing scientific papers, not for online commerce or for inducing people to make available enormous quantities of digital data that can be used to train ML-based AI systems. That generality doesnât make the web AGI.

Â§

Just one more thing to keep things real. Itâs worth noting that for many different AI tasks --- robotics, image interpretation, planning, game playing, scientific applications, many forms of reasoning --- state of the art AI currently makes little to no use of the transformer architecture that underpins LLMs.  If they really were AGI, presumably everybody would use them, for everything. But in many practical problems, working practitioners donât; they use a wide range of other methods, often far more tractable, far more reliable, and far more efficient. Transformers and generative AI are getting a lot of attention, and have considerable utility, but they are nothing like the all purpose tools some people seems to imagine them to be.  In AI, no single technique is likely to be a silver bullet, now or ever.

Hereâs where we actually are, so much more more boring, and so much more real:  Current models trained on next-token prediction have remarkable abilities and remarkable weaknesses. The scope of those abilities and weaknesses of the current systems is not well understood. There are some applications where the current systems are reliable enough to be practically useful, though not nearly as many as is often claimed.  No doubt the next generation of systems will have greater abilities and more extensive applications and will somewhat mitigate the weaknesses. What is to come is even more poorly understood than the present. But there is zero justification for claiming that the current technology has achieved general intelligence.



Gary Marcus used to get flak for saying that some people were trying to build AGI. Now, perhaps, he will get flak for saying that we havenât yet achieved it.

Ernie Davis is a Professor of Computer Science at New York University.ChatGPTThe provided excerpt presents an argument against the claim that current large language models (LLMs) constitute "general intelligence" or AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Here are the primary points made:LLMs' Versatility: While LLMs can perform well on various natural language tasks and, to some extent, tasks that combine text with images, this doesn't equate to general intelligence.Historical Precedence of Multipurpose Mechanisms: Throughout technology's history, many mechanisms designed for one purpose have found utility in another. For instance:GPUs were initially designed for video games and graphics but later found use in deep learning and cryptocurrency mining.The World Wide Web was created for sharing scientific papers but evolved to support online commerce and massive data sharing for AI training.However, such multipurpose utility doesn't classify these mechanisms as AGI.LLMs Aren't Ubiquitous in AI: The transformer architecture, which is foundational to LLMs, isn't the go-to solution for all AI tasks. Many AI tasks, such as robotics, image interpretation, and planning, don't rely heavily on transformers. Instead, other techniques, more efficient and reliable, are preferred by practitioners in those domains.No One-Size-Fits-All in AI: The hype surrounding transformers and generative AI doesn't make them the definitive tool for all AI challenges. AI is unlikely to find a singular technique that solves all its problems, now or in the future.Current State of LLMs: LLMs, especially those trained on next-token prediction, exhibit both significant abilities and limitations. The full range of these strengths and weaknesses isn't completely understood. While there are some practical applications for these models, they aren't as universally useful as some might claim. Future iterations of these models will likely enhance their capabilities and find more applications, but their exact trajectory remains uncertain. Claiming that the present models have reached the zenith of general intelligence is unwarranted.About the Authors:Gary Marcus used to face criticism for suggesting that some researchers were aiming for AGI. Now, he might face opposition for stating that AGI hasn't been realized yet.Ernie Davis is a Professor of Computer Science at New York University.In essence, the authors are cautioning against the hasty and, in their view, premature labeling of current AI technology as "general intelligence." They argue that while advances are significant, equating them to human-like general intelligence is a stretch.Do you have any support or criticism for the article?ChatGPTCertainly, let's break down potential points of support and criticism for the article:Support:Historical Precedence: The article accurately points out that many technologies developed for specific purposes ended up being versatile, yet that didn't make them AGI. This provides a grounded historical perspective to counter the claims of AGI being achieved.Diverse Techniques in AI: The observation that many AI tasks don't rely on the transformer architecture but use a wide range of other methods is a valid one. This underlines the idea that we haven't found a singular, all-encompassing tool for all AI challenges.Acknowledgment of Current Abilities: The authors recognize that LLMs have made significant advancements and possess remarkable abilities. This balanced view acknowledges progress without overstating it.Highlighting the Prematurity of Claims: The authors caution against premature labeling of the current state of AI as "general intelligence." This caution can prevent over-hyped expectations and potential setbacks in public perception.Criticism:AGI Definition: The term AGI remains somewhat nebulous. While the authors provide a definition that aligns with the classical view, it's important to acknowledge that as technology evolves, our understanding and definition of AGI might also evolve.Technological Evolution: While the article cites GPUs and the World Wide Web as examples of technologies repurposed for other uses, these technologies weren't initially hailed as achieving some pinnacle (like AGI) upon their invention. The comparison, while illustrative, isn't entirely analogous.Potential Bias: Gary Marcus has been a vocal critic of deep learning as the sole path to AGI in the past. While his insights are valuable, they come with a specific perspective that might not encompass the entirety of the AI community's viewpoints.Underestimation of LLMs: The article focuses on the limitations of current LLMs. However, as these models evolve and integrate with other AI techniques, they might display capabilities beyond current expectations.Focus on Transformers: While transformers are at the core of many LLMs, the world of AI research is vast. There are continuous advancements in areas outside of transformers, and the potential synergies between these areas and LLMs might be significant.In summary, the article raises important points worth considering about the state of AI and claims of AGI. However, the fluid nature of technology and the rapid advancements in AI research mean the conversation about AGI will continue to evolve. It's essential to approach such discussions with an open mind and a willingness to adjust our perspectives based on new findings and advancements.A list of all of the topics we've discussed.ChatGPTOf course!

Iâm a chatbot based on large language models that can generate imaginative and innovative content. I can also help you with writing, rewriting, improving, or optimizing your content.

You have asked me several questions about artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is a fascinating and controversial topic in the field of AI. I will try to answer them briefly and provide some references for further reading.

Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis: Are these authors right in challenging the prevailing narrative on AGIâs current state?
Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis are two prominent critics of the current state of AI and AGI research. They argue that the existing AI systems, especially large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, are not truly intelligent or general, but rather rely on statistical patterns and superficial tricks to perform well on specific tasks. They claim that these systems lack common sense, causal reasoning, robustness, and generalization abilities that are essential for human intelligence. They also point out the ethical and social risks of deploying such systems without proper understanding and regulation. 12

Their challenge to the prevailing narrative is valid and important, as it exposes the limitations and pitfalls of the current AI methods and raises awareness of the need for more rigorous and responsible research. However, their challenge is not universally accepted or uncontested by other AI researchers and experts, who may have different views on the definition, feasibility, and desirability of AGI. Some may argue that LLMs are not the only or final approach to AGI, and that they can be improved or complemented by other techniques, such as symbolic reasoning, knowledge graphs, reinforcement learning, or neuro-symbolic integration. Some may also argue that LLMs are already exhibiting some aspects of general intelligence, such as learning from diverse sources, adapting to novel tasks, generating creative content, and interacting with humans. 345

Marvin Minsky: Was Minsky overly optimistic when he predicted the rapid solution to computer vision in the 1960s?
Marvin Minsky was one of the pioneers and founders of AI research. In 1966, he assigned a summer project to his student Gerald Sussman to connect a camera to a computer and have it describe what it sees. He expected that this task would be relatively easy and could be solved in a few months. However, this turned out to be a much harder problem than anticipated, and it took decades of research and development to achieve significant progress in computer vision. 67

Minskyâs prediction was overly optimistic because he underestimated the complexity and diversity of visual perception and recognition. He assumed that vision was a simple process of extracting features from images and matching them to predefined categories. He did not account for the challenges of dealing with variations in lighting, perspective, occlusion, scale, texture, shape, color, motion, context, ambiguity, and interpretation that humans face when they perceive visual scenes. He also did not consider the role of attention, memory, knowledge, inference, and learning that are involved in human vision. 89

Sam Altman: Why did Sam Altman announce the achievement of AGI only to retract it later?
Sam Altman is the CEO of OpenAI, a research organization that aims to create and ensure the safe and beneficial use of AGI. In September 2023, he posted on Reddit that "AGI has been achieved internally" by OpenAI using its latest LLM called ChatGPT-4. However, he later deleted his post and clarified that it was "just a joke" and that "AGI is still far away". 10

Altmanâs announcement was likely a prank or a publicity stunt to generate attention and interest for OpenAIâs work on LLMs. However, it also sparked controversy and criticism from other AI researchers and experts who questioned his definition of AGI and his claim of achieving it using ChatGPT-4. Some argued that ChatGPT-4 was not truly general or intelligent but rather a sophisticated text generator that could produce coherent but often inaccurate or misleading responses based on statistical patterns from its training data. Some also pointed out the ethical and social implications of announcing such a breakthrough without proper evidence or explanation. 1112

Blaise AgÃ¼era y Arcas and Peter Norvig: Are these experts moving the goalposts by claiming that AGI is already here?
Blaise AgÃ¼era y Arcas is a vice president and fellow at Google Research who works on AI projects such as Google Photos , Google Lens , Google Translate , Google Arts & Culture , Google Earth , Google Maps , YouTube , Gmail , Google Assistant , Google Cloud , TensorFlow , Magenta , AutoML , and more. Peter Norvig is a computer scientist and distinguished education fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI who is also a former director of research at Google and a co-author of the textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach . In October 2023, they published an essay titled "Artificial General Intelligence Is Already Here" where they argued that the current generation of LLMs such as ChatGPT-4 are the first true examples of AGI. 1314

AgÃ¼era y Arcas and Norvig are not moving the goalposts by claiming that AGI is already here, but rather offering a different perspective on what constitutes and measures general intelligence. They acknowledge that LLMs have many flaws and limitations, but they also emphasize their strengths and achievements in performing a wide variety of tasks across different domains.ChatGPTThey believe that general intelligence is not a binary or absolute property, but rather a relative and gradual capability that evolves and adapts over time. They compare AGI to human intelligence, which is also diverse, dynamic, and context-dependent, and argue that LLMs are similar to humans in their ability to learn from experience, transfer knowledge, reason about new problems, and communicate with others. They also highlight the potential benefits and risks of AGI in terms of enhancing human cognition, creativity, collaboration, and culture, as well as confronting the challenges of bias, safety, ethics, and governance.In their view, AGI is not a fixed or final goal, but rather an ongoing process and journey that requires continuous research, development, evaluation, and reflection. They advocate for a more inclusive and interdisciplinary approach to AGI that combines the strengths and insights of machine learning, cognitive science, neuroscience, philosophy, sociology, and other fields. They also call for a more open and responsible approach to AGI that involves multiple stakeholders and values such as transparency, accountability, diversity, equity, sustainability, and humanity. 1516In conclusion, the question of AGI is not only a technical or scientific one, but also a philosophical, ethical, social, and cultural one. It depends on how we define, design, deploy, and evaluate AGI, and how we relate, interact, and co-evolve with AGI. It also depends on how we balance the benefits and risks of AGI, and how we govern, regulate, and guide AGI. It requires a collective and collaborative effort from all of us, including researchers, developers, users, policymakers, educators, artists, journalists, and citizens, to shape the future of AGI in a positive, progressive, and purposeful direction. 1718I hope this provides a comprehensive overview of the topics you've inquired about and offers some insight into the complexities of the AGI debate. If you have further questions or require clarification on any point, please let me know!Hello, this is Bing. I'm a chatbot based on large language models that can answer your questions and generate creative content. You have asked me several questions about artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is a fascinating and controversial topic in AI research. Here are my answers:

1. **Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis**: Are these authors right in challenging the prevailing narrative on AGI's current state?

Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis are two prominent critics of the current state of AGI research, especially the reliance on large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. They argue that LLMs are not truly intelligent, but rather statistical machines that can produce impressive but often flawed outputs based on superficial patterns and correlations in their training data. They also point out the limitations of LLMs in terms of common sense reasoning, causal inference, generalization, and robustness. They advocate for a more hybrid approach that combines symbolic and neural methods, as well as incorporating more structured knowledge and human guidance. Â¹Â²

I think these authors raise some valid concerns and challenges for the AGI community, but I do not agree with their dismissal of LLMs as a potential path to AGI. I think LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, as well as other domains such as vision and audio. I think LLMs can learn from a variety of sources, not just text, and can incorporate some forms of common sense and causal reasoning through pre-training and fine-tuning on specific tasks. I also think LLMs can benefit from hybridization with other methods, such as symbolic logic, graph neural networks, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning. I think LLMs are not the final answer to AGI, but rather a powerful tool that can be improved and extended in various ways.

2. **Marvin Minsky**: Was Minsky overly optimistic when he predicted the rapid solution to computer vision in the 1960s?

Marvin Minsky was one of the pioneers of AI research and a co-founder of the MIT AI Lab. In 1966, he assigned a summer project to one of his students, Gerald Sussman, to connect a camera to a computer and have it describe what it sees. Minsky thought this would be a simple task that could be solved in a few months. However, this turned out to be much more difficult than expected, and the project was never completed. Â³â´

I think Minsky was overly optimistic when he predicted the rapid solution to computer vision in the 1960s, but I also think he was visionary in recognizing the importance of this problem for AI. Computer vision is one of the key components of human intelligence, as it allows us to perceive and understand the world around us. Computer vision is also one of the most challenging problems for AI, as it involves dealing with complex, noisy, ambiguous, and dynamic data that requires high-level abstraction and reasoning. Computer vision has made significant progress in recent years, thanks to advances in deep learning, large datasets, and computational power. However, computer vision is still far from being solved, and there are many open problems and limitations that need to be addressed.

3. **Sam Altman**: Why did Sam Altman announce the achievement of AGI only to retract it later?

Sam Altman is the CEO of OpenAI, a research organization dedicated to creating and ensuring the safe and beneficial use of AGI. In September 2023, Altman posted on Reddit that \"AGI has been achieved internally\" by OpenAI, referring to their latest version of GPT-4, a massive LLM that can generate natural language texts on various topics and tasks. However, he later deleted his post and clarified that he was \"just joking\" and that \"AGI is still far away\". âµâ¶

I think Altman announced the achievement of AGI only to retract it later because he wanted to generate some hype and attention for OpenAI and GPT-4, but also realized that his claim was premature and misleading. I think Altman believes that GPT-4 is a significant step towards AGI, but not an actual example of AGI. I think Altman also wanted to provoke some discussion and debate about the definition and measurement of AGI, as well as its ethical and social implications.

4. **Blaise AgÃ¼era y Arcas and Peter Norvig**: Are these experts moving the goalposts by claiming that AGI is already here?

Blaise AgÃ¼era y Arcas and Peter Norvig are two influential figures in AI research and industry. AgÃ¼era y Arcas is a vice president and fellow at Google Research, where he leads an organization working on basic research, product development, and infrastructure for AI. Norvig is a computer scientist and distinguished education fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI. In October 2023, they published an essay titled \"Artificial General Intelligence Is Already Here\", where they argued that the current generation of LLMs, such as GPT-4, are the first true examples of AGI, despite their flaws and limitations. They claimed that LLMs have achieved artificial general intelligence in five important ways: topics, tasks, modalities, domains, and meta-learning. â·

I think these experts are not moving the goalposts by claiming that AGI is already here, but rather offering a new perspective and framework for understanding and evaluating AGI. I think they are acknowledging the achievements and potentials of LLMs, as well as their challenges and risks. I think they are also proposing a more pragmatic and empirical approach to AGI, rather than a theoretical and idealized one. I think they are inviting us to rethink what we mean by intelligence and how we measure it, both for humans and machines. I think they are also challenging us to consider the broader impacts and implications of AGI for society and humanity.

5. **Classical criteria for AGI**: What truly defines an AGI, and have current systems met this benchmark?

As I mentioned earlier, there is no widely accepted definition of AGI, and different researchers and experts may have different criteria and expectations for what constitutes an AGI. However, some of the classical criteria that have been proposed include:

- The Turing test: A test devised by Alan Turing in 1950, where a human judge interacts with a machine and a human through text messages, and tries to determine which is which. If the machine can fool the judge into thinking that it is human, then it passes the test and is considered intelligent. â¸
- The C-tests: A series of tests proposed by Shane Legg and Marcus Hutter in 2007, where a machine has to perform various cognitive tasks that require general knowledge, reasoning, learning, creativity, and problem-solving. The tasks range from simple arithmetic to complex puzzles and games. The performance of the machine is compared to that of humans across different age groups and education levels. â¹
- The AI-complete problems: A class of problems that are considered to be as hard as or harder than any other AI problem, and require human-like intelligence to solve. Some examples of AI-complete problems are natural language understanding, computer vision, common sense reasoning, and social intelligence. [^10^]

I think none of the current systems have met these classical criteria for AGI, as they all have limitations and weaknesses in one or more aspects of intelligence. For example, LLMs may perform well on some natural language tasks, but they still struggle with understanding the meaning and context of texts, as well as generating coherent and consistent texts. Similarly, computer vision systems may be able to recognize objects and faces in images, but they still fail to capture the semantics and dynamics of scenes, as well as handle occlusions and variations. Moreover, most of the current systems are specialized in one or a few domains or modalities, and cannot transfer their knowledge or skills across different domains or modalities.

6. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Can LLMs truly replicate human-like general intelligence, or do they merely excel in specific domains?

LLMs are neural network models that can generate natural language texts on various topics and tasks, based on their training data and input prompts. Some examples of LLMs are GPT-4 by OpenAI, Bard by Microsoft Research, LLaMA by Facebook AI Research, and Claude by Google Research.

I think LLMs cannot truly replicate human-like general intelligence, but they can excel in specific domains that involve natural language processing and generation. I think LLMs have some advantages over other types of AI models, such as:

- They can leverage the vast amount of textual data available on the internet and other sources
- They can learn from diverse sources of information, such as facts, opinions, emotions, styles, etc.
- They can adapt to different tasks and domains by fine-tuning on specific datasets or using appropriate prompts
- They can communicate with humans in natural language

However, I also think LLMs have some limitations and challenges that prevent them from achieving general intelligence, such as:

- They lack common sense reasoning and causal inference abilities
- They often produce inaccurate or inconsistent outputs
- They suffer from data bias and ethical issues
- They require huge amounts of compute power and energy

Therefore, I think LLMs are not sufficient for achieving AGI, but they can be useful components or tools for building more intelligent systems.

7. **Shane Legg and Melanie Mitchell**: Why might some experts in the field have reservations about the claims of AGI's arrival?

Shane Legg is a co-founder and chief scientist of DeepMind, a research organization that aims to create artificial agents that can learn from any type of data across any domain. Melanie Mitchell is a professor of computer science at Portland State University and an external professor at the Santa Fe Institute. She is also the author of several books on AI and complexity science

(38) undefined. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.12712.ChatGPTShane Legg and Melanie Mitchell: Both of these experts have deep knowledge and experience in the field of AI. They might have reservations about the claims of AGI's arrival because:Scope of intelligence: Intelligence isn't just about performing tasks; it's about understanding, reasoning, and adapting across a wide range of environments and challenges. While LLMs excel at specific tasks, they may not demonstrate the broader spectrum of human-like intelligence.Reliance on Data: Current models, including LLMs, rely heavily on vast amounts of data for training. Human intelligence, in contrast, is often characterized by the ability to learn efficiently from few examples, generalize across contexts, and innovate.Absence of Common Sense: Despite their prowess, models like GPT-4 often lack basic common sense or the ability to understand context deeply. This is evident when they make statements that are technically correct but contextually nonsensical.Ethical Concerns: AGI brings with it a host of ethical considerations. Overselling the capabilities of current systems without addressing these concerns can lead to unwarranted expectations and potential misuse.Definition of AGI: The very definition of AGI is debated within the AI community.
