The AGIO8 conference was a big success. I think it went even better than we expected going into it.
Toward the end of the conference, we had a show of hands in the audience and the vote was unanimous that AGIO9 is a good idea.
What we decided was to do an AGIO9 in the DC metropolitan area. The specific location is yet to be determined.
We're really looking forward to it. In addition to the high quality scientific and engineering presentations like we had this year,
in AGIO9 we plan to feature a demo track where we show off some of the practical achievements of artificial general intelligence software.
So we look forward to a bigger and better AGIO9 in Washington DC and we hope to see you there.
Thank you.
