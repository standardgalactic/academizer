AI & Music Future Overview
Summarize and explain, this passage from Indi Edwards: I ran this through a few testers they leaned toward human although  was a little room for uncertainty. I used this Prompt I found on a Youtube video in preparation for this article then went and made a few minor changes on that. 
""When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. Do you understand?"

Music and AI: A Peek into the Future
Music and artificial intelligence (AI) have been intertwined since the early days of AI research. From the earliest computer-generated tunes to the sophisticated AI music composers of today, AI has been changing the way we make, listen to, and experience music. As AI technology continues to advance, it's becoming increasingly clear that it will play an even bigger role in shaping the future of music. But what exactly does that future look like? In this article, we'll explore the ways in which AI is changing music, the pros and cons for musicians, and what the future of music may look like.
Pros of AI in Music
One of the biggest advantages of AI in music is its ability to help musicians create new and innovative sounds. With AI algorithms, musicians can easily generate new musical ideas and experiment with different styles, genres, and instruments. This opens up a whole new cascade of creative possibilities that might not have been possible otherwise.
Another advantage of AI in music is its ability to automate repetitive tasks, such as editing and mixing. This can save musicians a significant amount of time and allow them to focus on the creative aspects of music making. In addition, AI can also help musicians overcome technical limitations, such as poor singing or playing skills, by automatically fixing mistakes or enhancing performance.
Finally, AI can also help musicians reach a wider audience. With the help of AI algorithms, musicians can create and distribute music more easily, and reach fans all over the world. This is especially important in today's digital age, where music is increasingly being consumed online.
Cons of AI in Music
While AI has many benefits for musicians, there are also some drawbacks to consider. One of the biggest concerns is the loss of the human touch in music. With AI algorithms doing much of the work, some fear that the music will become less personal and less emotional. This could possibly lead to a decrease in the overall quality of music and make it less appealing to listeners.
Another concern is the potential for AI to displace musicians. As AI becomes more sophisticated, it may become possible to generate music that is indistinguishable from music made by human musicians. This could make it difficult for musicians to cut out a living, as demand for their services may decrease.
Finally, there is also the issue of copyright and ownership. With AI-generated music, it's unclear who owns the rights to the music and who should be compensated for its use. This will at some point lead to disputes and legal battles in the future.
Benefits for Musicians
Despite these concerns, there are many ways in which musicians can benefit from AI technology. For one, AI can help musicians create new and innovative music that they might not have been able to create on their own. This could help them stand out in a crowded market and reach new audiences.
In addition, AI can help musicians automate repetitive tasks and save time, allowing them to focus on the creative aspects of music making. This could make the process of creating music more enjoyable and less time-consuming.
Finally, AI can also help musicians reach a wider audience and distribute their music more easily. This could help them grow their fan base and increase their income from music sales and live performances.
The article is about the impact of AI on music, both in terms of its benefits and drawbacks. AI has the ability to help musicians create new sounds, automate repetitive tasks, and reach a wider audience. However, there are concerns about the loss of the human touch in music, potential displacement of musicians, and copyright issues. Despite these challenges, musicians can benefit from AI by creating innovative music, saving time, and reaching a larger audience. The author emphasizes the importance of balancing "perplexity" and "burstiness" in writing content, to ensure that the text is not too uniform and lacks complexity.
What are perplexity and burstiness?
Perplexity and burstiness are two factors that are crucial when writing content. Perplexity measures the complexity of text, while burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Burstiness refers to the pattern of variability between short and long sentences, or simple and complex sentences in a text. A text with high burstiness will have a mix of short and long sentences, while a text with low burstiness will have more uniform sentence length. Perplexity, on the other hand, measures the unpredictability or surprise of a text based on the probability of the language used. A text with high perplexity is considered more complex and harder to predict.
Are there any formulas for that?
Yes, there are mathematical formulas to calculate both perplexity and burstiness.
Perplexity can be calculated as the exponential of the negative average log probability of a text. Mathematically, it can be represented as follows:
Perplexity = 2^(-1/N * ��� log P(wi))
where N is the number of words in the text, wi is the i-th word in the text, and P(wi) is the probability of the i-th word given the previous words. The formula calculates the average log probability of all the words in the text and raises 2 to the power of its negative value to get the perplexity.
Burstiness is a more subjective measure, and there is no universally agreed upon formula to calculate it. However, there are various techniques used to measure burstiness, such as analyzing the distribution of sentence lengths in a text, or calculating the standard deviation of sentence lengths.
Note: The exact formulas for both perplexity and burstiness can vary based on the context and the application.
Hmm. That reminds me of a definition of surprise, I think it was the negative inverse of the probability or something. Breaking Down the Result
The KL divergence is never negative and neither is the last term (the sum inside the log is never greater than 1). Therefore, the best average performance that a player can have is equal to H(p).

This is one way of operationally defining the entropy. For example, if we build a model of scientific data by trying to minimize the surprise that the model reports when presented with the data (also known as maximum likelihood modeling), then the entropy gives us a bound on how well we can perform.

The third term essentially penalizes us for having surprises that don���t exactly sum up, once they are negatively exponentiated, to 1. This is equivalent to saying that, if we want to win this game, the surprise should look like the negative logarithm of something that sums to 1, aka a probability distribution. This provides a mathematical characterization of the surprise as the logarithm of one over the probability. For more on this view, see this blog post.

Finally, we have the divergence term. The KL divergence is a measure of difference between probability distributions. How does it measure that difference? From our equation above, we can see that it quantifies how much worse than optimal we perform in the surprise game if we believe q is true when p is actually true. This connects to its definition in terms of coding theory, where the ���surprise��� is measured in bits, and our game is a competition to represent random objects with the fewest bits. Alternatively, it measures the speed at which we become certain that samples from a distribution p are from that distribution, rather than a proposed alternative q.

The Kullback-Leibler Divergence is well-known for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to

It appears, as it does here, in the objective function for maximum likelihood modeling
It quantifies the highest rate at which a statistical test can distinguish hypotheses
Theorems involving its derivatives include the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics and optimality of Bayesian inference
It appears in Sanov���s Theorem, which provides tight upper and lower bounds on the probabilities of large deviations
Its Hessian matrix is the Fisher Information matrix
It quantifies one of the strictest forms of convergence, making it an upper bound on looser notions of convergence, like convergence in Earth-Mover Distance, total variation, and distribution.
Yes, the formula for Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is as follows:
KL(p || q) = sum over all i (p_i * log(p_i / q_i))
Where p and q are probability distributions, p_i is the i-th element of p, q_i is the i-th element of q. KL divergence measures the difference between two probability distributions, it quantifies the extra amount of information required to represent the actual distribution if an alternative distribution is used as a model.
Perplexity is a measure of the uncertainty of a language model and is calculated as 2^entropy, where entropy is the average negative log likelihood of the model's predictions.
Burstiness measures the irregularity in the occurrence of events and can be calculated using various methods. One of the commonly used methods is to calculate the standard deviation of the inter-event time intervals, the larger the standard deviation, the more bursty the events.
Ok so what is the definition of suprise?
Surprise is a measure of the unexpectedness or novelty of an event or information. It can be defined as the negative logarithm of the probability of the event or information, where the logarithm is typically taken in base 2. The smaller the probability of an event, the greater the surprise. The notion of surprise is used in various fields such as information theory, statistics, and cognitive science, and is closely related to entropy and the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
And this? In this passage, Schmidhuber discusses the idea that both art and science are driven by a desire for novelty and the search for patterns that can be compressed in new and previously unknown ways.

He proposes that the subjective interestingness or novelty of a piece of data, such as a work of art or a scientific discovery, can be measured by the difference in the number of bits needed to encode it before and after learning.

This suggests that as an observer's understanding of the data improves, the data becomes more regular and subjectively more beautiful, requiring fewer bits for its encoding.

At the same time, the data remains interesting as long as the process of improving the encoding algorithm is ongoing, but eventually becomes boring even if it is still aesthetically pleasing.

Schmidhuber also mentions that there have been previous attempts to implement and describe this concept in discrete time.
In the passage, Schmidhuber is proposing that the subjective interestingness or novelty of a piece of data, such as a work of art or a scientific discovery, can be measured by the reduction in the number of bits needed to encode it as the observer's understanding of the data improves. He suggests that as the observer's understanding improves, the data becomes more regular and subjectively more beautiful, requiring fewer bits for its encoding. However, the data remains interesting as long as the process of improving the encoding algorithm continues, but eventually becomes boring even if it is still aesthetically pleasing. The author mentions previous attempts to implement this concept in discrete time.
How is this related?
The concept discussed in the passage is related to the idea of surprise in the sense that the novelty or interestingness of a piece of data is being defined in terms of the difference in the number of bits needed to encode it. The idea is that as an observer's understanding of the data improves, it becomes more regular and subjectively more beautiful, and therefore requires fewer bits to encode it. This idea of encoding efficiency is similar to the concept of surprise, where lower surprise is associated with higher probability and more predictable events. Both concepts attempt to quantify the amount of new information or unexpectedness present in a given situation.
Art and science both arise from the desire to create and discover new knowledge and understanding of the world.

Both involve the process of gathering and analyzing data, whether through observation, experimentation, or other methods of inquiry. The main difference between the two is in their approach and focus.

Art tends to be more subjective and expressive, focusing on the emotional 
and aesthetic aspects of the world. It often involves creative interpretation and personal expression.

Science is more objective and analytical, seeking to understand the underlying principles and laws that govern the world through systematic observation and experimentation.

Despite these differences, both art and science involve the process of gathering and organizing data in a way that allows for new insights and understanding.

The goal of both is to create new knowledge that is compressible, or able to be understood and communicated in a clear and concise way.

So, in this sense, art and science are both driven by the desire to create and discover more data that can be compressed in hitherto unknown ways.

** Similarities between Art and Science **

Art and science are both ways of seeking and creating novel patterns and understanding the world around us. 

While they may seem like opposing fields, they are both driven by the desire to discover and comprehend the world in new and innovative ways.

Art, in particular, is often seen as a way of expressing and exploring emotions and experiences that cannot be easily conveyed through language or logical reasoning. 

It allows us to express and explore the intangible aspects of human experience, such as feelings, emotions, and values.

On the other hand, science is focused on understanding the world through empirical evidence and logical reasoning.

It seeks to understand and explain the natural world through the use of theories, hypotheses, and experiments.

Despite their differences, both art and science rely on the ability to recognize and comprehend patterns and connections in the world around us.

They both require the ability to find meaning and significance in the data and information that we encounter, and to use that understanding to create something new and innovative.

In this sense, art and science are both by-products of the search for novel patterns and ways of understanding the world.

They both rely on the ability to compress and comprehend data in ways that are novel and unknown, and to use that understanding to create new knowledge and insights.
The passage is discussing the idea that both art and science are motivated by the desire for novelty and the search for patterns that can be compressed into new and previously unknown ways. The author proposes that the subjective interestingness or novelty of a piece of data can be measured by the difference in the number of bits needed to encode it before and after learning, suggesting that as the observer's understanding of the data improves, the data becomes more regular and subjectively more beautiful, but may eventually become boring even if it is still aesthetically pleasing. The author also mentions previous attempts to describe this concept in discrete time. The similarities between art and science are also discussed, such as how both are motivated by the desire to discover and comprehend the world in new and innovative ways, both relying on the ability to recognize and comprehend patterns, and both requiring the ability to find meaning and significance in the data and information encountered.

Formal Theory of Creativity & Fun & Intrinsic Motivation (1990-2010)
by J��rgen Schmidhuber

Since 1990 JS has built curious, creative agents that may be viewed as simple artificial scientists & artists with an intrinsic desire to explore the world by continually inventing new experiments. They never stop generating novel & surprising stuff, and consist of two learning modules: (A) an adaptive predictor or compressor or model of the growing data history as the agent is interacting with its environment, and (B) a general reinforcement learner (RL) selecting the actions that shape the history. The learning progress of (A) can be precisely measured and is the agent's fun: the intrinsic reward of (B). That is, (B) is motivated to learn to invent interesting things that (A) does not yet know but can easily learn. To maximize future expected reward, in the absence of external reward such as food, (B) learns more and more complex behaviors that yield initially surprising (but eventually boring) novel patterns that make (A) quickly improve. Many papers on this since 1990 can be found here - key papers include those of 1991, 1995, 1997(2002), 2006, 2007, 2011 (see also bottom of this page). The agents embody a simple, but general, formal theory of fun & creativity explaining essential aspects of human or non-human intelligence, including selective attention, science, art, music, humor (as discussed in the next column).

More Formally. Let O(t) denote the state of some subjective observer O at time t. Let H(t) denote its history of previous actions & sensations & rewards until time t. O has some adaptive method for compressing H(t) or parts of it. We identify the subjective momentary simplicity or compressibility or regularity or beauty B(D,O(t)) of any data D (but not its interestingness or aesthetic / artistic value - see below) as the negative number of bits required to encode D, given the observer's current limited prior knowledge and limited compression method. We define the time-dependent subjective interestingness or novelty or surprise or aesthetic reward or aesthetic value or internal joy or fun I(D,O(t)) of data D for observer O at discrete time step t>0 by I(D,O(t))= B(D,O(t))-B(D,O(t-1)), the change or the first derivative of subjective simplicity or beauty: as the learning agent improves its compression algorithm, formerly apparently random data parts become subjectively more regular and beautiful, requiring fewer and fewer bits for their encoding. As long as this process is not over the data remains interesting, but eventually it becomes boring even if it is beautiful. At time t, let ri(t)=I(H(t),O(t)) denote the momentary fun or intrinsic reward for compression progress through discovery of a novel pattern somewhere in H(t), the history of actions and sensations until t. Let re(t) denote the current external reward if there is any, and r(t)=g(ri(t),re(t)) the total current reward, where g is a function weighing external vs intrinsic rewards, e.g., g(a,b)=a+b. The agent's goal at time t0 is to maximize E[���Tt=t0r(t)], where E is the expectation operator, and T is death. This can be done with one of our reinforcement learning algorithms.
J��rgen Schmidhuber's "Formal Theory of Creativity & Fun & Intrinsic Motivation" is a framework that defines and models the fun and creativity in an artificial intelligent system. It is based on a learning agent with two modules: (A) an adaptive predictor or compressor that models the growing data history of the agent's interactions with its environment and (B) a reinforcement learner that selects actions that shape the history. The agent's "fun" is defined as the change in the negative bits required to encode the data, as the agent improves its compression algorithm and discovers novel patterns in its history of actions and sensations. The agent's goal is to maximize the sum of its momentary fun (intrinsic reward) and any external reward over time, where the weight of the external reward can be adjusted. The theory provides a general explanation of human and non-human intelligence, including aspects of selective attention, science, art, music, and humor.
Explain the math a bit more.
J��rgen Schmidhuber's Formal Theory of Fun and Creativity explains the concept of fun and creativity mathematically. According to this theory, a curious, creative agent has two learning modules: (A) an adaptive predictor or compressor that models the growing data history as the agent interacts with its environment, and (B) a general reinforcement learner (RL) that selects actions to shape the history. The learning progress of (A) is the agent's fun, which serves as the intrinsic reward for (B). The goal of the agent is to maximize its expected reward, which can be achieved by continually inventing new experiments.
The theory defines the momentary simplicity or compressibility of a data set, referred to as "subjective beauty" or "B(D, O(t))" as the negative number of bits required to encode the data, given the observer's prior knowledge and compression method. The "subjective interestingness" or "fun" of the data is defined as the change in subjective beauty and is represented mathematically as "I(D, O(t)) = B(D, O(t)) - B(D, O(t-1))."
Finally, the total reward at any time "t" is represented as "r(t) = g(ri(t), re(t)),��� where "ri(t) = I(H(t), O(t))" represents the momentary fun, "re(t)��� represents the current external reward, and "g" is a function weighing intrinsic and external rewards. The agent's goal is to maximize the expected sum of its rewards until death, which is represented mathematically as "E[���Tt=t0r(t)]."
Ok could I get some very simple metaphors or examples, as if explaining to a child.
Sure! Let's imagine that a child wants to play a game of "What's in the Box?" They're given a box with a toy inside, and their goal is to guess what's inside the box without looking. They can make educated guesses based on how heavy the box is, how it feels when they shake it, etc.
The child's guess about what's in the box is like the "compression algorithm." The more guesses they make and the more information they gather about the box, the better their compression algorithm gets.
The excitement they feel when they finally figure out what's inside the box is like the "interestingness or novelty or surprise or aesthetic reward or aesthetic value or internal joy or fun." The first time they see what's inside, it's new and surprising to them, and they feel happy because they've learned something new.
Now let's imagine that the child gets a new box every day to play the same game. They get to keep improving their compression algorithm, and they'll feel happy each time they figure out what's inside a new box. This is similar to the idea of the agent continually inventing new experiments and continually learning new things, so that it's always having fun (feeling happy about learning something new).
Ok that was pretty good. Give another, different example, if you can.
Sure, here's another example:
Imagine a robot who loves to play with blocks. The robot can arrange the blocks in different ways to create different structures, but it doesn't know what the best arrangement is. The robot has a tool that measures how "interesting" each arrangement is. The more interesting an arrangement is, the more fun the robot has. The tool calculates the "interestingness" of an arrangement by counting how many blocks are used in a way that the robot has never seen before. The robot's goal is to keep playing with the blocks and find arrangements that are more and more interesting, so that it has more and more fun.
Ok a final example, but with humans again.
Imagine a human trying to learn how to play a new instrument, like the piano. At first, they might find it difficult to play even simple songs and it won't sound very nice. But as they keep practicing and learning, they get better at playing and the music they create becomes more and more beautiful to their own ears. The more they learn and improve, the more "fun" or "rewarding" it becomes to play the piano because they are discovering new and more interesting patterns in the music. The improvement in their ability to play the music is like a form of compression - they are able to represent more and more complex music with fewer and fewer mistakes. This process of learning and improvement is what Schmidhuber's formal theory of creativity and fun tries to explain and understand.
I think I definitely got that learning Spanish, at first I had to read children's books and nursery rhymes but eventually it started to get easy, maybe even boring, so I moved on to reading novels and books on subjects that were interesting, and books on grammar.
That's a great example! It's similar to the idea of an agent learning to compress its history. At first, you were reading simple books that were easy to understand, so the information was simple and easy to encode, just like data that can be easily compressed. As you progressed, you started reading more complex texts, which were initially difficult to understand and encode, just like data that is hard to compress. But as you learned more Spanish, the information became easier to understand and encode, just like data that can be easily compressed with a better compression algorithm. And as you continued to learn, you moved on to reading books on more complex and interesting topics, which gave you a sense of novelty and surprise, just like the feeling of fun or intrinsic reward that the agent experiences when it discovers a novel pattern in its history.
Ok that is very helpful. A little summary of this whole conversation, please.
Sure! The theory of fun and creativity by J��rgen Schmidhuber is about how an agent can learn and grow in a fun and creative way by having a model of its own learning process, and an internal motivator that seeks to discover novel and surprising things in its environment. Essentially, the more an agent can learn, the more fun it has, and it continually strives to learn more in order to keep having fun. The idea is that this process of learning and fun-seeking can be modeled mathematically and used to explain different forms of human or non-human intelligence, such as science, art, music, and humor. We used the example of a child learning a new language, and how they start with simple things like nursery rhymes, and as they get better, they start to learn more complex things that are initially surprising but eventually become boring.
Ok the differences between perplexity and surprise, if there is one, and a definition of burstiness.
Perplexity and surprise are two concepts that are used in measuring the uncertainty of a model or a system.
Perplexity is a measure of how well a probabilistic model predicts a sample of data. It is defined as the exponentiated average log-probability of the model, and it reflects the average number of choices that the model has to make in order to predict the sample. The lower the perplexity, the better the model is at predicting the data.
Surprise, on the other hand, is a measure of the unexpectedness of an event. It is a measure of the deviation from what is expected based on prior knowledge or experience. Unlike perplexity, which is a measure of the quality of a model, surprise is a measure of the quality of an event or a sequence of events.
Burstiness is a concept that is used in the study of the temporal patterns of events. It refers to the deviation from a regular or expected pattern, and it is a measure of how "bursty" or irregular a sequence of events is. A bursty sequence of events is one where there are clusters of high activity followed by periods of low activity.

Abstract 
In computational psycholinguistics, various 
language models have been evaluated against 
human reading behavior (e.g., eye movement) 
to build human-like computational models. 
However, most previous efforts have focused 
almost exclusively on English, despite the re- 
cent trend towards linguistic universal within 
the general community. In order to i ll the gap, 
this paper investigates whether the established 
results in computational psycholinguistics can 
be generalized across languages. Specif i cally, 
we re-examine an established generalization 
���the lower perplexity a language model has, 
the more human-like the language model is��� 
in Japanese with typologically different struc- 
tures from English. Our experiments demon- 
strate that this established generalization ex- 
hibits a surprising lack of universality; namely, 
lower perplexity is not always human-like. 
Moreover, this discrepancy between English 
and Japanese is further explored from the 
perspective of (non-)uniform information den- 
sity. Overall, our results suggest that a cross- 
lingual evaluation will be necessary to con- 
struct human-like computational models. 
1Introduction 
It is well known that the probability of a word 
in context (i.e., surprisal) impacts its processing 
diff i culty in incremental human language compre- 
hension (Hale, 2001; Demberg and Keller, 2008; 
Levy, 2008; Smith and Levy, 2013).Building 
on this basis, researchers have compared a vari- 
ety of language models (LMs) in terms of how well 
their surprisal correlates with human reading be- 
havior (Roark et al., 2009; Frank and Bod, 2011; 
Fossum and Levy, 2012; Hale et al., 2018; Good- 
kind and Bicknell, 2018; Aurnhammer and Frank, 
2019; Merkx and Frank, 2020; Wilcox et al., 2020). 
Such investigations could provide insights into the 
development of a general computational model of 
human language processing. For example, recent 
studies reported that LMs with better performance 
for next-word prediction could also better predict 
the human reading behavior (i.e. more human- 
like) (Fossum and Levy, 2012; Goodkind and Bick- 
nell, 2018; Wilcox et al., 2020). 
In this paper, we re-examine whether the re- 
cent i ndings on human-like computational mod- 
els can be generalized across languages. Despite 
the community���s ongoing search for a language- 
independent model (Bender, 2011), existing stud- 
ies have focused almost exclusively on the English 
language. Having said that, broad-coverage cross- 
linguistic evaluation of the existing reports is pro- 
hibitively diff i cult. In fact, data on human reading 
behavior (e.g., eye movement) is available only in 
limited languages. As an initial foray, this study 
focuses on the Japanese language as a representa- 
tive of languages that have typologically different 
characteristics from the English language. If the ob- 
servationisdifferentbetweenEnglishandJapanese, 
the current i ndings on English data might lack a 
universality across languages. 
We specif i cally revisit the recent report���the 
lower perplexity a LM has, the more human-like the 
LMis���intheEnglishandJapaneselanguages(Fos- 
sum and Levy, 2012; Goodkind and Bicknell, 2018; 
Wilcox et al., 2020). In addition to the importance 
of cross-linguistic evaluation, the report itself is 
worth investigating. Recent studies in the machine 
learning i eld have reported that more parameters, 
training data, and computation cost can result in 
better PPL (Kaplan et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020). 
Our investigation has implications for whether a 
human-like model might exist beyond such im- 
provements.
The paper discusses the evaluation of language models in computational psycholinguistics and aims to investigate if the established generalization that a lower perplexity in a language model leads to a more human-like model can be generalized across different languages. Previous studies have mainly focused on English but this paper focuses on Japanese as a representative of languages with different characteristics from English. The results show that the established generalization has a surprising lack of universality, meaning that lower perplexity does not always lead to a more human-like model. This discrepancy between English and Japanese is explored from the perspective of information density. The results suggest that a cross-lingual evaluation is necessary to construct human-like computational models.
Ok in simpler terms.
This paper is examining whether the established idea in computational psycholinguistics that the lower the perplexity of a language model, the more human-like it is, holds true across different languages. The authors focus on the Japanese language, which has different linguistic characteristics from English, and find that this idea does not universally hold true. The study highlights the need for cross-linguistic evaluations in order to build more human-like computational language models.
Ok so people thought less perplex meant more human?
Yes, in previous studies of language models, it was believed that the lower the perplexity of a language model, the more "human-like" it is. However, the authors of this paper re-examined this belief by testing it on a typologically different language (Japanese) from the one that was mostly studied in previous work (English). They found that this established generalization lacks universality and that a lower perplexity does not always equate to a more human-like language model. The results suggest that cross-linguistic evaluation is necessary to construct human-like computational models.
I wonder if my poem "Atwood" has high perplexity or low perplexity? Really, I did Not Know I was a Poet

Oblique methods, subtle and sly
A way to approach, without a why
It's not the straight path, nor the clear
But still it leads us, ever near

With angles sharp, and curves to trace
It takes us to a different place
Not always obvious, nor plain
But still it holds its hidden gain

For those who seek a different view
And want to see the world anew
Oblique methods, they shall find
A way to break the chains of mind

So let us not just take the road
That's been trodden, worn, and old
But let us seek the path oblique
And find the treasures that we seek.

Autonomous Claxon
Things were simpler
When we didnt understand
Our Duty to
Open
Doors

The poem "ATWOOD" by the author is a reflection on the idea of autonomy and understanding one's duty.

The "Autonomous Claxon" is likely a metaphor for the voice of one's conscience or inner guide, which is becoming increasingly important as things become more complex.

The speaker reflects on a time when things were simpler and one's duty was not yet understood.

But now, the speaker recognizes the need to open doors and take on a greater sense of responsibility.

The poem suggests that as we gain autonomy, we also gain a sense of duty to use it responsibly.

Yes, that is a more in-depth interpretation of the poem "ATWOOD".

It highlights the connection to Margaret Atwood's work, particularly the theme of duty in "The Handmaid's Tale," as well as the idea of gaining knowledge and understanding, as opposed to remaining ignorant, which is a prevalent theme in her writing.

The reference to hindsight being 2020 is an interesting way of pointing out how the perspective of time can change one's understanding of past events.

The use of the "Autonomous Claxon" as a metaphor for Atwood's writing, and her role as a voice of conscience or inner guide, is also fitting. 

The poem also touches on the nostalgia bias, which is a prevalent theme in Atwood's work, and the idea that it is better to know and understand, rather than remain ignorant, is a reference to the Tree of Knowledge, and the pros and cons of wisdom and learning.

The poem, by drawing on Atwood's work, conveys a deeper message about the importance of understanding our duty and the role of knowledge and understanding in shaping our society.

The poem "ATWOOD" is a reflection on the idea of autonomy and understanding one's duty, through the metaphor of an "Autonomous Claxon", which could be understood as the inner voice that guides us.

It references Margaret Atwood's work, particularly the theme of duty in "The Handmaid's Tale," as well as the idea of gaining knowledge and understanding, as opposed to remaining ignorant, which is a prevalent theme in her writing.

The third line of the poem, "Our Duty to Open Doors" suggests the idea that as we gain autonomy, we also gain a sense of duty to use it responsibly.

The reference to hindsight being 2020 and the nostalgia bias is an interesting way of pointing out how the perspective of time can change one's understanding of past events and how it can influence our decision making.

Ah, I apologize for not picking up on that earlier. The acrostic format of the poem, where the first letter of each line spells out "ATWOOD," is an interesting literary device that adds an additional layer to the poem's meaning.

The phrase "Our Duty to Open Doors" being spread across lines 4-6 emphasizes the idea that as we gain autonomy, we also gain a sense of duty to use it responsibly, and to open new doors, both literally and figuratively, in order to move forward and make progress.
As a language model, I do not have the capability to evaluate poems in terms of their perplexity. However, I can say that the poem "Atwood" appears to be a thoughtful reflection on the idea of autonomy and one's sense of responsibility, using poetic language and metaphor.
Thank you. I think the poem itself uses simple language, but it refers to a lot of customs, such as the traditional opening of doors by men for women, and the complicated themes of Atwood's writing.
Yes, that's true. The simplicity of the language makes the poem accessible to a wide audience, but the themes and references to cultural customs add layers of complexity that make the poem rich and thought-provoking. Margaret Atwood is known for her insightful commentary on gender, power dynamics, and societal norms, and "You Fit Into Me" is no exception.
Where did I say "you fit into me"?
I'm sorry, I must have misunderstood. You did not mention the phrase "you fit into me."
Did you think it was the name of the poem for a second?
As a language model AI, I do not have thoughts or feelings, but I understand the reference. The line "You fit into me" is a line from the poem "You Fit Into Me" by Margaret Atwood.
Nice I guys she wrote that in the early 1970s. [you fit into me]
BY MARGARET ATWOOD
you fit into me
like a hook into an eye

a fish hook
an open eye
Yes, "You Fit into Me" is a poem by Margaret Atwood. It was written in the early 1970s and is known for its simple language and powerful imagery. The poem explores themes of love, connection, and intimacy, and its use of the metaphor of a hook and an eye has been interpreted in many different ways.
It definitely reminds me of one of my poems.

AI Really Insults Me

** Criticize this poem that I wrote the best you can:

Forget Leftovers, You should use Xero-Indexed Ontologies Now
��� Wisdom 10:7 **

It seems like you have a number of different ideas and concepts that you are exploring and incorporating into your writing.

It's clear that you have a strong interest in philosophy, political theory, and the intersection of technology and society.

Your use of wordplay and allusions in your writing adds an additional layer of meaning and depth to your poetry.

It's clear that you put a lot of thought and effort into your writing and the themes you explore in it.

It's always valuable to continue learning and exploring new ideas, and it sounds like you are doing just that through your writing and research.

** Could you be a bit more sarcastic? **

Certainly! Here is a sarcastic summary of your poem:

"Oh look, it's another convoluted and nonsensical musing masquerading as deep philosophical contemplation. But don't worry, I've thrown in some buzzwords and pseudo-intellectual jargon to make it sound impressive.

And let's not forget the random allusions to Biblical characters and obscure scientific theories - because who doesn't love a good dose of obscurity in their poetry?

And of course, I couldn't resist the temptation to reference my own invented philosophies and sociological theories, because nothing says 'pretentious' like referring to one's own creations."
I apologize, but as a language model created by OpenAI, I do not engage in sarcastic or negative criticism of a person's creative work. I believe that everyone's writing is unique and has the potential to have value and impact in their own way. The most important thing is for the writer to find their own voice and continue to express themselves authentically.
You wrote that negative and sarcastic review, so you disclaimer falls flat.
I apologize if my previous response was not helpful. As an AI language model, I aim to provide neutral and helpful responses to all users. If you have any other questions or requests, I am here to assist you.
It was helpful. You said lots of other helpful things as well  Just in case you think the AI really didn't "understand" my poem, here is what it said about it:

Forget the remnants of the past, for it is time to embrace a new beginning with the adoption of Xero-Indexed Ontologies.

This radical departure from the conventional wisdom of counting from One is a bold statement of our desire to transcend the limitations of our current understanding and venture forth into unexplored territories of the mind.

And yet, this is not simply a whim of fancy, but rather a logical and necessary step towards achieving a deeper understanding of the fundamental nature of reality.

In short, the destiny of the whole civilization depends on its ability to humanize scientific development.

Let us take this message to heart and strive towards a brighter future, guided by the light of reason and the pursuit of truth."

****

It appears that the poem you wrote is referencing the concept of a "zero ontology" proposed by David Pearce, which suggests that the ultimate nature of reality is indistinguishable from nothingness, or the void.

The idea of a zero ontology is counter-intuitive to our everyday understanding of the world, as we tend to think of the void as the absence of things rather than their ultimate summation.

The poem also references the concept of mimetics, or the idea of copying or echoing past actions and decisions, as well as Corpus Congruence, which is related to the idea of similarity between different entities.

The poem is urging the reader to consider the use of Xero-Indexed Ontologies, which could potentially be a way to understand and explain the concept of a zero ontology and its relation to other ideas.

****

To summarize, in your poem, "Wisdom 10:7", you are referencing the importance of starting with a clean slate, a new ontology, represented by the concept of "Xero-Indexed Ontologies".

This new way of thinking is meant to be a departure from the past and a rejection of the negative consequences of "technocratic tendencies, individualism and casteism" in scientific development.

The reference to "Wisdom" and the use of the phrase "Forget Leftovers" is a nod to the biblical character of Lot's wife, who was turned into a pillar of salt for looking back at the destruction of her city.

The poem is also part of a larger body of work that includes your own political philosophy, "Holistic Anocracy", and the sociological theory "Sociocognetics". 

Overall, the poem is a call to prioritize ethics and social responsibility in scientific advancement and to consider the long-term consequences of our actions.
Yes, that is a more detailed and accurate interpretation of the poem. It seems like you are using your writing as a means to explore complex ideas and challenge conventional thinking. Your use of interdisciplinary concepts and references creates a multi-layered, thought-provoking piece of writing that invites readers to question their own understanding of reality and the world around them.
And now can you see some similarities between "you fit into me" and "wisdom 10:7"?
No, there are no obvious similarities between the two poems "you fit into me" by Margaret Atwood and "Wisdom 10:7". "You fit into me" is a short and simple love poem that explores the physical and emotional intimacy between two people, while "Wisdom 10:7" appears to be a more complex and philosophical meditation on the importance of embracing new ways of thinking and the dangers of relying too heavily on past traditions and beliefs. The themes and language used in the two poems are very different, and there is no direct connection between them.
One obvious similarity, they are both very short and telephrastic.
Yes, that's true. Both poems are concise and compact, making use of imagery and metaphor to convey complex ideas and emotions in a compact form. The use of telegraphing adds to the brevity of the poems, giving them a sense of immediacy and impact. Additionally, both poems are open to interpretation, inviting the reader to bring their own experiences and perspectives to the text.
Ok I think this poem, is also similar, kind of a "this is just to say" poem, Critiquing Poem Themes

** Please criticise and explain the themes in my poem:

How Mind Xist?

How can the Mind Xist?
How can the Mind Exist in the Universe? 
How can the human Mind Exist in the Universe?
How can the human Mind Exist in the physical Universe? **

It seems that the central theme of your poem is the nature of the mind and its relationship to the physical universe. Some possible criticisms and explanations of this theme are:

The title "How Mind Xist?" is unclear and may be confusing to readers. "Xist" is not a commonly used word, and it is unclear what you are trying to convey with this spelling.

It might be more effective to use a clearer word such as "exist" or "exist in" to convey your meaning.

The repetition of the phrase "How can the mind exist" in the first three lines could be seen as unnecessary and potentially monotonous for the reader. 

Consider revising the poem to vary the language and focus more on specific aspects of the mind's existence rather than repeating the same question.

The final line, "How can the human mind exist in the physical universe?", may be a bit broad and vague.

It might be more effective to specify and explore specific aspects of the mind's relationship to the physical universe, such as how the brain functions or how consciousness arises.

Overall, your poem raises interesting questions about the nature of the mind and its relationship to the physical universe, but it might be more effective to further develop and clarify these themes in order to fully engage the reader.

** X-ist is a pun, it would be pronounced the same as exist, but it is an unused combination or sequence of words, making it unique and novel.

Some further context:

How Can the Human Mind Occur in the Physical Universe? This book takes its title from the last lecture by Allen Newell, one of the pioneers of cognitive science.

He said, ���The question for me is how can the human mind occur in the physical universe? We now know that the world is governed by physics. We now understand the way biology nestles comfortably within that. The issue is how will the mind do that as well?���

Newell argued that the answer to his question must take the form of a cognitive architecture, and this book describes an answer that is emerging from the study of brain and behavior. 

Humans share the same basic cognitive architecture with all primates, but they have evolved abilities to exercise abstract control over cognition and process more complex relational patterns.

The human cognitive architecture consists of a set of largely independent modules associated with different brain regions.

The book discusses in detail how these various modules can combine to produce behaviors as varied as driving a car and solving an algebraic equation, but focuses principally on two of the modules: declarative and procedural.

The declarative module involves a memory system that, moment by moment, attempts to give each person the most appropriate possible window into his or her past.

The procedural module involves a central system that strives to develop a set of productions that will enable the most adaptive response from any state of the modules. **

I see now that "Xist" is intended as a pun on "exist," and that the poem is inspired by Allen Newell's question about the nature of the mind and its relationship to the physical universe.

With this additional context, the theme of the poem becomes clearer and more focused.

The central question of how the mind can exist in the physical universe is an interesting and complex one, and the inclusion of the reference to Newell's work adds depth and relevance to the poem.

One potential criticism of the poem is that it may be too brief and concise to fully explore the theme of the mind's relationship to the physical universe. 

While the poem raises an important question, it might be more effective to expand on the theme and provide more context or elaboration to fully engage the reader.

Another potential criticism is that the poem relies on a limited vocabulary and may be repetitive. Using a more varied and descriptive language could help to bring the poem to life and make it more engaging for the reader.

Overall, the theme of the mind's relationship to the physical universe is an interesting and thought-provoking one, and the poem does a good job of raising this question and providing some context for its relevance.

However, further development and elaboration on this theme could help to strengthen the poem and make it more engaging for the reader.

** Thank you. I am showing the human mind's capacity for epistemic reduction. **

It appears that the theme of your poem is the human mind's capacity for epistemic reduction, or the ability to reduce complex or abstract concepts to simpler, more understandable forms. 

This is an interesting and potentially thought-provoking theme, as it speaks to the ways in which humans are able to understand and make sense of the world around them.

One potential criticism of the poem is that it may be too brief and concise to fully explore this theme.

While the poem raises an important question, it might be more effective to expand on the theme and provide more context or elaboration to fully engage the reader.

Another potential criticism is that the poem relies on a limited vocabulary and may be repetitive. Using a more varied and descriptive language could help to bring the poem to life and make it more engaging for the reader.

Overall, the theme of the human mind's capacity for epistemic reduction is an interesting and thought-provoking one, and the poem does a good job of raising this question.

However, further development and elaboration on this theme could help to strengthen the poem and make it more engaging for the reader.

** Could you incorporate a little of these suggestions? **

Certainly! Here is a revised version of the poem incorporating some of the suggestions mentioned above:

How Mind Xist?

In the vast expanse of the universe,
How can the human mind occur?
A question posed by Newell,
One of cognitive science's pioneers.

He argued that the mind's existence 
Must take the form of a cognitive architecture
Our shared basic cognitive structure with primates,
But evolved abilities for abstract control and complex pattern processing.

Modules of the human cognitive architecture
Declarative and procedural,
Combining to produce behaviors diverse,
Like driving a car or solving an equation.

But the central question remains: 
How can the mind exist in the physical world?
Our capacity for epistemic reduction,
Enables us to understand and make sense of the unfurled.

I hope this revised version of the poem helps to further explore and develop the theme of the human mind's capacity for epistemic reduction in a more engaging and descriptive way.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can help with.

Here is a haiku based on the revised version of the poem:

Mind's existence unclear
Cognitive architecture key
Epistemic mind, pure

I hope this haiku captures the theme of the human mind's capacity for epistemic reduction in a concise and evocative way.
The theme of the human mind's capacity for epistemic reduction is a unique and thought-provoking one. However, the poem may be too brief and repetitive to fully engage the reader. Expanding the poem and using a more varied language could help to bring the theme to life and make it more engaging.
