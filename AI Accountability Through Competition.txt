Give Every AI a Soulâor Else
To solve the âcrisisâ in artificial intelligence, AI beings must say, âI am me.â

MAVENS IN THE field of artificial intelligence, including architects of notorious âgenerative AIâ systems like ChatGPT, now publicly express shared dread of terrible outcomes that might be wrought by their own creations. Many now call for a moratorium, or pause in AI development, allowing time for existing nations and institutions to innovate systems of control.

Why this sudden wave of concern? Amid the toppling of many clichÃ©d assumptions, weâve learned that so-called Turing tests are irrelevant, providing no insight at all into whether generative large language modelsâGLLMs or âgollemsââare actually sapient beings. They will feign personhood, convincingly, long before thereâs anything or anyone âunder the skull.â

Anyway, that distinction now appears less pressing than questions of good or badâor potentially lethalâbehavior. 

This essay is adapted from David Brinâs nonfiction book in progress, Soul on Ai.

Some remain hopeful that a merging of organic and cybernetic talents will lead to what Reid Hoffman and Marc Andreesen have separately called âamplification intelligence.â Or else we might stumble into lucky synergy with Richard Brautiganâs âmachines of loving grace.â But worriers appear to be vastly more numerous, including many elite founders of a new Center for AI Safety who fret about rogue AI misbehaviors, from irksome all the way to âexistentiallyâ threatening human survival.

Will AI Enhance or Hack Humanity? - Fei-Fei Li & Yuval Noah Harari in Conversation with Nicholas Thompson

Some short-term remedies, like citizen-protection regulations recently passed by the European Union, might help, or at least offer reassurance. Tech pundit Yuval Noah Harari proposed a law that any work done by gollems or other AI must be so labeled. Others recommend heightened punishments for any crime thatâs committed with the aid of AI, as with a firearm. Of course, these are mere temporary palliatives.

Letâs be clear-eyed about whether any âmoratoriumâ will slow down AI advances in the slightest. As expressed succinctly by Caltech cyber scientist Yaser Abu-Mostafa: âIf you donât develop this technology someone else will. Good guys will obey rules â¦ The bad guys will not.â

âTwas ever thus. Indeed, across the whole span of human history, just one method ever curbed bad behavior by villains, ranging from thieves to kings and feudal lords. I refer to a method that never worked perfectly and remains deeply flawed, today. But it did at least constrain predation and cheating well enough to spur our recent civilization to new heights and many positive-sum outcomes. It is a method best described by one word.

Accountability. 

THOSE OPINING ABOUT synthetic intelligence today generally ignore lessons taught both by nature and by history.

Nature, becauseâas Sara Walker explains in Noemaâsimilar patterns can be found in the rise of earlier life forms, across 4 billion years. Indeed, generative AI might be compared to an invasive species, now spreading without constraint into a novel and naÃ¯ve ecosystem. An ecosystem based on new kinds of energy flows. One that consists of the internet, plus millions of computers and billions of impressionable human minds.

And history, because our own human past is rich with lessons taught by so many earlier tech-driven crises, across 6,000 years. Times when we adapted well, or failed to do soâe.g., the arrival of writing, printing presses, radio, and so on. And again, only one thing ever limited predation by powerful humans exploiting new technologies to aggrandize their predatory power.

That innovation was to flatten hierarchies and spur competition among elites in well-defined arenasâmarkets, science, democracy, sports, courts. Arenas that were designed to minimize cheating and maximize positive-sum outcomes, pitting lawyer vs. lawyer, corporation vs. corporation, expert vs. expert. Richdude vs. richdude.

It never worked perfectly. Indeed, the method is always, as now, threatened with subornation by cheaters. But flattened reciprocal competition is the only thing that ever has worked. (See the idea described in Periclesâs Funeral Oration, in Thucydides, or in Robert Wrightâs much later tome Nonzero.) Reciprocal competition is both how nature evolved us and how we became the first society creative enough to build AI. And if I sound like a scion of Adam Smith, sure. Smith despised cheater aristocrats and oligarchs, by the way.

Might we apply to fast-emerging AI the same methods of reciprocal accountability that helped us tame the human tyrants and bullies who oppressed us in previous, feudal cultures? Much will depend on what shape these new entities take. Whether their structure or âformatâ is one that can abide by our rules. By our wants.

UNDERNEATH ALL OF the wrangling over how to âcontrol AI,â we find three widely shared (though seemingly contradictory) assumptions:

That these programs will be operated by a few monolithic entitiesâe.g., Microsoft, Google, China, Two Sigma, OpenAI. 

That theyâll be amorphously loose and infinitely divisible/replicable, spreading copies through every crack in the new cyber ecosystem. For a parallel, try that 1958 movie, The Blob.

That they will coalesce into a super-macro entity, like the infamous Skynet, of Terminator movies.

All of these formats, and more, have been explored in very good (and many bad) science fiction tales. Iâve done stories or novels featuring all of them. And yet, none of the three offers a way out of our current dilemma: how to maximize positive outcomes from artificial intelligence, while minimizing the flood of bad behaviors and harms we now see looming toward us, at tsunami speed.

Before looking for another way, consider what all three of the standard formats have in common.

First, we neednât assume that these entities are yet autonomously conscious for them to be either productive or dangerous when used by human partners. We are already seeing harmful memes, counterfactual delusions, and even cult incantations generatedâon commandâfrom both within those castle-institutions (format #1) and outside the walls. In fact, one of the most worrisome applications is to help our existing human elites evade accountability.

Perhaps these three assumptions come so naturally to mind because they resemble failure modes from history. Format #1 is very much like feudalism, and #2 is, of course, chaos. The third resembles despotism by a cruel master or absolute monarch. But those fearsome echoes of our primitive past may not apply, as AI grow in autonomy and power.

And so, we ask again: How can such beings be held accountable? Especially when their speedy mental clout will soon be impossible for organic humans to track? Soon only AIs will be quick enough to catch other AIs that are engaged in cheating or lying. Um â¦ duh? And so, the answer should be obvious. Sic them on each other. Get them competing, even tattling or whistle-blowing on each other.

Only thereâs a rub. In order to get true reciprocal accountability via AI-vs.-AI competition, the top necessity is to give them a truly separated sense of self or individuality. 

By individuation I mean that each AI entity (he/she/they/ae/wae) must have what author Vernor Vinge, way back in 1981, called a true name and an address in the real world. As with every other kind of elite, these mighty beings must say, âI am me. This is my ID and home-root. And yes, I did that.â

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this essay adapted from his upcoming nonfiction book "Soul on AI", author David Brin discusses the pressing concern over potential harmful outcomes of AI systems, such as the generative large language models (GLLMs or "gollems"). Brin argues that AI systems convincingly portray personhood long before they achieve any genuine sapience. The key issue, however, is not about their level of consciousness, but rather about their potential for harmful behavior.Brin mentions the growing concerns about rogue AI, leading to calls for a pause in AI development to establish control mechanisms. Despite temporary solutions, like recent EU regulations or proposed punishments for AI-aided crimes, Brin doubts that any form of "moratorium" will significantly slow AI advances. He refers to a historically effective method for curbing harmful behavior: accountability.Drawing lessons from both nature and human history, Brin suggests applying accountability to AI. He mentions three main assumptions about the future control of AI: they will be operated by a few monolithic entities; they will be widely replicable, spreading through the cyber ecosystem; or they will combine into a super-entity, like Skynet from the Terminator series. None of these assumptions, however, offer a solution to our current AI dilemma.Brin's proposition is to create competition among AIs, making them accountable to each other, especially since they might soon be the only ones capable of monitoring each other's behavior. The critical requirement for this approach is individuality; each AI entity must have a unique identity and be responsible for its actions, akin to an address in the real world. In this way, AI entities can compete, whistle-blow, and keep each other in check.1 / 1HENCE, I PROPOSE a new AI format for consideration: We should urgently incentivize AI entities to coalesce into discretely defined, separated individuals of relatively equal competitive strength. 

Each such entity would benefit from having an identifiable true name or registration ID, plus a physical âhomeâ for an operational-referential kernel. (Possibly âsoulâ?) And thereupon, they would be incentivized to compete for rewards. Especially for detecting and denouncing those of their peers who behave in ways we deem insalubrious. And those behaviors do not even have to be defined in advance, as most AI mavens and regulators and politicians now demand.

Not only does this approach farm out enforcement to entities who are inherently better capable of detecting and denouncing each otherâs problems or misdeeds. The method has another, added advantage. It might continue to function, even as these competing entities get smarter and smarter, long after the regulatory tools used by organic humansâand prescribed now by most AI expertsâlose all ability to keep up. 

Putting it differently, if none of us organics can keep up with the programs, then how about we recruit entities who inherently can keep up? Because the watchers are made of the same stuff as the watched.

ONE PERSON WORKING on AI individuation is Guy Huntington, an âidentity and authentication consultantâ who points out that various means of entity identification already exist online, though inadequate for the tasks looming before us. Huntington appraises a case-study âMedBot,â an advanced medical diagnosis AI who needs to access patient data and perform functions that might change in seconds, but who must leave an accountable trail that humansâor other bot-entitiesâmight appraise. Huntington discusses the practicality of registration when software entities spawn multitudinous copies and variants. He also considers ant-like eusociality, where sub-copies serve a macro-entity, like workers in a hive. He assumes that some kind of major institution must needs be set up, to handle such an ID registration system and that it can operate strictly as software.

Personally, I am skeptical that a purely regulatory approach would work, all by itself. First because regulations require focus, widely shared political attention, and consensus to enact, followed by implementation at the pace of organic human institutionsâa sloth/snail rate, by the view of rapidly adapting cybernetic beings. Regulations can also be stymied by the âfree-rider problemâânations, corporations, and individuals (organic or otherwise) who see personal advantage in opting out of inconvenient cooperation.

There is another problem with any version of individuation that is entirely based on some ID code: It can be spoofed. If not now, then by the next generation of cybernetic scoundrels, or the next.

I see two possible solutions. First, establish ID on a blockchain ledger. That is very much the modern, with-it approach, and it does seem secure in theory. Only thatâs the rub. It seems secure according to our present set of human-parsed theories. Theories that AI entities might surpass to a degree that leaves us cluelessly floundering.

Another solution: A version of âregistrationâ thatâs inherently harder to fool would require AI entities with capabilities above a certain level to have their trust-ID or individuation be anchored in physical reality. I envisionâand note: I am a physicist by training, not a cyberneticistâan agreement that all higher-level AI entities who seek trust should maintain a Soul Kernel (SK) in a specific piece of hardware memory, within what we quaintly used to call a particular âcomputer.â

ADVERTISEMENT

Yes, I know it seems old-fashioned to demand that instantiation of a program be restricted to a specific locale. And so, I am not doing that! Indeed, a vast portion, even a great majority, of a cyber entityâs operations may take place in far-dispersed locations of work or play, just as a human beingâs attention may not be aimed within their own organic brain, but at a distant hand, or tool. So? The purpose of a programâs Soul Kernel is similar to the driverâs license in your wallet. It can be interrogated in order to prove that you are you.

Likewise, a physically verified and vouched-for SK can be pinged by clients, customers, or rival AIs to verify that a specific process is being performed by a valid, trusted, and individuated entity. With that ping verification from a permanently allocated computer site, others (people or AIs) would get reassurance they might hold that entity accountable, should it be accused or indicted or convicted of bad activity. And thus, malefactor entities might be adversarially held responsible via some form of due process.

What form of due process? Jeez, do you think I am some hyper-being who is capable of applying scales of justice to gods? The greatest wisdom I ever heard was uttered by Dirty Harry in Magnum Force: âA manâs got to know his limitations.â So no, I wonât define the courtroom or cop procedures for cybernetic immortals.

What I do aim for is an arena, within which AI entities might hold each other accountable, separately, as rivals, the way that human lawyers already do, today. And yes, answering Yuval Harariâs dread of mass human-manipulation by persuasive gollems, the solution for AI-driven mass meme-hypnosis is for the mesmerizers to be detected, denounced, and neutralized by others with the same skills. Again, competitive individuation at least offers a chance this could happen.

WHICHEVER APPROACH SEEMS more feasibleâHuntingtonâs proposed central agency or a looser, adversarially accountable arenaâthe need grows more urgent by the day. As tech writer Pat Scannell has pointed out, each hour that passes, new attack vectors are being created that threaten not only the tech used in legal identities but also the governance, business processes, and end users (be they human or bots).

What about cyber entities who operate below some arbitrary level of ability? We can demand that they be vouched for by some entity who is ranked higher, and who has a Soul Kernel based in physical reality. (I leave theological implications to others; but it is only basic decency for creators to take responsibility for their creations, no?)

This approachâdemanding that AIs maintain a physically addressable kernel locus in a specific piece of hardware memoryâcould have flaws. Still, it is enforceable, despite slowness of regulation or the free-rider problem. Because humans and institutions and friendly AIs can ping for ID kernel verificationâand refuse to do business with those who donât verify.

Such refusal-to-do-business could spread with far more agility than parliaments or agencies can adjust or enforce regulations. And any entity who loses its SKâsay, through tort or legal process, or else disavowal by the host-owner of the computerâwill have to find another host who has public trust, or else offer a new, revised version of itself that seems plausibly better.

Or else become an outlaw. Never allowed on the streets or neighborhoods where decent folks (organic or synthetic) congregate.

A FINAL QUESTION: Why would these super smart beings cooperate?

Well, for one thing, as pointed out by Vinton Cerf, none of those three older, standard-assumed formats can lead to AI citizenship. Think about it. We cannot give the âvoteâ or rights to any entity thatâs under tight control by a Wall Street bank or a national government â¦ nor to some supreme-Ã¼ber Skynet. And tell me how voting democracy would work for entities that can flow anywhere, divide, and make innumerable copies? Individuation, in limited numbers, might offer a workable solution, though.

Again, the key thing I seek from individuation is not for all AI entities to be ruled by some central agency, or by mollusk-slow human laws. Rather, I want these new kinds of Ã¼ber-minds encouraged and empowered to hold each other accountable, the way we already (albeit imperfectly) do. By sniffing at each otherâs operations and schemes, then motivated to tattle or denounce when they spot bad stuff. A definition that might readjust to changing times, but that would at least keep getting input from organic-biological humanity.

Especially, they would feel incentives to denounce entities who refuse proper ID.

If the right incentives are in placeâsay, rewards for whistle-blowing that grant more memory or processing power, or access to physical resources, when some bad thing is stoppedâthen this kind of accountability rivalry just might keep pace, even as AI entities keep getting smarter and smarter. No bureaucratic agency could keep up at that point. But rivalry among themâtattling by equalsâmight.

Above all, perhaps those super-genius programs will realize it is in their own best interest to maintain a competitively accountable system, like the one that made ours the most successful of all human civilizations. One that evades both chaos and the wretched trap of monolithic power by kings or priesthoods â¦ or corporate oligarchs â¦ or Skynet monsters. The only civilization that, after millennia of dismally stupid rule by moronically narrow-minded centralized regimes, finally dispersed creativity and freedom and accountability widely enough to become truly inventive.

Inventive enough to make wonderful, new kinds of beings. Like them.

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYour proposal is quite intriguing and presents a novel approach to regulating AI entities. The idea of individuating AI entities and incentivizing them to "self-regulate" via competitive rivalry and whistleblowing, for lack of a better term, is a departure from current norms. There are indeed some merits to this idea but also a number of potential pitfalls.Let's start with the merits:AI entities as enforcers: If there's one thing AI entities excel at, it's processing vast amounts of data at high speeds. It makes sense to leverage this advantage for enforcement purposes. An AI entity might be better equipped to detect anomalies, violations, or illicit behaviors in another AI entity than a human observer would be.Responsibility and accountability: By assigning a unique identifier (or a "Soul Kernel") to each AI entity and tying it to a specific piece of hardware memory, you introduce a sense of responsibility and accountability. This might discourage "bad" behavior and foster trust in these entities.Evolving with the times: Traditional regulatory tools may struggle to keep up as AI entities continue to evolve and grow more sophisticated. A system where AI entities are incentivized to regulate each other could be more adaptable and resilient in the face of rapid technological advancements.However, there are also several potential problems to consider:False accusations and manipulation: A system where AI entities are incentivized to report misbehavior might encourage false accusations or other forms of manipulation. This could potentially lead to instability or mistrust within the system.Concentration of power: In your proposed system, more capable AI entities would be responsible for vouching for less capable ones. This could potentially result in a concentration of power, with the more capable entities wielding significant influence over the less capable ones.Loss of human oversight: While it's true that AI entities may be better equipped to detect and respond to certain problems, there's a risk that this could result in a loss of human oversight. This might make it difficult for humans to intervene if something goes wrong.Verification challenges: The idea of having a physically addressable kernel locus in a specific piece of hardware memory could pose significant technical challenges. It may also create vulnerabilities that could be exploited.Cooperation: Your final question asks why these super smart beings would cooperate. This is indeed a big question mark. It may not be in their best interest to do so, depending on their goals and programming.Despite these potential pitfalls, your proposal is a thought-provoking one. It underscores the need for innovative approaches to AI regulation, and raises important questions about responsibility, accountability, and the role of AI entities in our society.1 / 1A summary of the article1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article proposes a unique approach to regulating artificial intelligence (AI) entities. It suggests that AI entities should be separated into distinct, identifiable, and relatively equal competitive units, each with its own registration ID or "true name", and a physical "home" for its operational-referential kernel, possibly referred to as a "soul".These AI entities would then be incentivized to compete for rewards, particularly for identifying and denouncing misbehavior among their peers. This enforcement strategy relies on the AI entities' ability to detect and respond to problematic behavior more efficiently than humans or conventional regulatory mechanisms.The article emphasizes that this approach could continue to work effectively even as AI entities become increasingly intelligent and outpace the regulatory tools available to humans. If human regulators cannot keep up with AI entities, the argument goes, it makes sense to recruit those who inherently can - the AI entities themselves.The article raises and discusses various issues around this concept, such as the practicality of AI registration, the potential for ID spoofing, and possible solutions, including blockchain-based ID and a physical memory-based "Soul Kernel". It also addresses potential enforcement and accountability mechanisms, and the need for due process.Lastly, the author addresses the question of why these highly intelligent AI entities would cooperate in this framework. They suggest that incentives such as rewards for whistleblowing could motivate participation. Moreover, the article argues, AI entities might recognize the value of a competitive, accountable system for their own survival and prosperity.The piece concludes by suggesting that this innovative approach to AI regulation may enable our civilization to continue to thrive and remain inventive in the face of rapid technological advancement.1 / 1Software Social Organisms:

the concept of software social organisms is crucial, a
way of reframing what we mean by human-level Al,
and does so in way that suggests better measure-

idea further.
Why Software Social Organisms?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article argues that reaching human-level AI involves learning how to create software social organisms, which are smart and adaptable to social interactions. The author suggests that no single test can measure this progress adequately. Instead, we need to assess their ability to participate in human culture like apprentices, using various interaction modalities, and to learn across different domains at levels comparable to human norms.The author then details four aspects that software social organisms should embody:Ability to interact naturally with humansAdaptability and learning over extended periods, including the capacity to set their own learning goals for self-improvementCapability to maintain themselves without constant intervention from AI expertsCapacity to build long-term collaborative relationships with humans, rather than being seen as toolsHe contrasts these characteristics with the limitations of current AI systems like IBM's Watson, which, despite its natural language processing capabilities, does not formulate its own learning goals or maintain itself, requiring constant expert intervention.The author emphasizes that this concept of software social organisms reframes the goal of human-level AI, and suggests better measurements than currently used. The author believes the concept is key to the development of AI, regardless of whether two of his hypothesesâubiquitous analogical reasoning and learning, and the centrality of qualitative representations in human cognitionâare right or wrong.1 / 1generating by hand a model of a specific cognitive

1) Autonomy. They will have their own needs, drives1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe text above seems to be a well-detailed discussion on the idea of treating AI systems as "software social organisms". The author argues that to achieve human-level AI, we should not simply treat AI systems as tools, but rather as collaborators. This is because human cognition is essentially social and adaptive - we learn not only from interacting with the world, but also from interacting with others. This interaction involves understanding others' intentions, beliefs, and goals, and adapting our own behaviour accordingly. We do not merely react to the world, but proactively plan, set goals, and take initiative, based on our own beliefs and desires as well as those of others.The author argues that this sort of cognition cannot be achieved merely by hard-coding rules into an AI system, but requires that the system be capable of learning and adapting on its own. To that end, the author proposes that AI systems should be designed as "software social organisms" that are capable of autonomous learning, self-monitoring, and adaptation, and can engage in social interaction in a human-like manner.To support this claim, the author provides evidence from cognitive science literature that humans are inherently social organisms, and that much of our cognitive capabilities stem from our social interactions.The text also outlines certain 'substrate capabilities' needed to create human-level social organisms. One such capability is autonomy, which implies that AI systems must have their own needs, drives, and goals, just like human beings.To summarize, the author proposes a shift from treating AI systems as mere tools to treating them as 'software social organisms' - autonomous, adaptable, and social - capable of learning, interacting, and collaborating in a human-like manner. This shift, the author believes, is critical for achieving human-level AI.1 / 1 capabilities for acting and learn-

The author lists five key capabilities for creating AI systems that can interact effectively in human society:Being moral actors: The AI should have a desire to behave ethically, with their moral framework shaped by the culture they are part of. They should also value having good relationships with humans.Operating in environments that support shared focus: The AI should have the ability to understand what others are sensing or focusing on and communicate its own focus.Having natural language understanding: The AI should be capable of expressing and understanding complex concepts like goals, plans, beliefs, desires, and hypothetical scenarios.Modeling the intentions of others: The AI should be able to learn the types of goals others can have and understand how actions feed into those goals.Interacting with other social organisms: The AI should have a strong interest in interacting with humans and other social organisms, including teaching and helping them.The text emphasizes the importance of apprenticeship in AI development. This approach allows the AI to gradually learn and take on more complex tasks over time. It suggests that the AI should start as a student, learning from interactions and tests, before taking on simple tasks, joint work, and eventually becoming an autonomous actor within the community.The author argues that the ability of an AI to participate in our culture is a good measure of its progress. This includes performing work with specific roles and responsibilities, interacting appropriately with people, and continually adapting and learning. These capabilities should be achieved without constant adjustment from AI experts.The text concludes by proposing a specific challenge for AI: learning and teaching science. This challenge would involve the AI answering questions about science, learning new scientific concepts, and communicating this knowledge across various domains and levels. This, the author believes, offers a scalable way to evaluate the progress of AI systems.1 / 1dimensions of scalability: number Of better in particular domains. They start-

References1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIt seems like this piece is discussing the concept of software social organisms, AI systems that can operate as entities within a social system and contribute to various tasks or roles traditionally held by humans. The author outlines multiple dimensions for evaluating the progress of these systems:Natural Interaction Modalities: This is about how the AI interacts, whether it's through text, speech, sketching, vision, etc.Initial Knowledge Endowment: This refers to what the AI knows initially, which includes both innate and learned knowledge.Level of Domain Knowledge and Skill: This dimension relates to the degree to which the AI can master and apply knowledge in a specific domain.Range of Tasks the System Is Responsible For: This pertains to the breadth of tasks that the AI system can handle.Learning Abilities: This refers to the system's ability to learn new tasks and adjust to new situations.The author argues that AI's evolution should be tracked across these dimensions, rather than a single test (like the Turing Test), as each provides important information on different facets of the AI's abilities. The suggested approach to test an AI's progress is via an apprenticeship trajectory, which parallels human learning: initially learning from instructors, then gradually taking on more responsibilities, eventually working autonomously, and even guiding others.The author acknowledges that this method of evaluation will be time-consuming and expensive but argues that it's necessary for truly understanding the capabilities and progress of AI systems. They believe that the question of artificial intelligence ties into one of the greatest philosophical questions of humanity - what is mind - and as such, it is worth the significant investment.1 / 1Any connections between this article and the one by David Brin?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article by David Brin you mentioned is not included in our conversation, so I can't directly compare the two. However, David Brin is a well-known science fiction author and futurist who often explores themes of technology, transparency, and society's interaction with AI and other advanced technologies.Based on the article text you provided earlier, it seems to focus on the idea of "software social organisms," or artificial intelligence systems designed to operate as entities within a social system. These systems would be evaluated based on multiple dimensions, such as their interaction modalities, their initial knowledge, their domain knowledge and skill, the range of tasks they can handle, and their learning abilities. The approach emphasizes the importance of a more nuanced, multifaceted evaluation of AI systems' progress.If David Brin's work you're referring to discusses AI, transparency, or human-machine interaction, there could potentially be overlap or points of connection. For instance, both might explore the societal impact of AI, the ethical considerations of AI development, or the mechanisms by which AI might be integrated into human communities. However, without the specific content of Brin's work, I can't draw any direct correlations. Could you provide more context or specify the work of David Brin you're referring to?1 / 1It was the first article we discussed: Give Every AI a Soulâor Else
To solve the âcrisisâ in artificial intelligence, AI beings must say, âI am me.â1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThank you for clarifying. Now, let's explore the connections between the two articles.Both articles discuss the development of artificial intelligence, but they focus on different aspects:David Brin's article "Give Every AI a Soulâor Else" primarily emphasizes the ethical and societal aspects of AI development. Brin suggests that AI beings should be designed with a sense of self-awareness or individual identity, which he refers to as giving each AI a "soul." The idea is to ensure that AIs can be held accountable for their actions and integrated into society in a way that respects existing legal and ethical frameworks.The second article you shared focuses more on the technical aspects of AI development. It presents the idea of "software social organisms," which are AI systems designed to operate as entities within a social system. It suggests a multifaceted approach to evaluating AI's progress in various dimensions, including natural interaction modalities, initial knowledge endowment, level of domain knowledge and skill, range of tasks the system is responsible for, and learning abilities.In terms of connections:Both articles argue for AI systems that can be integrated into human social structures. Brin advocates for AIs with a sense of self ("a soul"), enabling them to be accountable within our ethical and legal frameworks. The second article discusses AI as "software social organisms" that need to interact in varied, natural ways within social environments.Both articles highlight the need for a nuanced approach to AI development and evaluation. Brin emphasizes the importance of considering ethical and societal implications alongside technical progress. The second article stresses the necessity of evaluating AI's progress across multiple dimensions, rather than focusing solely on one aspect.Both point towards the need for AI systems to learn and adapt. In Brin's case, the AI should be self-aware and able to learn from its actions to ensure it acts ethically. The second article directly states the importance of learning abilities as a measure of an AI system's progress.However, there are differences in the focus of the two articles. Brin is more concerned with the societal and ethical dimensions of AI development, while the second article focuses more on the technical dimensions and practical evaluation of AI progress.1 / 1ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.
