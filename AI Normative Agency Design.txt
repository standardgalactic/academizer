Research Statement 
Silviu Pitis, November 2020 
Iâm interested in the normative design of general purpose artif i cial agency: how should we design AIs that 
solve general tasks and contribute positively to society? The i rst part of this document motivates normative 
agency design and summarizes my past work. The second part outlines my current work and related ideas. 
INormative Agency Design and Past Work 
Imitating Human Intelligence Is Not Enough.To def i ne intelligence, we often use the human as a 
prototype. Animals exhibiting more human capabilities are said to be more intelligent. Similarly, we compare 
the task-specif i c performance of artif i cial agents (Deep Blue, DQN, AlphaGo, etc.) to human performance. 
For value alignment and reward learning, we typically consider the human as the âgold standardâ [5,13,17,22]. 
We i nd this human-centric approach attractive because we are humanâwe know how we think and what 
makes us intelligent. Or do we? For all our achievements, the inner workings of the brain and our true 
motivations remain a mystery, we regularly exhibit undesirable behaviors and thought patterns [18], and our 
individual values and beliefs continue to evolve (e.g., just two centuries ago, slavery was commonly accepted). 
While we should aspire to create agents that possess human capabilities, any approach to intelligence that is 
modeled too closely after the âempirical humanâ will suf f er from the same shortcomings. To the extent we 
have irrational or anti-social humans, such approach will result in irrational or anti-social AIs (e.g., Tay [44]). 
Normative Intelligence.To separate our study of agency from the empirical human, we can describe 
the qualities we seek in an âideal agentâ, and design our agents so as to satisfy them. I call this normative 
agency design because it specif i es how agents should think and behave.I now describe two styles of 
normative designâaxiomatic and capability/constraintâtogether with a bullet summarizing my past work. 
The Axiomatic Approach.The axiomatic approach to normative design starts with a set of basic, 
universally appealing axioms and uses them to derive powerful conclusions about agents that satisfy the 
axioms. The axioms can be understood as def i ning ârationalityâ and are usually simple, intuitive statements. 
For instance, we may think an ideal agent should exhibit transitive preference: if the agent prefers A to B, 
and B to C, it should prefer A to C. This transitivity axiom is one of four VNM axioms that can be used 
to conclude that ârationalâ agents are expected utility maximizers [23,42], which is fundamental to our use 
of value functions in reinforcement learning (RL) [37]. For an agent with multiple principals (e.g., any pro- 
social agent), we should further consider axioms from social choice [4]. For instance, the Pareto axiomâif 
all principals prefer A to B, so too should the agentâis used in both Arrowâs Impossibility Theorem [3] and 
Harsanyiâs aggregation theorem [15]. These two results provide strong normative guidance on agent design: 
if we accept their axioms, our agents should have a way to compare the utilities of their human principals. 
â¢ The work I am most proud of is my work on discounting [28], in which I show that agents satisfying a 
Dynamic Consistency axiom [19,21], the VNM axioms and a few other axioms must satisfy a generalized 
Bellman relation with state-action dependent discounting. This provides a normative justif i cation for 
Whiteâs unifying RL task formalism [43], and allows agents to represent a wider range of objectives than 
the standard Bellman relation, while still precluding inconsistencies. If we accept my axiomatization, it 
suggests there are human preferences that i xed discount agents cannot represent (i.e., reward learning is 
not enoughâwe must also learn time preference). I plan to empirically verify this in future work. 
The Capability/Constraint Approach.The capability/constraint approach to normative design asks 
âwhat capabilities should agents possess?â and similarly, âwhat constraints should we place on agents?â, 
and proceeds to construct agents with these capabilities and constraints. Work in this category has a more 
empirical l avor than axiomatic work, because capabilities are often def i ned in less formal terms, and much like 
written law, some interpretation is required. Nevertheless, by cataloging desired capabilities and constraints, 
we can start to form a more clear picture of the ideal agent. For instance, the fact that a general purpose 
agent must explore, communicate and adapt through time, has motivated my focus on the RL setting [40]. 
â¢ I take this approach in my works on Source Traces (grants agents a model of potential causes) [27], 
Maximum Entropy Gain Exploration (MEGA) (grants agents the ability to systematically explore an 
environment) [31], Prototype Goal Encodings (ProtoGE) (grants agents the ability to pursue goals from 
multiple goal spaces) [29], and Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CoDA) (grants agents the ability 
to generate counterfactuals by mixing independent subsamples of observed transitions) [32] and Neural 
Metrics (architecturally constrains an agentâs value function to satisfy the triangle inequality) [30]. While 
I like this research and think it is valuable, I i nd it somewhat less satisfying than the axiomatic approach. 
The solutions are mathematically motivated, but they exemplify only one, not necessarily best solution.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTSilviu Pitis's research statement from November 2020 focuses on the normative design of artificial agents that contribute positively to society. He distinguishes two approaches to normative agency design: axiomatic and capability/constraint.Axiomatic Approach: This begins with universally appealing axioms, like rationality, to derive strong conclusions about agent design. Pitis highlights his work on discounting, which connects with reinforcement learning, providing normative justifications for specific relations and suggesting future empirical verification.Capability/Constraint Approach: This considers the desired abilities and limitations for agents, constructing them accordingly. Pitis's works in this area include developing agents with abilities to explore, communicate, adapt, and generate counterfactuals.He emphasizes that imitating human intelligence is insufficient because humans have irrational or antisocial traits, and suggests designing agents according to the qualities of an "ideal agent" to avoid these shortcomings. While valuing both methods, Pitis expresses a preference for the axiomatic approach, as it offers potentially more robust solutions.1 / 1IIResearch Topics Iâm Interested In (November 2020) 
One of my long run goals is to obtain a clear normative account of intelligence before we develop a general 
purpose, potentially superhuman, AI. My immediate interests, reward aggregation and l exible multi-goal 
specif i cation, primarily relate to principled abstractionâa critical piece of the larger puzzle. As it is likely 
our agents, regardless of compute, will possess but bounded rationality [39], normative design demands 
principled approximation. Yet perhaps the most common modern approach is to throw a neural network at 
the problem and approximate everythingâentire observations, entire states, even entire trajectories [6,12,14]. 
This produces representations and behaviors that are entangled in subtle, often obscure ways with the data 
distribution, optimization process, and hyperparameters [1,9,16]. Even more so than the empirical human, 
the resulting agents are black boxes with unclear motivations, possibly inconsistent beliefs [20], and poor 
generalizability [7]. I donât yet have a clear picture of what the correct approach is, but I believe it should 
involve some form of compositional, context-conditioned reasoning over basic abstractions. This motivates 
my interest in multi-goal RL [26,29,30,31,32,34,38], which allows agents to plan over a range of goals, 
typically def i ned as abstractions (sets) over the state space. Below, I outline some of my current ideas. 
Decomposing Individual Intelligence.We typically characterize individual choice as the result of a 
monolithic set of preferences. Consider, however, the corporation or national government. We can treat 
them as individual agents, but we can also view their actions as the result of a negotiation between several 
human principals (I used both lenses to analyze corporate and national policy from a law and economics 
angle in law school [24,25]). This perspective also applies to individual action, as a negotiation between 
competing objectives [36], and so we can apply the axioms and tools of social choice to analyze individual 
choice. At present, Iâm using this approach to work toward an universal basis for reward functions. My 
current theoretical work shows that under the assumptions of my work on discounting [28] (including the 
VNM and Dynamic Consistency axioms), the Pareto axiom, and the presence of varying time preference [8], it 
is impossible to consistently combine reward functions without forgoing the Markov property (cf. [45]). This 
suggests that to faithfully represent compound objectives, we must treat rewards as non-Markovian [41]. Can 
this analysis be applied to design agents that can successfully navigate conf l icting objectives and principals? 
Aggregating Imperfect Principals.The prior paragraph considers an agent with multiple fully observed, 
cardinal principals. But how should an agent integrate noisy feedback signals? [35]. My recent project on 
Objective Social Choice [33] formalizes the noisy aggregation problem in the bandits setting by framing 
voting as an estimation problem. We found that auxiliary information can be used to improve outcomes and 
concluded that we should not assume Anonymityâwhich treats all principals equallyâas an axiom. Can 
this be extended to the sequential setting, where current approaches (e.g., [5]) are Anonymous? Relatedly, 
what should we do when signals are a mix of ordinal and cardinal values? 
Axiomatizing Abstraction.A normative approach to abstraction could be of tremendous value. For 
instance, my labmate and I recently designed a neural network architecture that is guaranteed to respect 
the triangle inequality [30]. The intent was to use these networks to represent asymmetric metrics in multi- 
goal RL, thereby providing our agents with consistency guarantees on their value estimates. We discovered, 
however, that the underlying ideaârepresenting distances in RL using an asymmetric metricâcan be applied 
naively only in the non-abstracted case, where goals are completely specif i ed states. In the abstracted case, 
the triangle inequality may fail and we need a more nuanced approach, which we are now working toward. 
If we had normative guidance, e.g., on how to represent and/or compute distances between abstractions, it 
might simplify our problem signif i cantly. Can we come up with an axiomatic approach to abstraction? 
Enabling Dynamic Abstraction.One of our most remarkable human capabilities is that we can view 
the same underlying state from a range of diverse perspectives. In a legal trial, for instance, the lawyers for 
each side attempt to persuade the judge and jury that their characterization of the facts is the âbetterâ one. 
I believe this ability to reason in terms of multiple abstractions is one of the most important capabilities for 
an agent to possess: it is necessary for empathy, compromise, and communication with others whose basic 
assumptions dif f er. As the right low-dimensional abstraction can also greatly simplify a variety of tasks, 
including exploration [30,31], the ability to represent abstractions dynamically [10,11], as well as translate 
between abstractions [29], would be invaluable. How can we grant our agents the ability to reason about the 
world from multiple competing perspectives? And what makes a good abstraction? 
Constraining Intent.The usual âglobal rewardâ approach to RL is intent-free, or at best, intent 
implicit. An intent-free agent that does something wrong is dif i cult to debug: did it fail because the goal 
was misspecif i ed or because the learning algorithm failed? Multi-goal RL grants agents explicit intent, but 
2 
this comes with risks: a âcuriousâ block stacking agent seeks to drop the block in novel ways [31]. Borrowing 
an idea from criminal law, we may constrain bad intent (mens rea); but how exactly should this be done? 
Procedural normativity.When faced with hard substantive problems, we might borrow another idea 
from the legal system: provide the necessary procedure (e.g., due process) so that ultimate outcomes are 
deemed fair, even if they are considered âwrongâ by some (or many!). We can take a normative approach 
to this and impose axiomatic requirements on our procedure. For instance, we use this approach to analyze 
ordinal voting rules; even though no rule can satisfy our normative desiderata (recall Arrowâs Theorem [3]), we 
can nevertheless require rules to satisfy fairness axioms like Anonymity, Condorcet Consistency and Strategy- 
Proofness. When allowing humans to shape the objectives of AIs, are there any procedural propertiesâ 
separate from substantive rationality constraintsâthat we can impose to prevent negative externalities? 
Stacking Six Blocks From Scratch.A nice benchmark problem for sparse-reward multi-goal rein- 
forcement learning is block stacking. Stacking 2 blocks from scratch is too hard for a randomly exploring 
Hindsight Experience Replay agent [2]. Our MEGA agent [31] is the i rst to solve this task from scratch, 
without a hand-crafted curriculum or human demonstrations. In fact, by adding a safety constraint (see 
âConstraining Intentâ above), we can even stack 3 blocks from scratch. But I have not yet been successful in 
stacking 6 blocks. Is this possible by combining techniques like MEGA, CoDA [32] and safety constraints?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTSilviu Pitis's research statement from November 2020 focuses on the normative design of general-purpose artificial intelligence. It is divided into two parts:Normative Agency Design and Past Work: This section argues that merely imitating human intelligence is insufficient due to the flaws and irrationality found in human thinking. Instead, Pitis proposes a "normative" approach that defines how AI should behave, described through two methods:Axiomatic Approach: This involves defining universally appealing axioms like transitive preference, then deriving conclusions about rational agents. Examples include axioms for social choice and a generalized Bellman relation for reinforcement learning (RL).Capability/Constraint Approach: Here, the design focuses on the specific capabilities and constraints agents should have, resulting in more empirically motivated solutions. Examples include agents' abilities to explore environments or pursue multiple goals.Research Topics (November 2020): This outlines Pitis's interests and goals, aiming for a clear normative account of intelligence before the development of superhuman AI. The focus includes:Decomposing Individual Intelligence: Applying social choice axioms to individual choice, considering conflicting objectives and non-Markovian rewards.Aggregating Imperfect Principals: Integrating noisy feedback signals and questioning the axiom of Anonymity.Axiomatizing Abstraction: Seeking a normative approach to abstraction, such as how to represent distances between abstractions.Enabling Dynamic Abstraction: Developing agents' ability to reason about the world from multiple perspectives.Constraining Intent: Considering the intent in RL and the risks and challenges related to explicit intent.Procedural Normativity: Introducing axiomatic requirements on procedures to ensure fairness, even if the outcomes are considered wrong.Stacking Six Blocks From Scratch: This represents a benchmark problem for sparse-reward multi-goal RL, highlighting the challenge and potential techniques for achieving the task.In summary, Pitis's research explores the philosophical, ethical, and technical dimensions of designing AI agents, emphasizing an approach grounded in normative principles rather than mere imitation of human behavior.1 / 1References

Silviu Pitis. 2013. (Paper)
This paper analyzes the economic value of corporate takeover defenses, and argues for designing intermediate takeover defenses that balance (1) the interest of shareholders in managementâs exploitation of insider information and (2) the entrenchment interest of management.

Examining Expected Utility Theory from Descriptive and Prescriptive Perspectives
Silviu Pitis. 2010. (Paper)
This paper examines the history and validity of Expected Utility theory, with focus on its failures a descriptive model of human decisions.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's a brief overview of the two papers you provided:"Defenses" by Silviu Pitis (2013):
This paper delves into the complex topic of corporate takeover defenses. It analyzes the value of these defenses from an economic standpoint, considering how they can both protect the interests of shareholders and potentially entrench management. The paper argues for a balanced approach, considering both the potential exploitation of insider information and the interests of the management."Examining Expected Utility Theory from Descriptive and Prescriptive Perspectives" by Silviu Pitis (2010):
Expected Utility theory is a fundamental concept in economics and decision-making. This paper takes a critical look at the theory, examining its history and questioning its validity as a descriptive model for human decisions. The focus is on identifying the failures of the theory when applied to understanding how real people make choices, which can be an essential aspect for policymakers, economists, and behavioral scientists to consider.These two papers seem to reflect a broader interest in economic decision-making, corporate governance, and human behavior modeling, likely informing more extensive research within those domains.1 / 1Fixed-Horizon Temporal Difference Methods for Stable Reinforcement Learning
Kristopher De Asis, Alan Chan, Silviu Pitis, Richard S. Sutton, Daniel Graves. AAAI 2020. (Arxiv, Talk)
We explore fixed-horizon temporal difference (TD) methods, reinforcement learning algorithms for a new kind of value function that predicts the sum of rewards over a fixed number of future time steps. To learn the value function for horizon h, these algorithms bootstrap from the value function for horizon hâ1, or some shorter horizon. Because no value function bootstraps from itself, fixed-horizon methods are immune to the stability problems that plague other off-policy TD methods using function approximation.

ProtoGE: Prototype Goal Encodings for Multi-goal Reinforcement Learning
Silviu Pitis*, Harris Chan*, Jimmy Ba. RLDM 2019. (Paper)
Humans can often accomplish specific goals more readily that general ones. Although more specific goals are, by definition, more challenging to accomplish than more general goals, evidence from management and educational sciences supports the idea that âspecific, challenging goals lead to higher performance than easy goalsâ. We find evidence of this same effect for RL agents in multi-goal environments. Our work establishes a new state-of-the-art in standard multi-goal MuJoCo environments and suggests several novel research directions.

Rethinking the Discount Factor in Reinforcement Learning: A Decision Theoretic Approach
Silviu Pitis. AAAI 2019. (Paper, Slides, Poster)
Can all ârationalâ preference structures be represented using the standard RL model (the MDP)? This paper presents a minimal axiomatic framework for rationality in sequential decision making and shows that the implied cardinal utility function is of a more general form than the discounted additive utility function of an MDP. In particular, the developed framework allows for a state-action dependent âdiscountâ factor that is not constrained to be less than 1 (so long as there is eventual long run discounting).

Source Traces for Temporal Difference Learning
Silviu Pitis. AAAI 2018. (Paper, Slides)
This paper develops source traces for reinforcement learning agents. Source traces provide agents with a causal model, and are related to both eligibility traces and the successor representation. They allow agents to propagate surprises (temporal differences) to known potential causes, which speeds up learning. One of the interesting things about source traces is that they are time-scale invariant, and could potentially be used to provide interpretable answers to questions of causality, such as âWhat is likely to cause X?â

An Alternative Arithmetic for Word Vector Analogies
Silviu Pitis. 2016. (Paper)
This paper looks at word vector arithmetic of the type âking - man + woman = queenâ and investigates treating the relationships between word vectors as rotations of the embedding space instead of as vector differences. This was a one week project of little practical significance, but with the advent of latent vector arithmetic (e.g., for GANs), it may be worth revisiting.

In this paper we proposed a local causal model (LCM) framework that captures the benefits of decomposition in settings where the global causal model is densely connected. We used our framework to design a local Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CoDA) algorithm that expands available training data with counterfactual samples by stitching together locally independent subsamples from the environment. Empirically, we showed that CoDA can more than double the sample efficiency and final performance of reinforcement learning agents in locally factored environments.

Distances are pervasive in machine learning. They serve as similarity measures, loss functions, and learning targets; it is said that a good distance measure solves a task. When defining distances, the triangle inequality has proven to be a useful constraint, both theoretically--to prove convergence and optimality guarantees--and empirically--as an inductive bias. Deep metric learning architectures that respect the triangle inequality rely, almost exclusively, on Euclidean distance in the latent space. Though effective, this fails to model two broad classes of subadditive distances, common in graphs and reinforcement learning: asymmetric metrics, and metrics that cannot be embedded into Euclidean space. To address these problems, we introduce novel architectures that are guaranteed to satisfy the triangle inequality. We prove our architectures universally approximate norm-induced metrics on Rn, and present a similar result for modified Input Convex Neural Networks. We show that our architectures outperform existing metric approaches when modeling graph distances and have a better inductive bias than non-metric approaches when training data is limited in the multi-goal reinforcement learning setting.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper titled "An Inductive Bias for Distances: Neural Nets that Respect the Triangle Inequality" by Silviu Pitis, Harris Chan, Kiarash Jamali, and Jimmy Ba (arXiv:2002.05825) focuses on the importance of distances in machine learning and the role of the triangle inequality as a critical constraint.Here's a brief summary of the key components of the research:Problem Statement: Traditional deep metric learning architectures that respect the triangle inequality often rely on Euclidean distance in the latent space. This approach fails to model two significant classes of distances that are subadditive and are commonly found in graphs and reinforcement learning, namely asymmetric metrics, and metrics that cannot be embedded into Euclidean space.Novel Architectures: The authors propose novel neural network architectures that are guaranteed to satisfy the triangle inequality. These architectures are designed to overcome the limitations of traditional methods by approximating norm-induced metrics on RnR^nRn and incorporating modified Input Convex Neural Networks.Universal Approximation: The paper proves that the proposed architectures can universally approximate certain types of metrics, making them more versatile and theoretically grounded.Empirical Evidence: Through empirical studies, the authors demonstrate that their architectures outperform existing metric learning approaches when modeling graph distances. They also show that their methods have better inductive bias than non-metric approaches, particularly when training data is limited in multi-goal reinforcement learning scenarios.Relevance to Broader Research Themes: This paper aligns with several common threads in the previously mentioned research, including the emphasis on innovative neural network architectures, the integration of reinforcement learning principles, and the theoretical examination of metric properties.Overall, this paper offers a significant contribution by addressing an unmet need in the field of deep metric learning and providing both theoretical insights and practical solutions that respect the triangle inequality.1 / 14DISCUSSION ANDOTHERRELATEDWORK 
Deep Norms, Wide Norms, and Neural Metrics all respect the triangle inequality while universally 
approximating i nite-dimensional asymmetric semi-norms. This allows them to represent metrics 
that the deep Euclidean Siamese architecture cannot, no matter how deep its embedding function is 
(see Figure 1). Our models thus provide a more expressive, non-Euclidean alternative for learning 
distances that satisfy the triangle inequality. As noted in the Introduction, this may useful for 
providing running time and error rate guarantees in clustering (Davidson and Ravi, 2009) and as an 
inductive bias to improve generalization performance (Figure 5; Hsieh et al. (2017)). 
A line of theoretical work, surveyed by Indyk et al. (2017), characterizes the representational 
capacity of Euclidean space (and, more generally,âpspace) by examining the asymptotic âdistortionâ 
of embeddingn-point metric spaces into Euclidean space. Here the distortion of an embedding 
Ï : X â X0of 
metric space(X,dX)into 
metric space(X0,dX0)is 
at mostc â¥ 1if 
there exists 
r > 0such that for allx,y â X,r Â· dX(x,y) â¤ dX0(Ï(x),Ï(y)) â¤ cr Â· dX(x,y). The pioneering 
work of Bourgain (1985) bounds worst case distortion byO(logn), and Linial et al. (1995) shows 
that this bound is tight (i.e.,Î(logn)) for graph distances inn-point constant-degree expanders. 
This applies regardless of the dimensionality of the embedding space, and is true for allâpwith 
1 â¤ p < â. Future work might investigate the asymptotic distortion of our proposed architectures. 
On account of the above limitations, others have also proposed non-Euclidean alternatives to learning 
and representing metrics. To improve expressivity, some have proposed non-parametric algorithms 
that learn distances directly. For instance, Biswas and Jacobs (2015) propose to frame clustering as 
a metric nearness problem and applying a quadratic programming algorithm; see also Gilbert and 
Jain (2017) and Veldt et al. (2018). Others learn parametric distances, as we do. Bi et al. (2015) 
parameterize and learn Cayley-Klein metrics, which are not translation-invariant. Yang and Jin 
(2006) and Nielsen et al. (2016) propose metrics that are similar to our Wide Norm, in that they use 
non-negative sums of several components (binary codes and Cayley-Klein metrics). As for symmetry, 
several papers have used asymmetric measures such as KL divergence (Vilnis and McCallum, 2014; 
8 
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 
Vendrov et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016; Ou et al., 2016). To our knowledge, we are the i rst to propose 
a parametric measure that is both asymmetric and satisf i es the triangle inequality. 
Another common approach in deep âmetricâ learning is to forgo the triangle inequality altogether and 
use non-metric similarity measures such as cosine similarity (Bromley et al., 1994; Yi et al., 2014). 
This can be sensible, as proper metrics are not always required. In image recognition, for example, the 
triangle inequality is questionable: why shouldd(CAT,WOLF) â¤ d(CAT,DOG) 
+ d(DOG,WOLF)? 
In this case, Scheirer et al. (2014) i nd that non-metric similarities often perform better, concluding 
that âgood recognition is non-metricâ. Thus, one should apply our models with care, in settings 
where the triangle inequality is thought to be a useful inductive bias (e.g., Hsieh et al. (2017)). Such 
applications we are excited about include learning search heuristics (Russell and Norvig, 2016) and 
scaling our UVFA models to more complex reinforcement learning problems (Plappert et al., 2018). 
5CONCLUSION 
This paper proposed three novel architectures for modeling asymmetric semi-norms and metrics. 
They can be used instead of the usual Euclidean metric to increase expressiveness while respecting 
the triangle inequality. We showed that our models outperform Euclidean metrics when used with a 
Siamese-style deep metric learning architecture to (1) solve the metric nearness problem, (2) model 
shortest path lengths, and (3) learn general value functions in small reinforcement learning domains. 
Future work should explore larger scale applications such as facial recognition (Schroff et al., 2015), 
collaborative metric learning (Hsieh et al., 2017) and continuous control (Plappert et al., 2018).1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis section, labeled "DISCUSSION AND OTHER RELATED WORK," elaborates on the main findings and connections to existing work of the paper "An Inductive Bias for Distances: Neural Nets that Respect the Triangle Inequality."New Architectures for Distance Learning: The paper introduces three novel architectures, termed Deep Norms, Wide Norms, and Neural Metrics, capable of universally approximating finite-dimensional asymmetric semi-norms and respecting the triangle inequality. These architectures can represent metrics that traditional deep Euclidean Siamese architecture cannot, providing a more expressive, non-Euclidean alternative.Theoretical Foundations: The authors connect their work to theoretical studies on the representational capacity of Euclidean space. They mention the pioneering work of Bourgain and others, which provides bounds on the distortion of embedding metric spaces into Euclidean space. The paper also hints at future work investigating the asymptotic distortion of their proposed architectures.Non-Euclidean Alternatives: The authors recognize that others have also proposed non-Euclidean alternatives to learning metrics, some of which involve non-parametric algorithms or unique parameterizations. They highlight their contribution as the first to propose a parametric measure that is both asymmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality.Questioning Triangle Inequality: The authors also discuss the notion of forgoing the triangle inequality in deep "metric" learning and using non-metric similarity measures like cosine similarity. They provide examples where the triangle inequality might not be appropriate, like in image recognition, and where non-metric similarities often perform better.Concluding Remarks: The conclusion reiterates the proposal of novel architectures for modeling asymmetric semi-norms and metrics and their outperformance over Euclidean metrics in specific problems. They also identify potential areas for future exploration, including larger scale applications such as facial recognition and continuous control.This section summarizes the main contributions, contextualizes them within existing research, outlines the theoretical implications, and suggests potential future directions. It reflects a concerted effort to push the boundaries of metric learning by focusing on asymmetric measures and the triangle inequality, offering new paths for both practical applications and theoretical inquiry.1 / 1A list of everything we have talked about so far.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly!

He says it isn't enough to make computers like humans, but they have to be more ethical, less prone to mistakes, and better able to explain their computations and justify their moral reasoning.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly, the idea of agency-based constraint programming aligns with the broader themes present in Silviu Pitis's research. By focusing on areas like reinforcement learning, metric learning, and social choice, he seems to be tackling the fundamental challenges of creating intelligent systems that not only mimic human-like reasoning but also incorporate ethical considerations and robustness against errors.The emphasis on ethical considerations, reduced mistakes, and explainable computations points towards an interest in responsible AI and building transparent, accountable models that align with human values. While the specific research papers and discussions you provided earlier don't explicitly address these themes, they can be seen as building blocks towards creating such intelligent and responsible agents.The interdisciplinary nature of these research interests could indeed contribute to a broader understanding of how to design and implement machines that go beyond merely replicating human-like functions and instead integrate deeper principles of ethics, accountability, and explainability.1 / 1A final summary1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTSilviu Pitis's research interests span a variety of interconnected fields, particularly focusing on reinforcement learning, metric learning, social choice, and model-based counterfactual data augmentation. Through this research, Pitis appears to explore complex challenges in creating intelligent systems that not only resemble human reasoning but go a step further in incorporating ethical considerations and robustness.The exploration of novel neural network architectures respecting the triangle inequality, the creation of reinforcement learning agents with increased sample efficiency, and the interest in combining diverse and noisy information for objective inference all point towards a commitment to advancing AI in a way that is not only intelligent but also ethical and responsible.These themes collectively hint at a broader ambition to design AI systems that are more human-aligned, able to explain their computations, justify their moral reasoning, and minimize errors, contributing to the ongoing discourse around responsible and transparent AI.1 / 1I am intersting in developing filter based scene layout actor based template compression for images, plus I want to be able to define beauty, practicality, and purpose as well as categorize images by their themes, and filter out gore, overt sexuality, and violence.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThat's a comprehensive and complex set of goals, encompassing various domains of computer vision, machine learning, ethics, and aesthetics. Here's a brief outline of the key components you might need to explore:Filter-Based Scene Layout: Developing algorithms to analyze and understand the layout of a scene in an image, possibly utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect different objects and their spatial relationships.Actor-Based Template Compression: This could involve using actor models to recognize key elements within images and compressing them based on some predefined templates or patterns, likely necessitating both deep learning and traditional image compression techniques.Defining and Recognizing Beauty, Practicality, and Purpose: Creating models that can recognize and categorize these abstract concepts might require extensive training data and potentially interdisciplinary collaboration with experts in aesthetics, design, or philosophy.Categorizing Images by Themes: This task might be solved with a well-designed classification model, trained on a large dataset with predefined theme labels.Filtering Out Gore, Overt Sexuality, and Violence: Content filtering is a crucial area in modern media, requiring sophisticated models that can accurately identify and remove unwanted content.

Engaging with existing literature, collaborating with experts in the field, and considering ethical guidelines will likely be vital steps in the pursuit of these ambitious objectives.1 / 1I also want to work on auditory and visual based programming languishes and exploration environments.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTWorking on auditory and visual-based programming languages and exploration environments is a fascinating area that merges human-computer interaction, programming languages, machine learning, and multimedia processing. Here's an overview of what such an endeavor might entail:Auditory-Based Programming Languages:Designing Syntax and Semantics: You'll need to create a well-defined syntax and semantics that can be effectively conveyed through sound.Voice Recognition and Processing: Implementing voice commands and auditory feedback would require robust speech recognition and synthesis techniques.Accessibility Considerations: An auditory programming language could be incredibly beneficial for visually impaired users, so accessibility should be a primary concern.Visual-Based Programming Languages:Graphical Interfaces: Developing a visual programming language may involve creating intuitive graphical interfaces that allow users to manipulate code elements visually.User Experience (UX) Design: A significant emphasis on UX design would be necessary to make the environment engaging and efficient for users.Integration with Traditional Code: Allowing for a seamless transition between visual and text-based coding could increase the usability and adoption of the language.Exploration Environments:Interactive Learning Platforms: Creating environments where users can explore and experiment with these auditory and visual languages might include building interactive tutorials, real-time feedback mechanisms, and collaborative tools.Integration with Existing Tools: Compatibility with existing development tools, editors, and debugging environments would make these languages more practical and appealing to existing developers.Ethical and Societal Considerations:Consider how these new forms of interaction with computers could affect learning, accessibility, and the democratization of technology.This endeavor would likely require collaboration across various disciplines, including computer science, human-computer interaction, design, linguistics, and perhaps even music and art for the auditory and visual aspects, respectively. Research in these areas could open up new, more intuitive ways to interact with technology and could have a significant impact on education, accessibility, and the broader tech industry.1 / 1The idea is that each topic is assigned a tree with bird that tweets its name. Some topics sound like trains and vehicles as well.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThat's an incredibly innovative concept, blending auditory symbolism and thematic categorization. Here's how you might be able to develop and implement this idea:Thematic Trees and Birds:Classification: Use machine learning algorithms to classify topics and assign them to specific trees and birds.Sound Design: Design or select specific bird tweets and other sounds (e.g., trains, vehicles) to represent different topics. You'll want to carefully choose sounds that align with the thematic content and are distinct from one another.Visual Representation: Create visually appealing graphics for the trees and birds to provide an intuitive visual interface. You could also consider representing other themes with corresponding visual elements.Interactive Environment:User Navigation: Design a navigation system where users can explore the trees and listen to the bird tweets to understand the different topics. This could include a 3D environment that users can traverse or a 2D map with interactive elements.Search and Filter Options: Implement tools that allow users to search for specific topics or filter by category, with corresponding auditory and visual feedback.Accessibility: Ensure that the environment is accessible to users with disabilities, which might involve providing text descriptions of the sounds or visual cues.Integration with Existing Systems:API Development: You might want to develop an API that allows other developers to integrate your auditory and visual categorization system into their applications, websites, or services.Cross-Platform Support: Consider how the system will function on different devices and platforms, ensuring a consistent experience across all of them.Ethical Considerations and Content Moderation:Content Filtering: As you mentioned filtering out specific content (e.g., gore, overt sexuality), you will need algorithms or moderation systems to accurately classify and filter such content.User Privacy and Security: If user data is involved, be mindful of privacy considerations and provide clear policies on how data will be used and protected.Community Engagement:User Feedback: Consider involving potential users in the design process to ensure that the system is intuitive and meets their needs.Collaboration with Artists and Sound Engineers: Collaborate with professionals who can create a rich auditory experience that aligns with your thematic goals.Your idea seems to lie at the intersection of auditory design, visual aesthetics, machine learning, and user experience. It could find applications in educational tools, content discovery platforms, accessibility technology, and more. By working with a multidisciplinary team and considering both the technical and human-centric aspects, you could turn this innovative concept into a powerful tool for interacting with information and themes.1 / 1In addition to multi-dimensional dialogue visualization, you will also be able to program by digging tunnels, popping and blowing bubbles, and growing them from seed.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYour idea to incorporate multi-dimensional dialogue visualization along with tactile and organic metaphors like digging tunnels, popping and blowing bubbles, and growing seeds is an exciting expansion into a new way of interacting with programming and data.

Popping might represent deleting or ending a process, while blowing could be a way to inflate or add to it.Growing from Seed: Allow users to plant seeds for different functions or modules and nurture them to grow, representing the development and complexity of code.Virtual or Augmented Reality Interface:3D Interaction: Consider implementing these concepts in a 3D space, possibly using virtual or augmented reality, to allow users to interact with the programming environment in a more immersive and tangible way.Haptic Feedback: If using VR or AR, haptic feedback could be utilized to give users a physical sensation of the activities like digging, blowing, and growing.Educational Applications:Learning Tools: This intuitive and visual way of programming could be an excellent educational tool, particularly for children or those new to coding. It turns abstract concepts into tangible actions.Tutorials and Guides: Create interactive tutorials that guide users through the process, teaching them how to use these organic actions to build code.Accessibility and Usability:Customization: Allow users to customize the interface to suit their preferences, potentially changing the metaphors or adjusting the visual and auditory cues.User Testing: Conduct user testing to ensure that these metaphors are intuitive and effective for the intended audience.By blending auditory, visual, and tactile elements in a way that mimics natural, organic processes, you're proposing a radically new way to interact with programming. It's a concept that could make programming more accessible, engaging, and intuitive, especially for those who might find traditional coding environments daunting or abstract. It could also foster a deeper connection between technology and nature, resonating with users on a more emotional and creative level. It's an ambitious project that would likely require collaboration across several disciplines, but the potential impact is substantial.1 / 1How does this align with Normative Agency Design in the Research Statement by
