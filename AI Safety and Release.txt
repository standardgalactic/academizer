I agree that some level public awareness would not have been reached without accessible demos of SOTA models.

However, I don���t agree with the argument that AI capabilities should be released to increase our ability to ���rein it in��� (I assume you are making an argument against a capabilities ���overhang��� which has been made on LW before). This is because text-davinci-002 (and then 3) were publicly available but not accessible to the average citizen. Safety researchers knew these models existed and were doing good work on them before ChatGPT���s release. Releasing ChatGPT results in shorter timelines and hence less time for safety researchers to do good work.

To caveat this: I agree ChatGPT does help alignment research, but it doesn���t seem like researchers are doing things THAT differently based on its existence. And secondly I am aware that OAI did not realise how large the hype and investment would be from ChatGPT, but nevertheless this hype and investment is downstream of a liberal publishing culture which is something that can be blamed.

Arthur, your points highlight a nuanced perspective on the dissemination and impact of advanced AI technologies. You've noted that while the release of such technologies (like ChatGPT) does promote public awareness and potentially aids in alignment research, it might also reduce the window of opportunity for in-depth safety assessments by accelerating the development timelines. This acceleration could indeed lead to a capabilities overhang where advancements in AI capabilities outpace our understanding and control of their implications.
Furthermore, the accessibility of these technologies is crucial. If advanced AI models are not readily accessible or understandable to the general public, there is a risk of leaving a significant portion of the community underinformed about their functionalities and potential impacts. However, when these technologies become widely available, as seen with ChatGPT, it creates a surge in interest and investment which can be both beneficial for rapid development and risky if the hype outstrips rigorous safety evaluations.
Finally, your point about the unintended consequences of a "liberal publishing culture" within AI development is particularly poignant. This culture can lead to rapid dissemination of new technologies without sufficient consideration of the long-term effects, highlighting the need for a balanced approach between innovation and precaution in AI research and development. Your critique is well-founded in urging a more measured approach to the release of AI capabilities, prioritizing safety and ethical considerations alongside the benefits of increased public engagement and research opportunities.

I agree that ChatGPT was positive for AI-risk awareness. However from my perspective being very happy about OpenAI's impact on x-risk does not follow from this. Releasing powerful AI models does have a counterfactual effect on the awareness of risks, but also a lot of counterfactual hype and funding (such as the vast current VC investment in AI) which is mostly pointed at general capabilities rather than safety, which from my perspective is net negative.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Arthur, you've raised a critical concern about the broader impact of releasing powerful AI models like ChatGPT. While these releases can increase awareness of AI risks, they also generate significant hype and attract substantial venture capital investment. This investment often prioritizes enhancing general AI capabilities over improving AI safety, which can indeed be problematic.
Your point emphasizes the need for a more balanced distribution of resources between developing new AI capabilities and ensuring their safety. The current trend, driven by excitement and the potential for financial returns, may skew focus away from crucial safety research and development. This imbalance could increase the risks associated with advanced AI technologies, especially if safety measures and ethical considerations do not keep pace with technological advancements.
Highlighting the counterfactual impact of these releases helps underline the complexity of managing AI development responsibly. It's crucial for stakeholders in the AI field, including developers, investors, and policymakers, to consider how resources are allocated and to strive for a more equitable emphasis on safety to mitigate potential negative consequences of rapid AI advancement. Your perspective is valuable in sparking further discussion and urging a more cautious and conscientious approach in the AI community.

Quick thoughts on the implications of multi-agent views of mind on AI takeover

There was conversation on Facebook over an argument that any sufficiently complex system, whether a human, a society, or an AGI, will be unable to pursue a unified goal due to internal conflict among its parts, and that this should make us less worried about "one paperclipper"-style AI FOOM scenarios. Here's a somewhat edited and expanded version of my response:

1) yes this is a very real issue

2) yet as others pointed out, humans and organizations are still able to largely act as if they had unified goals, even if they often also act contrary to those goals

3) there's a lot of variance in how unified any given human is. trauma makes you less unified, while practices such as therapy and certain flavors of meditation can make a person significantly more unified than they used to be. if you were intentionally designing a mind, you could create mechanisms that artificially mimicked the results of these practices

4) a lot of the human inconsistency looks like it has actually been evolutionarily adaptive for social purposes. E.g. if your social environment punishes you for having a particular trait or belief, then it's adaptive to suppress that to avoid punishment, while also retaining a desire to still express it when you can get away with it. This then manifests as what could be seen as conflicting sub-agents, with internal conflict and inconsistent behaviour.

5) Depending on its training regime, an AI might be anywhere between not having those incentives for inconsistency at all (if it was optimized for one goal), to having them almost as much as humans (if it was trained in some kind of multi-agent artificial life setting with similar kinds of social dynamics as humans faced; maybe also if it's trained something like the way ChatGPT is, where it has to give an acceptable-to-the-median-liberal-Westerner answer to any question, even if those answers are internally inconsistent)

6) at the same time there is still genuinely the angle about complexity and unpredictability making it hard to get a complex mind to work coherently and internally aligned. I think that evolution has done a lot of trial and error to set up parameters that result in brain configurations where people end up acting in a relatively sensible way - and even after all that trial and error, lots of people today still end up with serious mental illnesses, failing to achieve almost any of the goals they have (even when the environment isn't stacked against them), dying young due to doing something that they predictably shouldn't have, etc. I'd say it's less like "evolution has found a blueprint than reliably works" and more like "evolution keeps doing trial-and-error search in every generation, with a lot of people not making it"

7) aligning an AI's sub-agents in a purely simulated environment may not be fully feasible because a lot of the questions that need to be solved are things like "how much priority to allocate to which sub-agent in which situation". E.g. humans come with lots of biological settings that shift the internal balance of sub-agents when hungry, tired, scared,, etc. Some people develop an obsessive focus on a particular topic which may end up being beneficial if they are lucky (obsession on programming that you can turn into a career), or harmful if they are unlucky (an obsession on anything that doesn't earn you money and actively distracts you from it). The optimal prioritization depends on the environment and I don't think there is any theoretically optimal result that would be real-world relevant and that you could calculate beforehand. Rather you just have to do trial-and-error, and while running your AIs in a simulated environment may help a bit, it may not help much if your simulation doesn't sufficiently match the real world.

8) humans are susceptible to internal Goodhart's Law, where they optimize for proxy variables like "sense of control over one's environment", and this also leads them to doing things like playing games or smoking cigarettes to increase their perceived control of the environment without increasing their actual control of the environment. I think that an AI having the same issue is much more likely than it just being able to single-mindedly optimize for a single goal and derive all of its behavior and subgoals from that. Moreover, evolution has put quite a bit of optimization power into developing the right kinds of proxy variables which overall still largely work. Having control of your environment is actually quite important and even if the drive for that can misfire, having the drive to increase that control is mostly still better than not having it. But the exact configuration of these kinds of proxy variables feels like it's also in the class of things that you just need to find out by trial and error and throwing lots of minds at it, there's no a priori answer for exactly how much the AI should optimize for that in an arbitrary environment.

9) a lot of these kinds of failures are generally not correctable from within the system. Suppose that an AI's internal priority-allocation system ends up giving most of the priority to the subsystem thinking about how to best develop nanotech, and this subsystem ends up obsessively thinking about minute theoretical details about nanotech long past the point it would have had any practical relevance for the AI's world-takeover plans. Even if other subsystems realize that this has turned into a lost cause, if they cannot directly affect the priority-allocation system which keeps the nanotech-obsessed subsystem in control, the nanotech-obsessed subsystem will continue spending all the time just thinking about this and nothing else. Or if the other subsystems can directly affect the priority-allocation system, then it creates an incentive for them to seize control of it and ensure that it will always keep them in charge, even past the point that their contributions turned out to matter. (cf. Minsky on mutually bidding subagents)

10) overall, this makes me put less credence on the "the first AI to become superintelligent will take over the world" scenario - I think that it's likely that the first superintelligent AI will turn out to be internally misaligned and fail to achieve a goal as complex as taking over the world. However, I don't think that this necessarily helps us much, because AI looks like it can become far more internally aligned than humans ever can, and given enough trial and error (different actors creating their own AIs), one of them is going to get there eventually.

Kaj Sotala's analysis on the multi-agent models of mind and its implications for AI risk is intriguing and highlights several key points about the complexity of achieving unified goals in both artificial and human intelligence systems. Here���s a breakdown of the main points he discusses:
Real Issue of Goal Disunity
: Even complex systems like humans and societies face challenges in pursuing unified goals due to internal conflicts, suggesting similar difficulties for AI.
Human Analogy
: Despite internal conflicts, humans and organizations can often appear to act with unified goals, hinting that AI might also overcome internal disunities.
Variance and Unification Methods
: Human minds vary in their unity; some methods like therapy and meditation can increase unification, which could theoretically be mimicked in AI design.
Evolutionary Adaptiveness
: Human inconsistencies often serve adaptive social functions, suggesting that AIs could also have built-in incentives for inconsistent behavior depending on their training environments.
Complexity and Unpredictability
: The complexity of a system adds to its unpredictability, making it difficult for even well-designed AIs to act coherently and align internally, akin to evolutionary trials in humans.
Challenges in AI Alignment
: Aligning an AI���s sub-agents in a simulated environment may not accurately reflect real-world conditions, making theoretical optimal prioritizations elusive.
Internal Goodhart���s Law
: Humans often optimize for proxy variables like a sense of control, which can lead to maladaptive behaviors. AIs could face similar issues, misaligning from their intended goals.
Systemic Correction Limitations
: If an AI subsystem becomes overly dominant without practical relevance, other subsystems may not be able to correct this misalignment, which could hinder overall AI objectives.
Misalignment and AI Development
: The potential for internal misalignment in AI reduces the likelihood of a single AI suddenly taking over the world, but continuous trials by different developers could eventually lead to a highly aligned AI.
Kaj's perspective suggests a nuanced view of AI development, emphasizing the challenges of internal alignment and the potential for evolutionary-like trial and error in AI design. This view counters simpler narratives about AI risks and points towards a more complex interplay of factors that could influence the future of superintelligent AI. This complexity not only challenges our understanding of AI's potential but also emphasizes the importance of rigorous and continuous exploration of AI safety and alignment strategies.

Romance, misunderstanding, social stances, and the human LLM

1. Cross-sex friendships
I saw a tweet recently that was talking about one of the possible conditions where (heterosexual) men and women have an easy time being ���just friends���:

if the ���lovers��� symbol energy is already bound up in something else, and/or if there is another archetypal relationship that holds more power and more draw for these two, both enough to actually crowd out the call of ���lovers��� equilibrium

I liked that, but it probably isn���t very clear to everyone. So let me try to explain how I understand it.

A friendship can bring up feelings of affection, closeness, vulnerability, and even sexual attraction. Many people might associate those primarily with a romantic relationship. If the feelings and the association are strong enough and other necessary conditions[1] are in place, the people may feel drawn toward the "shape" of that association. 

In ���Goodhart���s Law inside the human mind���, I talked about how automatic pattern completion is a pervasive aspect of human thought. If your balance is slightly off, it feels wrong, and (assuming that you are a healthy able-bodied adult) you are automatically drawn into a posture that feels more right. Or if you have learned a skill slightly wrong and have to unlearn bits of it, it's going to be difficult at first, because the "right" way of doing it feels wrong. Until you relearn what the "right" shape is, you will be automatically drawn back into your old pattern.

There's a model[2] that developing expertise in something is all about learning to perceive things as having particular kinds of shapes, that your mind/body can then automatically fill in.[3] 

Learning to walk involves developing a sense of it's like to maintain balance while being upright and moving forward. Eventually, your body comes to automatically carry out the right pattern for maintaining that feeling and correcting deviations from it.
Learning to be polite in conversation involves developing a sense of what it's like to be polite to someone. Eventually, your mind comes to automatically carry out the right pattern for maintaining that feeling and correcting deviations from it.
Learning to solve systems of algebraic equations involves developing a sense of what it's like to carry out the right steps to solve them. Eventually, your mind comes to automatically carry out the right pattern for maintaining that feeling and correcting deviations from it.
Likewise, if someone has a stored pattern saying that a romantic relationship involves affection, closeness, and vulnerability... and all of those are present in a particular friendship, then it may feel wrong for the sexual attraction to be missing. Like a pattern that's subtly deviating from what it should be, with there being an automatic impulse towards correcting it by adding a sexual component.

There's an observation that many men don't get to experience emotional vulnerability with their male friends. Instead, they associate it as something that can only happen with a woman they are romantically involved with.  

A female friend of mine once had to politely tell a male friend of hers that she wasn't romantically interested in him. "But why have you spent all this time hanging out with me and having these deep conversations with me, then?", was his response. "Uhh, because we're friends?", was hers. 

It was like the pattern of "an emotionally deep friendship with a woman without sex and romance" wasn't available for him, so anything that was creating emotional depth felt like it was obviously moving towards the "romantic relationship" pattern.

Also, you can even have sexual attraction in an otherwise Platonic relationship. People might flirt with each other without ever intending or having an interest in escalating beyond that. Yet, if someone has a pattern where sexual attraction and sexual acts are intrinsically linked together, then this may become a self-fulfilling prophecy where experiencing attraction toward someone might make the person feel like they are compelled to escalate their acts.

But if one's mind has available the pattern of "a friendship that includes affection, closeness, vulnerability, and sexual attraction, while still remaining Platonic"... then it can instead autocomplete to that.

Or if one has a very strong pattern of "I will only have one romantic relationship at a time" and is in a committed relationship, then the thought of one of their friendships also turning romantic may just be so incompatible with that overarching pattern, that it never happens. Any potential for romance gets overwritten by the stronger pattern.

2. Cross-sex friendship frustration as mismatched social stances
There���s a particular kind of pattern that I experience, that I���ve taken to calling a social stance. You could say that it���s a special case of a pattern that one wants to either experience or avoid, where other people���s behavior is also included in the pattern.

Suppose that I'm mostly only aware of two possible relationship patterns that I can have with my friends. One is that of a somewhat emotionally distant friendship, and the other is that of an emotionally close romance. 

A friend now pulls me towards the ���romance��� pattern, so I start doing things that I feel are associated with that pattern - being vulnerable, telling the other person how much I like that person, and so on.

And now I have the expectation that the other person will reciprocate - that when I act in ways I associate with romance, the other person will also do similar things. For a physical analogy, if friendship is walking with each other and romance is dancing together, then I might start leaning towards the other person and extending my hand - expecting them to grab the hand and join in a dance, hopefully before I lean forward so much that I fall.

I'm using this metaphor because in my experience there's something of an almost kinesthetic feeling of different "stances" people might be in, in different social situations. And someone not sharing the same vocabulary of stances may mean that I feel metaphorically "out of balance", stumbling until I get back to some more recognizable stance. 

I lean towards another person, intending to settle into a "lover" stance. I'm expecting the other to likewise lean toward me, into a "lover" stance. But suppose that the other person instead takes the "close Platonic friend" stance and only leans forward a little bit, and then stops - then I might be caught off-balance and not know what stance I am expected to take. 

In this situation, if I lack the "close Platonic friend" stance, I can only see the other person as being in either the "friend" or the "lover" stance.  To me, it may also feel like they started moving towards the ���lovers��� stance, only to then pull back and go back to the ���friends��� stance. 

A less metaphorical way of describing the experience is that it feels like the other person is acting erratically and inconsistently, maybe even leading me on. Do they want to be lovers or not? Sometimes they seem to want that, when they are emotionally vulnerable, but at other times they don���t seem to, when they reject romantic advances. What���s going on?

In this situation, I see there being a ���two people becoming lovers��� pattern and I try to complete it, the same way I would try to complete other patterns. But as it involves two people, I can���t complete it alone - I can only do my part and then let the other person do theirs. And since they are perceiving the situation through the lens of a different pattern, they don't respond the way that I am expecting (indeed, they might be totally unaware of the fact that there���s anything going on that I might be frustrated by).

Some of this may happen even if one has an intellectual understanding of what���s going on. Expectations about social stances are frequently stored as emotional schemas. Even if one part of my mind has an intellectual concept of a deep Platonic friendship, the part of my mind that experiences the other person's behavior as ambivalent doesn���t necessarily have it. So I may be able to make the conscious decision to stay as just friends, even as this causes discomfort as different interactions keep swinging my emotional expectations between ���this person is just my friend and I should have the ���friend��� stance��� and ���this person could become my romantic partner and I can move towards the ���lovers��� stance���. 

This is not the only possible failure mode. It can also happen that I understand the other person is not interested in me (possibly because they are already in a committed monogamous relationship) and I'm actually not romantically interested in them either. But, I am afraid that they will interpret certain kinds of emotional intimacy as me trying to get them to do something inappropriate. As a result, I end up avoiding the kind of intimacy that I might want, but fear would send the wrong message.

This isn't necessarily wrong - if they do have a pattern where such intimacy is only associated with sex or romance, then they might very well interpret things in that way. But if I don't see this as a pattern that people might or might not share, then it might never even occur to me that this person (as well as that person's partner) could also be totally fine with that level of intimacy.

3. The unhelpful interviewer���s stance
A book on counseling technique that I was reading included this excerpt (thankfully as an example of what not to do):

Nor is it necessary to be coy and avoid giving information, as in this example:

CLIENT: So how do people find a job in this area?

INTERVIEWER: You���re really wondering about that.

CLIENT: Yes.

INTERVIEWER: You���re curious how people get jobs.

CLIENT: Yes, I am.

INTERVIEWER: And you wish someone could give you some ideas.

CLIENT: Yes! Do you have any?

INTERVIEWER: You���d like to know if I have any ideas.

If you���re like me, that passage was almost painful to read. I imagine that the client is getting increasingly frustrated during this conversation - in the second-to-last line, I read them almost getting excited that the interviewer is finally about to answer, only for the client���s hopes to be dashed again. Or maybe the client didn���t get excited at that point, and it was rather their frustration building up to a point that they asked the question a bit more pointedly.

The way people usually expect conversation to go is that a question-asking stance is followed by something like an answering stance from the other person. You ask how people find a job, and the other person answers to the best of their ability - or says that they don���t know, or at least somehow acknowledges that an ask has been made. Quite possibly, the client may perceive the interviewer as having a stance that���s something like ���being intentionally frustrating���. 

This may or may not be the interviewer���s actual experience. If, for instance, the interviewer has been taught that reflecting the other person���s words back is just good active listening (and they have taken this lesson a little too far), the interviewer may experience themselves as being in some other stance, such as ���being a good and empathetic listener who encourages the client to find their own solutions���.

Regardless of what the interviewer���s experience is, the way I imagine the client responding is by a desire to dislodge the interviewer from that stance and get them to just answer the fucking question.

4. Social stances as physical stances and vice versa
I suspect that these things feel to me natural to describe in terms of "stances" because they are in fact employing some of the same machinery involved in physical stances. 

A very physical kind of stance might be someone aggressively yelling and coming at you. You might respond to this by getting startled and instinctively drawing back. The aggressive person has something like an attacking stance, while you have a defensive stance. Or you might respond more aggressively yourself, in which case you might go into a fighting stance. 

These stances mobilize different kinds of reactions and processes in your body because they are preparing you for different kinds of physical responses (attacking or defending/fleeing). You orient to them differently, both in terms of literal physical orientation and what kinds of things you pay attention to (a person in an aggressive stance might look for openings in their opponent's defenses, and a person in a frightened stance might look around to find help or an escape route). 

In the example above, the interviewer might be focusing on ways in which they feel like they are doing "good listening", while client may be focusing on the question of "how do I get this fucker to respond already". And you also orient differently to a person depending on whether they are a friend or a lover - which also includes differences on a purely physical level and the kinds of hormones etc. that your body releases when interacting with them.

If you are having a physical fight with another person, you probably want to maintain the kinds of stances that let you fight well while sabotaging their stance - so that they e.g. fall down on their face and can���t defend themselves. And sabotaging the interviewer's stance may be exactly what the client would have wanted to do. 

If you are a trained martial artist, you may have been taught to maintain different kinds of explicitly defined stances. They have become patterns that your body seeks to automatically maintain and to transition between them in the right circumstances. And if your opponent goes into a particular stance, you may know to react by going into another one yourself.

Separately, in dance, you have various positions where you hold your body in a particular way while trusting your dance partner to hold their body in a compatible way. If the other person doesn���t move in ways that are compatible with yours, the dance may fall apart. It's collaborative rather than confrontational, but it still involves responding to the other person's pattern with a pattern of your own.

Social stances feel to me analogous to physical stances in that people learn to experience themselves as being in one stance and another person as being in a different stance. They also learn various expectations about how to transition from one stance to another. These transitions may be collaborative or adversarial. And like physical stances, it may feel acutely unstable and uncomfortable to be in a position that���s partway between two stances.

5. Misunderstood stances
I���ve been in situations where it feels like the other person perceives me to be inhabiting a stance I don���t feel like I have. I say something and they respond in anger, but I don���t quite get what exactly it is that they���re arguing against.

It feels like they���re trying to push me but I���m kind of incorporeal. So they keep pushing but it doesn���t really affect me in any way, and I just remain faintly puzzled.

Sometimes I���m upset at someone and try to lash at them with my words, but it feels like their stance is off from what would be required for my offensive to work. As a result, it feels like my words keep either glancing off or missing entirely. In those cases, I feel like their stance is that they are saying X, so I try to argue against the X - but they probably experience themselves as saying something completely different.

This kind of thing seems to happen pretty often online.

Person A: ���I like blueberries.���

Person B: ���So you think that romantic comedies should be banned?! Don���t you have any human decency?���

Person A: ���Huh, what?���

Person B: ���Just admit that you are secretly jealous of all the actors in romantic comedies!���

Person A: ���...I only said that I like blueberries?���

Person B: ���See? See? You said you like blueberries! So you admit that you hate romantic comedies!���

Person A: ���... uhh, okay.���

6. A few more stances and related expectations
Here are a few more examples[4] of expectations that people might have - sometimes correctly, sometimes incorrectly - that I can experience in terms of stances. Many of these have a symmetric complement, e.g. if B expects that A expressing upset puts an obligation to B to take care of that upset, then A may also have (or not have) that expectation.

Person A taking a stance of being self-deprecating and expecting person B to take a supportive stance in return (���Now I know my art isn���t good������ ���Don���t say that, you have great art!���)
Person A sharing something about themselves and person B sharing something of a similar nature in return, where B finds themselves as taking a reciprocative stance and expecting A to react positively (���I���ve been having difficulties getting my taxes done��� ���Oh yeah that always happens to me too���)
Person A expressing upset and person B feeling like this puts an obligation on B to take a helping stance
Person A being ask culture and asking B for a favor, expecting that B can choose how to respond to A���s asking stance
Person A being guess culture and feeling like they are compelled to respond to an ask with a helping stance
Person A acting helpless and saying that they���re unable to do something, with the expectation that this will shift person B into a rescuer stance
Person A coming across as helpless to person B, with B feeling like A is basically begging for help and like B has to comply with a rescuer stance to A���s victim-like helpless stance (���Okay let me do that for you���) (���Hey I never asked for your help���) (���Well what was I supposed to do, just leave you hanging there?���)
Person A asking if person B wants to hang out, getting a ���would like to but too busy right now���, and expecting that B will feel pressured if A persists in asking again later - causing A to take a respectful stance of not asking again
Person A asking if person B wants to hang out, getting a ���would like to but too busy right now���, and expecting that B will feel glad if A takes the initiative in asking again later - causing A to take a friendly stance of asking again
Person A sharing something about their feelings, and expecting person B to take a stance of offering emotional support (���Things are going really badly at work today������ ���Oh no, how do you feel about it?���)
Person A sharing something about their feelings, and expecting person B to take a stance of problem-solving (���Things are going really badly at work today������ ���Oh no, what have you tried to change that?���)
Person A taking an upset stance in response to something that person B said, and expecting to B to take a guilty stance that implies B was in the wrong to upset A. (���What? That pisses me off.��� ���Oh I���m sorry, I didn���t meant to������)
Person A taking an upset stance in response to something that person B said, and not expecting B to take any stance in particular (���What? That���s pisses me off.��� ���Oh I���m sorry, I didn���t meant to������ ���It���s okay, I didn���t mean you did anything wrong - I was just sharing how I felt���)
Person A having an enthusiastic stance about something and expecting person B to also react with an enthusiastic stance (���Did you hear about Elvis coming to town? Isn���t that great!��� ���Oh wow Elvis?���)
Person A taking a playful teasing stance and expecting person B to respond with a similarly playful stance ("Hey, did you get lost on your way here again?" "Haha, you know me, navigationally challenged!")
Person A showing vulnerability and expecting person B to take a comforting and reassuring stance ("I'm feeling really insecure about my presentation tomorrow." "Don't worry, you've prepared well, and I know you'll do great.")
Person A taking an advice-seeking stance and expecting person B to respond with an expertise stance ("I'm not sure which career path to choose, any thoughts?" "Well, considering your skills and interests, I would recommend...")
Person A expressing excitement about an accomplishment and expecting person B to take a congratulatory stance ("I just got a promotion at work!" "That's amazing, congratulations!")
Person A taking a defensive stance during a disagreement and expecting person B to take a conciliatory stance ("I don't think I was wrong in that situation." "Okay, I understand where you're coming from, let's find a compromise.")
Person A admitting a mistake and expecting person B to take a forgiving stance ("I'm sorry I forgot our anniversary." "It's okay, we all make mistakes. Let's celebrate it this weekend instead.")
Person A sharing a personal struggle and expecting person B to take a compassionate stance ("I've been feeling really down lately." "I'm sorry to hear that, do you want to talk about it?")
Person A taking a supportive stance towards person B's goals and expecting person B to feel motivated and appreciative ("I believe in you, you can achieve anything you set your mind to!" "Thank you, that means a lot to me.")
Person A expressing a need for space or solitude and expecting person B to take an understanding stance ("I think I need some time alone right now." "Of course, take all the time you need.")
Person A sharing a humorous story or joke and expecting person B to take an amused stance ("So then the chicken says, 'Why did the human cross the road?'" "Haha, that's a good one!")
Person A expressing a concern and expecting person B to take a validating stance ("I'm worried about this upcoming deadline." "I understand, it's a lot of pressure, but I know you can handle it.")
Person A taking an appreciative stance and expecting person B to take a humble stance ("Your presentation was fantastic!" "Thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed it, but I couldn't have done it without my team.")
Person A sharing a personal interest or hobby and expecting person B to take an interested stance ("I've been getting into photography lately." "That's cool! What kind of photos do you enjoy taking?")
7. Why is all of this interesting?
Someone might (somewhat uncharitably) say that this whole post is just a complicated way of saying that ���people might have mismatched expectations of each other���. And in a way, it is. Why am I spending so many words on this?

I think the important thing to notice is that if you can frame this kind of thing as being about mismatched expectations, you���re already halfway to the point of solving the problem. But what commonly happens is that these kinds of things do not feel like ���expectations���, they feel like reality.

Imagine that you are a large language model. You are given the sentence and you continue it. You don���t have any sense of what it is that you are doing, you just recognize the pattern and you complete it. To the extent you can be said to ���think��� at all, you just think that this is the correct pattern.

Now imagine that you are a human, whose cognition does a lot of pattern recognition and is filled with entities that act like LLMs. You have seen lots of people act in a particular way in a particular situation, and you yourself have been both rewarded for doing so, and occasionally punished for not doing so.

When you next the hear that question, the LLM-like entity in your mind doesn���t really know that it has been trained by a combination of pattern recognition and reinforcement learning to perceive this as the correct pattern and to output it. To the extent that it can be said to think at all, it just thinks that ���this is the pattern to output here���, and part of its prediction about what���s going to happen next is output into the global workspace of your consciousness. 

Suppose now that its model of the situation is wrong, somehow.

In the theory of predictive processing, precision refers to the amount of uncertainty that a prediction has - if you are in a dark room where you can���t see very well, the signal from your eyes has low precision, and you are more likely to fall back on your priors of what you expect to see (the thing in front of you kind of looks like a person, but you know you���re in your own home with nobody else around, so it���s probably just your lamp). Whereas if you could see very well and you saw what looked like a person standing in your room, the signal from your eyes would be assigned high precision. This would overrule your prior belief that you are home alone and you would then be quite surprised (and probably startled).

If there is a particular pattern that has always seemed correct to you, and you think you understand the social situation well, then the predictions of the LLM-like entity in your mind might be treated as having high precision. When a pattern fails to complete the way it was predicted to, the brain might simply ignore that failure as noise and fall back to its prior of ���this is the correct pattern���. As a result, the LLM-like entity may keep trying to complete the same pattern over and over, despite it failing to work - even as the system as a whole notices that something is off, possibly reacting with increasing frustration. Since its own prediction and behavior is treated as being correct, the reasonable inference is that there���s something wrong with the environment that's causing the frustration - typically, that the other person is doing something wrong.

But if your brain also happens to contain the pattern of ���this is the feeling of I and someone else having mismatched patterns���... then another LLM-like entity observing the contents of your workspace might notice that. It can then bring up the hypothesis that maybe there���s actually nothing wrong with either of you, you just have incompatible patterns.

In my experience, there is a particular feeling (or felt sense) associated with both my experience of my own stance, and my experience of the stance that someone else is in. If I notice any of the following:

That there���s a social situation where I have the expectation that if I do X, then I will get something or another person will react in a particular way, and that expectation keeps getting frustrated
That I find I myself repeatedly taking some social action even after seeing that it didn���t work before
That I feel disappointed or angry at someone because I feel like they didn���t ���do their part��� or reciprocate to something that I offered, even though I intellectually think that they were under no obligation to do so
Then that���s a cue for noticing that I might have an implicit pattern about how I expect particular stances to interact with each other. (In other words, my mind autocompletes any of the above cues to the pattern of ���I���m now acting based off an implicit pattern that may not be shared���.)

This post is an attempt to help in building up a meta-pattern (or if you already have one like that, making it clearer and offering more examples) of ���this is a situation where my social patterns might be mismatched with someone else���s���, that then lets you consider other possible actions when you notice it. It���s very useful, in my experience, to have ���mismatched patterns��� as a pattern that one���s mind can recognize. And if I only said ���there are situations where you have mismatched expectations���, that wouldn���t be very helpful in helping to actually notice when you were in a situation like that.

I have used the analogy of a stance because to me it feels like there���s an almost kinesthetic component involved in my felt sense of the states that I describe as ���stances���. If there���s something similar in your experience, describing it in these terms might draw your attention to it and help you notice it. Of course, it���s also possible that your mind works differently, and you need to find something else that works for you. That���s why I have also described some other possible cues, such as the sense of increasing frustration that I imagined the client to be having when the interviewer wasn���t responding to this question.

Kaj Sotala���s article "Romance, misunderstanding, social stances, and the human LLM" explores the complex nature of human interactions, especially in cross-sex friendships and the various social stances people adopt in different relational contexts. Here are the key points discussed in the article:
Cross-Sex Friendships and Patterns
: Kaj discusses how heterosexual men and women might avoid romantic tensions by engaging with each other under different archetypal relationships or roles that overpower the romantic impulse. This concept challenges the default assumption that mixed-sex friendships naturally evolve toward romance.
Pattern Recognition and Emotional Schemas
: He introduces the idea that humans automatically fill recognized patterns based on past experiences, similar to how language models predict text. In interpersonal relationships, this might mean expecting a friendship that exhibits deep emotional closeness to naturally include romantic or sexual elements, unless alternative patterns (like a strong platonic or professional archetype) are more dominant.
Misalignment of Social Stances
: The core of the article addresses situations where different individuals approach interactions from mismatched social stances, leading to misunderstandings and unmet expectations. For instance, one person might approach with a "romantic" stance, while the other maintains a "platonic" stance, causing confusion and potential conflict.
The Role of Implicit Patterns in Social Interactions
: Kaj suggests that much of our social behavior is guided by implicit patterns, which shape our expectations and reactions in subtle but powerful ways. Recognizing when these patterns are mismatched can be key to navigating social interactions more effectively.
Meta-Patterns of Mismatch Recognition
: He proposes the development of a meta-pattern that helps individuals recognize when their social expectations are misaligned with others'. This awareness could prevent misunderstandings and improve communication, by prompting a reassessment of the situation based on a broader range of potential interactions.
Practical Implications and Techniques
: The discussion includes practical implications for improving interpersonal communication and relationships. By understanding and adjusting our social stances, we can better manage our interactions and avoid common pitfalls in relationships.
Exploration of Social Stances as Physical Stances
: Kaj uses the metaphor of physical stances (like in dance or martial arts) to illustrate how people can become "positioned" in social situations. This analogy helps to explain the kinetic feeling of social interactions, where movements and responses are both reactive and proactive, influenced by the perceived stances of others.
This exploration of social stances and the complexities of human relationships offers valuable insights into how we interpret and navigate our social world, particularly in the nuanced dynamics of cross-sex friendships and beyond. The article not only sheds light on common social misunderstandings but also provides a framework for thinking about how we can improve our interpersonal engagements through a better understanding of implicit social patterns.

Goodhart's Law inside the human mind
by Kaj_Sotala

Some time back, I saw a tweet from somebody that read:

Much of social psychology seems to be premised on the bizarre assumption that what people really care about is not real-world outcomes but the state of their own mind: self-esteem, a positive self-image, dissonance reduction, feelings of control, reducing uncertainty, etc.

I've certainly seen versions of the same myself. Maybe the most poignant example comes from this book review, which suggested that gambling addicts get hooked on a sense of control - even though someone who's hooked on gambling to the point of ruining their life clearly isn't in much control of anything:

The primary objective that machine gambling addicts have is not to win, but to stay in the zone. The zone is a state that suspends real life, and reduces the world to the screen and the buttons of the machine. Entering the zone is easiest when gamblers can get into a rhythm. Anything that disrupts the rhythm becomes an annoyance. This is true even when the disruption is winning the game. Many gamblers talk about how winning the game brings them out of the zone, and they actually dislike winning for that reason. For some gamblers, the very act of pressing buttons to play the game disrupts the rhythm. These gamblers use autoplay modes on games that offer them, and jerryrig an autoplay mode on machines that don���t by jamming something into buttons to keep them pressed. They don���t want to chase a win or pick their lucky numbers, they want to disappear into the zone. [...]

The book is full of heartbreaking stories about what gamblers endure on their path to extinction. They sacrifice their bodies, their time, and their relationships. Sharon, for example, spent four days at a casino, trying to lose all her money to reach extinction. At the end of this ordeal, she came home to sleep, but she found three nickels in her bedroom. The thought of not having spent all her money bothered her so much that she drove back to a casino immediately to lose those last three nickels. [...]

I used to think that gambling addicts ���lost control��� when they gambled excessively. But the addicts in the book use machines as a way to gain control in their lives. In front of a machine, the world is simple: they place bets and lose a little bit of money on each turn. The gamblers are in control of this machine world. It is the world away from machines where the prospect of losing control in frightening ways looms. Away from the machines, life is long and full of terrors.

This certainly sounds odd and destructive���seeking control in a way that destroys one's life.

But it's also one that resonates with me - it feels like it describes the relationship I've often had with social media. Picking up my phone and checking Facebook can give me a sense of autonomy, like I'm choosing to leave the current situation and momentarily visit another world. This feels like it's the case even when the phone-checking becomes compulsive; a part of me craves that feeling of control so much that it gets out of control.

While I've never smoked, I understand that many smokers describe their relationship with cigarettes similarly. Smoking offers a socially acceptable reason to step away from a dull conversation or meeting for a moment. Briefly, you can tune out and regain a sense of control.

There's something peculiar about this. The initial tweet mentioned the "bizarre" assumption in social psychology that people prioritize internal mental states over actual control (or any other attribute the feelings seem to track). It's strange that a gambling addict would chase the feeling of control even when it leads their life to spiral out of control.

However, I believe it's relatively simple to explain. First, there's a brain subsystem that calculates a variable, such as "to what extent do I feel in control," based on external factors. Then, other subsystems learn various strategies to regulate that variable and maintain a desired range.

In ideal circumstances, this would be beneficial���the sense of control would correlate with actual control over the environment. When something reduces control, the regulating subsystems act to restore the sense of control. For example, losing your job might make you feel less in control of your finances, so you search for another job until you feel in control again.

Unfortunately, subsystems within the brain are just as subject to Goodhart���s law - ���when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure��� - as anything else is. The feeling of control is a proxy for actual control, but an imperfect one. When it becomes an optimization target, it becomes an even worse proxy. If part of you feels like your life is spiraling out of control, the regulator subsystem may get stuck in a local maximum where it clings to anything that slightly increases the sense of control - even if that overall causes a continued loss of control.

While playing the slot machine, you're distracted from distressing thoughts, and the predictable nature of the game elevates your "sense of control" variable. As soon as the game ends or you win, unpredictability returns, and you're reminded of the unpleasant aspects of life, causing the sense of control to drop. The regulator predicts that playing another game will raise the sense of control. If you act on this prediction, it may be quickly confirmed, reinforcing the pattern of "play the slot machines when distressed, since that will bring the sense of control up"

The original tweeter acknowledged that it makes sense for there to be feelings that track external states. He seemed to think that explanatory theories only went off the rails when they proposed that humans sought to primarily regulate internal psychological states - after all, the evolutionary purpose of the regulation system can���t be purely internal, it has to have its roots in the external world.

But it seems very reasonable to me that we might first evolve systems for the purpose of regulating external states which then take a life of their own, developing something like inner optimizers that put intrinsic value on the regulation of internal variables. If that���s the case, then it makes perfect sense to explain human behavior in terms of humans attempting to regulate their internal variables - even when those variables have become uncorrelated from external reality, and even if the variables originally evolved to track external states.

Behavior by feeling regulation
I suspect that there���s a sense in which it could be said that our brains and bodies are doing nothing but trying to keep various feelings within desired parameters. Even though it has its failure modes, it���s a pretty good system overall. And it can be useful to start paying attention to the various kinds of different feelings that our minds are tracking.

The original tweet mentioned a number of feelings that people have proposed the mind might be optimizing for: control, internal dissonance, self-esteem, self-image, and uncertainty. Here are a few more:

The sense of balance. By this, I mean just the thing that you have when you���re e.g. walking, that tells you whether you're well-balanced or whether you just slipped and are about to fall. If you are a healthy, able-bodied adult, you don���t need to pay attention to it. You have internalized the skill of walking enough that your sense of balance is automatically kept within the right range to maintain upright motion. But if you slip and lose that sense, then those regulator subsystems will quickly kick in and try to bring it back up.

The sense of singing right. An experienced singer may have a sense of what singing a song right feels like physically, even if they can���t actually hear themselves singing.[1] There can be various concert venues whose acoustics are such that it���s impossible for the singer to hear themselves, but they can still sing perfectly, just by the right internal feel.

The sense of ���everything is done���. Maybe you are finishing a day of work or packing your things for vacation. You might have a feeling of ���there was still something that I needed to do/pack���, which you are hoping to turn into a feeling of ���I have done everything that I need for now and can relax now���. You might do that by consulting a list of things that needed to be done/packed, reviewing what you have done/packed so far, or just continuing to do or pack things until you can���t think of anything else and just intuitively feel like you have everything.

And while the previous discussion may have made it sound like it���s a bad thing to try to strive for a ���sense of control���, often it can be beneficial. Rossin shares the following:

I used to think of myself as someone who was very spontaneous and did not like to plan or organize things any more or any sooner than absolutely necessary. I thought that was just the kind of person I am and getting overly organized would just feel wrong.

But I felt a lot of aberrant bouts of anxiety. I probably could have figured out the problem through standard Focusing but I was having trouble with the negative feeling. And I found it easier to focus on positive feelings, so I began to apply Focusing to when I felt happy. And a common trend that emerged from good felt senses was a feeling of being in control of my life. And it turned out that this feeling of being in control came from having planned to do something I wanted to do and having done it. I would not have noticed that experiences of having planned well made me feel so good through normal analysis because that was just completely contrary to my self-image. But by Focusing on what made me have good feelings, I was able to shift my self-image to be more accurate. I like having detailed plans. Who would have thought? Certainly not me.

Once I realized that my self-image of enjoying disorganization was actually the opposite of what actually made me happy I was able to begin methodically organizing and scheduling my life. Since then, those unexplained bouts of anxiety have vanished and I feel happier more of the time.

Here���s a more general description of how we learn to do anything, argued for on the basis of academic studies in Anders Ericsson���s Peak and more anecdotally in Josh Waitzkin���s (International Master in chess and 2004 world champion in Taiji Push Hands) The Art of Learning. 

When we practice any skill, we get feedback that tells us when we���re doing well at it, and our brain then associates a feeling of ���doing well��� with the kinds of states where we���re doing well. Initially, that sense is only relatively rough. A beginner at playing piano might recognize they're doing well when they play a melody approximately right, but not notice more subtle mistakes in it. 

As we learn to get to that state, our ability to identify more fine-grained measures of success develops. An intermediate piano player may be able to notice subtler errors that they are making and learn what the finger motions associated with playing just right feel like. We then get better and better, as learning to hit each more fine-grained feeling of ���doing well��� allows us to develop even more detailed feelings of doing well

A way I would phrase this is that we learn:

To have a particular kind of feelings (felt senses) that represent something (control, balance, singing right, playing the piano right, everything being done)
A range of intensity that we should keep that feeling sense in, in some given context (either trying to make sure we have some positive feeling, or that we avoid some negative feeling)
Various strategies for keeping it within that range
Returning to our earlier examples, these might look something like:

Feeling of control
Range to keep it in: Variable; depending on the person���s learned expectations of how much control they think they have (see locus of control)

Strategies: Looking for sources of income when don���t have one (financial control), making detailed plans and schedules, playing slot machines, looking at social media, smoking

Feeling of balance
Range to keep it in: One that feels ���upright��� when walking or standing, one that doesn���t when lying down

Strategies: The body doing automatic balance adjustments, trying to correct position or grab a hold of something if you slip

Feeling of singing right
Range to keep it in: Try to get keep it as close to the ���right shape of the song��� as possible

Strategies: Adjusting the physical state of the vocal cords, breath, and the like to be within the right range to produce the right feeling

Feeling of everything being done
Range to keep it in: Try to get the feeling as strong as possible

Strategies: Doing things that you remember you should do, explicitly deciding to leave some things undone/for later to clear them off the set of things that need to be done now, consulting a to-do list to check whether you have done everything

Failure modes
At the same time, there are various ways in which this can go wrong.

Pain as the unit of effort. alkjash writes about a failure mode where pain is the unit of effort. Here, a person has learned that they are only trying if they put themselves in as much pain as they can handle. The feeling that some part of them comes to optimize for is misery, even as this comes uncorrelated from the goal of actually doing well. An anecdote from the post:

As a child, I spent most of my evenings studying mathematics under some amount of supervision from my mother. While studying, if I expressed discomfort or fatigue, my mother would bring me a snack or drink and tell me to stretch or take a break. I think she took it as a sign that I was trying my best. If on the other hand I was smiling or joyful for extended periods of time, she took that as a sign that I had effort to spare and increased the hours I was supposed to study each day. To this day there's a gremlin on my shoulder that whispers, "If you're happy, you're not trying your best."

A fear of being accused of something. A pattern that I���ve seen come up in parts work is that a child might be accused of some wrongdoing that they didn���t actually commit. If this happens more than once, their mind may develop the prediction that ���being unexpectedly accused of something��� is something that might happen at any time, or in particular kinds of circumstances. This creates a feeling of discomfort and uncertainty, and a desire to reduce that feeling of discomfort. A strategy that their mind might then hit upon is to actually do something that they���ll be blamed for. 

Actually having something bad happen to you can often feel less bad than living in constant uncertainty about when it will happen. And getting accused about something can temporarily bring the anticipation of being accused down to zero. Thus, intentionally doing bad things serves as an effective strategy to keep the anticipation within the desired range��� even as it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. Other people will come to expect that the person will consistently misbehave, making them even more likely to accuse the person even of wrongdoings that the person didn���t actually commit.

Thus, in more ways than just one, trying to eliminate the feeling of an impending accusation actually causes more accusations.

General self-sabotage. Some people might have experienced something bad happening when they thought that things were going well, and developed the general expectation of ���things are so good, something is about to go wrong���. Similar to the example above, they might then learn to intentionally sabotage themselves in order to realize that expectation of failure. Or it might the case that there is something frightening about success - maybe you���ve learned that success causes there to be more expectations to be put on you while being incompetent means that you���ll get extra support, making the feeling of failure correlated with safety - so that your mind actually comes to optimize for a feeling of failure.

In an old comment on a post on self-sabotage, pjeby mentions a subtle sense of reward associated with getting a feeling of failure:

My wife and I both described the "Bruce effect" sensation as being more like a sense of recognition or rightness -- like confirmation of something that you expected, something that's just the way the world works. That, upon successfully losing, it's like, "yep, this is where I'm supposed to be". Not enjoyment... more like satisfaction... though that's still too strong. Closure, maybe? Relief? It's a brief and subtle reward, not a conscious pleasure.

Bringing yourself down to make your social status clearer. Another self-sabotage-like pattern is that if someone is feeling uncertainty about their social status and wants to bring that uncertainty down, they may disparage and degrade themselves to others to establish that they are low status. Maybe they have learned that if others perceive their status as being unclear, those others may act to take the person down until the person���s low status has been established. So a part of the person learns that they should keep their feeling of status down in order to be safe, and they learn a strategy of pre-emptively bringing it down. This may then happen even in environments where it's not necessary, and one's sense of social status is uncorrelated with being safe (or maybe it would even be safer to have higher social status).

���Stuck on��� anxiety responses. According to some models of trauma, when people feel anxious without clearly knowing why, the cause is commonly in distress responses that have gotten ���stuck on���. Something distressing once happened to the person, and the feeling of distress triggered a strategy of trying to get away from the situation.

However, for whatever reason, their mind/body has failed to properly register that the original threat is gone, so it keeps generating distressing feelings. The person may then e.g. engage in a strategy of pursuing addictive activities that numb the feeling (essentially engaging in a type of flight response intended to bring the distressing feeling down to zero). While this helps alleviate the discomfort temporarily, it doesn't actually help the response get unstuck. 

In these cases, the feeling of threat activates escape responses even though it has become uncorrelated from the actual threat it was a response to.

Additional failure modes left as an exercise for the reader. I'm sure you can come up with plenty, post them in the comments!

Contradictory failure modes
It was beautiful

and I fled from there.

There was nature

and I ran away from it.

There was my love

and I left them.

All was well there

and I couldn't stand it.

(translated by DeepL and me)[2]

There are also failure modes where the person has feelings that trigger opposite strategies:

Pursuit/distancing in relationships. Someone may have learned that the feeling of being alone and without a romantic relationship is painful and something to avoid, and developed strategies to get into a relationship that are triggered whenever they are single. At the same time, they may also have had the experience of feeling suffocated and constrained in relationships. This may cause a strategy that triggers whenever the person feels at all at risk of being constrained in the relationship and causes them to distance themselves from the other person.

Janina Fisher offers an vivid description of this in Healing the Fragmented Selves of Trauma Survivors:

Aaron described the reasons for which he had come: ���I start out by getting attached to women very quickly���I immediately think they���re the ���one.��� I���m all over them, can���t see them enough ��� until they start to get serious or there���s a commitment. Then I suddenly start to see everything I didn���t see before, everything that���s wrong with them. I start feeling trapped with someone who���s not right for me���I want to leave, but I feel guilty���or afraid they���ll leave me. I���m stuck. I can���t relax and be happy, but I can���t get out of it either.���

Aaron was describing an internal struggle between parts: between an attachment-seeking part that quickly connected to any attractive woman who treated him warmly and a hypervigilant, hypercritical fight part that reacted to every less-than-optimal quality she possessed as a sign of trouble. His flight part, triggered by the alarms of the fight part, then would start to feel trapped with what felt like the ���wrong person,��� generating impulses to get out���an action that his submit and cry for help parts couldn���t allow. [...] Without a language to differentiate each part and bring it to his awareness, he ruminated constantly: should he leave? Or should he stay? Was she enough? Or should he get out now? Often, suicide seemed to him the most logical solution to this painful dilemma, yet at the same time ���he��� dreamed of having a family with children and a loving and lovely wife.

Wanting to be with people vs. wanting to be alone. A similar phenomenon may pop up in a non-romantic context, where a person desires connection and goes to social events - but then feels uncomfortable in them, and wants to reduce that feeling of discomfort by leaving right away. A short story I once read described this evocatively as ���I remember wondering why I always first want to belong, but then always immediately want to leave���. [3]

Playing the slot machine vs. not playing the slot machine. In the case of playing the slot machine, it may be that another part of the mind notices that this behavior is actually self-destructive and generates a feeling of distress about being stuck in self-destructive behavior. This distress may then make the person less inclined to play, even as the lack of control when not playing drives back towards playing.

In the worst-case scenario, the distress produced by this self-destructive pattern may serve to further entrench the pattern. A part aimed at reducing the distress from gaming might recognize that when the person becomes distracted by the slot machines, they temporarily forget about other concerns, including their own distress over constant gaming. Thus, it might end up also driving the person to gamble more.

What to do about it?
So, if you recognize yourself running into some of these failure modes - what can you actually do about it?

All of them involve some subconscious learning about what kinds of feelings to have and what kinds of strategies to employ in response to those feelings. As such, various memory reconsolidation-based practices can be employed to identify and change those learnings. 

As usual, Internal Family Systems is one of my personal favorite methodologies. Practicing Gendlin���s Focusing is also useful for developing a higher awareness of the various felt senses happening in your mind. Core Transformation is a parts work technique explicitly aimed at processing different feelings and refactoring them.

A prompt that may sometimes work for stuck-on anxiety responses is the following:

(It may be easier to do this exercise in a situation where to anxiety is not acutely activated, but you remember it well enough to remind yourself of what it feels like when it is triggered.)
See if you can get curious about what the response is trying to do. For example, is it try to run away, is trying to hide, is it trying to keep you motionless?
Ask yourself - if the response could do that just the way that it wanted to do, what would that be like? For example, maybe the desire to run away has a sense of somewhere safe where it would like to run to. Maybe the desire to hide has a sense that by digging itself somewhere underground, it could get away from threats. Maybe the desire to stay motionless feels like if it could freeze completely enough, it could become invisible, and any danger would move past it.
You might have the thought that the imagined outcome feels impossible, irrational or counterproductive. In that case, note that the objection is a valid one, and then put it aside. You���re not evaluating the overall realism of the plan or committing to actually doing this in a real situation, you���re trying to get into contact with the emotional schema which does think that this makes sense.
Invite the reaction to complete, just the way that it wants to complete. You can imagine actually running away to that sense of safety, actually digging yourself to somewhere underground, actually staying motionless enough to become invisible.
If it feels like this is doing something, stay with the thing-you���ve-imagined until it feels like the reaction has resolved. 
In Creating a Truly Formidable Art, Valentine talks about internal noise. I interpret him to be talking about two different kinds of noise:

Emotional noise - something like feelings of discomfort or stuck-on anxiety responses that give rise to various, often Goodharty-strategies to avoid them.

Cognitive noise - thoughts that make up the strategies themselves, including the strategy of having lots of thoughts that distract from the underlying feeling.

He has some suggestions of what to do about that in the section about Becoming the Art. And I don���t think it���s a coincidence that he talks about these practices as anti-Goodhart moves, nor that he talks about developing a highly honed feeling of the Art.

I find it hard to see what's going on in me when everything is loud inside and thoughts are slamming into one another and creating turbulence while other thoughts are running in the background influencing me unseen. It doesn't matter how accurate some or even all of those thoughts are: I still can't do much intentionally with all that clutter. I'm just reacting.

But if I can come to inner silence, I can see and hear what's going on in me very clearly.

In my words: if you are full of different feelings that various parts of your mind are urgently reacting to (as well as the reactions themselves), it doesn���t leave any space to actually see what���s happening, or what the different strategies are responses to. If you can calm down some of that activity, it becomes possible to perceive things better and to actually let your entire mind-system participate in choosing your actions.

Practices such as meditation, IFS, or Acceptance and Commitment Therapy can also help in unblending / cognitively defusing from various feelings - that is, coming to experience e.g. a feeling of danger as a feeling of danger, instead of an objective fact of being in danger.

In general, I would say that the right approach is not to start distrusting your feelings too much. It���s good to have some healthy skepticism, but probably all of our thought and action is driven by learned senses of what ���good thought��� and ���good action��� should feel like. (If you develop a distrust of your feelings, then that feeling of distrust is also a feeling.) 

Rather, I would suggest opening up to feelings. Becoming familiar with them, understanding where they come from and what they are trying to do, and allowing them to become updated with new evidence and feedback. (As well as applying more therapeutic approaches to ones that seem to resist updating.) In the best case, you can straighten out some of the more Goodharty loops and let your actions become more grounded in reality and in what you actually care about

Kaj Sotala's piece "Goodhart's Law inside the human mind" delves into the complexities of human behavior, particularly how people often prioritize managing their internal states over achieving real-world outcomes. Here's a summary of the main points he discusses:
Misplaced Priorities
: Sotala starts by reflecting on observations from social psychology, which suggest that people are often more focused on maintaining favorable internal states, such as self-esteem or feelings of control, rather than directly engaging with real-world outcomes. This reflects a fundamental aspect of human psychology where internal feelings often take precedence over external realities.
Gambling as Control
: He uses the example of gambling addiction to illustrate this point. For many gamblers, the act of gambling isn't about winning money but rather about entering a "zone" where they can feel a sense of control. This pursuit of control is paradoxical because it leads to greater real-world chaos and loss of control.
Social Media and Smoking
: Sotala extends this analysis to other behaviors like social media usage and smoking, where the activities provide a temporary sense of autonomy and control, even if they lead to negative outcomes or become compulsive.
Goodhart's Law Applied to Psychology
: The article discusses Goodhart's Law, which states that "when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." Sotala applies this to psychological states: when the sensation of control (or any internal state) becomes a target for regulation, it no longer accurately reflects one's true control over their environment. This can lead to behaviors that are counterproductive or destructive.
Regulatory Subsystems
: He posits that the brain has subsystems that calculate and regulate feelings based on external factors. Ideally, these feelings should help guide adaptive behavior. However, when these feelings themselves become the focus of optimization, they can lead to maladaptive behaviors.
Systemic Misalignments and Solutions
: Sotala argues that these misalignments between feelings and actual control are systemic, suggesting that the evolutionary purpose of these regulatory systems might have been external but has taken on a life of its own internally. Understanding this can help explain why people engage in behaviors that seem irrational by conventional standards.
Behavioral Regulation by Feeling
: The essay concludes by suggesting that much of human behavior can be understood as attempts to regulate feelings to keep them within desired parameters. This includes both beneficial regulations (like maintaining balance while walking) and harmful ones (like compulsive gambling or smoking).
Sotala's exploration provides a compelling framework for understanding many puzzling aspects of human behavior, especially those that seem self-destructive or irrational. By considering how internal states can dominate our decision-making processes, he sheds light on the importance of aligning these states with external realities to foster healthier behaviors and better outcomes.

Kaj Sotala's exploration of Goodhart's Law within the human mind indeed connects interestingly with his other topics discussed in previous articles, such as multiagent models of mind and social stances in cross-sex friendships. Here are the connections:
Multiagent Models of Mind
:
Internal Conflict and Alignment
: In both his discussions on multiagent models and Goodhart's Law, Sotala emphasizes the complexity and sometimes conflicting goals within a single system���whether it's the human mind or an artificial intelligence. In the case of Goodhart���s Law, he describes how optimizing for internal states (like feeling in control) can lead to actions that are misaligned with actual beneficial outcomes, paralleling the internal misalignment seen in multiagent models.
Subsystems and Subagents
: Both discussions imply that the mind is composed of multiple subsystems or subagents, each with its own goals and methods of achieving them. In multiagent models, these could be seen as competing agents within an AI, while in the Goodhart's Law context, they are different psychological systems or responses trying to optimize internal feelings.
Social Stances and Misunderstandings
:
Internal States vs. External Perceptions
: In the article on social stances, Sotala discusses how different social stances and the expectations that arise from them can lead to misunderstandings in human interactions, akin to how misalignments between internal states and actual control can cause self-destructive behaviors in the Goodhart's Law context.
Pattern Recognition and Social Behavior
: The idea that people often act based on recognized social patterns (and attempt to fit into them) resonates with the discussion on Goodhart���s Law, where individuals follow patterns that optimize for internal feelings, sometimes at the cost of their well-being or social harmony.
Managing Expectations and Emotional Schemas
: Both themes involve individuals managing their internal states to align with or respond to external stimuli or social cues. In social stances, managing expectations and emotional responses in interactions requires understanding and adapting to others' perceived stances. Similarly, in managing feelings of control or self-esteem as discussed under Goodhart's Law, individuals often engage in behaviors that might not reflect the actual situation but rather are aimed at maintaining an internal equilibrium.
Overall, Sotala's work consistently highlights the importance of understanding the internal mechanisms and models driving human behavior, whether in social interactions, psychological well-being, or even theoretical discussions on AI. These insights point to the broader theme of how our internal models of the world, whether accurate or not, profoundly influence our actions and interactions. By understanding these connections, we can better address issues related to AI alignment, psychological health, and social harmony.
