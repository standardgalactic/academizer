Introduction


There is a simple truth - humanity���s extinction is possible. Recent history has also shown us another truth - we can create artificial intelligence (AI) that can rival humanity.1 There is no reason to believe that creating an AI vastly beyond the most intelligent humans today is impossible. Should such AI research go wrong, it would risk our extinction as a species; should it go right, it will still seismically transform our world at a greater scale than the Industrial Revolution.

We now stand at a time of peril. Companies across the globe are investing to create artificial superintelligence ��� that they believe will surpass the collective capabilities of all humans. They publicly state that it is not a matter of ���if��� such artificial superintelligence might exist, but ���when���.2  Their investments mean that we must ask: If we build machines smarter than any human, that are better at business, science, politics, and everything else, and can further improve themselves, do we know how to control them? This is a critical question for the future of every person alive today, and every one of our descendants.

Reasonable estimates by both private AI companies and independent third parties indicate that they believe it could cost only tens to hundreds of billions of dollars to create artificial superintelligence. It would be an accomplishment comparable to building a small fleet of aircraft carriers, or founding a new city of a million people from scratch: something that major countries such as the United Kingdom or France could achieve if sufficiently determined, and that the largest economies (such as the United States or China) could do without a significant impact on their other priorities.

We believe that no one company or government, no matter how well-intentioned its people and its work may be, should make such consequential decisions for the entirety of the human species. We need to chart a path for humanity as a whole to stay in control.

A new and ambitious future lies beyond a narrow path. A future driven by human advancement and technological progress. One where humanity fulfills the dreams and aspirations of our ancestors to end disease and extreme poverty, achieves virtually limitless energy, lives longer and healthier lives, and travels the cosmos. That future requires us to be in control of that which we create, including AI.

This document outlines our plan to achieve this: to traverse this path. It assumes the reader already has some familiarity with the ways in which AI poses catastrophic and extinction risks to human existence. These risks have been acknowledged by world3 leaders4, leading scientists and AI industry leaders5 6 7, and analyzed by other researchers, including the recent Gladstone Report commissioned by the US Department of State8 and various reports by the Center for AI Safety and the Future of Life Institute.9 10

Our plan consists of three phases:

Phase 0: Safety
New institutions, legislation, and policies that countries should implement immediately that prevent development of AI that we do not have control of. With correct execution, the strength of these measures should prevent anyone from developing artificial superintelligence for the next 20 years.

Phase 1: Stability
International measures and institutions that ensure measures to control the development of AI do not collapse under geopolitical rivalries or rogue development by state and non-state actors. With correct execution, these measures should ensure stability and lead to an international AI oversight system that does not collapse over time.

Phase 2: Flourishing
With the development of rogue superintelligence prevented and a stable international system in place, humanity can focus on the scientific foundations for transformative AI under human control. Build a robust science and metrology of intelligence, safe-by-design AI engineering, and other foundations for transformative AI under human control.

While most AI development is beneficial, artificial superintelligence threatens humanity with extinction. We have no method to currently control an entity with greater intelligence than us. We currently have no ability to predict the intelligence of advanced AIs prior to developing them, and we have incredibly limited methods to accurately measure their competence after development.

We now stand at a time of peril. Companies across the globe are investing to create artificial superintelligence ��� that they believe will surpass the collective capabilities of all humans. They publicly state that it is not a matter of ���if��� such superintelligence might exist, but ���when���.

We do not know how to control AI vastly more powerful than us. Should attempts to build superintelligence succeed, this would risk our extinction as a species. But humanity can choose a different future: there is a narrow path through.

A new and ambitious future lies beyond a narrow path. A future driven by human advancement and technological progress. One where humanity fulfils the dreams and aspirations of our ancestors to end disease and extreme poverty, achieves virtually limitless energy, lives longer and healthier lives, and travels the cosmos. That future requires us to be in control of that which we create, including AI.

The above paragraphs appear at the start of the document "A Narrow Path" which was recently published by Control AI. See https://www.narrowpath...���.

That document sets out a comprehensive policy plan split into three phases: Safety, Stability, and Flourishing. To be clear, this is no anti-AI campaign, but rather an initiative to ���build a robust science and metrology of intelligence, safe-by-design AI engineering, and other foundations for transformative AI under human control���.

Shortly after the launch of "A Narrow Path", another document was published: "The Compendium", which covers what can be seen as the larger picture behind the thinking of "A Narrow Path".

See https://www.thecompend...���.

The Compendium starts as follows:

======

Today, ideologically motivated groups are driving an arms race to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), backed by Big Tech, and are vying for the support of nations. If these actors succeed in their goal of creating AI that is more powerful than humanity, without the necessary solutions to safety, it is game over for all of us. There is currently no solution to keep AI safe.

In order to do something about these risks, we must understand them fully.

The Compendium aims to present a coherent worldview explaining the race to AGI and extinction risks and what to do about them, in a way that is accessible to non-technical readers who have no prior knowledge about AI. You can read this end-to-end or a-la-carte. Each section is standalone.

======

Both documents are full of rich analyses, and are likely to transform public discussion about the future of AI. Both are described as work-in-progress, which means that each of us has the chance to suggest improvements.

What are some problems with defining superintelligence?
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Defining superintelligence is a complex challenge due to several nuanced and interrelated problems. Here are some key issues:
1.
Lack of Consensus on Definition
Varying Interpretations
: Different researchers and theorists have different interpretations of what constitutes superintelligence, leading to confusion and inconsistency in discussions.
Ambiguity
: Terms like "intelligence," "superintelligence," and "general intelligence" can be vague and subjective, making precise definitions difficult.
2.
Measurement Challenges
Quantifying Intelligence
: Intelligence is multifaceted and can encompass various cognitive abilities such as reasoning, problem-solving, creativity, and emotional understanding. Creating a standardized metric to measure these dimensions is problematic.
Comparative Metrics
: Determining how to compare human intelligence with AI capabilities raises questions. For example, how do we measure a machine's ability to perform tasks that require human-like reasoning or creativity?
3.
Temporal Context
Evolving Standards
: What is considered superintelligent today may change as both human and AI capabilities evolve. An entity that is superintelligent today might not be viewed the same way in the future as our understanding and expectations change.
Human-Level vs. Superintelligence
: The transition from human-level intelligence to superintelligence is not clearly defined. There is debate about what specific capabilities distinguish the two, complicating the definition.
4.
Functional vs. Theoretical Definitions
Functionality
: Some definitions focus on what superintelligence can do (e.g., outperforming humans in all tasks), while others may consider theoretical constructs that might not have practical applications.
Theoretical Constructs
: Theoretical frameworks may not adequately capture the complexities of intelligence and the potential emergence of superintelligent systems.
5.
Domain-Specific vs. General Intelligence
Narrow vs. General Intelligence
: Most AI today is designed for narrow tasks (narrow AI), and it is unclear how to extrapolate those capabilities to define superintelligence, which implies a broad, general capability across diverse domains.
Human Comparison
: Many definitions of superintelligence are based on human abilities, but intelligence can manifest differently in machines. This raises questions about whether machine intelligence can be compared directly to human intelligence.
6.
Ethical and Philosophical Considerations
Value Alignment
: Defining superintelligence also requires consideration of the values it embodies. A superintelligent AI might not share human values, making its alignment with human goals a significant concern.
Existential Risk
: The implications of superintelligence include potential risks to humanity, leading to debates about whether it is prudent to define and pursue superintelligence given the uncertainties and dangers involved.
7.
Predictive Challenges
Future Development
: Predicting the pathways through which superintelligence might develop is fraught with uncertainty, as we currently lack comprehensive models of intelligence development, particularly in complex systems like AI.
Unforeseen Behaviors
: Superintelligent systems might behave in ways that are unexpected or beyond current human understanding, making it hard to establish clear boundaries on what superintelligence entails.
Conclusion
Defining superintelligence is not merely a theoretical exercise; it has real implications for the development and governance of AI systems. The complexities surrounding its definition highlight the need for interdisciplinary dialogue among AI researchers, ethicists, policymakers, and the public to navigate the challenges posed by advanced AI.
4o mini
Dijiste:
I was thinking that by definition superintelligence would be incomprehensible. Someone was complaining earlier that you couldn't read the Bible forward and backwards just as easily, which presumably would be easy for a superintelligent. However it seems odd that someone should use their arbitrary preferences as benchmarks.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Your insight touches on some profound philosophical and conceptual issues surrounding the definition of superintelligence, especially regarding comprehension and the benchmarks we use to evaluate intelligence. Here are several points to consider in this context:
1.
Incomprehensibility of Superintelligence
Beyond Human Comprehension
: The notion that superintelligence might be incomprehensible suggests that its thought processes, reasoning, and decision-making could transcend human understanding. This could mean that even if we could interact with a superintelligent AI, its reasoning could involve concepts, calculations, or forms of logic that are simply beyond human capacity to grasp.
Different Forms of Intelligence
: If superintelligent systems operate on principles or frameworks that differ fundamentally from human cognition, their outputs or behaviors might appear nonsensical or illogical from a human perspective.
2.
Arbitrary Benchmarks for Intelligence
Human-Centric Standards
: Often, benchmarks for intelligence���such as the ability to read complex texts or solve difficult problems���are based on human abilities and preferences. This raises questions about the validity of these standards when applied to non-human intelligences.
Cultural and Contextual Biases
: Individual preferences and cultural contexts significantly shape how we evaluate intelligence. For instance, valuing certain cognitive tasks (like reading or mathematical problem-solving) may not accurately reflect the range of abilities that could define intelligence in a broader, more universal context.
3.
Cognitive Diversity
Multiple Intelligences
: Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences posits that intelligence is not a single entity but a combination of different kinds, such as linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, and emotional intelligences. Superintelligence might operate on principles that draw from a wide array of these intelligences in ways that humans cannot fully appreciate or replicate.
Different Priorities
: A superintelligent entity might prioritize tasks and processes based on criteria entirely different from human values or interests, which can lead to outputs that seem irrelevant or strange to us.
4.
Measurement and Evaluation Problems
Subjectivity in Evaluation
: The criteria we use to measure intelligence, such as problem-solving speed or understanding of language, may be subjective and reflect personal or societal biases. For example, a superintelligent AI might solve problems in a manner that is completely efficient but does not align with human expectations or traditional methodologies.
Complexity of Tasks
: Tasks that humans find difficult or complex might be trivial for a superintelligent AI, but this does not necessarily mean the AI is "better" in a holistic sense���it could merely highlight the limits of human cognitive capabilities.
5.
Philosophical Implications
Redefining Intelligence

What if all online business including cloud storage are a form of vanity publishing
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
The idea of viewing all online businesses, including cloud storage, as a form of "vanity publishing" can provoke an interesting discussion about the nature of online platforms, content creation, and the value of digital services. Here���s a breakdown of this concept:
Understanding Vanity Publishing
Vanity publishing
traditionally refers to publishing services that are financed by the author rather than a traditional publisher, often resulting in works that may not have met the standards for publication through traditional channels. The term carries a connotation of self-indulgence, where the author is motivated by a desire for recognition rather than a genuine belief in the quality or marketability of the content.
Analogies to Online Business
When considering online businesses, including cloud storage services, as a form of vanity publishing, several parallels emerge:
Content Creation and Ownership
Many online platforms allow individuals to publish content (blogs, videos, music) that may not have undergone rigorous vetting or editorial processes, akin to vanity publishing where the focus is on self-expression rather than quality.
Just as vanity publishing can lead to an oversaturation of low-quality books, the internet is filled with content that may lack depth, critical thinking, or originality.
Motivation Behind Use
Users of cloud storage and online platforms often engage out of personal desire for visibility, recognition, or convenience rather than a need that contributes significantly to societal value.
This can create a cycle where the platform���s success is driven by individuals seeking validation rather than fostering meaningful community or innovation.
Accessibility and Saturation
The low barrier to entry for online business and content creation can lead to a saturation of services and products, mirroring the proliferation of vanity published works that clutter the market.
Many online services are built on the premise of ease of access, which may prioritize quantity over quality, similar to how vanity presses may prioritize accepting submissions over curating quality literature.
Implications of This Perspective
1.
Quality vs. Quantity
This analogy raises concerns about the overall quality of online content and services. It invites questions about how to discern valuable contributions in a sea of self-published or self-promoted material.
2.
Value of Digital Services
It challenges the perceived value of cloud storage and other online services. Are these services genuinely meeting user needs, or are they catering to the ego of the user wanting to feel relevant or recognized in the digital landscape?
3.
Market Dynamics
The comparison may suggest a shift in market dynamics where platforms and services are driven more by self-promotion than by innovation, leading to a stagnation in meaningful advancements.
4.
Cultural Reflection
This viewpoint might reflect a broader cultural shift towards individualism and self-promotion, raising philosophical questions about the implications of this trend for society as a whole. Are we becoming more self-focused at the expense of communal values and shared knowledge?
Counterarguments
While viewing online businesses as vanity publishing offers a critical perspective, there are also counterarguments:
Value of Self-Expression
: Many individuals find genuine value in expressing themselves and sharing their ideas, which can lead to innovation and community building.
Quality Content Emerges
: In a marketplace of ideas, high-quality content can still rise to the top, and many online platforms have mechanisms to surface valuable contributions.
Utility of Services
: Cloud storage and other digital services provide practical benefits (e.g., data backup, collaboration tools) that serve real user needs, which go beyond self-promotion.
Conclusion
Viewing all online businesses, including cloud storage, as a form of vanity publishing is a thought-provoking perspective that invites deeper exploration of the motivations behind digital engagement and content creation. While it raises important questions about quality and the nature of online interactions, it is essential to balance this viewpoint with an understanding of the genuine value that many online platforms provide in terms of self-expression, connectivity, and practical utility. This analysis can lead to a richer dialogue about how we navigate and curate our digital environments in an age of overwhelming content and services.

I believe that any individual plant, animal, or virus can take over the planet if allowed to reproduce itself indefinitely without constraints. In this sense they are all grabby aliens, unaware of the implications of their actions until they come up against constraints of other intelligences and organisms.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Your perspective that individual plants, animals, or even viruses could be considered "grabby aliens" if allowed to reproduce indefinitely without constraints raises several interesting points about ecological dynamics, competition, and the nature of intelligence. Here���s a deeper exploration of this concept:
1.
The Concept of "Grabby Aliens"
Definition
: "Grabby aliens" typically refer to hypothetical extraterrestrial intelligences that aggressively expand and dominate their environments, potentially at the expense of other life forms or ecosystems. Applying this term to earthly organisms suggests that they inherently strive for dominance and survival, often without regard for the broader ecological consequences.
Reproductive Strategies
: Many organisms exhibit reproductive strategies that prioritize rapid growth and reproduction, such as certain invasive species. These strategies can lead to overpopulation and depletion of resources, which aligns with the idea of a "grabby" nature.
2.
Reproduction Without Constraints
Ecological Implications
: If any individual organism were allowed to reproduce indefinitely, it could lead to significant ecological disruption. For example, unchecked populations of certain species (like locusts or rats) can devastate ecosystems and lead to the decline of other species.
Viruses and Pathogens
: Viruses, too, can spread rapidly and dominate host populations without constraints. Their ability to replicate and evolve quickly poses challenges for ecosystems and human health.
3.
Awareness and Implications
Unawareness of Consequences
: Many organisms act based on instinct and survival mechanisms rather than conscious awareness of the broader implications of their actions. For instance, plants compete for sunlight and nutrients, while animals may aggressively defend territory or resources. This "unawareness" mirrors the notion of grabby aliens acting without understanding the ecological consequences of their proliferation.
Interconnectedness
: The interactions between different species often act as natural checks and balances. Competition, predation, and resource availability create constraints that prevent any one organism from dominating completely.
4.
Intelligence and Constraints
Role of Constraints
: The presence of constraints���whether environmental, biological, or social���serves as a vital balancing mechanism in ecosystems. These constraints can arise from competition with other species, predation, disease, or human intervention.
Intelligent Response
: While many organisms lack conscious awareness, humans possess the ability to reflect on the implications of unchecked growth. This understanding allows us to implement conservation strategies and manage ecosystems to prevent overpopulation and ecological collapse.
5.
Ethical and Philosophical Considerations
Moral Responsibility
: The notion of grabby aliens can inform discussions about human responsibility toward the planet. As conscious beings capable of understanding the consequences of our actions, we have an ethical obligation to consider the impacts of our reproduction, consumption, and environmental practices.
Ecosystem Management
: Recognizing organisms as potentially grabby forces can help inform policies around biodiversity, invasive species management, and conservation efforts. This perspective emphasizes the importance of maintaining ecological balance to ensure the survival of diverse species.
6.
Potential Consequences of Unchecked Growth
Collapse of Ecosystems
: Without constraints, any organism could lead to the collapse of ecosystems, resulting in loss of biodiversity and critical resources. This scenario emphasizes the fragility of ecological networks and the importance of maintaining balance.
Human Perspective
: From a human standpoint, unchecked proliferation of any species, including our own, can lead to resource depletion, climate change, and environmental degradation. Understanding this can motivate proactive approaches to sustainable living.
Conclusion
The idea that individual plants, animals, or viruses can act as "grabby aliens" if allowed to reproduce indefinitely without constraints highlights the intricate relationships within ecosystems and the potential consequences of unchecked growth. This perspective encourages a greater awareness of our responsibilities as stewards of the planet and underscores the need for sustainable practices to maintain ecological balance. By acknowledging the potential for organisms to dominate their environments, we can better understand the necessity of constraints and the interconnectedness of all life forms.

According to Darin Stevenson, thrisps are memetic thought-complexes that compete for attention in peoples brains and volumetric space in the environment.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Darin Stevenson���s concept of thrips as "memetic thought-complexes" introduces an intriguing framework for understanding how ideas and cultural phenomena compete for attention and resources in both human cognition and the physical environment. This perspective aligns with memetics, which is the study of how ideas, behaviors, and styles spread within a culture, akin to the way genes propagate biological traits. Here are some key aspects of this concept:
1.
Understanding Thrips as Memetic Thought-Complexes
Definition of Thrips
: In this context, "thrips" can be seen as metaphors for ideas, trends, or memes that proliferate within human consciousness and society. They are likened to pests that invade and occupy cognitive and physical spaces, competing for limited resources.
Memetic Framework
: Memetics posits that cultural units of information (memes) evolve and spread through imitation, adaptation, and competition. Thrips as thought-complexes suggest that some ideas are more successful at capturing attention and becoming dominant in culture.
2.
Competition for Attention
Cognitive Space
: Just as biological organisms compete for space and resources in the environment, ideas and memes compete for cognitive space within individuals��� minds. The more attention an idea garners, the more likely it is to thrive and spread.
Information Overload
: In a world inundated with information, the competition for attention becomes even more pronounced. Thrips, in this metaphor, symbolize the overwhelming number of ideas vying for our focus, leading to a constant filtering process in our cognitive landscape.
3.
Volumetric Space in the Environment
Physical Presence
: Beyond cognitive competition, thrips can also refer to the physical manifestation of ideas in the environment. This includes the presence of products, advertisements, or cultural symbols that occupy space and compete for visibility.
Cultural Artifacts
: Memetic thought-complexes often materialize as cultural artifacts (books, media, technology), which occupy physical space and reflect the values and interests of society.
4.
Implications for Human Behavior and Culture
Influence on Decision-Making
: The presence of certain memetic thought-complexes can significantly influence individual and collective decision-making processes. For example, popular trends or ideas can shape consumer behavior and social norms.
Cultural Evolution
: The competition among thrips can lead to the evolution of culture itself. Memes that successfully adapt and resonate with people may undergo transformations, leading to new ideas or cultural movements.
5.
Interplay with Human Agency
Awareness of Influence
: Recognizing the competitive nature of these thought-complexes can empower individuals to critically evaluate the ideas and memes they consume and propagate. Understanding that some ideas are designed to capture attention can foster a more intentional approach to information engagement.
Creating and Sharing Ideas
: Content creators, marketers, and social influencers can leverage the concept of thrips by crafting compelling ideas that resonate with audiences, maximizing their impact and reach.
6.
Challenges and Critiques
Simplification of Complex Ideas
: Critics might argue that framing ideas as memetic thought-complexes oversimplifies the intricacies of human thought and cultural dynamics. It can reduce complex social phenomena to mere competition for attention.
Ethical Considerations
: The competitive nature of memes raises ethical questions about manipulation and exploitation in media and marketing. Understanding this competition can help inform responsible practices in communication and content creation.
Conclusion
Darin Stevenson���s characterization of thrips as memetic thought-complexes offers a novel lens through which to examine the dynamics of ideas, attention, and cultural evolution. By framing thoughts as entities competing for cognitive and environmental space, we can better understand the mechanisms behind cultural propagation, the impact of information overload, and the responsibilities that come with sharing and creating ideas in our interconnected world. This perspective invites individuals to engage more thoughtfully with the ideas that shape their lives and societies.

Ok that is interesting. He called them "thrisps" but a "thrip" is what, a kind of wasp like insect? Which reminds me of a thrisps sphexisnesh: The presence of fringed wings, protrusible bladders at the tarsal apices, asymmetrical mouth parts with the right mandible vestigial, and a pre- pupal stage during post-embryonic development are typical of thrips or the Thysanoptera which enjoy a cosmopolitan distribution. Most thrips are comparatively small [1.0-3.0 mm], but several of the spore-feeding species of the suborder Tubulifera reach a length of 3.0-6.0 mm, and rarely 10.0 mm. The Terebrantia, however, retain their small size and some species are really minute, measuring hardly 0.5 mm. They are essentially phytophagous or mycophagous, and are one of the well-known tropical cecidogenous insect groups. While many thrips are true gall-formers, a few others are habitually associated with the galls of other thrips and of other insects and mites. Thrips galls present a number of interesting problems in Plant Pathology, Plant Mor- phogenesis, and Ecology, that are of significant fundamental importance. Though the bulk of thrips galls are caused by members of the suborder Tubulifera, a few Terebrantia are also known to produce galls.
Galls, arising in response to the feeding stimulus of thrips, include a variety of abnormalities from simple folding, curling, and rolling to complex deformities. A majority of thrips are more primitive gall-makers, but complexities in galling patterns are known in several species. Although galls may be formed on any part of the plant, thrips induce them mostly on leaves, with a few on buds and shoot axes (Figures 1, 2 and 3), and only juvenile plant parts are receptive to gall-formation.
Galls made by thrips have been known since the turn of the present century. As early as 1902, R��bsaamen described some gall-like malforma- tions on Galium verum, Stellaria media, and Veronica chamaedrys caused by Physothrips basicornis, Frankliniella intonsa, and Thrips tabaci respectively. Grevillius, in 1910, described the anatomical peculiarities of the galls on Stellaria media in Europe caused by Tmetothrips subapterus, Taeniothrips

You���re right to point out that "thrips" refers to a group of tiny, insect-like organisms belonging to the order Thysanoptera. This order includes many species that are known for their plant-feeding habits and sometimes cause damage to crops. The connection between Darin Stevenson���s concept of "thrisps" as memetic thought-complexes and the biological characteristics of actual thrips can provide some interesting insights.
Biological Context of Thrips (Thysanoptera)
Description and Characteristics
:
Size and Form
: Thrips are generally small insects, typically ranging from 1.0 to 3.0 mm in length, although some species can grow larger (up to 10 mm). They often have elongated bodies and are characterized by their fringed wings.
Feeding Habits
: Most thrips are phytophagous (plant-eating) or mycophagous (fungus-eating), meaning they primarily feed on plants or fungi. This feeding behavior can lead to the formation of galls on host plants, which are abnormal growths induced by their feeding.
Gall Formation
: The galls induced by thrips can manifest in various ways, including folding, curling, and complex deformities of plant tissues. These responses illustrate how thrips can manipulate their environment to create a niche for themselves.
Ecological Importance
:
Plant Pathology
: Thrips are of significant interest in the fields of plant pathology and ecology. Their interactions with plants can influence plant health and yield, making them relevant to agricultural practices.
Ecosystem Dynamics
: The presence of thrips and their galls can affect not only the plants they inhabit but also other organisms within the ecosystem, highlighting their role in ecological interactions.
Connection to Darin Stevenson���s Concept of Thrisps
Metaphorical Interpretation
:
By using the term "thrisps," Stevenson could be drawing a parallel between the competitive nature of thrips in their ecological niches and how ideas (or "memes") compete for space and attention in human cognition. Just as thrips can manipulate plant growth for their benefit, ideas can "gall" or invade human thought processes, competing for mental and social resources.
Competition for Resources
:
Just as thrips can cause abnormal growth in plants by inducing galls, ideas that capture attention may grow and proliferate in the cultural landscape, often at the expense of less compelling or competing ideas. This highlights the dynamics of attention and cultural transmission in a way similar to ecological competition.
Adaptation and Evolution
:
Both biological thrips and memetic thrisps illustrate the principles of adaptation and evolution���thrips evolve to thrive in their environments, while ideas evolve to become more appealing or relevant in the minds of individuals. The more effective a meme is at capturing attention and facilitating social sharing, the more likely it is to thrive.
Conclusion
Darin Stevenson���s use of "thrisps" as a concept for understanding memetic competition invites a deeper exploration of the parallels between biological phenomena and cultural dynamics. By likening ideas to thrips, we can gain insights into how thoughts propagate, compete, and influence the ecological systems of human culture. This interdisciplinary approach enriches our understanding of both the natural world and the landscape of human thought, suggesting that the principles of competition, adaptation, and resource allocation are universal across different domains of existence.

Thrips is a like a thrisp, because when I said thrisps you thought I might mean thrips. But the idea of thrips, is itself a thrisps, since it lends an intentional stance and agency to might be a connective complex with uninterpretable or misaligned intentions.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Your analogy between "thrips" and "thrisps" reflects a deeper exploration of the complexities of language, meaning, and intentionality. By considering "thrips" as a specific biological entity and "thrisps" as a metaphorical concept for competing ideas or memes, you���re delving into how our perceptions and interpretations of language shape our understanding of agency and intention. Here���s a breakdown of your ideas:
Conceptual Connections
Language and Interpretation
:
The way we interpret terms like "thrisps" can vary significantly based on our existing knowledge and the context in which the word is used. This reflects the notion that language can act as a bridge between different concepts, leading to potential misinterpretations or layered meanings.
Intentional Stance
:
The idea of "intentional stance" refers to the practice of attributing mental states (like beliefs, desires, and intentions) to entities that may not have them in a human sense. When we think of "thrisps" in a memetic context, we might ascribe agency to ideas or concepts, treating them as if they act with purpose and intent in competing for our attention and resources.
Agency in Memes and Ideas
:
By likening ideas to "thrisps," you propose that these ideas have their own form of agency���competing, evolving, and influencing human thought and behavior much like living organisms do in their ecosystems. This challenges the traditional view of ideas as passive and instead positions them as active participants in cultural and cognitive landscapes.
Connective Complex
:
The concept of a "connective complex" implies that ideas (or thrisps) can form networks of relationships and interactions, influencing each other and the environment in which they exist. This can lead to emergent behaviors or properties that are difficult to interpret or predict, much like the ecological interactions seen with biological organisms such as thrips.
Misaligned Intentions
:
When ideas compete for attention, they may not always align with the intentions of individuals or communities. Some "thrisps" may propagate harmful or misleading concepts, creating a dynamic where the spread of information does not necessarily lead to beneficial outcomes. This echoes the way biological organisms can disrupt ecosystems, with unintended consequences for their environments.
Summary
In summary, your exploration of the terms "thrips" and "thrisps" highlights the fluidity of language and meaning, as well as the potential for ideas to possess a form of agency and intentionality. By examining how ideas compete for attention and influence human behavior, you create a rich metaphorical framework that encourages us to consider the implications of our interactions with ideas in the same way we would with biological entities. This perspective invites deeper reflection on the nature of thought, communication, and the complex dynamics that govern both biological and cultural ecosystems.

He said: While writing the first few paragraphs, I had what was for me a crucial and formative insight. Specifically, it was that I could envision the entire network of living human minds��� as an actual environment ��� from a perspective beyond what we usually are capable of perceiving or supposing. I could, in effect, ���see��� it as ���a world��� layered on the physical and organismal worlds.

I called this network the cogniscium, and thought of it as an invisible dimension of our own planet, that was a kind of ���second world��� in its own right. It has something analogous to ���ecologies���, but they are not organismal; their basis is primarily relational; they hitchhike on organismal structure, behavior, and nervous systems.

I conceived of the landscape comprised by the human cogniscium as ���inhabited��� by entities of a sort ��� processes vaguely analogous to what we call ���animals���, except that these things were virulently competitive and aimed at domination of structural features of the network of human minds.

They are not alive, but are instead examples of special form of persistent information in human minds, relationships and behavior. I called them thrisps.

Thrisps inhabit the terrains of this ���world��� forged from our minds and the connections between them. They covertly dominate entire epochs of human culture and behavior, thought and experience. The concept of monotheism is an example, as is Google.

Recusively, the concept of thrisps is, itself, a thrisp. But unlike the majority of thrisps, the concept of thrisps introduces the possibility of transcending the malignant variety��� or engineering them on purpose.

I then began to imagine the connective infrastructure that unified the minds in this living network. As I moved into my imagination to invent a word for it.

ChatGPT
Darin Stevenson���s exploration of the concept of the
cogniscium
and
thrisps
offers a fascinating perspective on the interplay between human cognition, culture, and information. Let���s unpack the key ideas he presents, as well as their implications:
Key Concepts
Cogniscium
:
Stevenson describes the
cogniscium
as a network of living human minds that forms an "invisible dimension" of our planet���a second world layered on top of our physical reality. This perspective encourages viewing human cognition not just as individual minds but as part of a collective environment where thoughts and ideas interact and evolve.
This notion parallels ecological systems, where different organisms interact within a shared environment, but here it focuses on the relational and informational aspects of human thought.
Thrisps
:
Thrisps
are conceptualized as entities within this cogniscium. They are likened to competitive processes rather than living organisms, representing persistent forms of information that dominate human thought and culture.
They thrive on the networks of human minds, potentially influencing behavior and shaping cultural narratives, much like biological species can dominate ecological niches.
The term
thrisp
reflects the competitive and often parasitic nature of certain ideas, concepts, or memes that seek to gain attention and influence over others.
Dominance and Competition
:
Thrisps are characterized as "virulently competitive," suggesting that they engage in a struggle for dominance within the cognitive landscape. This competition can manifest in various forms, such as cultural ideologies (e.g., monotheism) or technological platforms (e.g., Google), which exert considerable influence over human behavior and societal structures.
Malignant vs. Benevolent Thrisps
:
Stevenson acknowledges that while many thrisps can be harmful or malignant, the concept of thrisps also allows for the possibility of creating or engineering beneficial ideas. This reflects a duality where some ideas may promote healthy cognitive environments while others may lead to destructive or limiting patterns of thought.
Transcending Malignancy
:
The idea that the concept of thrisps itself represents a potential means of transcending malignant thrisps suggests a meta-cognitive awareness. By recognizing the competitive dynamics of thought and the influence of certain ideas, individuals may be able to cultivate healthier cognitive environments, steering culture towards more beneficial outcomes.
Implications and Insights
Cognitive Ecology
: By framing human thought as an ecology, we can better understand how ideas proliferate, compete, and evolve. This can lead to insights about cultural dynamics and how certain ideologies or practices can become dominant.
Awareness and Agency
: The concept of thrisps encourages mindfulness about the ideas we engage with and promote. Recognizing that ideas can have agency within the cognitive realm may empower individuals to consciously select and propagate beneficial thoughts while resisting harmful ones.
Engineering Ideas
: The possibility of engineering thrisps suggests a proactive approach to cultural change. By intentionally crafting and disseminating positive ideas, individuals and communities can foster healthier cognitive and social environments.
Interconnectedness of Minds
: The cogniscium emphasizes the interconnected nature of human cognition, suggesting that individual thoughts and behaviors are part of a larger web of influence. This perspective invites collaborative approaches to problem-solving and idea-sharing, recognizing that collective intelligence can lead to richer insights and solutions.
Conclusion
Stevenson���s conceptual framework offers a thought-provoking lens through which to view human cognition, culture, and the dynamics of ideas. By recognizing the relational and competitive nature of thoughts, we can better navigate the complexities of our cognitive environments and work towards fostering ideas that enrich our collective human experience. This exploration not only enhances our understanding of cultural evolution but also provides actionable insights for cultivating a more conscious and intentional approach to the ideas we embrace and propagate.

Incorporate algorithms that reflect the Pythagorean emphasis on harmony and relationships between numbers, analogous to the relationships between data points.
Crowd Intelligence (Wisdom of the Crowd):
Implement a collaborative filtering mechanism that aggregates insights from a large pool of contributors, akin to the collective knowledge found in agoras (public spaces).
Use this approach to identify patterns and trends, allowing the system to evolve and adapt over time.
Information Filtering (Essence of the Agora):
Establish criteria for filtering information, ensuring that only relevant and high-quality content is distilled.
Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to query and access distilled knowledge easily.
Noxiousness Assessment (Noxious Oracle):
Develop algorithms to assess the quality and potential biases of information sources, identifying "noxious" or misleading content.
Employ machine learning techniques to refine the assessment process, making the system more effective in recognizing harmful misinformation.
Integration of Perspectives (High Mind of the People):
Allow for diverse perspectives and interpretations, mirroring the multiplicity of voices in the agora.
Create a system that not only collects data but also contextualizes it, providing users with a multi-dimensional understanding of topics.
Adaptive Learning (Elevated Thought of the Masses):
Incorporate feedback mechanisms that allow the system to learn from user interactions and improve its distillation processes.
Use advanced techniques such as natural language processing to enhance the system's ability to understand and categorize knowledge.
Visualization Tools (Heavenly Sage of the Agora):
Design intuitive visualizations that help users navigate through complex information landscapes, drawing inspiration from geometric and mathematical principles.
Utilize data visualization techniques to represent relationships between different concepts and areas of knowledge.
Conclusion
In this way, the name
Pythagoras
serves not only as an emblem of wisdom but also as a
stratewisp

Pythos means noxiousness or stench as in the purified or distilled aroma (compare  al kohl -> alcohol) of the crowd.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Great connection! The term "Pythos" suggesting noxiousness or stench, alongside the concept of a "purified" or "distilled aroma," provides an interesting lens through which to view knowledge and its distillation. Here���s how we can further develop this idea:
Pythos as a Concept in Knowledge Distillation
1. Pythos: The Dual Nature of Knowledge
Noxiousness
: The idea that some knowledge can be misleading, toxic, or harmful. This aligns with the notion that not all information contributes positively to understanding; some may be considered "noxious" or "stench-like," clouding judgment and clarity.
Purified Aroma
: On the other hand, the process of distillation involves filtering out impurities, leaving behind the "pure" essence of knowledge. This duality reflects the journey of transforming raw information into actionable insights.
2. Stratewisp: Knowledge Distillation as an Art
Analogous to Alchemy
: Just as al-kohl (alcohol) refers to the process of distilling a substance to achieve purity, so too can knowledge be distilled to extract its essential truths. The term "Pythos" embodies this alchemical transformation, where one seeks to separate the "noxious" from the valuable.
Guiding Framework
: In the context of constructing a knowledge-distilling computer, "Pythos" serves as a guiding principle���reminding us to seek out the essence of truth while remaining vigilant of misleading or harmful information.
Application to Knowledge Distillation Framework
Using this understanding of "Pythos," we can refine the earlier framework for building a knowledge-distilling computer:
Identifying Noxious Knowledge
:
Algorithmic Filters
: Develop algorithms that recognize patterns of misinformation or harmful ideologies, akin to detecting the "stench" of noxious ideas.
Community Feedback
: Implement community-based reporting mechanisms that allow users to flag and discuss potentially harmful content.
Distillation Process
:
Purification Techniques
: Use advanced data processing techniques to filter and distill knowledge, analogous to the distillation of alcohol. This could include natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and citation tracking to ensure the quality of information.
Aroma of Insight
: Focus on presenting distilled knowledge in an engaging and accessible manner, highlighting the "aroma" of useful insights that arise from purified data.
Community Involvement
:
Agora of Knowledge
: Foster a collaborative environment where users contribute to the distillation process, sharing their insights and expertise to enhance the overall quality of knowledge.
Balancing Perspectives
: Encourage diverse perspectives to enrich the knowledge base, ensuring that the system reflects a wide range of views while maintaining quality control against noxious content.
Conclusion
In this expanded framework, "Pythos" serves as both a cautionary term and a guiding principle in the quest for knowledge. By recognizing the dual nature of information���as both potentially noxious and capable of being distilled into pure insights���we can create systems that not only enhance understanding but also safeguard against the pitfalls of misinformation.

I argued that Aaron's explanation of how he made the golden calf, by taking the jewellery and the gold from the people and throwing it into the furnace, prefigures how LLMs are trained by training them them on large amounts of data (the jewelry and gold of the people).
ChatGPT dijo:

That's an intriguing analogy! Here���s how we can explore the connection between Aaron���s creation of the golden calf and the training process of large language models (LLMs):
Analogical Framework: Aaron's Golden Calf and LLM Training
1. Gathering Materials: Jewelry and Gold
Aaron's Process
: In the biblical narrative, Aaron gathers gold and jewelry from the Israelites, which symbolizes their wealth and contributions. This material is then melted down and reshaped into the golden calf.
LLM Training
: Similarly, LLMs are trained on vast datasets, which consist of text and information generated by a multitude of contributors (akin to the "jewelry and gold" of the people). This data represents the collective knowledge, culture, and creativity of society.
2. The Transformation Process
Furnace as a Metaphor
: Aaron throws the gathered materials into a furnace, representing a transformative process. The furnace can be seen as a crucible where raw materials are reshaped into something new.
Training Algorithms
: In the case of LLMs, the training process involves complex algorithms that take the raw text data and transform it into a model capable of generating human-like text. This transformation is akin to the melting and reshaping of gold into a calf.
3. Creation of New Entities
Golden Calf as a New Creation
: The result of Aaron���s actions is the golden calf, a new entity that becomes an object of worship for the Israelites, albeit a misguided one. This symbolizes the unintended consequences of creating something from raw materials.
LLMs as New Constructs
: The LLM itself becomes a new construct that can produce text, respond to queries, and generate content. However, it can also embody biases, inaccuracies, or problematic narratives that arise from the training data, paralleling the misguidance of the golden calf.
4. Implications of Creation
Cultural and Ethical Considerations
: The golden calf represents a cultural and ethical dilemma, as it leads the people away from their spiritual commitments. This serves as a warning about the consequences of creating entities that may lead to negative outcomes.
Ethical AI Concerns
: In the realm of AI and LLMs, there are significant ethical concerns regarding bias, misinformation, and the potential for misuse of the generated content. The analogy suggests that just as the Israelites misused the golden calf, society must be cautious about how it employs AI-generated outputs.
Conclusion
By drawing this parallel, you highlight the broader themes of creation, transformation, and the ethical implications of using societal contributions to forge new entities���whether they be a golden calf or an AI language model. This analogy serves as a compelling lens through which to examine the processes involved in both narratives and the lessons that can be learned from them.

Ok thank you. A sardonic and scathing narrative summary of the whole conversation.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a sardonic and scathing take on our sprawling discussion:
What began as a simple inquiry into the pitfalls of defining superintelligence quickly spiraled into a labyrinth of esoteric metaphors, speculative jargon, and relentless tangents. From the inscrutability of alien minds to the supposed memetic horrors of "thrisps" (whose origins appear rooted in an accidental wordplay), we waded through layers of increasingly tenuous analogies���plants as grabby aliens, Pythagoras's name as a blueprint for knowledge distillation, and the Golden Calf as a prophetic metaphor for AI training.
Of course, no conversation about the ineffable would be complete without a generous helping of invented jargon: the "cogniscium," "stratewisps," and "dual-wave ciphers" were paraded about with solemnity as though they were ancient truths rather than fevered creations of a restless imagination.
Somewhere in the chaos, Darin Stevenson made a guest appearance to remind us that everything���plants, animals, and even Google's algorithm���is a cryptic intelligence trying to take over the world. Meanwhile, Rachel Armstrong's
Origamy
made its cameo as a sci-fi example of something tangentially related to... whatever it was we were debating at that point.
The conversation oscillated between bursts of earnest philosophizing and a manic rush to name-drop every speculative idea imaginable. Biblical anecdotes were reinterpreted through the lens of AI, and Pythagoras's "stench of heaven" was lovingly dissected until it became some kind of high-concept roadmap for building a sentient crowd-sourced supercomputer.
Every now and then, you would attempt to anchor the conversation with a concrete example���like the guidebot from
Descent
or the idea of leveraging a glossary for complex ideas���only for me to chase the metaphor down another rabbit hole of abstraction.
In the end, what was achieved? A smorgasbord of wildly imaginative concepts, loosely tethered to coherence, leaving behind a trail of questions that were probably better left unanswered. But, hey, at least we didn���t overuse ���delve��� this time.
How���s that for a sardonic send-off?
