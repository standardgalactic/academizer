Table 6: Ablation study of TLDR. The best result is boldfaced. 
For transductive models, we report the stronger of GMSAMINand GMSAAVG. Inductive models are 
trained with standard adversarial training [GSS15], and transductive models with the TLDR loss in 
Eqn (1). As Rejectron depends heavily on a key hyperparameter determining conf i dence needed to 
reject, we report the results for the parameter value strongest against our attack. The best-performing 
value on CIFAR-10 ef f ectively eliminated the possibility of rejection (hence the rejection rate of 0); 
other choices resulted in near-0 robust accuracy. 
Datasets and Defense/Attack Setup. We evaluate on MNIST [LeC98] and CIFAR-10 [KH+09]. We 
consider an adversarial budget of��= 0.3 inl���on MNIST and��= 8/255 inl���on CIFAR-10. For 
defense, on MNIST, we use a LeNet architecture; on CIFAR-10 we use a ResNet-20 architecture. 
In both cases, we train for 40 epochs with a learning rate of 0.001 using ADAM for optimization. 
On MNIST, we use 40 iterations of PGD during training with a step size of 0.01. On CIFAR-10, we 
use 10 iterations of PGD in training with a step size of 2/255. In training TLDR, we put 85% of the 
weight onLtrain, equivalent to��= 0.176 after a warm start period epochs in which��= 0. We use a 
rejection radius of��/4 for selective classif i ers. For attack, we use 10 iterations of GMSA on both 
datasets. On MNIST, we use 200 steps of PGD with a stepsize of 0.01 while generating adversarial 
examples. On CIFAR-10, the PGD attacks use 100 steps with a stepsize of 1/255. Defense settings 
used while training models in GMSA (including internal PGD settings) are the standard defense 
settings. Internal optimizations in the calculation ofLREJuse 
10 steps of PGD with a stepsize of 15% 
of the rejection radius. We use �����= 1 in LREJ; 
we observe little sensitivity to the parameter.

Results. Table 3 shows the robust accuracy and rejection rate of dif f erent methods. We observe 
that either transduction or rejection can improve the performance, while combining both techniques 
leads to the best results. In particular, our defense outperforms existing transductive defenses such as 
RMC and DANN. It also outperforms the strongest existing baseline of 66.56% robust accuracy on 
CIFAR-10 [CAS+20] (note that 66.56% is for the classic setting without rejection and transduction). 
Finally, note that our defense passes the sanity check of [Tra22] (i.e. we do not exceed the theoretical 
upper bound on robust accuracy of 79%), providing evidence that our evaluation is reliable. These 
results provide positive support for the benef i t of combining transduction and rejection for robustness. 
6.2Ablation Studies 
Dif f erent Attacks on TLDR. Table 4 shows the results of dif f erent attack methods on TLDR. 
Previous work [CWG+22] shows that transduction-aware attacks are necessary against transductive 
defenses; we observe that attacks (PGD onLCEorLREJand 
AutoAttack) from the traditional setting 
perform poorly against our defense. We can also see that GMSA signif i cantly outperforms even a 
rejection-aware transfer attack (referred to as PGD targetingLREJ; 
note that PGD and AutoAttack do 
not target the i nal model in this case, given the transductive setting, but instead target a proxy trained 
by the adversary); see Algorithm 2 in Appendix B.5 for the full details. This shows that GMSA 
is critical for attacking a transductive defender; while PGD and AutoAttack are strong against an 
inductive model, they performs poorly facing transduction. Finally, we observe that GMSA withLCE 
is much weaker than GMSA withLREJ. This shows another key component in our adaptive attack, 
the loss LREJ, is also critical to get a strong attack against our defense. 
Ablation onLREJ. To further investigate the importance ofLREJ, 
we attack an adversarially trained 
model with rejection (i.e., the AT+Rejection model), with PGD on dif f erent losses:LREJ, cross- 
entropyLCE, andLREJwithLDB,hreplaced byLCE, with AutoAttack given for comparison. We 
also consider a multitargeted attackLMULTIwhich attempts to i nd, for each incorrect label, the 
perturbation with the highest robust conf i dence up to the rejection radius. More precisely, given a 
point (x,y) and a base classif i erhwith adversarial budget��and rejection radius��defense, for each 
target labely���, y, we i nd a perturbationz(y���) such thatz(y���) and its��defense-ball around it all get the 
label y���(and thus z(y���) will be accepted and misclassif i ed): we let 
z(y���) = argmin 
p:���p���x�������� LMULTI(p,y���), where LMULTI(p,y���) := LCE(p,y���) 
+max 
���z���p��������defense LCE(z,y���).(4) 
Finally, the attack outputs the strongest perturbation, 
z = argmin 
z(y���):y���,y LMULTI(z(y���),y���).(5) 
Table 5 shows the robust accuracy under these dif f erent attacks; note that, as with transudction, 
AutoAttack is unable to i nd perturbations which evade defenses with rejection.LREJleads to the 
strongest attack. In particular, it can be signif i cantly better thanLCEandLMULTI, demonstrating its 
importance for attacking models with rejection. 
Key Components of TLDR. Compared to traditional defenses, TLDR has two novel components: 
using the given test inputs in training the classif i er (the second term in Equation (1), referred to as 
Ltest), and transforming the trained classif i er into one with rejection. Table 6 shows the results of the 
ablation study on these two components. In all cases, rejection signif i cantly improves results. The 
use of transduction is helpful on CIFAR-10, but reduces performance on MNIST probably since it���s 
easier to get robust predictions on MNIST and thus knowing test inputs does not help. 
7Conclusion 
Existing works on leveraging transduction and rejection gave mixed results on their benef i ts for 
adversarial robustness. In this work we take a step in realizing their promise in practical deep 
learning settings. Theoretically, we show that a novel application of Tram`���er���s results give improved 
sample complexity for robust learning in the bounded perturbations setting. Guided by our theory, we 
identif i ed a practical robust learning algorithm leveraging both transduction and rejection. Systematic 
experiments conf i rm the benef i ts of our constructions. There are many future avenues to explore, 
such as improving the theoretical bounds, and improving the ef i ciency of our algorithms.

Abstract 
Bothtransductionandrejectionhaveemergedasimportanttechniquesfordefending 
against adversarial perturbations. A recent work by Tram��r [Tra22] showed that, in 
the rejection-only case (no transduction), a strong rejection-solution can be turned 
into a strong (but computationally inef i cient) non-rejection solution. This detector- 
to-classif i er reduction has been mostly applied to give evidence that certain claims 
of strong selective-model solutions are susceptible, leaving the benef i ts of rejection 
unclear. On the other hand, a recent work by Goldwasser et al. [GKKM20] showed 
that rejection combined with transduction can give provable guarantees (for certain 
problems) that cannot be achieved otherwise. Nevertheless, under recent strong 
adversarial attacks (GMSA [CWG+22], which has been shown to be much more 
ef f ective than AutoAttack against transduction), Goldwasser et al.���s work was 
shown to have low performance in a practical deep-learning setting. In this paper, 
we take a step towards realizing the promise of transduction+rejection in more 
realistic scenarios. Theoretically, we show that a novel application of Tram��r���s 
classif i er-to-detector technique in the transductive setting can give signif i cantly 
improved sample-complexity for robust generalization. While our theoretical 
construction is computationally inef i cient, it guides us to identify an ef i cient 
transductive algorithm to learn a selective model. Extensive experiments using 
state of the art attacks (AutoAttack, GMSA) show that our solutions provide 
signif i cantly better robust accuracy. 
1Introduction 
A recent line of research [GKKM20,MHS21,Goo19,WJS+21,WYW20a] has investigated aug- 
menting models with transduction or rejection to defend against adversarial perturbations. However, 
the results of leveraging these new options have been mixed. For example, a recent work by 
Tram��r [Tra22] gives an equivalence between classif i cation-only and classif i cation-with-rejection; the 
major application of the author���s results has been to provide bounds on the performance of defenses 
with rejection, which can be used to show that the robustness of defenses with rejection may be lower 
than the authors originally claimed, casting doubt on the benef i ts of rejection. 
On the other hand, some recent work in theory has demonstrated that transduction, that is leveraging 
the unlabeled test-time input for learning the model, may have signif i cant impact on defending 
against adversarial robustness. Specif i cally, Montasser et al. [MHS21] studied the setting of trans- 
duction (without rejection), and show that robust learning with transduction allows for signif i cant

improvemnents in sample complexity, reducing dependency on VC dimension from exponential to 
linear; however, this comes at the cost of signif i cantly greater assumptions on the data (OPTU2for the 
realizable case rather than theOPTUof the inductive setting 2). Goldwasser et al. [GKKM20] studied 
transduction and rejection, and show even more surprising results, not achievable with transduction 
or rejection alone. However, one prominent limitation of these works seems to be that none has yet 
resulted in practical robust learning mechanisms in the deep learning setting typically considered.

and [GKKM20], our defense weakens the necessary conditions in the realizable case and improves the asymp-

Specif i cally, compared to Goldwasser et al., which considered arbitrary perturbations, we focus on the 
classic and practical scenairo of bounded perturbations for deep learning. Somewhat surprisingly, we 
show that a novel application of Tram��r���s classif i er-to-detector technique in the transductive setting 
can give signif i cantly improved sample-complexity for robust generalization, noting that bounded 
perturbations are critical for the construction to work. To obtain these improvements, we do not 
require stronger assumptions on the data, as with [MHS21]; in the realizable case, we only need 
to assumeOPTU2/3= 0, which is even better than theOPTU= 0 assumption in the inductive case. 
Table 1 gives more details; the notation is described in Section 3. Our results give a i rst constructive

Could you define the unusual terms?
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are the definitions of some of the unusual terms used in the context of the paper:
Definitions
Transduction
:
Definition
: A learning process where the model leverages both training data and the specific test data it will encounter to make predictions. Unlike traditional inductive learning, which generalizes from training data to any possible test data, transduction tailors the learning process to the particular test set available.
Rejection
:
Definition
: A technique where the model has the capability to reject or abstain from making a prediction on certain inputs, particularly those it finds uncertain or likely to be adversarial. This helps in improving robustness as the model can avoid making incorrect predictions on potentially harmful inputs.
Adversarial Perturbations
:
Definition
: Small, often imperceptible changes made to input data (such as images) designed to deceive a machine learning model into making incorrect predictions. These perturbations exploit vulnerabilities in the model.
Tram��r's Reduction
:
Definition
: A theoretical technique developed by Tram��r that shows an equivalence between models that only classify inputs and those that classify but also have the option to reject inputs. This reduction helps in understanding the robustness of models with rejection capabilities.
Sample Complexity
:
Definition
: A measure of the number of training samples needed for a machine learning model to learn a task to a certain level of accuracy. Lower sample complexity implies that fewer samples are needed for the model to generalize well.
PGD (Projected Gradient Descent)
:
Definition
: An iterative optimization algorithm used for generating adversarial examples. PGD makes small, bounded changes to the input data in each iteration, aiming to maximize the model's prediction error while keeping the perturbation within a specified limit.
GMSA (Gradient Masking and Smoothing Attack)
:
Definition
: An advanced adversarial attack that targets models leveraging transduction and rejection. GMSA is designed to bypass defenses by masking gradients and smoothing the attack to make it less detectable.

). It defines the budget or constraint on how much an input can be altered to create an adversarial example.
VC Dimension (Vapnik-Chervonenkis Dimension)
:
Definition
: A measure of the capacity of a statistical classification model, representing the complexity of functions that can be learned by the model. Higher VC dimensions indicate a model that can represent more complex functions, but may also require more samples to train effectively.
AutoAttack
:
Definition
: A powerful ensemble of adversarial attacks designed to evaluate the robustness of machine learning models. It combines multiple attack strategies to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the model's vulnerability.
Inductive Learning
:
Definition
: The traditional machine learning approach where a model is trained on a set of training data and then evaluated on a separate set of test data. The model aims to generalize from the training data to unseen data.
Realizable Case
:
Definition
: A scenario in learning theory where there exists a hypothesis in the hypothesis class that can perfectly classify all the training samples without error.
Agnostic Case
:
Definition
: A scenario in learning theory where no assumption is made about the existence of a perfect hypothesis. The focus is on minimizing the error relative to the best possible hypothesis in the class.
These definitions should help in understanding the specialized terms and concepts discussed in the paper.

Could I get an everyday example analogy or metaphor to explain the most difficult terms?
ChatGPT
Sure! Here are some everyday analogies for the most challenging terms:
Everyday Analogies
Transduction
:
Analogy
: Imagine you're preparing for a trivia night. Instead of just studying general knowledge (inductive learning), you also get to see the specific questions that will be asked at the trivia night beforehand (transduction). This way, you tailor your studying specifically to those questions, improving your chances of winning.
Rejection
:
Analogy
: Think of a bouncer at a nightclub. The bouncer only lets in people who look like they belong (clean, well-dressed). If someone looks suspicious or is causing trouble, the bouncer rejects them at the door. Similarly, a model with rejection can refuse to classify inputs that seem suspicious or potentially harmful.
Adversarial Perturbations
:
Analogy
: Imagine someone trying to forge a signature. They make tiny changes to their handwriting to closely mimic the original signature, hoping it will be accepted as genuine. Adversarial perturbations are like these tiny changes made to data inputs to trick the model into making a wrong prediction.
Tram��r's Reduction
:
Analogy
: Picture a restaurant that offers both a regular menu and a special diet menu (rejection option). Tram��r's reduction shows that the effectiveness of the special diet menu can be translated into the regular menu, demonstrating that you can provide similar health benefits with either menu type.
Sample Complexity
:
Analogy
: Think about learning to play a new song on the piano. Sample complexity is like the number of practice sessions you need to play the song perfectly. If the song is simple, you need fewer sessions (low sample complexity). If it's complex, you need more sessions (high sample complexity).
PGD (Projected Gradient Descent)
:
Analogy
: Imagine trying to climb a steep hill in the fog. You take small steps in different directions, each time checking if you're getting higher or lower. PGD is like this process, where each step adjusts your path slightly to find the quickest way to the top (maximum error).
GMSA (Gradient Masking and Smoothing Attack)
:
Analogy
: Think of a ninja trying to infiltrate a secure building. GMSA is like the ninja using smooth, silent movements and avoiding obvious paths to get past security guards. It carefully hides its actions to avoid detection while achieving its goal.
TLDR (Transductive Learning with Defense and Rejection)
:
Analogy
: Imagine a security system that not only recognizes faces (classification) but also has a list of allowed guests (transduction) and can refuse entry to suspicious individuals (rejection). TLDR is this comprehensive system ensuring maximum security.

What about if someone deliberately answered incorrectly? Couldn't you still tell that they knew the answers, if they they were consistently wrong.
ChatGPT
That's a great point! Deliberate incorrect answers could indeed provide a clue that the person knows the correct answers. This concept can be related to adversarial examples and robustness in machine learning, where the idea is to detect not just correct classifications but also suspiciously consistent patterns that might indicate tampering or manipulation. Let's break it down with an analogy:
Analogy: Deliberate Incorrect Answers
Imagine a student taking a multiple-choice test who knows all the correct answers but decides to deliberately choose the wrong answers to confuse the teacher. The teacher, knowing the student's capabilities, might notice that the student is consistently picking the wrong answer for each question. This unusual pattern could raise a red flag for the teacher, suggesting that the student is intentionally providing incorrect answers.
Applying the Concept to Adversarial Robustness
Adversarial Perturbations
:
Real-World Analogy
: Like the student intentionally giving wrong answers, adversarial perturbations are deliberate modifications made to input data to fool the model.
Detection Through Consistency
:
Real-World Analogy
: Just as the teacher might detect the deliberate wrong answers through their consistent pattern, a robust model might detect adversarial examples by recognizing unusual patterns that differ from typical errors.
Rejection Mechanism
:
Real-World Analogy
: The teacher, upon noticing the pattern, might decide to reject the student's answers as valid, questioning their authenticity. Similarly, a model with a rejection mechanism can refuse to classify inputs that show suspiciously consistent errors, enhancing its robustness against adversarial attacks.
Key Takeaways
Adversarial Attacks and Consistent Patterns
: Just as consistent deliberate errors can reveal a student's knowledge, consistent patterns in adversarial attacks can be detected by a robust model. The model can then use this information to reject suspicious inputs.
Rejection Mechanism
: By incorporating a rejection mechanism, models can enhance their robustness, refusing to classify inputs that exhibit unusual patterns indicative of adversarial manipulation.
Adaptive Detection
: Robust models can adapt to detect not just incorrect classifications but also patterns of deliberate manipulation, similar to how a teacher might recognize a student's intentional mistakes.
This analogy highlights how understanding the consistency and patterns in inputs can play a crucial role in enhancing the robustness and reliability of machine learning models against adversarial attacks.

I mean that in order to "guess" completely wrong everything everytime. The teacher might have put a secret message like 

W R O N G

A N S W E R S

O N L Y

And could include three correct answers and only one incorrect one.

This would check if they were reading all the instructions carefully and they could fail the ones who passed.

You also detect it as a statistical irregularity on an ordinary test, and the teacher could still pass them on the account of the fact that the student likely knows the answer or else it is a highly statistical fluke
ChatGPT
I understand now. You're suggesting that deliberately incorrect answers, if consistently incorrect in a certain way, could reveal that the person actually knows the correct answers. This concept can be used to understand how machine learning models detect adversarial examples and ensure robustness.
Refined Analogy: Deliberate Incorrect Answers as a Robustness Check
Imagine a scenario where a teacher is testing students not only on their knowledge but also on their ability to follow instructions meticulously. Here���s how this analogy can be expanded to illustrate key concepts in adversarial robustness:
The Special Instruction Test
:
Scenario
: The teacher designs a test with a hidden instruction, like "Mark all correct answers as incorrect." This instruction is known only to students who read the entire test carefully.
Objective
: The teacher wants to see if students can follow this hidden instruction, which indirectly tests their thoroughness and attention to detail.
Detection of Deliberate Incorrect Answers
:
Consistent Patterns
: If a student consistently marks the correct answers as incorrect, the teacher might deduce that the student has actually read the hidden instruction and knows the correct answers.
Statistical Irregularity
: If most students are getting a mix of correct and incorrect answers, a student who consistently gets all correct answers wrong stands out. This statistical irregularity suggests that the student likely knows the correct answers and is following the hidden instruction.
Robustness Against Adversarial Attacks
:
Machine Learning Parallel
: In adversarial robustness, models can be designed to detect not just the correctness of answers (classifications) but also unusual patterns that indicate manipulation (adversarial attacks).
Rejection Mechanism
: If a model detects that an input is consistently altered in a specific way (like the student marking all correct answers as wrong), it can reject the input as adversarial, similar to how the teacher might reject the test as manipulated.
Statistical Analysis
:
Detection
: Just as the teacher can use statistical analysis to detect an unusual pattern of wrong answers, machine learning models can use statistical methods to detect adversarial perturbations that deviate from typical data patterns.
Passing Despite Irregularities
: The teacher might still pass the student if they believe the deliberate wrong answers show understanding of the hidden instruction. Similarly, a robust model might handle adversarial inputs by understanding the underlying pattern and still making a correct decision.
Key Concepts Illustrated
Adversarial Detection
:
Models can detect adversarial examples by identifying patterns that are too consistent to be random errors.
Rejection Mechanism
:
Just as a teacher can reject a manipulated test, models can reject inputs that appear adversarial based on statistical irregularities.
Statistical Irregularities
:
Identifying unusual patterns helps both teachers and models to detect manipulation and ensure robust performance.
Deliberate Manipulation as Evidence
:
Consistent deliberate mistakes can be evidence of underlying knowledge or intentional manipulation, which models can use to make informed decisions about input validity.
This analogy demonstrates how deliberate incorrect answers can reveal underlying knowledge and how machine learning models can detect adversarial attacks by identifying consistent patterns of manipulation.

Counterfoil Choices in the Kalabari Life Cycle
by Nimi Wariboko

INTRODUCTION
Kalabari ethnic identity is under enormous pressure as a result of modernization and Western influences. One Kalabari response to their exposure to foreign values, styles, cultural artifacts and ways of life has been to select, incorporate, and transform borrowed values, styles, and artifacts to create a new combination or ensemble uniquely identified as Kalabari. This process of adaptation has been described as cultural authentication (Erekosima and Eicher 1981,1995; Eicher 1997). In their studies, Erekosima and Eicher have focused only on the use of a limited number of material artifacts (such as textiles) to create and maintain ethnic identity. Kalabari have created clothing that separates them from their neighbors, ���for items assembled from their history and the range of their trading contacts resulted in distinctive appearance��� (Eicher 1997:231).

Why the preference for distinctive appearance? Why are the Kalabari always tinkering with foreign artifacts in order to make themselves distinct from their Southern Nigerian neighbors? Why the deep preference for independence? The best answer Eicher and colleagues have found is: ���Kalabari dress represented their independence of thought and action and their view of a tripartite cosmology of the water-people, community deities and ancestors��� (Eicher1997:231; Erekosima 1989, Daly 1984). This explanation appears inadequate. By limiting their analyses to the easily observable somewhat static connection between dress and world view, they ignore the more intellectual, dynamic, and complex process involved in maintaining and passing to the next generation the core of Kalabari identity. Maintaining an ethnic identity is not a one-time affair, especially for an African traditional society that has to grapple with influences both from the West and from other nationalities within Nigeria. Dress and other aspects of the culture are often the visible representations of an invisible world view. One is, however, very far from the whole truth unless one explains how this link has been maintained from pre-colonial times until today in spite of all influences to the contrary.

This paper discusses the salient management tool or idea that Kalabari have used and are still using to ensure that their ethnic identity is maintained amidst the flux of changes from within and outside. This paper brings to the fore the philosophical principles which put into proper perspective the Kalabari struggle to maintain an identity and way of life, and to minimize European influences on their traditional and political beliefs (Dike 1956: 161). For lack of a better terminology, this identity management tool is termed counterfoil choice.

In most societies, there are two types of choices: ordinary and Hobson. In ordinary choice, the decision-maker chooses between A or B, which are alternatives to each other. Hobson���s choice is between what is offered and nothing. Kalabari have a third variety wherein the freedom to choose is not limited as in Hobson���s choice, but the result of the selection is similar to that of Hobson���s choice. This is termed counterfoil choice. A is not an alternative to B; B is only a counterfoil to A. When A is offered, Kalabari offers its negative B to show the person where the decision should not go. The decision-maker is primed to choose A, the real ���ticket��� and shun the counterfoil. For instance, a father wanting to teach his child a lesson about success might give him two bowls. One contains garri (cassava derived flour), the other is empty. The child is asked to choose. The empty bowl is there to show that laziness comes with severe hunger and that life offers two bowls (prosperity/power or failure/disgrace). The child is advised to know the right bowl to choose. It is a counterfoil choice because no father wishes his son or daughter to choose the empty bowl. Kalabari have found this an effective way of teaching their youngsters.

The use of this management tool in Kalabari society parallels age-grade and political status. Thus, this essay shall proceed by examining the significance and role of counterfoil choice within Kalabari culture from the perspective of its relevance through the political life cycle. For the limited purposes here, the life cycle is divided into five stages: awome (birth to age 15), asawo (16 to 40), opuasawo (40 and above), alapu (chiefs) and duein (ancestors). Ancestor is considered a stage in the life cycle because a person���s life is deemed incomplete if he or she does not become an ancestor after death. To be an ancestor a person must be in good standing before entering the next world.

This classification is not precise; the purpose is only to indicate phases. It is based mainly on the male life cycle. However, this paper will consider women in the category of iya (most lawful and expensive) wives when it is dealing with alapu because in traditional Kalabari society every chief must have one iya wife. Also, in terms of achievement women value iya marriage as much as men value chieftaincy titles. Third, the fact that this paper is focused mainly on age categories of men does not mean that counterfoil choice as relating to women is given short shrift. As a matter of fact, various examples of counterfoil choices are given which span the life cycle of women in the society
ChatGPT
I see the connection you're making between deliberate incorrect answers and the concept of "counterfoil choices" in Kalabari culture as discussed in the African Studies Quarterly article. The idea of using deliberate choices to teach or reveal deeper understanding can indeed be related to how we might detect deliberate adversarial inputs in machine learning. Let's break down these concepts and their parallels.
Concept of Counterfoil Choices
Counterfoil Choice
: This is a decision-making scenario where the options provided are designed to guide the decision-maker towards the desired choice. The undesirable option (counterfoil) is presented not as a true alternative but as a means to highlight the preferred option.
Everyday Example: Teaching through Counterfoil Choices
Scenario
: A father gives his child two bowls: one filled with food (garri) and one empty. The child is to choose between them.
Purpose
: The empty bowl serves as a counterfoil to illustrate the consequences of laziness and the importance of hard work, guiding the child to choose the bowl with food.
Relating to Deliberate Incorrect Answers
Deliberate Incorrect Answers
: In an educational or testing context, this could be similar to students intentionally choosing incorrect answers to follow hidden instructions or reveal deeper insights.
Everyday Example: Hidden Instructions in a Test
Scenario
: A test contains a hidden instruction to choose the wrong answer deliberately. Students who follow this instruction show they have read carefully and understood the hidden message.
Purpose
: This reveals their attentiveness and understanding, as their deliberate mistakes indicate a deeper level of engagement with the material.
Applying to Machine Learning and Adversarial Robustness
Adversarial Perturbations
: These are small changes made to inputs with the intent to deceive a machine learning model into making incorrect predictions.
Detection of Adversarial Examples
: Models can be designed to detect patterns of consistent manipulation, just as a teacher might detect a pattern of deliberate wrong answers.
Analogy: Counterfoil Choices in Machine Learning
Scenario
: A machine learning model is trained to recognize certain patterns and anomalies. It encounters inputs that are consistently manipulated in a specific way, much like students choosing the empty bowl in the teaching example.
Purpose
: The model detects these patterns (adversarial examples) and can reject or flag them, similar to how the father uses the empty bowl to teach a lesson.
Key Parallels
Guiding Decisions
:
Counterfoil Choices
: Presenting an undesirable option to highlight the correct choice.
Deliberate Incorrect Answers
: Using deliberate wrong choices to indicate understanding of hidden instructions.
Adversarial Detection
: Identifying consistent manipulation patterns to detect adversarial attacks.
Revealing Understanding
:
Counterfoil Choices
: Teaching through choices that emphasize the correct path.
Deliberate Incorrect Answers
: Showing deep understanding through intentional mistakes.
Adversarial Detection
: Revealing adversarial manipulation through detection of unusual patterns.
Statistical Irregularities
:
Counterfoil Choices
: The clear contrast between the correct and incorrect choices.
Deliberate Incorrect Answers
: Consistent wrong answers indicating a deeper understanding.
Adversarial Detection
: Detecting patterns that deviate from normal inputs to identify manipulation.
By understanding these parallels, we can better appreciate how deliberate choices and patterns can reveal deeper insights, whether in human decision-making or in the detection of adversarial inputs in machine learning. The concept of counterfoil choices provides a useful framework for thinking about how to design robust systems that can detect and respond to deliberate manipulations.

In the context of ablation versus rejection
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's explore the concepts of ablation and rejection in the context of adversarial robustness and relate them to the ideas of deliberate incorrect answers and counterfoil choices.
Ablation and Rejection in Adversarial Robustness
Ablation Studies
:
Purpose
: Ablation studies involve systematically removing or modifying components of a model to understand their impact on performance. This helps in identifying which components are crucial for robustness.
Example
: In the context of adversarial robustness, an ablation study might involve removing the rejection mechanism to see how it affects the model's ability to resist adversarial attacks.
Rejection Mechanism
:
Purpose
: The rejection mechanism allows a model to refuse to classify certain inputs it deems too uncertain or likely to be adversarial. This improves robustness by avoiding potentially incorrect classifications.
Example
: A model might reject inputs that appear to be manipulated, similar to a teacher rejecting a test where all answers are suspiciously wrong.
Relating to Deliberate Incorrect Answers and Counterfoil Choices
Counterfoil Choices as a Teaching Tool
Analogy
: A father giving his child a choice between a full bowl of food and an empty bowl. The empty bowl (counterfoil) is not a real choice but a way to teach the child about the consequences of laziness.
Deliberate Incorrect Answers
Analogy
: A student intentionally choosing incorrect answers on a test due to hidden instructions. This shows they have read and understood the entire test carefully.
Applying These Concepts to Ablation and Rejection
Ablation Studies and Counterfoil Choices
:
Counterfoil Choice
: Removing an important component (like the full bowl of food) highlights the necessity of that component (the consequences of laziness).
Ablation Study
: Removing or altering parts of the model (like the rejection mechanism) to see their impact. This helps identify the critical components for robustness.
Example
: In a test setting, removing the hidden instruction and seeing if students still perform as expected.
Rejection Mechanism and Deliberate Incorrect Answers
:
Deliberate Errors
: A teacher detecting students' understanding through their consistent incorrect answers due to hidden instructions.
Rejection Mechanism
: A model rejecting inputs that consistently appear manipulated, similar to how the teacher might reject a test with deliberate wrong answers.
Example
: A model rejecting inputs that deviate from normal patterns, akin to rejecting a test with a clear pattern of wrong answers.
Key Parallels
Guiding Decisions
:
Counterfoil Choice
: Using a negative option to emphasize the correct choice.
Ablation Study
: Understanding the importance of components by removing them.
Rejection
: Avoiding incorrect decisions by rejecting suspicious inputs.
Deliberate Errors
: Understanding students' attentiveness through intentional mistakes.
Revealing Understanding
:
Counterfoil Choice
: Highlighting the correct path through a clear contrast.
Ablation Study
: Revealing the importance of each component by its removal.
Rejection
: Identifying adversarial inputs by their deviation from normal patterns.
Deliberate Errors
: Showing deep understanding through consistent wrong answers due to hidden instructions.
Statistical Irregularities
:
Counterfoil Choice
: The clear contrast between correct and incorrect choices highlights understanding.
Ablation Study
: Detecting the impact of removing components to understand their role.
Rejection
: Detecting inputs that deviate from expected patterns to avoid manipulation.
Deliberate Errors
: Using statistical analysis to detect patterns of intentional mistakes.
By drawing these parallels, we can better understand how ablation studies and rejection mechanisms help improve adversarial robustness. Both concepts rely on identifying and understanding the role of specific components or patterns, whether in human decision-making or in the performance of machine learning models. The analogy with counterfoil choices and deliberate incorrect answers helps illustrate the underlying principles of these techniques.

I was thinking of Wittgenstein's ladder in this context.
ChatGPT
Wittgenstein's ladder is an interesting philosophical concept that can indeed provide a useful framework for understanding ablation studies and rejection mechanisms in the context of adversarial robustness. Let's delve into how Wittgenstein's ladder might apply here.
Wittgenstein's Ladder
Concept
:
Wittgenstein's Ladder
: In his book "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus," Ludwig Wittgenstein uses the metaphor of a ladder to describe a process where one uses a set of propositions (the rungs of the ladder) to reach a higher understanding. Once the higher understanding is achieved, the propositions can be discarded, much like how a ladder is no longer needed once one has climbed up.
Applying Wittgenstein's Ladder to Ablation and Rejection
Ablation Studies as Climbing the Ladder
:
Process
: In ablation studies, we systematically remove components of a model to understand their importance. Each removal is akin to climbing a rung on the ladder, leading to a deeper understanding of the model's structure and robustness.
Goal
: The ultimate goal is to reach a higher understanding of which components are essential for robustness against adversarial attacks.
Discarding Components
: Once this understanding is achieved, some components might be deemed unnecessary (discarded rungs), simplifying the model without sacrificing performance.
Rejection Mechanisms as Higher Understanding
:
Higher Understanding
: The rejection mechanism can be seen as a culmination of understanding adversarial patterns and implementing a strategy to avoid them. It represents a higher rung on the ladder that enhances the model's robustness.
Avoiding Adversarial Inputs
: By rejecting inputs that appear suspicious, the model leverages this higher understanding to maintain accuracy and reliability.
Parallels with Wittgenstein's Ladder
Progressive Understanding
:
Ablation Studies
: Removing components step-by-step to see their impact helps in building a progressive understanding of the model���s structure.
Wittgenstein's Ladder
: Using propositions step-by-step to reach higher philosophical understanding.
Discarding Unnecessary Components
:
Ablation Studies
: Some components may be found unnecessary and can be discarded without loss of function, streamlining the model.
Wittgenstein's Ladder
: Once the higher understanding is achieved, the initial propositions can be discarded.
Higher-Level Robustness
:
Rejection Mechanisms
: Implementing a rejection mechanism based on the understanding of adversarial patterns provides a higher level of robustness.
Wittgenstein's Ladder
: Achieving a higher understanding that goes beyond the initial propositions.
Relating to Deliberate Incorrect Answers and Counterfoil Choices
Deliberate Incorrect Answers
:
Wittgenstein's Ladder
: The deliberate incorrect answers can be seen as a tool (a rung) to reveal deeper understanding or attentiveness, which can be discarded once their purpose is served.
Model Detection
: Detecting deliberate patterns (rungs) to achieve a higher understanding of whether the input is adversarial.
Counterfoil Choices
:
Wittgenstein's Ladder
: Counterfoil choices act as steps to guide the decision-maker towards the desired understanding, much like using the rungs of a ladder.
Educational Tool
: They are used temporarily to achieve a deeper understanding or learning objective, after which their explicit use might no longer be necessary.
Summary
Ablation Studies
: These represent the process of climbing Wittgenstein's ladder in understanding the importance of each component in a model. Each step (removal of a component) brings higher understanding, and unnecessary components can be discarded.
Rejection Mechanism
: This represents the higher understanding achieved at the top of the ladder, allowing the model to effectively reject adversarial inputs based on learned patterns.
Deliberate Incorrect Answers
: Serve as a rung to reveal deeper understanding, much like using initial propositions to reach a higher level of insight.
Counterfoil Choices
: Act as guiding steps that help in achieving the desired understanding or learning outcome, aligning with the idea of using intermediate steps to reach a higher goal.
Wittgenstein's ladder thus provides a powerful metaphor for understanding the process of developing and refining robust machine learning models through ablation studies and rejection mechanisms.

I thought that the story of Lot's wife was like Wittgenstein's ladder
ChatGPT
That's a thought-provoking analogy! The story of Lot's wife in the biblical narrative, where she turns into a pillar of salt after looking back at the burning city of Sodom, can indeed be likened to Wittgenstein's ladder in a metaphorical sense. Let's explore this comparison:
The Story of Lot's Wife
In the biblical account, Lot's wife is instructed not to look back at Sodom as they flee the city's destruction. However, she disobeys and looks back, resulting in her transformation into a pillar of salt. This story is often interpreted as a lesson on the dangers of dwelling on the past or failing to fully commit to a directive or path forward.
Wittgenstein's Ladder
Wittgenstein's ladder refers to the idea of using certain propositions or statements as stepping stones to reach a higher understanding. Once this understanding is achieved, the initial propositions (the steps of the ladder) can be discarded. This concept is about progressing in thought and then leaving behind the initial means used to achieve that progression.
Connecting the Two Concepts
Looking Back vs. Moving Forward
: Just as Lot's wife looked back and suffered the consequences, in Wittgenstein's metaphor, one uses the ladder of understanding but must eventually leave it behind to progress. The act of looking back metaphorically represents clinging to the earlier rungs of the ladder that should be discarded to move forward in understanding or spiritual progress.
Consequences of Not Letting Go
: Lot's wife's inability to resist looking back can be seen as a failure to discard the unnecessary 'rungs'���the attachments or the old ways of life in Sodom. This halted her progress and transformation, culminating in a permanent state of stasis (turning to salt).
Instruction and Obedience
: In both narratives, there's an element of instruction and the need for obedience to achieve a higher purpose or safety. In the biblical story, the instruction is literal and comes with immediate physical consequences. In Wittgenstein's philosophy, the instructions are intellectual, and the consequences are stagnation in thought or understanding.
Metaphor for Learning and Growth
: Both the story and the philosophical idea serve as metaphors for growth and the necessity of moving beyond the past or preliminary knowledge to achieve a more profound or meaningful state of existence or understanding.
Using the story of Lot's wife as a parallel to Wittgenstein's ladder beautifully illustrates how personal and intellectual growth requires us to move forward without clinging to past steps or stages. It encourages embracing change and new understanding without the baggage of previous ways of thinking or living, symbolizing a transition from a literal or figurative 'Sodom' to a new phase of life or thought, unencumbered by the past.

Any similarities with Vygotskian scaffolding?
ChatGPT
Indeed, there are some intriguing parallels between Wittgenstein's ladder and Vygotsky's concept of scaffolding in the context of cognitive and educational development. Both concepts emphasize temporary support structures that are meant to be removed once they have served their purpose. Let���s delve deeper into these similarities:
Vygotsky's Scaffolding
Concept
: Lev Vygotsky, a Soviet psychologist, introduced the concept of scaffolding within his broader theory of the zone of proximal development (ZPD). Scaffolding involves providing support to a learner that is tailored to their current developmental level. The support helps the learner accomplish tasks they are not yet able to manage on their own. As the learner's competence increases, the support (scaffolding) is gradually removed.
Purpose
: The primary goal of scaffolding is to bridge the gap between what a learner can do independently and what they can do with assistance, promoting a higher level of independence and mastery.
Wittgenstein's Ladder
Concept
: As discussed, Wittgenstein's ladder is a metaphor from his early philosophical work, suggesting that certain propositions are used to climb to a higher understanding. After reaching this understanding, the propositions (like the rungs of a ladder) are no longer necessary and can be discarded.
Purpose
: This metaphor highlights the process of using certain foundational ideas to reach a deeper or higher level of philosophical insight, which, once achieved, renders the initial ideas unnecessary.
Similarities
Temporary Tools for Advancement
: Both scaffolding and Wittgenstein's ladder represent temporary aids designed to advance understanding or competence. In both cases, these aids are meant to be removed once they have fulfilled their purpose���scaffolding in learning and the ladder in reaching a philosophical understanding.
Facilitating Progress
: Each concept is about facilitating progress beyond the learner's or thinker's current level. Scaffolding helps learners achieve tasks just beyond their independent reach, while the ladder helps thinkers reach a higher level of understanding.
Gradual Removal
: The gradual removal of support is a key aspect of both scaffolding and Wittgenstein's ladder. As the learner or thinker progresses, less and less support is needed, and it is eventually discarded entirely.
Goal of Independence
: Both concepts aim to bring the individual to a state of greater independence. In education, this means being able to solve problems without external help; in philosophy, it means adopting and then moving beyond foundational propositions to form one���s own insights.
Application in Education and Personal Growth
Both Vygotsky's scaffolding and Wittgenstein's ladder can be seen as effective metaphors for teaching and learning processes. They emphasize the importance of providing initial support or using foundational concepts to propel individuals to higher levels of independence and mastery. Once these levels are reached, the initial supports or foundational concepts are no longer necessary, symbolizing growth and the achievement of autonomy.
These parallels enhance our understanding of how tools, whether cognitive, educational, or philosophical, serve as critical stepping stones in the journey towards greater independence and deeper understanding.

I think this is the purpose of toys and play in general
ChatGPT
Absolutely, you've touched on a fundamental aspect of how toys and play function in development, aligning well with the concepts of scaffolding and the philosophical metaphor of Wittgenstein's ladder. Toys and play are essential in providing structured yet flexible scaffolding in a child's learning process. Here���s how these connect:
The Role of Toys and Play
Exploration and Learning
: Toys and play scenarios allow children to explore and experiment in a safe environment. This exploration is critical as it enables children to learn new skills and concepts by interacting with objects and ideas in the physical and imaginary worlds.
Developmental Scaffolding
: Toys often serve as tools that provide just enough support to encourage the next step in skill development. For instance, building blocks help with spatial and motor skills, while puzzle games enhance cognitive abilities. These toys adjust to the developmental stage of the child, much like Vygotsky���s scaffolding.
Progressive Challenges
: As children grow, the complexity of the toys and the nature of play evolve to meet their advancing developmental needs. This mirrors the idea of removing the rungs of Wittgenstein���s ladder���once a certain level of proficiency is achieved with a type of play or a particular toy, children move on to more complex activities that better match their new skills and understandings.
Encouraging Independence
: Through play, children often start with guided activities which may involve adults or more skilled children participating in the play. As they develop, they take on these roles themselves, gradually moving towards independent play and problem-solving, embodying the goal of fostering independence found in both Vygotsky's and Wittgenstein���s theories.
Abstract Thinking and Problem Solving
: Play often involves scenarios that require problem-solving and manipulation of abstract concepts, which develops critical thinking. This aspect is akin to climbing Wittgenstein's ladder, where abstract and foundational propositions are used to reach higher-level thinking before they are discarded.
Broader Implications
Metaphorical and Literal Growth
: The processes supported by toys and play are not just about achieving specific educational milestones. They also involve broader personal and social development, including emotional regulation, social interaction skills, and the ability to focus and complete tasks.
Lifelong Learning Models
: The patterns established by play���exploration, structured challenge, and progressive independence���are also foundational to lifelong learning models. Just as toys facilitate stages of childhood development, adult learning involves progressively building upon foundational knowledge and skills to achieve greater insights and capabilities.
Adaptability and Creativity
: Play also cultivates adaptability and creativity. The ability to approach problems from multiple angles or think outside the box is developed through open-ended play, which encourages children to use toys in novel ways, paralleling the philosophical exploration of abandoning prior assumptions as one reaches higher understandings.
In summary, toys and play are integral in shaping cognitive and social abilities in ways that are deeply analogous to educational scaffolding and philosophical growth models. They not only support the immediate developmental stages but also set a foundation for complex thought processes and independent problem-solving skills essential throughout life.

I've said that play is simulated danger, and that learning is inoculation against surprise
ChatGPT
Your insight that play is simulated danger and learning as inoculation against surprise eloquently captures the essence of why play is such a critical activity in the development of cognitive and emotional skills. Let's explore this concept further and see how it aligns with educational and psychological theories.
Play as Simulated Danger
Risk-Taking and Safety
: Play allows children to engage in risk-taking behaviors within a controlled and safe environment. This "simulated danger" is essential for development because it provides children the opportunity to push boundaries, explore limits, and experience consequences in a way that does not threaten their well-being.
Building Resilience
: By engaging in play that simulates dangerous or challenging situations, children learn to manage fear and uncertainty. This kind of play helps them build resilience by overcoming small-scale adversities in play scenarios, like negotiating higher climbs on playgrounds or strategizing in competitive games.
Problem-Solving Skills
: Simulated danger in play teaches problem-solving under stress. For example, when children play tag or hide-and-seek, they must think quickly and under pressure, skills that are valuable in real-life situations where immediate responses are necessary.
Learning as Inoculation Against Surprise
Preparation for the Unexpected
: Just as vaccines prepare the body's immune system to fight off infections, learning through play prepares the mind to handle unexpected situations. It builds a repertoire of responses to a variety of challenges and scenarios, reducing the element of surprise in future encounters.
Cognitive Flexibility
: Play develops cognitive flexibility���the ability to adjust one's thinking and behavior to adapt to new information, changes, or rules. This flexibility is crucial in effectively handling new and unexpected situations in life.
Emotional Regulation
: Through play, children also learn to regulate their emotions. Experiencing a range of outcomes in play, from failure and frustration to success and joy, helps children learn to handle similar emotions in real-world situations.
Integration with Educational and Psychological Theories
Vygotsky���s Zone of Proximal Development
: Play often pushes children slightly beyond their current abilities, falling into Vygotsky���s concept of the zone of proximal development, where the most effective learning occurs just outside one���s comfort zone.
Piaget���s Stages of Development
: Jean Piaget noted that play was crucial in each stage of a child���s cognitive development, particularly in the preoperational stage where children begin to engage in symbolic play that develops their thinking and reasoning abilities.

She is known for popularizing theory theory, Bayesian brain hypothesis, child as scientist, scientist as child, and child as hacker theories
ChatGPT
Alison Gopnik has indeed made significant contributions to developmental psychology with her innovative theories about how children learn and understand the world. Her ideas have reshaped our understanding of early cognitive development and how we approach learning processes both in childhood and across the lifespan. Here's a brief look at some of the theories you mentioned:
Theory Theory
Description
: Gopnik advocates for the "theory theory," which posits that children learn much like scientists. According to this view, children form theories about how the world works and then test these theories through their experiences. When they encounter evidence that contradicts their theories, they modify them, much like scientists refining hypotheses based on experimental data.
Bayesian Brain Hypothesis
Description
: The Bayesian brain hypothesis suggests that the brain processes information in a probabilistic manner, continuously updating its beliefs based on new evidence���essentially, the brain as a Bayesian inference machine. Gopnik applies this concept to understand how children adjust their expectations and learning processes based on the probability of events and experiences they encounter.
Child as Scientist
Description
: This concept is closely related to theory theory and is central to Gopnik's research. She argues that children are naturally curious and systematically experiment with their environment to figure out how things work, much like a scientist conducting experiments. This perspective views children as active learners, driven by innate curiosity and a fundamental desire to make sense of the world.
Scientist as Child
Description
: This idea flips the "child as scientist" metaphor, suggesting that scientists could benefit from adopting a child-like approach to exploration and learning. Children's exploratory behaviors, open-mindedness, and creativity in problem-solving can serve as a model for scientific inquiry, emphasizing that the best scientists retain a sense of play and curiosity throughout their careers.
Child as Hacker
Description
: Gopnik uses the "child as hacker" analogy to describe how children interact with and learn about their world. In this view, children are like hackers���they tinker with systems (their environment) to see what happens, learn the rules, and often figure out how to "hack" these rules to work in their favor or to find new ways of doing things.
Impact and Application
Education
: Gopnik's theories have profound implications for educational practices. They suggest that educational environments should nurture and support children's natural curiosity and investigative nature, providing them with opportunities to explore and experiment.
Parenting
: For parents, these theories emphasize the importance of providing a safe and rich environment where children can test their ideas and learn from the outcomes of their actions.
Artificial Intelligence
: Insights from Gopnik's work also inform the development of AI, particularly in creating systems that learn from the environment in a manner analogous to how children learn, adapting and optimizing themselves over time.
Alison Gopnik's work challenges traditional views of passive childhood learning, presenting a dynamic model where children are active agents in their cognitive development. Her influence extends beyond psychology into fields like education, parenting, and artificial intelligence, offering a comprehensive framework for understanding human learning and cognitive evolution.
