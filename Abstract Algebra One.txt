This preface is written primarily for mathematics lecturers, but students might 
i nd it interesting too. It describes differences between this book and other 
Abstract Algebra texts and explains the reasons for those differences. 
T 
his book is not like other Abstract Algebra1books. It is not a 
textbook containing standard content. Rather, it is designed as 
pre-readingorconcurrentreadingforanAbstractAlgebracourse. 
I do mean that it is designed for reading, which is important because 
students are of t en unaccustomed to learning mathematics from books, 
and because research shows that many do not read ef f ectively. h is book 
is therefore less dense and more accessible than typical undergraduate 
texts. It contains serious discussions of central Abstract Algebra con- 
cepts, but these begin where the student is likely to be. h ey make 
linkstoearliermathematics,refutecommonmisconceptions,andexplain 
how def i nitions and theorems capture intuitive ideas in mathematically 
sophisticated ways. h e narrative thus unfolds in what I hope is a natural 
and engaging style, while developing the rigour appropriate for under- 
graduate study. 
Because of this aim, the book is structured dif f erently from other texts. 
Part 1 contains four chapters that discuss not the content of Abstract 
Algebra but its structure, explaining what it means to have a coherent 
mathematical theory and what it takes to understand one. h ere is no 
âpreliminariesâ chapter; instead, notations and def i nitions are introduced 
where they are i rst needed, meaning that they are spread across the text 
(though a symbol list is provided on pages xiiiâxiv). h is means that a 1 âAbstract Algebraâ should probably not have upper-case âAâs, but I want to make the 
subject name distinct from other uses of related terms.

student reading for review might need to use the index more than usual, 
so the index is extensive. 
A second dif f erence is that not all content is covered at the same depth. 
h e i ve main chapters in Part 2 each contain extensive treatment of their 
central def i nition(s), especially where students are known to struggle. 
h ey also discuss selected theorems and proofs, some of which are used 
tohighlightstrategiesandskillsthatmightbeusefulelsewhere,andsome 
of which are used to draw out structural similarities and explain theory 
development. But these chapters aim to prepare a student to learn from a 
standard Abstract Algebra course, rather than to cover its entire content. 
A third dif f erence is that the order of the content is relatively uncon- 
strained by logical theory development. h eory is explicitly discussed: 
Part 1 provides information on the roles of axioms, def i nitions, theorems 
and proofs, and Part 2 encourages attention to logical argument. But 
numerous sections provide examples before inviting generalization, or 
introduce technical terms informally before they are def i ned, or observe 
phenomena to be formalized later. I take this approach with care, high- 
lighting informality and noting where formal versions can be found. But 
I consider it useful because the central ideas of early Abstract Algebra are 
so tightly interwovenâreally I would like to introduce all of the bookâs 
main ideas simultaneously. Obviously that is impossible, but I do want 
to keep some pace in the narrative, to prioritize concepts and important 
relationships over technicalities. I realize, of course, that this approach 
goesagainstthegrainofmathematicalpresentationandmeansthatthisis 
notabookthatatypicalcoursecouldâfollowâ.ButIamcontentwiththatâ 
theworldisfullofstandardtextbooksdevelopingtheoryfromthebottom 
up, and my aim is to provide an alternative with a focus on conceptual 
understanding.ChatGPTSummary:The preface addresses mathematics lecturers and students, highlighting the unique features of this Abstract Algebra book. Unlike standard textbooks, this book is intended as pre-reading or concurrent reading for an Abstract Algebra course. It is crafted to be less dense and more readable, emphasizing the importance of students learning mathematics from books. The narrative provides a detailed discussion of core Abstract Algebra concepts, connecting to earlier mathematics and addressing common misconceptions.Key differences include:Structure: The book first explains the structure of Abstract Algebra rather than its content. Notations and definitions are introduced as needed throughout the text, but an index and symbol list are provided for easy reference.Depth: Content is not uniformly deep. Major chapters in Part 2 provide in-depth treatment of central definitions and discuss specific theorems and proofs.Order of Content: The arrangement of topics isn't strictly based on logical theory progression. The author occasionally uses examples before generalizations and introduces terms informally, focusing on core concepts.The author's goal is to provide an alternative to traditional textbooks, emphasizing conceptual understanding over strict theory development.Finally, this book explicitly discusses how students might make sense 
of Abstract Algebra as it is presented in lectures and in other books. 
I realize that this, too, is contentious: many mathematics lecturers place 
high value on constructing ideas and arguments, and some have worked 
hard to develop inquiry-based Abstract Algebra courses. I am all for 
inquiry-basedcourses,andforanywell-thought-outapproachthatallows 
students to reinvent mathematical ideas through independent or collab- 
orative problem solving. But the reality is that most mathematics lectures 
are still just that: lectures. Many lecturers are constrained by class sizes 
viPREFACE 
well into the hundreds, and l ipped classroom models might promote 
student engagement but it is not obvious how to use them ef f ectively to 
develop the theory of Abstract Algebra. Because of this, and because few 
students follow every detail of their lectures, an important student task 
is to make sense of written mathematics. Research shows that the typical 
student is capable of this but ill-informed regarding how to go about it. 
h is book tackles that problemâit aims to deliver students who do not 
yet know much Abstract Algebra but who are ready to learn. 
A book like this would be impossible without work by numerous 
researchers in mathematics education and psychology. In particular, the 
self-explanation training in Chapter 3 was developed in collaboration 
withMarkHoddsandMatthewInglis(seeHodds,Alcock&Inglis,2014) 
on the basis of earlier research on academic reading by authors including 
Ainsworth and Burcham (2007), Bielaczyc, Pirolli, and Brown (1995), 
and Chi, de Leeuw, Chiu and LaVancher (1994). More information on 
the studies we conducted can be found in Alcock, Hodds, Roy and Inglis 
(2015), an article in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society. 
h e bibliography contains extensive references to decadesâ worth of 
research on student learning about specif i c concepts in Abstract Algebra 
and about general proof-based mathematics. I encourage interested 
readers to investigate further. 
My specif i c thanks go to Ant Edwards, Tim Fukawa-Connelly, Kevin 
Houston, Artie Prendergast-Smith, Adrian Simpson, Keith Weber, and 
Iro Xenidou-Dervou, all of whom gave valuable feedback on chapter 
draf t s. Similarly, to careful readers Romain Lambert, Neil Pratt, and 
Simon Goss, who were kind enough to point out errors. I am particularly 
indebted to Colin Foster, who read a draf t of the entire book before its 
chapters went to anyone else. I am also grateful as ever to the team 
at Oxford University Press, including Dan Taber, Katherine Ward, 
Chandrakala Chandrasekaran and Richard Hutchinson. Finally, this 
book is dedicated to Kristian Alcock, who has never known me not to be 
writing it. I think he will be glad and amazed to see it in print.ChatGPTSummary:This Abstract Algebra book emphasizes helping students understand the subject as presented in lectures and other books. While the author supports inquiry-based courses, the reality is that many mathematics lectures are primarily traditional in approach. Hence, a significant task for students is understanding written mathematics. Research indicates students can comprehend written mathematics, but often lack the knowledge of how to effectively do so. This book addresses this gap, preparing students to learn Abstract Algebra.Acknowledgments:The book draws from research in mathematics education and psychology.Chapter 3's self-explanation training is a collaborative effort, with significant contributions cited from various researchers.There's a rich bibliography for those interested in diving deeper into research about specific Abstract Algebra concepts and proof-based mathematics.The author extends gratitude to multiple individuals for their feedback, error-checking, and support, including the Oxford University Press team.The book is dedicated to Kristian Alcock, who has witnessed its long creation process.SymbolMeaningSection

This short introduction discusses the place of Abstract Algebra in typical 
undergraduate degree programmes and the challenges it presents. It then 
explains this bookâs content and intent. 
M 
athematics students typically encounter Abstract Algebra as 
one of their i rst theorems-and-proofs courses. For those in 
UK-like systems, where people specialize early, it might be 
taughtatthebeginningofamathematicsdegree,orperhapsinthesecond 
termorsecondyear.ForthoseinUS-likesystems,wherepeoplespecialize 
late, it will more likely be an upper-level course for mathematics majors 
in their junior or senior year. Either way, a course might not actually be 
called Abstract Algebra. h at name is an umbrella term for the theory of 
groups,rings,f i eldsandrelatedstructures,soaf i rstcoursemightbetitled 
Group h eory or Groups, Rings and Fields or something more basic like 
Sets and Groups. 
Whatevertheprecisearrangements,AbstractAlgebraisusuallystudied 
inparallelwithothersubjectssuchasAnalysis.BothAbstractAlgebraand 
Analysis involve a shif t in mathematical emphasis: students who think of 
mathematicsasasetofalgorithmsmustnowlearntofocusondef i nitions, 
theorems and proofs. Part 1 of this book provides advice on that. But 
the two subjects can feel quite dif f erent, and awareness of the dif f erences 
might help with understanding their respective challenges. 
In Analysis, the main challenge is the reasoning: the subject makes 
heavy use of logically complex statements, which few students are well 
equipped to process. But its objects are relatively graspable: numbers, 
sequences, series and functions are already familiar or readily repre- 
sented in diagrams. In Abstract Algebra, the main challenge is almost 
the opposite. h e logic is more straightforward, but many of the objects 
are less familiar and less easy to represent. For students, this can render 
INTRODUCTIONxv 
the subject somewhat meaninglessâeven those who do well might not 
develop a strong sense of what it is âaboutâ. h at was my experience. 
Despitehavingaverygoodlecturer,1IneverreallylikedAbstractAlgebra 
becauseIneverreallygot it.Icouldperformthemanipulations,applythe 
theorems, and reconstruct the proofs, but I didnât really understand what 
it all meant. 
I now believe that this happened for two reasons. h e i rst is general 
butparticularlyrelevantinAbstractAlgebra:mathematicsishierarchical, 
with each level building on the last. Shif t ing up a level of t en requires 
compressing some aspect of your understanding in order to to think 
of it in relation to four or i ve new things. If you havenât compressed 
it enough, this is dif i cult, and higher levels can seem like meaningless 
symbol-pushing. Abstract Algebrainvolvesa lotof compression,and this 
book will point out explicitly where it is needed.ChatGPTSummary of Introduction:The introduction highlights the positioning and challenges of Abstract Algebra within typical undergraduate degree programs. Key points include:Placement in Curricula:Mathematics students often meet Abstract Algebra early in their journey into theorem-and-proof courses.In systems like the UK's, it may be introduced at the start or during the second term/year of a math degree.In systems like the US's, it's usually an upper-level course for math majors in their junior or senior year.Terminology:The term "Abstract Algebra" encompasses theories of groups, rings, fields, and related structures.Courses might have titles such as Group Theory, Groups, Rings and Fields, or basic titles like Sets and Groups.Parallel Study:Often studied alongside subjects like Analysis.Both subjects signify a shift in mathematical focus: from algorithms to definitions, theorems, and proofs.Challenges in Comparison with Analysis:Analysis challenges lie mainly in its complex logical reasoning, while its objects (like numbers, sequences) are more familiar.Abstract Algebra's challenges stem from its less familiar and harder-to-represent objects, even if its logic is simpler.This unfamiliarity can make the subject feel meaningless for students. Even those who excel might lack a deep understanding or sense of the subject's essence.Author's Personal Experience:The author didn't have a fondness for Abstract Algebra initially, despite a good lecturer. They could apply theorems and proofs but lacked a real understanding of the subject's meaning.Hierarchical Nature of Mathematics:Math builds on preceding levels. Ascending to a new level often requires compressing prior knowledge to integrate new concepts.If not done adequately, higher-level subjects can feel like mere symbol manipulation.Abstract Algebra demands significant compression, and this book aims to guide readers in understanding where and how it's required.h e second reason is that I didnât access good representations for 
Abstract Algebraâs key ideas. I like visual representationsâimages that 
enable me to âseeâ how concepts are related and to develop intuition for 
why things work as they do. I donât of t en get that feeling from algebraic 
arguments, no matter how sure I am that each step is valid. And Abstract 
Algebra didnât seem to have many visual representations, so I didnât i nd 
much to hold on to. I donât blame my lecturer for thisâI failed rather 
badly to keep up, so I didnât follow his lectures ef f ectively and I probably 
missed some enlightening explanations. But intuition for the subject can 
be developed using diagrams and tables, so this book contains many 
of those. 
h is book also contains explicit discussion of what Abstract Algebra 
is, beginning in Chapter 1 with sections on what is abstract about 
Abstract Algebra, and what is algebraic about it. h e remainder of 
Part 1 discusses axioms and def i nitions and their roles in mathematical 
theory (Chapter 2), theorems and proofs and productive ways to interact 
with these (Chapter 3), and research-based strategies for ef f ective 
learning (Chapter 4). Please read Chapter 4 even if you are a successful

or âprofessorâ.

studentâyou might i nd that you can tweak your strategies to improve 
your learning or reduce your workload or both.2 
Part2coverstopicsinAbstractAlgebra,startingwithbinaryoperations 
(Chapter 5) and moving on to groups and subgroups (Chapter 6), 
quotient groups (Chapter 7), isomorphisms and homomorphisms 
(Chapter 8) and rings (Chapter 9). Because this is not a standard 
textbook, it does not try to âcoverâ all of the relevant content for these 
topics. Instead, it treats the main ideas in depth, using examples and 
visual representations to explain ways to think about them accurately. 
Each chapter also includes selected theorems and proofs and discusses 
relationships between topics. 
Because Abstract Algebra is a tightly interconnected theory, early 
chapters of t en touch on ideas not formalized until later. For this reason, 
I recommend reading the whole book in order, although each chapter 
should also be readable as a self-contained unit. If you get stuck, remem- 
ber that there is an extensive index, and that pages xiiiâxiv list where 
symbols are explained in the text. If it is practical, I also recommend 
reading the entire book before starting an Abstract Algebra course. I 
intendtosetyouupwithmeaningfulunderstandingofthemainideasand 
a good grasp of how to learn ef f ectively, so you will likely get maximum 
benef i t by reading before you start. However, if you have come to this 
book because your course has begun and you i nd yourself lost in the 
abstractions, it should provide opportunities to rework your understand- 
ing so that you can engage ef f ectively. Either way, I hope that Abstract 
Algebra deepens your understanding of both familiar mathematics and 
higher-level theory.ChatGPTSummary of the Continued Introduction:Role of Visual Representations:The author appreciates visual representations for comprehending key ideas in Abstract Algebra, which help develop intuition.Abstract Algebra seemed lacking in visual aids initially to the author, making it hard for them to relate to the subject.This book remedies this by offering various diagrams and tables to help foster intuition.Content and Aim of the Book:The book delves into what Abstract Algebra is, discussing its abstract and algebraic nature.It offers insights on axioms, definitions, theorems, proofs, and strategies for effective learning.Readers, even those well-versed in the subject, are encouraged to go through Chapter 4 for potentially improved learning strategies.Book Structure:Part 2 delves deep into topics of Abstract Algebra, such as binary operations, groups, quotient groups, isomorphisms, and rings.This is not a traditional textbook aiming for breadth; instead, it provides depth, using examples and visual aids to drive understanding.Interconnected Nature of Abstract Algebra:The subject's interconnectedness means that early chapters might touch upon ideas explained in detail in later chapters.The author advises reading the book sequentially. However, each chapter can also stand alone for focused study.An extensive index is provided, along with a list indicating where symbols are defined and explained.Reading Recommendations:Ideally, one should read the entire book before starting an Abstract Algebra course to establish a solid foundational understanding.If readers stumble upon the book while already enrolled in a course, it's designed to help reframe their understanding and enable effective engagement.Book's Hope:The author wishes for the book to enrich readers' comprehension of both basic math and advanced theories, making Abstract Algebra more approachable and meaningful.chapter 1 
What is Abstract Algebra? 
This chapter contrasts Abstract Algebra with the algebra studied in earlier 
mathematics. It highlights the subjectâs focus on validity of algebraic manipula- 
tions across a range of structures. It then describes three approaches common 
in Abstract Algebra courses: a formal approach, an equation-solving approach 
and a geometric approach. 
1.1 What is abstract about Abstract Algebra? 
A 
bstract Algebra is abstract in the same sense in which other 
human thinking is abstract: its concepts can be instantiated in 
multiple ways. For instance, you recognize things like trees and 
windows.Youcandothatbecauseyouunderstandtheabstractideasâtreeâ 
andâwindowâ,andyoucanmatchthemtoobjectsintheworld.Youdonot 
need to look at one tree to identify another; you do it by reference to the 
abstract idea. 
Now, trees and windows are physical objectsâyou can walk up and 
touchthem,andidentifythembysight.Butyoucanthinkaboutconcepts 
that are more abstract, too. For instance, you can identify an aunt. You 
do that by reference to a criterion: is this a female person with a sibling 
who has children? If yes, itâs an aunt. If no, itâs not. Moreover, you can 
think about abstract concepts that are not single objects, like family. 
A family includes multiple peopleâperhaps manyâwho are related to 
one anotherâgenetically or by marriage or by other caring relationships. 
Families vary a lot, and you couldnât necessarily recognize a family by 
WHAT IS ABSTRACT ABOUT ABSTRACT ALGEBRA?3 
sight or by checking simple criteria. But you nevertheless understand 
the idea. 
Abstract Algebra is about concepts that are somewhat like each of 
these more abstract ideas. h ey are like aunts in that they are def i ned by 
criteria. Abstract Algebra is stricter, though. Everyday human concepts, 
even def i ned ones like âauntâ, tend to be used l exibly. Is your mumâs 
brotherâsfemalepartneryouraunt?Maybe,maybenot.AndwhereIgrew 
up, adult female neighbours and friends were commonly referred to as 
âAuntieâ, even where there were no family relationships. Such l exibility 
doesnât happen in Abstract Algebra, because mathematical concepts are 
specif i ed by precise def i nitions about which all mathematicians agree.1

h e concepts of Abstract Algebra are like families in that not all are 
justsinglethings:somearesetswithparticularinternalrelationships.T h is 
meansthattheycanbebigandcomplex,thoughthatdoesnotnecessarily 
make them hard to think about. A single tree, af t er all, might have tens 
of branches and thousands of leavesâit has lots of internal structure, 
but you can treat it as a single thing. Mathematical objects can be like 
this too. For instance, the set of all even numbers is inf i nite and has lots 
of internal structure, but again you can treat it as a single thing. Such 
thinking is important in Abstract Algebra: of t en it is useful to switch 
between examining an objectâs internal structure and thinking of it as a 
unif i ed whole.ChatGPTSummary of Chapter 1: What is Abstract Algebra?Purpose of the Chapter:To differentiate Abstract Algebra from earlier studied algebra.Emphasize the validity of algebraic manipulations across various structures.Describe three approaches commonly used in Abstract Algebra courses: formal, equation-solving, and geometric.Abstraction in Thought:Just as humans recognize physical objects like trees and windows based on abstract concepts, Abstract Algebra operates on abstracted principles.Just as people understand the idea of a "family" without a specific look, Abstract Algebra works with abstract concepts.Criteria-based Definitions:Like identifying an "aunt" based on certain relational criteria, Abstract Algebra defines concepts based on specific criteria.However, unlike everyday human concepts that can be used flexibly, Abstract Algebra requires strict definitions. Mathematical concepts are precisely defined, and there is universal agreement among mathematicians regarding these definitions.Complexity and Wholeness:Some concepts in Abstract Algebra, similar to the idea of "families", are not just single entities but sets with particular relationships.While these sets can be vast and intricate, they can often be treated as singular entities.A prime example is the set of all even numbers, which, despite its infinite nature and internal structure, can be thought of as a unified entity.This duality of examining internal structures and viewing them as unified wholes is a crucial aspect of Abstract Algebra.Overall, this chapter provides an initial understanding of the nature of abstraction in Abstract Algebra and how it parallels abstract thinking in other realms. It sets the stage for deeper explorations of the subject's intricacies.1.2 What is algebraic about Abstract Algebra? 
To understand what is algebraic about Abstract Algebra, it is probably 
useful to consider what is algebraic about earlier algebra. Many students 
think of algebra as something you do, where doing algebra means manip- 
ulatinganexpressionorequationinvalidwaystoarriveatanother.T h isis 
of t eninserviceofagoal:solvingamechanicsproblem,say.Andthinking 
of algebra in this way is not wrongâcertainly it captures most studentsâ 
1 More accurately, mathematicians agree about the principle that concepts should 
be def i ned in this way, and most undergraduate mathematics works like this. But, 
historically, there were debates about how best to def i ne everything, and such debates 
continue in developing subjects. 
4WHAT IS ABSTRACT ALGEBRA? 
experience prior to undergraduate mathematics. But it is not enough to 
grasp the aims of Abstract Algebra. 
Abstract Algebra focuses not on performing algebraic manipulations 
but on understanding the mathematical structures that make those 
manipulationsvalid.ToseewhatImean,considerthisalgebraicargument 
(the arrow âââ means âimpliesâ). x(x+y) = yx 
â x2+xyâyx = 0 
âx2= 0 
âx = 0. 
Probably you can write such arguments quickly, l uently and with only 
occasional errors. But why exactly is each step valid? One step (which?) 
assumes that xy = yx. h is is valid because multiplication is commuta- 
tive, meaning that xy and yx always take the same value. Another step 
(which?) assumes that if x2= 0 then x = 0. h is is valid because 0 is the 
only number that, when squared, gives 0. But such assumptions rely on 
properties of operations and objects. Multiplication is commutative, but 
not all operations share this property. Division is not commutative, for 
instance: x/y could not be replaced by y/x. And not all objects behave 
like numbers. If x and y were 2Ã2 matrices,2we could not assume that 
xy = yx because matrix multiplication works like this: 
(x 
11 x12 
x21x22 )(y 
11 y12 
y21y22 ) = (x 
11y11+x12y21 x11y12+x12y22 
x21y11+x22y21x21y12+x22y22 ) 
. 
So, for example, 
(1 
2 
34 )(5 
6 
78 ) = ( 
5+146+16 
15+2818+32 ) = (19 
22 
4350 ) 
2 h is book includes examples based on matrices and complex numbers. If you 
are studying in a UK-like system and have not come across these, you can i nd 
introductions in A-level Further Mathematics textbooks or reliable online resources.

but (5 
6 
78 )(1 
2 
34 ) = (5+18 
10+24 
7+2414+32 ) = (23 
34 
3146 ) 
. 
Similarly, we could not assume that if x2= 0 then x = 0. h e matrix 
(0 
1 
00 ) 
is not the zero matrix, but nevertheless 
(0 
1 
00 )(0 
1 
00 ) = (0+0 
0+0 
0+00+0 ) = (0 
0 
00 ) 
. 
Algebraic validity therefore depends upon properties of both binary 
operations, including multiplication, division and others to be discussed 
in Chapter 5, and the sets on which these operate, which might be sets of 
numbers,matricesorobjectsofothertypesâagain,seeChapter5.Binary 
operationsmightbecommutativeonsomesetsbutnotonothers.Insome 
sets there are few ways to combine objects to give zero; in others, there 
are many. h us, âfactsâ that are true for one operation on one set do not 
necessarily hold elsewhere, and Abstract Algebra requires concentration 
to ensure that you do not overgeneralize from a familiar context. I wonât 
lie:thisishard.Whenyouareaccustomedtoâdoingâalgebrainnumerical 
contexts, it might not require much ef f ort. h e manipulations become 
natural enough that you do them easily, much as you might walk or type 
easily.Andconcentratingonsomethingthatyoudoeasilyfeelsweirdand 
disruptive. If you concentrate on your muscles as you walk, you become 
slowandungainly.Ifyoucantouch-type,butyouforceyourselftolookat 
thekeyboardandthinkaboutwhichlettersyouwant,youmightf i ndthat 
you canât type at all. Focusing on why algebraic manipulations are valid 
can feel similar: slow, clunky and therefore like a step backward in your 
learning rather than a step forward. It takes discipline, and for a while 
might feel frustrating. 
But the reward is worth it. Dif f erences occur in the detail, but at 
larger scales Abstract Algebra reveals strikingly similar structures. Sets 
6WHAT IS ABSTRACT ALGEBRA? 
and operations that appear quite dif f erent turn out to have numerous

even if youâre not by nature one of thoseâif youâre into mathematics for 
its practical applicationsâI encourage you to be open to the ideas. h ere 
is pleasure in recognizing structures that cut across the subject.ChatGPTSummary of Section 1.2: What is algebraic about Abstract Algebra?Understanding of Traditional Algebra:Algebra, as traditionally understood, involves manipulating expressions or equations in valid ways, often to solve problems.This understanding is mostly what students encounter before reaching undergraduate mathematics.Aims of Abstract Algebra:Instead of merely performing algebraic manipulations, Abstract Algebra focuses on understanding the mathematical structures that make such manipulations valid.Algebraic Validity:The validity of each algebraic step can be traced back to certain properties of operations and objects.Example: The commutative property of multiplication implies that xy=yxxy = yxxy=yx. However, not all operations share this property. Division isn't commutative, as x/yx/yx/y isn't necessarily equal to y/xy/xy/x.Different Behaviors:Not all objects behave like numbers. Matrices are an example where multiplication is not commutative.Certain assumptions valid for numbers may not hold for matrices. For example, a square of a matrix being zero doesn't imply that the matrix itself is the zero matrix.Scope of Algebraic Validity:The validity of algebraic operations depends on both the operations (e.g., multiplication, division) and the sets they operate upon (e.g., sets of numbers, matrices).Abstract Algebra demands caution to prevent overgeneralization from one context to another.Challenges:Transitioning from 'doing' algebra to understanding the reasons behind algebraic manipulations can be difficult. This shift can feel counter-intuitive, slowing down what was once an automatic process.Rewards of Abstract Algebra:Despite the initial challenges, understanding Abstract Algebra can unveil similar structures across seemingly different sets and operations.Recognizing these structures is satisfying and can be appealing not just to pure mathematicians but also to those interested in the practical applications of math.In essence, this section emphasizes the importance of diving deeper into the foundational structures that make algebraic manipulations possible, urging students to see the broader patterns and connections in the subject of Abstract Algebra.1.3 Approaches to Abstract Algebra 
To appreciate Abstract Algebra, you will need to engage ef f ectively with 
your course. And courses dif f er. Lecturers have individual approaches, 
and even those who follow books will emphasize some things and skip 
over others. h at said, many Abstract Algebra courses start with group 
theory. Some start with rings or a combination of structures but, as the 
grouptheorybeginningiscommon,itformsthegreaterpartofthisbook. 
In teaching group theory, there are three broad approaches: a formal 
approach, an equation-solving approach and a geometric approach. Your 
course will likely have something in common with at least one of these, 
and this book will draw on all three. Here I will describe each in turn, 
commenting on their advantages and disadvantages. h e descriptions 
are necessarily caricatures, but they give a l avour of what you might 
encounter. 
A formal approach is in one sense the simplest. Lecturers taking this 
approachtendtobeginwithdef i nitions,likethatforgroupshownbelow.3 
h is is explained in detail in Chapters 2, 5 and 6; for now, you might like 
to know that the symbol âââ means â(which) is an element ofâ and is of t en 
read simply as âinâ. 
Def i nition: A group is a set G with a binary operation â such that: 
Closure for every g1,g2â G, g1âg2â G; 
Associativity for every g1,g2,g3â G, (g1âg2)âg3= g1â(g2âg3); 
Identity there exists e â G such that for every g â G, eâg = gâe = g; 
Inverses for every g â G, âgâ²â G such that gâgâ²= gâ²âg = e. 
3 If your course uses a def i nition that omits the closure criterion, see Section 5.7. 
APPROACHES TO ABSTRACT ALGEBRA7 
Af t er introducing a def i nition, lecturers taking a formal approach will 
use it to prove general theorems. So a formal approach foregrounds the 
key concepts and deductive nature of advanced mathematics. And some 
peoplelikeit.Itâstidy,itâsslickanditleadstoaconcisesetoflecturenotes. 
It avoids expansive discussion of ways in which abstract theory can be 
instantiated, so there is minimal distraction and it should be clear that 
def i nitions,theoremsandproofsarecentral.Italsosavestime,soacourse 
can get to deeper results quite quickly. Some people i nd that motivating 
because deeper results are more interesting. 
h e speed of a formal approach can, however, present challenges. A 
theory presented with few examples provides little opportunity to build 
intuition, so that students might learn many theorems but i nd it dif i cult 
to decide which to use in problem solving. It is also, for some, actively 
demotivating.Ifyourlecturertakesthisapproachbutyouvalueintuition, 
you might can i nd yourself staring at def i nitions, theorems and proofs 
and thinking, âWell, that seems to be valid, but why should I care? Why 
def i ne a group that way in the i rst place?â

ChatGPTSummary of Section 1.3: Approaches to Abstract AlgebraDiversity in Courses:Courses in Abstract Algebra can differ based on the lecturer's approach and the material emphasized.Many courses begin with group theory, though some may start with rings or other structures. This is reflected in the content of the book the user refers to.Three Broad Approaches:There are three main teaching methods for group theory: the formal approach, the equation-solving approach, and the geometric approach. The section further elaborates on the formal approach.Formal Approach:This method is often seen as straightforward. It usually begins with definitions, such as the one provided for a group.Definition of a Group:A group is defined as a set GGG with a binary operation â*â such that:Closure: For every g1,g2g_1, g_2g1â,g2â in GGG, g1âg2g_1 * g_2g1ââg2â is also in GGG.Associativity: For every g1,g2,g3g_1, g_2, g_3g1â,g2â,g3â in GGG, (g1âg2)âg3=g1â(g2âg3)(g_1 * g_2) * g_3 = g_1 * (g_2 * g_3)(g1ââg2â)âg3â=g1ââ(g2ââg3â).Identity: There exists an element eee in GGG such that for every ggg in GGG, eâg=gâe=ge * g = g * e = geâg=gâe=g.Inverses: For every ggg in GGG, there exists a gâ²g'gâ² in GGG such that gâgâ²=gâ²âg=eg * g' = g' * g = egâgâ²=gâ²âg=e.After introducing a definition, the formal approach dives into proving general theorems based on it.Pros:Highlights the central concepts and logical reasoning of higher-level math.Concise, clear focus on definitions, theorems, and proofs without distraction.Can rapidly lead to deeper, more interesting results.Cons:Speed can be a challenge, especially for newcomers.Provides few examples, potentially hindering the development of intuition.Some students may find it challenging to understand the motivations behind definitions and might question their relevance.In essence, the formal approach to Abstract Algebra emphasizes strict definitions and proofs. While it's efficient and clear-cut, it may not cater to those who prefer more intuitive or application-based learning.h e equation-solving approach deals with this problem. A lecturer 
taking this approach might start by inviting students to consider what 
properties are needed to ensure that equations of the form x+a = b 
always have solutions. Working this out involves solving this simple 
equation while attending to those properties. We want to subtract a from 
both sides, writing x+a = b 
âx = bâa. 
What assumptions does that require? First, subtraction must be possible; 
a must have an additive inverse âa. h is cannot be taken for granted: 
in the set of natural numbersN= {1,2,3,...}, the elements have no 
additive inverses. Further assumptions are revealed by unpacking what 
we are doing. x+a = b 
â (x+a)+(âa) = b+(âa) (adding âa to both sides) 
â x+(a+(âa)) = b+(âa) (reordering operations on the lef t ) 
âx+0 = b+(âa) (using a+(âa) = 0) 
âx = b+(âa) (using x+0 = x). 
8WHAT IS ABSTRACT ALGEBRA? 
You see what I mean about the challenge of concentrating on validity. If 
you are wondering why anyone would bother, check your assumptions 
about sets and operations. Would equivalent intermediate steps be valid 
if the operation were multiplication, so that the original equation read 
ax = b? Would the addition and multiplication versions work if the 
objects were matrices? If not, what could go wrong? 
h en consider the intermediate steps. For the i rst, as noted above, the 
object a must have an additive inverse âa. For the second, the operations 
are reordered so that a+(âa) is calculated before x+a; for this, the 
operationmustbeassociative.T h ethirdusestheinversepropertydirectly. 
h e fourth uses the fact that 0 is the additive identity element. Finally, 
the result b+(âa) must be in the set; the set must be closed under the 
operation.Now,didyounoticewhatthismeans?Guaranteeingsolvability 
for equations like x+a = b or ax = b requires closure, associativity, an 
identity element and inverses. In other words, it requires a structure 
that satisf i es the def i nition of group. h at def i nition does not come from 
nowhere.

earlier algebraic experience, so it provides a natural way in. And dif f erent 
equationtypesdemanddif f erentstructures,leadingtotheoryaboutrings, 
fields and so on. But this approach alone gives little sense of group 
structures that exist beyond familiar sets and operations.ChatGPTSummary of the Equation-Solving Approach in Abstract Algebra:Introduction:The equation-solving approach focuses on properties required to ensure that equations of certain forms always have solutions.Using the example x+a=bx+a = bx+a=b, it delves into the underlying properties to solve such equations.Underlying Assumptions:For subtraction to be viable in the equation x+a=bx+a = bx+a=b, aaa must have an additive inverse, denoted as âa-aâa.In the natural number set N={1,2,3,...}N = \{1,2,3,...\}N={1,2,3,...}, elements do not have additive inverses, making subtraction non-trivial.Breakdown of the Equation-Solving Process:To solve x+a=bx+a = bx+a=b:Add âa-aâa to both sides: x+a+(âa)=b+(âa)x+a+(âa) = b+(âa)x+a+(âa)=b+(âa).Reorder operations: x+(a+(âa))=b+(âa)x+(a+(âa)) = b+(âa)x+(a+(âa))=b+(âa).Simplify: x+0=b+(âa)x+0 = b+(âa)x+0=b+(âa), which leads to x=b+(âa)x = b+(âa)x=b+(âa).The process reveals several critical properties:Additive Inverse: aaa must have an inverse âa-aâa.Associativity: The order in which operations are performed shouldn't affect the result.Identity Element: 000 acts as the identity for addition.Closure: The resulting number b+(âa)b+(âa)b+(âa) must also belong to the set.Relevance to Group Theory:This equation-solving approach reveals that to guarantee solutions for equations like x+a=bx+a = bx+a=b or ax=bax = bax=b, one requires closure, associativity, an identity element, and inverses. These are precisely the properties that define a group.This definition of a group is grounded in fundamental algebraic concepts and isn't arbitrary.Advantages:The approach relates Abstract Algebra to students' foundational algebraic experiences.Different types of equations introduce different structures like rings and fields.Limitation:The equation-solving approach, when used alone, might not provide a comprehensive understanding of group structures beyond familiar sets and operations.In essence, the equation-solving approach in Abstract Algebra offers a bridge between elementary algebra and more advanced concepts, making the subject more relatable for students. However, its scope might be limited when exploring broader group structures.h e geometric approach addresses that. It starts with structuresâand 
indeed objectsâthat are, for many students, unfamiliar. h e objects are 
the symmetries of shapes such as equilateral triangles and squares, where 
eachsymmetryisatransformationaf t erwhichtheshapeâlooksthesameâ. 
For instance, an equilateral triangle has the six symmetries represented 
below (the spots are just to keep track). h ese comprise an identity e 
(âleave the triangle where it isâ), two rotations and three ref l ections. With 
the i rst rotation denoted by Ï (the Greek letter ârhoâ), why does it make 
sense to denote the second by Ï2? Why do you think the identity is 
included?

h is use of the word symmetry dif f ers from colloquially saying that the 
triangle âis symmetricalâ. It is more precise in that the six symmetries are 
recognizedasdistinct.Moreover,âsymmetryâisanoun(asinâaref l ectionâ,

ofcomposition,wherecomposingtwosymmetriesmeansperformingone 
then the other. For instance, performing Ï then r1has the same ef f ect as 
performing the single symmetry r2.

What is required to establish that these symmetries form a group under 
composition? Which properties are easy to check and which are more 
dif i cult? Symmetry groups, including alternative notations, will be 
discussed in Sections 5.6 and 6.7â6.8.

You might enjoy this ifâlike meâyou like visual representations. I can 
imagine the objects, although it takes concentration to remember that 
the group elements are symmetriesârotations and ref l ectionsânot the 
triangle or its corners (see Section 6.7). If you are more of a formalist, 
you might think that manipulating shapes is a bit childish, or that it 
wastestimethatcouldbeusedforrealtheory.T h atâsfairenough,thoughI 
encourage you to embrace the intuition that can come from such activity. 
One broader disadvantage of a geometric approach is that it privileges

groups, or at least that these are somehow the most important. It might 
be less obvious that group theory also applies to familiar structures, and 
students might therefore miss opportunities to connect their mathemat- 
ical knowledge. So, while visual representations are useful, I encourage 
you to develop your understanding of a range of groups, so that you can 
use dif f erent insights and appreciate the scope of the theory. h is book is 
designed to help you do that.ChatGPTSummary of the Geometric Approach in Abstract Algebra:Introduction:The geometric approach deals with the symmetries of shapes such as equilateral triangles and squares. These symmetries represent transformations where the shape appears unchanged.Symmetries of an Equilateral Triangle:An equilateral triangle has six symmetries, which include an identity eee, two rotations, and three reflections.The first rotation is represented by the Greek letter Ï (rho). Subsequent rotations are denoted Ï2Ï^2Ï2, Ï3Ï^3Ï3, and so on.These symmetries are recognized as distinct from the general idea that a triangle is 'symmetrical'.Symmetries as Group Elements:Symmetries can be considered elements of a set.These symmetries form a group under the operation of composition. Composition means performing one symmetry after another.For example, executing the symmetry ÏÏÏ followed by r1r1r1 has the same effect as executing the symmetry r2r2r2.Exploration of Symmetry Groups:Establishing these symmetries as a group requires checking certain properties. Some properties are straightforward to verify, while others might be more intricate.Symmetry groups will be elaborated on in other sections of the book.Benefits of the Geometric Approach:Ideal for inquiry-based learning as students can physically interact with shapes, aiding in developing intuition and hypothesis exploration.Offers a visual representation, which can be beneficial for those who are visually inclined.Limitations:The geometric approach might suggest that the entirety of group theory is centered around symmetry groups, overshadowing the broader applicability of group theory.Some might see physically manipulating shapes as rudimentary or believe it diverts time from delving into theoretical aspects.It may not be immediately evident that group theory also encompasses familiar structures, which can lead students to overlook opportunities to integrate their mathematical knowledge.Final Thoughts:While visual representations and hands-on experiences have their merits, it's essential to cultivate an understanding of various groups. This will enable students to leverage diverse insights and fully appreciate the expanse of group theory. The book is curated to assist in this understanding.In essence, the geometric approach in Abstract Algebra offers a tangible, visual way to understand and appreciate group theory. However, learners should be cautious not to see it as the entirety of group theory and should strive to grasp the broader aspects of the subject.chapter 2 
Axioms and Def i nitions 
Thischapterexplainshowaxiomsanddef i nitionsf i tintomathematicaltheories, 
and describes ways to relate them to examples. It notes relationships between 
axioms,def i nitionsandthekeyconceptsofgroupandring,andintroducesideas 
to be formalized in Part 2. It concludes by discussing object types in Abstract 
Algebra and corresponding notations. 
2.1 Mathematical axioms and def i nitions 
A 
xioms and def i nitions form the basis of any mathematical theory, 
where a theory is an interlinked network of concepts and results. 
Axioms and def i nitions are the assumptions and agreements 
from which mathematicians build a theory by proving theorems, where 
a theorem is a true statement about one or more mathematical concepts. 
h is is represented in the diagram below. 
Understanding axioms and def i nitions is therefore crucial. And it is 
important to know what this involves, because mathematical concepts 
are not like everyday concepts. h at might be obvious for axiomsâ 
in everyday life, no one really talks about those. People do talk about 
def i nitions, but everyday def i nitions are not the same as mathematical 
def i nitions. In fact, everyday def i nitions are mostly ignored because we 
usuallylearnaboutconceptsbyexposuretoexamples.Ifweencounteran 
unfamiliarconcept,wemightlookupitsdef i nition,butwemightinferits 
meaning from the context. People do this imperfectly, but that is rarely 
disastrous. We usually grasp roughly the intended meaning, and many
concepts in any case have âwoolly edgesâ around which people do not 
quite agree. 
Mathematical def i nitions are not like this. Mathematical def i nitions 
specify properties, and the words they def i ne are used exactly and only 
for things that satisfy those properties. For example, a def i nition of even 
number appears below. I recommend reading such def i nitionsâand all 
mathematicsâaloud: it is important to own the language so that you 
can use it naturally when reading and when communicating with others. 
Here, âââ means âthere existsâ, âZâ denotes the set of all integers (whole 
numbers, including negatives and zero) and âââ can be read as âinâ. 
Def i nition: A number n is even if and only if âk âZsuch that n = 2k. 
h is def i nition splits numbers cleanly into those that are even and those 
that are not. h ere is no ambiguity: 4,â38 and 0 are even; 5 and â351 
are not; 12.001 might be âclose toâ the even number 12, but it is not even, 
and it is certainly not considered even by some people but not by others. 
h is is due to the logic captured in the phrase âif and only ifâ, which is 
sometimes easier to process by considering each part separately: 
A number n is even if âk âZsuch that n = 2k; 
A number n is even only if âk âZsuch that n = 2k.
h ef i rstpartmeansthatanumberisevenifthereexistsanappropriatek. 
h e second means that a number cannot be even otherwiseâtry reading 
each part aloud with emphasis on the italics. h en, to make the logic 
clearer,considerthetwostatementsbelow.T h esearesimilarlystructured, 
but something important must be dif f erent because one is true and the 
other is false. Which is which? 
A number n is divisible by 2 if it is divisible by 4. 
A number n is divisible by 2 only if it is divisible by 4. 
h e true statement splits numbers into three partially nested sets because 
some numbers are divisible by 2 but not by 4. Consider how the logic 
relates to the diagram. evennot even 
divisible 
by 4 
In mathematics, it of t en happens that one of an if and an only if is true 
and the other is falseâChapter 3 discusses theorems with this feature. 
But def i nitions all have if and only if structures. Unfortunately, that is not 
always apparent from teaching materials. First, some def i nitions sound 
more natural when formulated dif f erentlyâI will point out where that 
occurs in thisbook. Second, mathematiciansunderstand thelogic of def- 
initions without having to think about it, so some write âifâ knowing that 
they really mean âif and only ifâ. I think that this overlooks opportunities 
to help students focus on logic. On the other hand, undergraduates need 
to learn their subjectâs norms, to interpret this kind of thing correctly. 
Whatever your lecturerâs approach, bear this information in mind. 
Now, the principle behind mathematical def i nitions is easy enough 
to work with for even numbers, where the def i nition is simple and the 
relevantobjectsarefamiliar.Itcanbeharderwhenadef i nitioniscomplex 
andtherelevantobjectsareunfamiliar.Considerthedef i nitionbelow,for

ChatGPTSummary of Chapter 2: Axioms and DefinitionsPurpose and Role of Axioms and Definitions:Axioms and definitions underpin mathematical theories.Mathematical theories comprise an interconnected web of concepts and outcomes derived from these foundational elements.Axioms and definitions enable mathematicians to formulate and prove theorems, which are true statements regarding one or more mathematical concepts.Difference from Everyday Concepts:Everyday notions differ from mathematical concepts. While people often grasp the general idea of day-to-day concepts through context or example exposure, mathematical concepts are strictly defined.Mathematical definitions outline precise properties. Words defined in this context are used exclusively for things that fulfill these properties.For instance, in mathematics, the term 'even number' is strictly defined. There's no ambiguity; a number is either even or not, based on its properties.Example of a Mathematical Definition:A number nnn is termed even if there exists an integer kkk such that n=2kn = 2kn=2k. This definition unequivocally classifies numbers as even or not.Importance of 'If and Only If':The phrase 'if and only if' (often abbreviated 'iff') is essential in mathematical definitions as it ensures that the definition is both necessary and sufficient.It can be broken down into two parts: "if" and "only if", each having its logical significance.This dual structure differentiates definitions from other mathematical statements, which might have only one of the two components being true.Illustration with Divisibility:The concept of divisibility serves as an illustration. The statement "A number nnn is divisible by 2 if it is divisible by 4" is true. However, the statement "A number nnn is divisible by 2 only if it is divisible by 4" is false.Pedagogical Considerations:Definitions in teaching materials don't always explicitly state the 'if and only if' structure. This omission can sometimes be due to the aim for more natural language or because seasoned mathematicians implicitly understand the logic.However, it's crucial for students to understand the inherent logic in definitions and be aware of these nuances when studying.Complexity in Definitions:Simple definitions, like that of even numbers, are easier to grasp due to their simplicity and familiarity. However, as definitions become more intricate and pertain to less familiar objects, understanding can be more challenging.In essence, this chapter emphasizes the foundational role of axioms and definitions in mathematics. It highlights the precision and strictness of mathematical definitions compared to everyday concepts and underscores the importance of the 'if and only if' structure in forming clear, unambiguous definitions.Def i nition: Suppose that H is a subgroup of G. h en the lef t coset of H 
containing a is aH = {ah|h â H}. 
One thing to check is that you can read this aloud. For instance, the 
expression aH = {ah|h â H} could be read as 
âa-big-H is the set of all elements of the form a-little-h, where little-h is 
in the subgroup big-H.â 
In practice, people might not bother with the detail, just saying 
âaH is the set of all elements of the form ah, where h is in H.â 
h at works provided that everyone is looking at the written formulation, 
so they know which h or H is which. You might want to distinguish 
them explicitly, though, because h and H are dif f erent types of object, as 
discussed in Section 2.5. 
One thing to observe is that this def i nition sounds natural without 
an explicit âif and only ifâ: it is formulated less as a possible property of 
pre-existing objects, and more as an instruction, as a way to calculate lef t 
cosets. Coset calculations will be introduced in Section 2.5 and discussed 
further in Chapter 7. For now, note that applying this def i nition requires 
understanding what a subgroup is, what the notation means, and so on. 
Using it to prove things about cosets in general requires compressing the 
idea to think about cosets as objects. Chapter 7 discusses that compres- 
sion, which takes some work. But at least the word coset indicates that 
there is work to do: most people have never heard it so it is clear that it 
introduces a new concept. 
h e principle behind mathematical def i nitions can be even harder 
to work with when a def i nition is complex, the relevant objects are 
unfamiliar, and the word sounds like an everyday concept. For instance, 
as noted in Chapter 1, a central Abstract Algebra concept is that of a 
group. h e group concept has a rather long def i nition, and you probably 
have little experience with mathematical groups. But you have a lot of 
experience with everyday groups, and Iâm sure you can see that this 
causes problems. When you hear the word âgroupâ, it will be easier to 
think about its everyday meaning than its mathematical meaning. Con- 
sequently,manystudentsstrugglealongwithanunderstandingofgroups
that is overly inf l uenced by the everyday meaning, and rather imprecise. 
Unsurprisingly, this is not a good foundation for understanding the 
related mathematical theory. 
Recognizing this problem can help students to address a lot of their 
own dif i culties. Students of t en know that they do not understand things. 
h ey might know, for instance, that they do not understand a theorem 
aboutcosetsbecausetheydonotreallyknowwhatcosetsare.T h esolution 
to this problem has a simple i rst step: study the def i nition. But students 
new to advanced mathematics of t en do not think to do that, because it 
is not how they have learned about concepts in everyday life or in earlier 
mathematics.Consequently,muchofthischapterisaboutwaystoprocess 
def i nitions. But its overarching message is simply that def i nitions are 
paramount and should command your attention.ChatGPTSummary of the Excerpt on Mathematical Definitions and Cosets:Reading Mathematical Definitions Aloud:Mathematical expressions, like the definition of the left coset of a subgroup, can be read aloud to help with comprehension. For example, the expression aH={ahâ£hâH}aH = \{ah | h \in H\}aH={ahâ£hâH} can be verbalized to clarify the distinction between the individual element hhh and the subgroup HHH.Nature of the Definition:The coset definition might not seem to need an 'if and only if' because itâs presented more as an instruction or way to compute left cosets rather than as a property of existing objects.Understanding the Definition:Using the definition effectively requires understanding foundational concepts like subgroups and the associated notation.To discuss cosets in depth, one must treat cosets as objects in their own right. This involves compressing or distilling the core idea of the definition.The Challenge of Familiar Words:Mathematical definitions can be particularly challenging when they use terms that sound familiar from everyday language. The mathematical meaning might be very different from the everyday sense, leading to confusion.For example, the term "group" in abstract algebra has a very specific and detailed definition. However, the everyday use of the word "group" might influence one's understanding of the term in a mathematical context, causing misconceptions.Addressing Conceptual Challenges:Recognizing the divergence between everyday and mathematical meanings of terms can help students navigate their misconceptions.Often, students might realize they don't fully grasp a theorem or concept because they don't understand its foundational definitions.A fundamental strategy to address such challenges is to revisit and thoroughly understand the definitions. This approach differs from how concepts are typically learned in everyday life or in simpler mathematical contexts.Importance of Definitions:This chapter emphasizes the critical role of definitions in advanced mathematics. Understanding definitions thoroughly is pivotal for grasping more complex ideas and theorems that build upon them.In essence, this excerpt underscores the importance of definitions in mathematics, especially in higher-level courses. It highlights potential pitfalls in understanding due to the use of everyday language terms and offers strategies for students to navigate and rectify their misconceptions.2.2 Relating def i nitions to examples 
One way to understand def i nitions is to relate them to examples. For 
instance, the concept of closure is def i ned below, where the symbol âââ 
means âfor allâ. (I will stop reminding you to read aloud now but I 
recommend that you continue.) 
Def i nition: h e set S is closed under the binary operation â if and only 
if âs1,s2â S, s1âs2â S. 
h is def i nition refers to both a set, denoted by S, and a binary operation, 
denotedbyâ(âstarâ).Andapplyingitcanbestraightforward.Forinstance, 
translatingfromthegeneralsetSandoperationâtothespecif i csetNand 
operation + gives ân1,n2âN, n1+n2âN. 
h is statement is true, so the natural numbers are closed under addition. 
How about other sets such asZ(the integersâwhole numbers including 
negativesandzero),Q(therationalnumbers,thoseoftheformp/qwhere

Checkandyouwillf i ndthatallf i veareclosedunderbothoperations:the 
sum of two real numbers is a real number, the product of two complex 
numbers is a complex number, and so on. So it might seem like there 
isnât much to see here. But other sets and binary operations are more 
interesting. h e integers are not closed under division because it is not

Whenintroducingadef i nition,lecturerscommonlyapplyittoacouple 
of examples and ask students to apply it to more. I recommend perform- 
ing at least mental checks in relation to all the examples you can think 
of. If that turns out to be easy, you have quickly explored the breadth 
and limitations of the concept. If it turns out to be dif i cult, you have 
discoveredeitheragapinyourunderstandingoramathematicalsubtlety 
that merits more attention. 
Here, for instance, it might be tempting to say simply that a set is or 
is not closed. But that would be mathematically ambiguousâa set on its 
own cannot be closed because the def i nition requires a binary operation. 
Another subtlety is that zero is an integer, but division by zero is not 
well def i ned. h is renders the closure question moot for division onZ, 
because division is not even a binary operation onZ. h at might strike 
you as overly fussy, because only one element is problematic: division is 
def i nedonnearlyallofZ.Mathematiciansrecognizethis,andsometimes 
restrict to a set such asZ\{0}, which means the integers excluding zero. 
But that raises another subtlety glossed over so far: must the result of a 
binary operation be in the original set? If it must, then division is not a 
binary operation even onZ\{0}, again due to counterexamples like 3/2. 
Division is a binary operation onQ\{0}, so we could think ofZ\{0} as 
a subset of that. Does that af f ect closure? IsZ\{0} as a subset ofQ\{0} 
closed under division? No: 3/2 is still a counterexample. 
Chapter 5 will discuss this subtlety further. It will also consider other 
sets and binary operations, including matrices under addition and multi- 
plication, and functions, symmetries and permutations under composi- 
tion.Ifyouarefamiliarwithsomeofthese,considernowwhichareclosed

Finally, for mathematical usage of everyday words, it is worth think- 
ing about relationships between mathematical def i nitions and everyday 
meanings. h e two will dif f er, but usually the words are well chosen. For 
instance, I would say informally that âclosedâ means that it is impossible 
to âget out ofâ the set by combining two of its elements using the binary 
operation.Soitislikehavingaclosedboxand,forme,thisuseoftheword 
makes sense.ChatGPTSummary of the Excerpt on Relating Definitions to Examples:Understanding Through Examples:Using concrete examples helps clarify mathematical definitions. The symbol 'â' denotes 'for all.'Closure in Mathematics:The set SSS is closed under the binary operation â if, for every pair of elements from SSS, their result under the operation also belongs to SSS.Translated to natural numbers (NNN) and addition, the statement becomes: for all natural numbers n1n1n1 and n2n2n2, their sum also belongs to NNN. This implies natural numbers are closed under addition.Closure Across Different Sets and Operations:Natural numbers, integers (ZZZ), rational numbers (QQQ), real numbers (RRR), and complex numbers (CCC) are all closed under addition and multiplication.However, integers aren't closed under division. For example, while 3 and 2 are integers, their division results in a non-integer (1.5).Importance of Counterexamples:A single counterexample is enough to show a set isn't closed under an operation due to the quantifier 'â.'Mathematical Subtleties:It's incorrect to simply say a set is or isn't closed without specifying the binary operation.For integers, division by zero is undefined, which means division isn't a binary operation for integers.Some subsets of familiar sets might be closed under specific operations while others aren't. For example, the set of integer multiples of 3, denoted as 3Z3Z3Z, and the set of all complex numbers of the form 0+yi0+yi0+yi.Implications for Learning:When introduced to a new definition, it's beneficial to mentally check and apply it across various examples to grasp its breadth and limitations.Certain definitions might need to be reevaluated or restricted to make sense in specific contexts.Relation to Everyday Language:While mathematical definitions might differ from everyday meanings, the terms are usually well-chosen. The term 'closed' in mathematics has a resemblance to its everyday usage: it implies the impossibility of escaping a set when combining its elements using the specified operation.In summary, the excerpt emphasizes the importance of using examples to better understand and apply mathematical definitions. It dives deep into the concept of closure and highlights the subtleties and nuances that can arise when applying definitions across various mathematical contexts.A second important concept is associativity. 
Def i nition: h e operation â is associative on the set S if and only if 
âs1,s2,s3â S, (s1âs2)âs3= s1â(s2âs3). 
Youcanunderstandthisinsimilarways.Whichoperationsareassocia- 
tive on which sets? Is there an operation that is associative on a whole set 
but not on a smaller subset, or vice versa? If so, can you give an example? 
Ifnot,whynot?AssociativitywillbediscussedinChapter5,butthinking 
in advance can ground the ideas. 
A third important concept is that of an identity element, of t en denoted 
by âeâ for the German word einheit, though you might also see âidâ or âÄ±â or 
your lecturerâs own favourite. 
Def i nition: h e element e â S is the identity in S with respect to the 
binary operation â if and only if âs â S, eâs = sâe = s. 
h is def i nition distinguishes one element of a set with a special property. 
How would you describe this property informally? I would say that the 
identity âdoesnât change anythingâ when combined with other elements 
using the binary operation. For instance, the identity inZwith respect to 
multiplication is 1, because âx âZ,1x = x1 = x.
What is the identity inZwith respect to addition? It is 0, because 
âx âZ,0+x = x+0 = x. 
h us it makes no sense to discuss âtheâ identity inZ; this def i nition too 
requires both a set and a binary operation. h at said, people do abuse the 
language when an operation is established. For instance, the 2Ã2 matrix 
(1 
0 
01 ) 
is of t en referred to as âtheâ identity matrix. Which is it, a multiplicative or 
an additive identity? Could it be both, or perhaps an identity in relation 
to another operation? 
A i nal important concept is that of an inverse. 
Def i nition: Suppose that e is the identity in S with respect to â. h en 
s â S has inverse sâ²with respect to â if and only if sâsâ²= 
sâ²âs = e. 
h is def i nition applies to individual elements rather than just one spe- 
cial one or the whole set. Also, it def i nes a two-sided inverse. In some 
structures, it makes sense to separate lef t and right inversesâwhat might 
that mean? h e inverse notion applies in obvious ways for familiar cases, 
subject to care regarding the binary operation. For instance, inZunder 
addition, the identity is 0 and the inverse of 2 is â2, because 2+(â2) = 
(â2)+2 = 0. InZunder multiplication, the identity is 1 and the inverse 
of 2 is 1 2, because 2Â· 
1 
2 = 
1 
2 Â·2 = 1. Do all elements inZhave inverses 
under both operations? Are these inverses inZ? What is the inverse of 
the identity in each case? And what would be the answers for other sets 
and binary operations? 
To conclude this section, note that it is not a coincidence that I have 
introducedthedef i nitionsofclosure,associativity,identitiesandinverses. 
As you know if you have read Section 1.3, they all combine in the 
def i nition of group.ChatGPTSummary of the Excerpt on Important Mathematical Concepts:Associativity:A binary operation â is associative on set SSS if and only if for all elements s1,s2,s3s1, s2, s3s1,s2,s3 in SSS, the operation holds: (s1âs2)âs3=s1â(s2âs3)(s1âs2)âs3 = s1â(s2âs3)(s1âs2)âs3=s1â(s2âs3).There's an open-ended query regarding if an operation can be associative on an entire set but not on a subset, or vice versa.Identity Element:An element eee in set SSS is the identity with respect to the binary operation â if, for every element sss in SSS, eâs=sâe=seâs = sâe = seâs=sâe=s.Informally, the identity element doesn't affect other elements when combined using the binary operation.For the integers ZZZ under multiplication, the identity is 1. Under addition, it's 0.The identity depends on both the set and the operation. As an example, a 2x2 matrix with 1s on the diagonal is often called "the identity matrix", but it's important to clarify which operation it's the identity for.Inverse:If eee is the identity in SSS with respect to â, then an element sss in SSS has an inverse sâ²s'sâ² with respect to â if sâsâ²=sâ²âs=esâs' = s'âs = esâsâ²=sâ²âs=e.This definition defines a two-sided inverse, but in some contexts, one might consider left or right inverses separately.Examples in ZZZ: Under addition, the inverse of 2 is -2. Under multiplication, the inverse of 2 is 1/2.There are further questions posed, such as whether all elements in ZZZ have inverses for both addition and multiplication, and whether these inverses are also in ZZZ.Conclusion:The introduction of the concepts of closure, associativity, identity, and inverses isn't random. Together, they form the foundational concepts for the mathematical definition of a group.This section presents foundational mathematical concepts and encourages critical thinking by prompting the reader with questions about applying these concepts in various contexts. These foundational ideas are central to understanding more advanced mathematical structures, such as groups.2.3 The def i nition of group 
Some def i nitions in Abstract Algebra are short. But some are longer, with 
multiple parts. h e parts are sometimes called axioms: people say things 
likeâtobeagroup,asetwithabinaryoperationmustsatisfyfour1axiomsâ. 
To understand this, it might help to know that axioms can function 
in two complementary but psychologically distinct ways. h e i rst is as 
assumptions,asthingsthatareobviouslytruesothateveryonecanagreeto 
usethemwithoutjustif i cation.Forinstance,additionontherealnumbers 
is associative, because forevery x,y,z âR, (x+y)+z = x+(y+z). h is 
is one of numerous axioms for the real numbers, a list of which might be 
studied in Analysis. h ere, however, the axioms will not take centre stage 
for long because the entire subject is about the real numbers, at least at 
i rst. h is means that the axioms, once clarif i ed, might be used without 
much comment. 
Abstract Algebra, in contrast, is about not one structure but many, 
and about their similarities and dif f erences. h is means that axioms in 
Abstract Algebra function less as assumptions and more as criteria. As 
we encounter various structures, we ask whether or not they satisfy these 
criteria. h e def i nition of group has four criteria: it requires a set and 
binary operation that satisfy four axioms. 
Def i nition: A group is a set G with a binary operation â such that: 
Closure âg1,g2â G, g1âg2â G; 
Associativity âg1,g2,g3â G, (g1âg2)âg3= g1â(g2âg3); 
Identity âe â G such that âg â G, eâg = gâe = g; 
Inverses âg â G, âgâ²â G such that gâgâ²= gâ²âg = e. 
If you have read Chapter 1, you might notice that I have now converted 
some words to symbols, writing âââ and âââ for âfor everyâ and âthere 
existsâ. Whether and when to do this is debated. Some lecturers think that 
learning new symbols impedes understanding, or that starting sentences 
with symbols is grammatically undesirable. Others value the symbolsâ
brevity. I am of the latter view, though I do not claim full consistencyâ 
how I write depends on what I want to communicate. Here, I like that the 
symbols draw attention to the contrasting structures of the identity and 
inverses axioms: one uses âthere exists... for allâ; the other uses âfor all... 
there existsâ. If you have studied some undergraduate mathematics, you 
might know that order in these quantif i ers is important. h e âââ comes 
i rst in the identity axiom because there is a single identity that combines 
in a certain way with all other elements. h e âââ comes i rst in the inverses axiom because each element has its own inverse.ChatGPTSummary of the Section on The Definition of Group:Axioms in Abstract Algebra:Axioms can function in two ways: as assumptions and as criteria.In Abstract Algebra, axioms serve more as criteria, distinguishing between various mathematical structures based on their properties.Definition of a Group:A group is a mathematical structure consisting of a set GGG and a binary operation â.It has to meet four axioms or criteria:Closure: For every pair of elements g1,g2g1, g2g1,g2 in GGG, their operation g1âg2g1âg2g1âg2 results in an element that is also in GGG.Associativity: For every triplet of elements g1,g2,g3g1, g2, g3g1,g2,g3 in GGG, the operations hold: (g1âg2)âg3=g1â(g2âg3)(g1âg2)âg3 = g1â(g2âg3)(g1âg2)âg3=g1â(g2âg3).Identity: There exists an element eee in GGG such that for every element ggg in GGG, eâg=gâe=geâg = gâe = geâg=gâe=g.Inverses: For every element ggg in GGG, there exists an inverse element gâ²g'gâ² in GGG such that gâgâ²=gâ²âg=egâg' = g'âg = egâgâ²=gâ²âg=e.Use of Symbols:The author has transitioned from words to mathematical symbols like âââ for 'for every' and âââ for 'there exists'.There's a debate on the use of these symbols: while some find them impeding understanding, others appreciate their succinctness.The author prefers symbols for their clarity in denoting structures, especially in explaining the contrasting structures of the identity and inverses axioms.The order of the quantifiers 'â' and 'â' is crucial: In the identity axiom, the existence of a single identity is established first (thus 'â' comes first), whereas in the inverses axiom, the universality is emphasized first, indicating that each element has an inverse (thus 'â' comes first).The section provides a concise definition of a group in abstract algebra, detailing its axiomatic properties. The use of symbols emphasizes the specific structures of the axioms and their importance.h e structure of the group def i nition could be represented as below, 
and its length can make Abstract Algebra look dauntingâpeople tend to 
think that long things are dif i cult. But that is not necessarily true. Each 
part of a multi-part def i nitioncanbe fairly straightforward, so thereis no

Establishing that a set with a binary operation is a group requires estab- 
lishing that it satisf i es all four group axioms. For instance, the statements 
below are all true (when the operation is addition, the additive inverse 
of x is naturally denoted by ââxâ). So the integers under addition form a 
group. h is group can be denoted by â(Z,+)â. 
Closure âx1,x2âZ, x1+x2âZ; 
Associativity âx1,x2,x3âZ, (x1+x2)+x3= x1+(x2+x3); 
Identity â0 âZsuch that âx âZ, 0+x = x+0 = x; 
Inverses âx âZ, â(âx) âZsuch that x+(âx) = (âx)+x = 0.

An Abstract Algebra lecturer might of f er similar illustrations and ask 
studentstodemonstratethatotherstructuresformgroups.Butthismight 
leave you feeling nonplussed, at least initially. Af t er all, what do the 
abovestatementsreallydo?Juststatetheobvious,youmightargueâthey 
donât really prove anything. h is psychological conundrum arises from 
the two complementary functions of axioms, and I will discuss it further 
in Section 2.4. For now, you might i nd that the checks make more sense 
where there is more clearly something to prove.ChatGPTSummary of the Section on The Structure of Group Definition:Structure of Group Definition:At first glance, the definition of a group in abstract algebra may appear lengthy and daunting.However, while each multi-part definition may seem complex, each part can be understood individually and sequentially. Tackling one part at a time can simplify understanding.In problem-solving, it's helpful to start with the simpler parts.Verifying Group Axioms:To confirm that a set with a binary operation is a group, all four group axioms must be satisfied.Using the integers with the operation of addition as an example:Closure: For every pair of integers x1,x2x1, x2x1,x2, their sum is also an integer.Associativity: For every triplet of integers x1,x2,x3x1, x2, x3x1,x2,x3, the sum holds: (x1+x2)+x3=x1+(x2+x3)(x1+x2)+x3 = x1+(x2+x3)(x1+x2)+x3=x1+(x2+x3).Identity: 0 is the identity in the integers for addition.Inverses: For every integer xxx, its additive inverse (denoted âx-xâx) also belongs to the integers, and their sum is zero.This confirms that the integers, under addition, form a group, denoted by (Z,+)(Z,+)(Z,+).Challenges in Grasping the Concept:Some students may initially find it hard to see the value in these axiomatic verifications, feeling that they merely state the obvious and don't offer genuine proofs.This challenge stems from the dual nature of axioms: as assumptions and as criteria.The relevance and necessity of these checks may become clearer when the criteria are not so evidently met, i.e., when there's something non-trivial to prove.The section emphasizes that while the structure and definition of a group in abstract algebra might seem complex, breaking it down into its component axioms and understanding each in turn can simplify the learning process. It also touches upon the potential challenges students might face in grasping the essence and value of such definitions and verifications.For instance, the set 3Z= {3n|n âZ} forms a group under addition. 
Check the axioms to convince yourself: 3Zis closed under addition, 
addition is associative, the additive identity 0 is in 3Z, and every element 
in3Zhasanadditiveinversein3Z.T h enthinkaboutformulatingwritten 
arguments. It can help to start by introducing objects, naming them, 
and specifying their properties. For instance, closure can be established 
like this. 
Claim: 3Zis closed under addition. 
Proof: Let x1,x2â 3Z, so ân1,n2âZsuch that x1= 3n1,x2= 3n2. 
h en x1+x2= 3n1+3n2= 3(n1+n2) â 3Zbecause 
(n1+n2) âZ. 
So 3Zis closed under addition. 
For the identity axiom, we might write this. 
Claim: 0 is the additive identity in 3Z. 
Proof: 0 = 3Â·0 so 0 â 3Z, and âx â 3Z, 0+x = x+0 = x. 
Lecturersâ expectations for such arguments varyâsome want everything 
spelled out in full logical detail, others are more relaxed so long as the 
conceptual ideas come through. If in doubt, show your lecturer some 
attempts and ask for feedback. 
Next, it can be illuminating to prove that a set and binary operation do 
not form a group. Does that require proving that all four axioms are not 
satisf i ed? No, it just requires proving that one is not satisf i ed. If that is not 
obvious, think about the logic. h e def i nition says that to be a group, a 
structure must satisfy all four axioms. So, to show that it is not a group, 
THE DEFINITION OF GROUP23 
it is enough to show that it fails one. h is can be quite easy. For instance, 
theintegersdonotformagroupundermultiplication.Scantheaxiomsâ 
can you i nd one that is not satisf i ed? h e problem is with inverses. Two 
elements ofZdo have multiplicative inverses inZ: 1 and â1. But the rest 
do not, so it is not true that for all x âZ, there exists xâ²âZsuch that 
xxâ²= xâ²x = 1.

matrices under multiplication. h is structure satisf i es closure, because 
multiplying together two 2Ã2 matrices gives another. Matrix multipli- 
cation is associative, which is tedious but straightforward to check. How

this idea in Section 6.5 and Chapter 9.ChatGPTSummary of the Section on Sets that Form Groups:Set 3Z3Z3Z under Addition:The set 3Z={3nâ£nâZ}3Z = \{3n | n \in Z\}3Z={3nâ£nâZ} forms a group under addition. This is proven through the following:Closure: For every x1,x2â3Zx_1, x_2 \in 3Zx1â,x2ââ3Z, their sum lies in 3Z3Z3Z.Associativity: The property is inherently true due to the nature of addition.Identity: The number 0 is the additive identity and belongs to 3Z3Z3Z.Inverses: Every element in 3Z3Z3Z has an additive inverse in 3Z3Z3Z.Written Arguments:Constructing arguments for axioms can begin with naming objects, introducing them, and specifying their properties.The level of detail required in proofs varies depending on the lecturer or course. Some prefer thorough logical detail, while others prioritize conceptual clarity. When unsure, it's advisable to seek feedback.Proving a Non-Group:To prove a set with a binary operation isn't a group, one needs only to demonstrate that it fails even a single group axiom.The integers ZZZ under multiplication don't form a group due to the lack of multiplicative inverses for all elements, except for 1 and -1.2x2 Matrices under Multiplication:Multiplication of two 2x2 matrices results in another 2x2 matrix, satisfying the closure axiom.Matrix multiplication is associative, though verifying this for general 2x2 matrices is a tedious process.The identity for 2x2 matrix multiplication is the identity matrix [1,0;0,1][1, 0; 0, 1][1,0;0,1].However, not all 2x2 matrices possess multiplicative inverses. One classic example is the zero matrix.A potential task would be identifying a subset of 2x2 matrices that forms a group under multiplication, a topic that will be revisited in future sections.This section dives deep into the properties that allow specific sets to form groups under particular operations. By examining various sets and their operations, the section highlights the importance of verifying the axioms to determine whether a structure is indeed a group.2.4 Commutativity and rings 
Section 1.2 introduced commutativity, which is def i ned as below. 
Def i nition: h e binary operation â is commutative on the set S if and 
only if âs1,s2â S, s1âs2= s2âs1. 
Not every binary operation is commutative; matrix multiplication is not, 
for instance. And commutativity is not part of the def i nition of group. It 
might seem unnecessary to say that, and I do not suggest that you would 
forget when asked directly or when stating the def i nition. But it is easy to 
forgetingeneralarguments,becauseeveryoneisaccustomedtoswitching 
around the letters in a+b or ab. 
Of course, there are plenty of groups in which the operation is com- 
mutative, and these are are called abelian af t er the mathematician Niels 
Henrik Abel. 
Def i nition: Agroup(G,â)isabelianifandonlyifiscommutativeonG. 
Addinga criterionreducesthenumberofobjectsthatsatisfyadef i nition; 
there are fewer abelian groups than groups. But many existâsee Chapter 
6âand they have some nice, tidy properties. Abelian groups are also 
pertinent to the def i nition of ring, which appears below.2Can you see 
how? 
2 In some areas of mathematics it makes sense to allow rings that do not have 
multiplicative identities, so you might i nd that some books or your course omit that axiom.ChatGPTSummary of the Section on Commutativity and Rings:Commutativity:A binary operation â\astâ is said to be commutative on a set SSS if, for all elements s1s_1s1â and s2s_2s2â in SSS, the operation satisfies s1âs2=s2âs1s_1 \ast s_2 = s_2 \ast s_1s1ââs2â=s2ââs1â.It's important to note that not all binary operations are commutative. Matrix multiplication is a classic example of a non-commutative operation.Abelian Groups:Although commutativity is not a requirement for a structure to be a group, there are groups where the operation is commutative.Such groups are termed "abelian" in honor of the mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.Formally, a group GGG with operation â\astâ is abelian if â\astâ is commutative on GGG.Abelian Groups and Their Importance:Introducing the criterion of commutativity restricts the number of structures that can be considered groups. Thus, there are fewer abelian groups compared to general groups.However, many abelian groups exist, and they exhibit neat properties that make them noteworthy in the realm of abstract algebra.Relevance to Rings:The section hints at the definition of a ring and its relationship with abelian groups. While the exact definition of a ring isn't provided in the given passage, it's implied that the concept of abelian groups plays a role in defining a ring. Furthermore, there's a note suggesting that some mathematical areas might consider rings without a multiplicative identity, which can vary the definition.This section primarily focuses on the idea of commutativity in groups and introduces the concept of abelian groups. It also alludes to the connection between abelian groups and rings, setting the stage for a deeper dive into the properties and intricacies of rings in abstract algebra.Def i nition: A ring is a set R with two binary operations + and Â· such

ChatGPTSummary of the Ring Definition:A ring is a mathematical structure which consists of a set RRR and two binary operations, addition (+) and multiplication (Â·). For a set RRR with these two operations to be considered a ring, it must satisfy the following properties:Properties related to Addition:Closure under Addition: For all elements aaa and bbb in RRR, their sum a+ba + ba+b is also in RRR.Associativity of Addition: Addition is associative in RRR. This means for any three elements aaa, bbb, and ccc in RRR, the equation (a+b)+c=a+(b+c)(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)(a+b)+c=a+(b+c) holds true.Additive Identity: There exists an element 000 in RRR (often referred to as the additive identity or neutral element) such that for every element aaa in RRR, 0+a=a+0=a0 + a = a + 0 = a0+a=a+0=a.Additive Inverses: For every element aaa in RRR, there exists an element denoted âa-aâa in RRR (called the additive inverse of aaa) such that their sum equals the additive identity, i.e., a+(âa)=(âa)+a=0a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0a+(âa)=(âa)+a=0.Commutativity of Addition: Addition is commutative in RRR. This means for any two elements aaa and bbb in RRR, a+b=b+aa + b = b + aa+b=b+a.Properties related to Multiplication:Closure under Multiplication: For all elements aaa and bbb in RRR, their product aâba \cdot baâb is also in RRR.Associativity of Multiplication: Multiplication is associative in RRR. This means for any three elements aaa, bbb, and ccc in RRR, the equation (aâb)âc=aâ(bâc)(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)(aâb)âc=aâ(bâc) holds true.Multiplicative Identity: There exists an element 111 in RRR (often referred to as the multiplicative identity or neutral element) such that for every element aaa in RRR, 1âa=aâ1=a1 \cdot a = a \cdot 1 = a1âa=aâ1=a.Left Distributivity: The distributive property holds from the left in RRR. This means for any three elements aaa, bbb, and ccc in RRR, aâ(b+c)=aâb+aâca \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot caâ(b+c)=aâb+aâc.Right Distributivity: The distributive property holds from the right in RRR. This means for any three elements aaa, bbb, and ccc in RRR, (a+b)âc=aâc+bâc(a + b) \cdot c = a \cdot c + b \cdot c(a+b)âc=aâc+bâc.The definition of a ring might appear intimidating due to the number of axioms it encompasses. However, by breaking down the definition into these subsets related to the operations of addition and multiplication, it becomes more digestible. It's noteworthy that the first five properties essentially stipulate that the set RRR, under the operation of addition, must be an abelian group. This realization can help in simplifying the understanding of the ring's structure.It raises questions, though. Why does addition have to be commutative 
when multiplication does not? Why do additive inverses have to exist 
when multiplicative ones do not? h at seems a bit arbitrary, no? Of 
course, mathematicians construct def i nitions for good reasons, so you 
should always assume that there is one, even if you do not yet know it. 
Rings will be discussed in Chapter 9, and it might be useful to know 
that the canonical example of a ring isZwith the usual addition and 
multiplication. 
Closure under addition âx,y âZ, x+y âZ; 
Associativity of addition âx,y,z âZ, (x+y)+z = x+(y+z);

h epsychologicalissuemightnowmakemoresensetoo.Fortheintegers, 
theseaxiomscanbeunderstoodasassumptions,asthingsthatweallagree 
are true. We need such assumptions because no one could âcheckâ that 
they hold for all integers; we have to take them for granted. h ey can 
thus be conceptualized as specifying what the integers are by specifying 
how they behave. If that seems weird, there is no need to worryâyou 
will understand this book if you think of the integers as familiar and the 
axiomsasassumptionsthatcapturetheirproperties.Butthisaccountsfor 
the feeling that establishing that the integers form a group or ring is not 
really âprovingâ anything.ChatGPTIndeed, the very questions you've raised touch on foundational elements of abstract algebra. The definitions of structures like groups, rings, and fields have been formulated over time to capture specific properties and behaviors that mathematicians have found useful or interesting in their study of mathematical systems.To address your specific questions:Why is addition commutative but multiplication not necessarily?The choice to define rings in this way is based on many mathematical structures we observe naturally. For instance, integer addition is always commutative, but as you move into matrices or other complex structures, multiplication does not always maintain that property. By not mandating commutativity for multiplication in the basic definition of a ring, mathematicians allow for a wider range of mathematical systems to be studied under this framework.Why must additive inverses exist, but not multiplicative ones?Again, this comes down to the types of structures mathematicians found useful to study. In the case of rings, the structure captures systems like the integers, where every integer has an additive inverse, but not every integer (except 1 and -1) has a multiplicative inverse. If we move to fields (another algebraic structure), multiplicative inverses are required for all non-zero elements.The integers, Z\mathbb{Z}Z, are indeed a canonical example of a ring. They satisfy all the ring axioms under normal addition and multiplication. However, they serve more than just an illustrative purpose; they form a foundational building block of number theory and algebra.Your intuition about the axioms being assumptions for the integers is spot on. These axioms encapsulate the behaviors we observe and take for granted with the integers. In a way, they serve as a formal way of describing the properties of the integers that we're familiar with. As we move into more abstract mathematical structures, these axioms provide a foundation for generalizing our understanding and drawing parallels between different systems.In essence, while proving that the integers form a ring might seem like a reiteration of the obvious, it's a crucial step in ensuring our foundational understanding of more complex algebraic structures.2.5 Mathematical objects and notation 
You might have noticed that mathematical objects are subject to nota- 
tionalconventions.Setsareusuallydenotedbyupper-caseletters.Groups 
are of t en based on sets called G; a second group might be based on a set 
called H. Subgroups, in particular, might be based on sets called H, or 
sometimesNorKfornormal subgroupsorthekernelsofhomomorphisms 
(see Chapters 7 and 8). Rings are of t en based on sets called R. 
Elements of sets or groups are usually denoted by lower-case letters. 
Group elements might be called g and h, or g1and g2, or g and gâ², or 
a and b, according to a writerâs preferences and what works for a given 
argument. If an argument involves both a group G and a subgroup H, it 
might be confusing to use g and h for elements of G; g1and g2might be 
better. 
Operation notation also varies. A general operation might be denoted 
by âââ, but that tends to disappear once Abstract Algebra gets going, 
for two reasons. First, specif i c operations of t en come with notation: 
â+â for addition, âÃâ or âÂ·â or juxtaposition for multiplication, ââ¦â 
for function composition. Second, Abstract Algebra involves theory 
building, constructing general proofs that apply to all groups or all rings. 
For rings, the two operations are closely linked to standard addition 
and multiplication so they are usually denoted by â+â and either âÂ·â 
or juxtaposition. For groups, there is more variety, which demands 
notational decisions. To write about all groups, we want notation that 
doesnotmisleadusintothinkingaboutspecif i coperations;âââisgoodfor 
that. But mathematicians also value brevity, and dislike writing âââ all the 
time (my handwritten stars always come out wonky, which is annoying). 
So general statements and arguments tend to be written in multiplicative 
notation using juxtaposition. With juxtaposition, the group def i nition 
looks like this. 
Def i nition: A group is a set G with a binary operation such that: 
Closure âg1,g2â G, g1g2â G; 
Associativity âg1,g2,g3â G, (g1g2)g3= g1(g2g3); 
Identity âe â G such that âg â G, eg = ge = g; 
Inverses âg â G, âgâ1â G such that ggâ1= gâ1g = e.ChatGPTThis section delves into the nuances and conventions of mathematical notation in the realm of abstract algebra, which indeed plays a pivotal role in the understanding and communication of mathematical concepts.Notation is a symbolic language that mathematicians use to communicate mathematical ideas clearly and succinctly. Properly used, notation can elucidate complex concepts, streamline proofs, and facilitate collaboration between mathematicians from different backgrounds.Sets and Elements:Sets are usually denoted with uppercase letters like A,B,G,HA, B, G, HA,B,G,H.Elements of these sets are often denoted with lowercase letters such as a,b,g,ha, b, g, ha,b,g,h.Groups and Operations:Groups are frequently denoted by G,HG, HG,H, and their elements by lowercase letters like g,hg, hg,h.A general binary operation is often denoted by â\astâ but can also be denoted by other symbols based on the context.When it comes to the actual operations, addition is usually represented by +++, multiplication by Ã,â,\times, \cdot,Ã,â, or simply juxtaposition, and function composition by â\circâ.The identity element is often denoted by eee or 111 based on whether the group is considered in additive or multiplicative notation.Groups vs. Rings:For rings, since they involve two operations (addition and multiplication), the notation becomes somewhat standardized with +++ and â\cdotâ.For groups, the binary operation can be more varied, leading to notational choices. For instance, the operation might be matrix multiplication, function composition, or some other custom operation.Brevity in Notation:Mathematicians often opt for succinctness. This is why you'll see multiplication in groups typically denoted by juxtaposition (placing elements next to each other) instead of continually writing out â\astâ.The importance of understanding these notational conventions can't be understated. It allows mathematicians to read, write, and communicate mathematical ideas fluently. As with any language, the more one practices and gets acquainted with it, the easier it becomes to understand and convey complex mathematical concepts.Juxtaposition is economical, and its link to multiplication makes gâ1 
a natural notation for the inverse of g. Using it requires care, though: 
in an additive group, the operation is still addition, even if this is not 
explicit.Implicitoperationsalsocontributetoeconomyinspeech;people 
of t en speak about âa group Gâ with no reference to the operation. h is is 
perfectly acceptable, in the same way that using âifâ instead of âif and only 
ifâ in def i nitions is acceptable. But it can be ill-advised in a novice. If in 
doubt, specify the operation. 
Now, these conventions probably seem familiar, or at least sensible. I 
highlight them because things do get more complex in Abstract Alge- 
bra, and because the subject rewards care in tracking object types. For 
instance, recall the def i nition of lef t coset. 
Def i nition: Suppose that H is a subgroup of G. h en the lef t coset of H 
containing a is aH = {ah|h â H}. 
For an additive group, this def i nition could be written as below. Check 
that nothing has changed except the operation notation. 
Def i nition: SupposethatHisasubgroupof(anadditivegroup)G.T h en 
the lef t coset of H containing a is a+H = {a+h|h â H}. 
In these def i nitions, aH looks like a product and a+H looks like a sum. 
But they are not products or sums of two elements; they are products or 
sumsof an element and a set.Whatkindofobject is aH ora+H?A coset 
isdef i nedasaset,butweshouldbeopentothepossibilitythatasetcould 
be empty or contain just one element. 
We can grasp the meaning by considering the additive group 
G = (Z,+), the element a = 1, and the subgroup H = (3Z,+). h is 
set-up gives 
a+H = 1+3Z= {1+h|h â 3Z} = {1+3n|n âZ} 
= {...,â5,â2,1,4,7, ...}.

What is the lef t coset containing a = 2? How many distinct cosets are 
there of (3Z,+) in (Z,+)? How many cosets would there be of the 
subgroup (6Z,+) in (Z,+)? Cosets and their important place in theory 
are discussed in Chapter 7. 
To reiterate, I comment on notation not because it is, in itself, dif i cult 
orcounterintuitive.Notationisalwayssetupsensibly.But,formeaningful 
understanding, it is important to notice what objects appear in math- 
ematical sentences. Probably the most useful advice anyone3gave me 
about studying Abstract Algebra was that when reading a mathematical 
sentence, it is a good idea to stop at every object and ask what kind of 
object is that? Reminders to do that appear throughout this book.ChatGPTThe passage sheds light on the nuances of mathematical notation and the importance of being meticulous when working within the realm of abstract algebra. Here are the primary takeaways:Juxtaposition and Implicit Operations:Juxtaposition, where the operation is implied by placing elements next to each other, is efficient and linked to multiplication.In additive groups, the operation is addition even when not explicitly stated. There is a risk of ambiguity or confusion if this is not understood, especially for those new to abstract algebra.Cosets:A coset (either left or right) is the set of products/sums of an element with each element of a subgroup.The notation aHaHaH or a+Ha+Ha+H might look like a simple multiplication or addition, but they represent a set of products or sums.A coset is defined as a set. Even though it's a set, it can have just one element or might even be empty.The passage provides an example using the additive group G=(Z,+)G = (Z,+)G=(Z,+) to illustrate the concept of cosets.The Significance of Notation:Notation in abstract algebra can become intricate. However, it's not the notation itself that is challenging but the underlying concepts it represents.For a robust understanding of mathematical concepts, one should always be aware of the nature of the mathematical objects being used. Recognizing whether an object is a set, an element, a function, etc., is crucial.A valuable piece of advice for those studying abstract algebra is to pause and comprehend the kind of object every symbol or term in a mathematical sentence represents.In conclusion, the world of abstract algebra, like many areas of advanced mathematics, demands precision, clarity, and a deep understanding of the symbols and notations used. Comprehending the nature of each mathematical object, its properties, and the relationships among them is essential for gaining a robust understanding of the subject.This chapter discusses theorems and proofs in mathematical theories and 
in undergraduate study. It considers deductions in proofs involving algebra, 
matrices, modular arithmetic and equivalence relations. It then discusses 
logic in theorem structures, drawing attention to quantif i ers and conditional 
statements. Its later sections explain how to read proofs effectively, and offer 
advice on constructing proofs. 
3.1 Theorems and proofs in Abstract Algebra 
F 
irst things i rst: if you l ipped straight to this chapter because 
you are struggling with theorems and proofs in Abstract Algebra, 
please start with Chapter 2. People of t en work on theorems and 
proofs without fully understanding the underlying axioms and def i ni- 
tions, which makes everything more dif i cult. If you have read Chapter 2, 
you will know that I think of mathematical theories as in the diagram 
below, where the âbottomâ layer contains axioms and def i nitions. h eo- 
rems are proved from these axioms and def i nitions; they are the âresultsâ 
of the deductive science that is mathematics. 
But what does it mean to prove theorems or to say that mathematics 
is deductive? A deductive argument is one in which the conclusion is 
a necessary consequence of the premises (also called assumptions or 
hypotheses). You might not have thought of mathematics this way, but 
you are nevertheless accustomed to deductive reasoning. h e algebraic 
step from â(xâ2)(xâ5) = 0â to âx = 2 or x = 5â is a deduction: if the 
THEOREMS AND PROOFS IN ABSTRACT ALGEBRA
premise that (xâ2)(xâ5) = 0 is true, it necessarily follows that x = 2 
or x = 5. A proof chains such deductions together: each step introduces 
relevant objects or can be justif i ed using axioms, def i nitions and earlier 
results. Proofs can be long and complicated, but they can also be short 
and simple, like this. 
Theorem: Suppose that x2â7x+10 = 0. h en x = 2 or x = 5. 
Proof:x2â7x+10 = 0 
â (xâ2)(xâ5) = 0. 
So x = 2 or x = 5. 
h ismeansthatyouhavebeenâdoingâtheoremsandproofsforsometime, 
even if they havenât been labelled as such. And while specif i c results like 
this might be called âclaimsâ rather than theorems, you have seen general 
theorems too. For instance, you have used Pythagorasâ h eorem, maybe 
the binomial theorem and, if you have studied complex numbers, maybe 
De Moivreâs h eorem. 
However, before undergraduate mathematicsâor before upper-level 
courses in US-like systemsâgeneral theorems crop up only occasionally. 
Students might be expected to engage with the corresponding proofs and
perhaps reconstruct them in tests. But they might be expected simply to 
use the theorems in calculations. Where students do have responsibility 
for proofs, this of t en involves proofs of specif i c types such as proof by 
induction. Such experience can mean that theorems and proofs seem 
like part of mathematics, but a smallish and relatively unimportant part. 
Before university, students expend more ef f ort in a mathematical âplaneâ 
where their primary responsibility is solving problems by doing calcu- 
lations. h ey might sometimes be expected to invoke the theorems and 
proofsthatunderliethecalculations,butthesestaymostlybelowthelevel 
of attention. 
calculationsattention

and proofs 
Undergraduate pure mathematics reverses this: calculations become a 
more minor part of the work, and student attention should be mostly on 
theorems and proofs.

and proofs 
It is important to understand this because probably no one will say itâto 
mathematicians, it is just obvious that subjects like Abstract Algebra are 
about theory. And because no one says it, students can be baf l ed. h ey 
expect to be taught problem solving and calculations, and feel let down by lecturers who spend little time on those and much more on theorems 
and proofs. 
In fact, the gap between what students expect and what pure mathe- 
maticians do is smaller than it appears: much of the apparent disconnect 
is pedagogical rather than intellectual. Pure mathematicians do solve 
problems, but they do it in the theory plane, working out how to use 
axioms and def i nitions to prove theorems. And they do not usually start 
with axioms and def i nitions and work up. h e reality is a messier pro- 
cess of formulating def i nitions and theorems, tightening up def i nitions 
when people use words in slightly dif f erent ways, adding conditions 
when theorems turn out to apply only for some cases, and occasionally 
reformulatingthewholelotwhensomeonenoticesthatadif f erentcentral 
concept would permit more elegant proofs. Af t er a whileâwhere a while 
might be hundreds of yearsâthings settle down enough for everyone to 
agree about key def i nitions and important theorems and proofs. 
h e resulting theory is taught to students. And teaching does usually 
start with axioms and def i nitions and work up. h is makes logical sense, 
but it means that the psychological experience for students learning a 
mathematical theory is quite dif f erent from that of the mathematicians 
who developed it. Students do not get a say in formulations: they must 
accept standard axioms and def i nitions, and study existing theorems and 
proofs. h is can be uncomfortable, especially for students who want to 
understand why everything is the way it isâfor them, it can seem that 
def i nitionsandtheoremscomeoutofnowhereinawaythatismysterious 
and therefore annoying. But it is also dif i cult for dutiful students who 
are willing to take a lecturerâs wordâa typical course goes fast, and it 
takesalotofworktounderstandthereasoningpackedintotheoremsand 
proofs. I say that not to be discouragingâquite the reverse. I want you to 
be comfortable with the idea that there is much to do. 
I also want you to understand that when mathematicians state 
even short and simple theorems, they have in mind a wealth of related 
examples and reasoning. Much of Part 2 is designed to provide you with 
access to something similar: it contains detailed discussions of specif i c 
groups and rings, and explains why key concepts are formulated as they 
are. h e present chapter contributes in a dif f erent way: it focuses on understanding theorems and proofs as they might be presented in a 
standardlecturecourse,withcommentsattheendonconstructingproofs 
foryourself.Somemathematicianswouldquerythatapproachâalthough 
they teach pre-existing theory, they really want students to master proof 
construction. But the reality is that most students do a lot of learning 
from lecture notes and books, and need to know how to interpret these 
accurately and meaningfully. Accurate and meaningful understanding 
requires a good grasp of logic, so this chapter proceeds with that.
ChatGPTThis passage highlights the shift in focus and understanding that takes place as students transition from pre-university mathematics to undergraduate pure mathematics, especially within the context of theorems and proofs.Here are the key points:Importance of Foundations:Before delving into theorems and proofs, one must have a solid understanding of the axioms and definitions upon which the theorems are built.A solid foundation makes it easier to understand and engage with the theorems and their corresponding proofs.Nature of Mathematics:Mathematics is fundamentally deductive. That means conclusions are drawn from premises, or hypotheses, in a way that if the premises are true, then the conclusions are necessarily true.Theorems chain deductions together, starting from axioms or earlier proven results.Shift in Focus:Before university, students often focus primarily on calculations and problem-solving. They might occasionally interact with theorems and proofs, but this interaction is generally limited.However, in undergraduate pure mathematics, the focus shifts to understanding theorems and their proofs. Calculations become secondary.Disconnection Between Student Expectations and Reality:Students often come into university courses expecting to solve problems and perform calculations, similar to their pre-university experience. This can lead to a disconnect when they are instead introduced to abstract concepts and proofs.The passage stresses that the development of mathematical theories is a dynamic and iterative process that takes years or even centuries to solidify. The resulting theories are then presented in a structured manner to students, starting with axioms and definitions.Learning Theorems and Proofs:Learning theorems and their proofs can be challenging, especially when students are trying to understand the logic and reasoning behind them.Students must often accept standard axioms and definitions and study pre-existing theorems and proofs.However, this process equips students with a deeper understanding of mathematics and its underlying structures.Approach to Learning:The passage emphasizes that students should not only focus on constructing proofs but also on how to interpret and understand theorems and proofs as presented in lectures or textbooks.A meaningful understanding of theorems and proofs requires a strong grasp of logic.In essence, the passage underscores the importance of theorems and proofs in the realm of undergraduate pure mathematics. It aims to prepare students for the shift in focus and encourages them to engage deeply with the material to develop a comprehensive understanding of the subject.3.2 Logic in familiar algebra 
h is section reviews some familiar algebra with a focus on its underlying 
logic.Youmightreaditandthink,yeah,Iknowallthat.Butmanyreaders 
will recognize that while they âknowâ it in the sense that they could act 
accordingly, they have not systematically ref l ected upon this knowledge. 
h is review will build on the discussion in Section 1.2, considering logic 
in algebra in relation to numbers and matrices. 
First, consider equation solving. What would you say it means to solve 
anequation?Canyougetbeyondâf i ndingxâ?Maybethinkabouthowyou 
would explain equation solving to a young student who is intelligent but 
has not yet studied equations. What would you say? I will ask again later. 
Perhaps the simplest equations take forms as in Section 1.3: x+a = b 
or ax = b. If these seem trivial, that is due to your extensive knowledge. 
For young children, the world of numbers is smaller than it is for you, 
and the equations x+5 = 2 and 5x = 2 have no solutions. For you, they 
dohavesolutionsbecauseyouknowaboutnegativeandrationalnumbers. 
In Abstract Algebra, we do not revert to the earlier position, but nor do 
we assume that all numbers are always fair gameâwe are careful about 
sets.Intheintegers,5x = 2hasnosolution.Intherealnumbers,x2= â5 
has no solution. 
As discussed in Section 1.3, to guarantee that all equations of the form 
x+a = b can be solved requires that the manipulations below are valid. 
So it requires a set that is closed under addition and that has associative 
addition, an additive identity and additive inverses. In short, it requires 
an additive group.
x+a = b 
â (x+a)+(âa) = b+(âa) (adding âa to both sides) 
â x+(a+(âa)) = b+(âa) (reordering operations using associativity) 
âx+0 = b+(âa) (using a+(âa) = 0) 
âx = b+(âa) (using x+0 = x). 
To guarantee that all equations of the form ax = b can be solved requires 
that the manipulations below are valid. So it requires a set that is closed 
undermultiplicationandthathasassociativemultiplication,amultiplica- 
tive identity and multiplicative inverses. In short, it requires a multiplica- 
tive group. ax = b 
â (aâ1)(ax) = aâ1b (multiplying both sides by aâ1) 
â(aâ1a)x = aâ1b (reordering operations using associativity) 
â1x = aâ1b (using aâ1a = 1) 
âx = aâ1b (using 1x = x). 
Now,theequationsx+a = bandax = beachinvolvejustoneoperation. 
But algebra of t en involves addition and multiplication together. h e real 
numbers, for instance, have both operations and many useful properties. 
h ey are closed under addition and under multiplication. Both addition 
and multiplication are associative. h ere is an additive identity 0, and 
every element a âRhas additive inverse âa âR. h ere is also a mul- 
tiplicative identity 1, although multiplicative inverses are not quite so 
tidy: almost every a âRhas a multiplicative inverse aâ1âR, but the 
additive identity 0 does not. Because of this, some simple equations have 
no solutions: when 0 appears in the multiplicative equation ax = b, this 
equation cannot always be solved for x. h e equation ax = 0 is mostly 
i ne if uninteresting: provided a Ì¸= 0, multiplying both sides by aâ1gives 
x = 0. h e equation 0x = b is mostly not i ne: it cannot be solved for x 
unless b = 0. In that case, it reads 0x = 0, which can be solved but not in 
the sense of i nding âtheâ x: the solution set is the whole ofR. ChatGPTThis section focuses on the logical underpinnings of familiar algebraic concepts. Let's break down the main points:Revisiting Known Knowledge: It reminds readers that even though they might be familiar with certain algebraic concepts, it's beneficial to reflect upon the underlying logic of these concepts.Meaning of Equation Solving: This section encourages the reader to think deeply about the concept of solving equations, beyond just 'finding x'. It prompts the reader to consider how they would explain the concept to someone unfamiliar with it.Number Sets: Different number sets (integers, real numbers, etc.) determine the solutions available for specific equations. For example:In the set of integers, the equation 5x=25x = 25x=2 has no solution.In the set of real numbers, x2=â5x^2 = -5x2=â5 has no solution.Requirements for Equation Solving:To guarantee solutions for equations of the form x+a=bx + a = bx+a=b, you need an additive group. This is a set with specific properties related to addition: closure under addition, associative addition, an additive identity, and additive inverses.Similarly, to ensure solutions for equations of the form ax=bax = bax=b, a multiplicative group is required. This group should be closed under multiplication, have associative multiplication, a multiplicative identity, and multiplicative inverses.Combination of Addition and Multiplication: While some equations deal with just one operation, real-world algebra often involves both addition and multiplication. The real numbers, for instance, offer a framework where both operations coexist harmoniously, albeit with some exceptions. For example, while every non-zero real number has a multiplicative inverse, the additive identity, 0, does not.Special Cases with Zero: The section concludes with a discussion of special cases involving the number 0 in multiplication. Specifically:ax=0ax = 0ax=0 has a straightforward solution for all aaa not equal to 0.0x=b0x = b0x=b does not have a unique solution unless b=0b = 0b=0. If b=0b = 0b=0, any real number can be a solution.The overall emphasis is on understanding the logical framework that supports algebraic operations and the importance of the number set in determining possible solutions. This deepens the reader's understanding and provides a foundation for further study in abstract algebra.Multiplicative equations involving zero can sometimes be solved using 
not inverses but the zero product property. h is property was used
implicitlyintheprevioussectiontodeducethatif(xâ2)(xâ5) = 0then 
xâ2 = 0 or xâ5 = 0. h e logic is important, as can be seen by 
considering this pair of conditional statements. 
If ab = 0 then a = 0 or b = 0. 
If a = 0 or b = 0 then ab = 0. 
h e i rst statement is the zero product property: it says that if a product 
is zero, one of its factors must be zero. h e second, its converse, is the 
statement that âanything times zero is zeroâ. Do these seem obviously dif- 
ferent?T h edistinctioncanbehardtokeepstraight,fortworeasons.First,

statement is true and the other is false. For 2Ã2 matrices, it is not true 
that if ab = 0 then a = 0 or b = 0. For instance, neither

Formally, matrix multiplication admits zero divisors, nonzero elements 
that multiply to zero. But it is still true that if a or b is the zero matrix, 
then ab must be the zero matrix.2 
Another way to clarify the logic of conditional statements is to write in 
an abbreviated way using symbols (look at the implication arrows).

2 You might have been told that matrices should always be denoted by upper-case 
letters. h at is a sensible way to distinguish object types, but Abstract Algebra involves 
reasoning about multiple structures, and no notation matches them all. h at said, in 
specif i c contexts it is easier to use familiar notation, and we could write âif A = 0 or 
B = 0 then AB = 0â.ChatGPTThe discussion is delving deeper into the intricacies of the zero product property, a key concept in algebra, especially when understanding polynomial equations. Let's break it down:Zero Product Property:This property is succinctly stated as: "If ab=0ab = 0ab=0, then a=0a = 0a=0 or b=0b = 0b=0".It is used, for example, to deduce that if (xâ2)(xâ5)=0(xâ2)(xâ5) = 0(xâ2)(xâ5)=0, then xâ2=0xâ2 = 0xâ2=0 or xâ5=0xâ5 = 0xâ5=0.Converse Statement:The converse of the zero product property is: "If a=0a = 0a=0 or b=0b = 0b=0, then ab=0ab = 0ab=0".In essence, this statement reflects a basic arithmetic rule: anything multiplied by zero equals zero.Differentiating Between the Two:The two statements can be confused because they seem related and because both are true for real numbers. But they convey different information.The first statement is about inferring the factors from the product, and the second is about inferring the product from the factors.2x2 Matrices - An Exception:For 2x2 matrices, the zero product property doesn't hold in the same way it does for real numbers. As an example, two non-zero matrices are shown to multiply to give the zero matrix.This demonstrates the concept of zero divisors in matrix multiplication. A zero divisor is a non-zero element that, when multiplied with another non-zero element, results in a zero product.Implication Arrows:The text hints at a more symbolic or formal representation of these statements using implication arrows. This provides a more compact way to express conditional statements, especially in logic and higher-level mathematics.Footnotes:The first footnote suggests a further reading for understanding the complexities of the word "if" in everyday vs. logical use.The second footnote touches on the convention of denoting matrices. While it is common to use uppercase letters to denote matrices, there's flexibility in notations, especially in abstract algebra.In summary, while the zero product property is straightforward for real numbers, its behavior changes in the world of matrices. This discussion emphasizes the importance of understanding the logic behind mathematical properties and how they can vary across different mathematical structures.ab = 0 â a = 0 or b = 0. 
ab = 0 â a = 0 or b = 0. 
Either way, in logical language, precision matters. Can you see that the 
three statements below are logically equivalent? For most people, the last 
requires some thought. 
ab = 0 â a = 0 or b = 0. 
If ab = 0 then a = 0 or b = 0. 
ab = 0 only if a = 0 or b = 0. 
Precision also matters in equation solving, at least in some contexts. Did 
you notice that the earlier equations were written x+a = b (x i rst) but 
ax = b(xsecond)?Iswitchedformultiplicationbecausethelattersounds 
more naturalâwe usually write 2x or 0x, not x2 or x0. But the ensuing 
arguments then involved adding the additive inverse on the right but 
multiplying by the multiplicative inverse on the lef t (they are reproduced 
belowsothatyoucancheck).Doesthismatter?Doesitmakeasubstantive 
dif f erence for real numbers or for 2Ã2 matrices, or is it just convenient 
to arrive at (aaâ1)x rather than (ax)aâ1? 
x+a = b 
â (x+a)+(âa) = b+(âa) (adding âa to both sides) 
â x+(a+(âa)) = b+(âa) (reordering operations using associativity) 
âx+0 = b+(âa) (using a+(âa) = 0) 
âx = b+(âa) (using x+0 = x). 
ax = b 
â (aâ1)(ax) = aâ1b (multiplying both sides by aâ1) 
â(aâ1a)x = aâ1b (reordering operations using associativity) 
â1x = aâ1b (using aâ1a = 1) 
âx = aâ1b (using 1x = x). 
It does matter, due to commutativity. For real numbers and 2Ã2 matri- 
ces, addition is commutative. So, for the additive argument, the order is just convenient: an expression like (âa)+x+a could be tidied up with 
valid algebraic steps. But for matrices, multiplication is not commutative. 
So, while associativity means that (ax)aâ1= a(xaâ1), the x and the aâ1 
could not then be swapped to give a(aâ1x). 
Now, it takes discipline to remember that tempting algebraic steps 
might not work on the lef t or right, or for zero, or for various other 
elements. h is can make equation solving seem complicated. In fact, 
though, Abstract Algebra usually involves minimal equation solvingâ 
people tend instead to prove general claims. I am not sure whether this 
makes studentsâ lives easier or harder. On the one hand, you do not get 
the disheartening experience of equation-solving mistakes. On the other, 
you do not get the practice that might make it natural to avoid tempting 
steps in general proofs. Certainly care is required over algebraic steps in 
proofs like those appearing later in this chapter. 
With that in mind, back to the earlier question: what does it mean 
to solve an equation? Would you now change your response? I ask not 
because there is a âright answerâ, but to encourage you to ref l ect on your 
understanding and improve its accuracy. For instance, when describing 
equation solving, people of t en say things like âchange sides, change signsâ. 
But, really, nothing changes sides or signsâeach algebraic step does the 
same thing to both sides. In terms appropriate to Abstract Algebra, we 
might say that solving an equation involves making deductions that are 
valid for the relevant sets and operations in order to reveal the solutions. 

And what is valid is not universal, which will become increasingly clear 
as you gain experience with groups and rings.

For instance, zero divisors 
like those seen for matrices also exist in modular arithmetic.ChatGPTThe provided text delves deep into the realm of abstract algebra and emphasizes the importance of precision in mathematical language and reasoning.Let's summarize the key points:Equivalence of Statements:The text lists three statements that, in essence, mean the same thing:ab=0ab = 0ab=0 implies a=0a = 0a=0 or b=0b = 0b=0If ab=0ab = 0ab=0, then a=0a = 0a=0 or b=0b = 0b=0ab=0ab = 0ab=0 only if a=0a = 0a=0 or b=0b = 0b=0
These might sound different in natural language, but logically, they're equivalent.Precision in Equation Solving:The discussion touches on the intricacies of equation-solving, such as the ordering of terms and operations. It stresses the importance of precision in notation and procedure, especially since abstract algebra often deals with structures (like matrices) where traditional arithmetic properties may not hold.Commutativity:The order of operations matters, especially with matrices. While addition is commutative for both real numbers and matrices, multiplication isn't for matrices. This has implications for equation solving, as certain algebraic steps valid for real numbers might not work for matrices.Algebra in Abstract Algebra:Abstract Algebra requires a different kind of thinking. It emphasizes general claims and proofs over routine equation-solving. Thus, it's important to approach problems with caution, being wary of making intuitive but incorrect steps.Redefining Equation Solving:The text poses an introspective question: "What does it mean to solve an equation?" The traditional heuristic methods like 'change sides, change signs' may not always apply. In abstract algebra, equation solving is more about deducing valid operations for the given structures.Validity is Not Universal:The principles that hold true for one mathematical structure might not for another. For instance, while the zero product property holds for real numbers, it doesn't necessarily for 2x2 matrices or in modular arithmetic.This discussion serves as a primer on the intricate nuances of mathematical reasoning in abstract algebra. It underscores the importance of precision, understanding the properties of mathematical structures, and remaining wary of intuitive but potentially misleading shortcuts.3.3 Modular arithmetic 
Modular arithmetic is more ânumericalâ than matrix arithmetic, but it 
raises similar issues about algebraic structures. And you already know 
about modular arithmeticâeven if you have never heard of itâbecause 
you know about clocks. On much of a clock, arithmetic works as usual. 
Forinstance,3oâclockplus5hoursis8oâclock;informally,wemightwrite 
3+5 = 8.Elsewhere,arithmeticworksbyâgoingoverâthe12andstarting 
again at 1. For instance, 9 oâclock plus 5 hours is 2 oâclock. 
MODULAR ARITHMETIC39

+5 
Writing â9+5 = 2â would probably feel wrong, though, even if you can 
see it as âtrueâ in this structure. So, because this is not âstandardâ addition, 
it has a dif f erent name: +12(addition modulo 12). With this notation, 
3+125 = 8 and 9+125 = 2. 
Now, +12is an operation on a set with just 12 elements, so its ef f ects can 
be fully captured in a table as below. 
+12123456789101112 
1234567891011121 
2345678910111212...

In this structure, equations can be solved: for instance, x+1210 = 4 has 
solutionx = 6(checkagainstthetableandaclock).Indeed,thisstructure 
is a group. It can be denoted by (Z12,+12), and relating (Z12,+12) to the 
additive group of integers (Z,+) can build intuition for more advanced 
concepts in Abstract Algebra. 
For instance, we need not lose the idea that 9+5 âreallyâ equals 
14. Instead, we can say that 14 is congruent to 2 modulo 12, writing 
14 â¡ 2(mod 12). So the sum 
9+5 = 14 â¡ 2(mod 12) 
captures familiar knowledge: 14.00 is 2pm. But, mathematically, we need 
not be constrained by the clock: it is also true that 26 â¡ 2(mod 12), that 
38 â¡ 2(mod 12), and so on. You might i nd it useful to imagine a bendy 
integer number line wrapped around a circle so that numbers congruent 
to one another all line up. Notice that this works for negative numbers 
too: â10 â¡ 2(mod 12), â22 â¡ 2(mod 12) and so on.

h e relation âcongruence modulo 12â thus distributes the integers into 
disjoint congruence classes (âdisjointâ means ânot overlappingâ). Here are 
three congruence classesâwhat are the others? 
{...,â24,â12,0,12,24, ...} 
{...,â23,â11,1,13,25, ...} 
{...,â22,â10,2,14,26, ...} 
An integerâs congruence class modulo 12 depends on its remainder on 
division by 12. For instance, 14 â¡ 2(mod 12) because dividing 14 by 12 
leavesremainder2.Forthisspecif i ccaseandageneralone,wecancapture the relationship using the symbols âââ (âif and only ifâ or â(which) is 
equivalent toâ) and âââ (âthere existsâ). 
14 â¡ 2(mod 12) â ân âZsuch that 14 = 2+12n; 
x â¡ a(mod 12) â ân âZsuch that x = a+12n. 
We can thus relate congruence classes to addition modulo 12 via the 
theorem and proof below. Read both carefully. 
Theorem: Suppose that x â¡ a(mod 12) and y â¡ b(mod 12). 
h en x+y â¡ (a+b)(mod 12). 
Proof: Suppose that x â¡ a(mod 12) so ân1âZsuch that x = a+12n1 
andy â¡ b(mod 12) so ân2âZsuch that y = b+12n2. 
h enx+y = (a+12n1)+(b+12n2) 
= a+(12n1+b)+12n2(by associativity) 
= a+(b+12n1)+12n2(by commutativity) 
= (a+b)+12(n1+n2)(by associativity) 
â¡ (a+b)(mod 12)(by def i nition). 
h is proof might be longer than some that you have encountered, but 
its steps are not especially clever. h ey convert the premises about con- 
gruences into information about number forms, then add those number 
formsandrearrangeeverythinginvalidwaystoarriveattheconclusion.If 
you wrote out the theorem and covered up the proof, you could probably 
reconstruct it. I recommend trying that. 
h e theorem isnât surprising, either: it says that adding a number 
congruent to a modulo 12 to one congruent to b modulo 12 always 
gives one congruent to (a+b) modulo 12. h is is algebraically tidy, and 
familiar from clocks: any representation of 9 oâclock (09.00 or 21.00) 
plus i ve hours is always 2 oâclock (14.00 or 02.00). Generalizing, any 
representationof9oâclockplusanynumberofhoursfromthecongruence class containing 5 (5 plus some number of 12s) is 2 oâclock. Why, 
exactly? And how does reasoning about a clock relate to the theorem 
and proof? 
Mathematicians capture this theoremâs result by saying that addition 
modulo 12 is well def i ned. h is is what makes 9+125 = 2 meaningful: 
each 9 in the table for +12can be viewed as representing the con- 
gruence class {...,â15,â3,9,21,33, ...}, and each 5 as representing 
{...,â19,â7,5,17,29, ...}. Adding any element from each always gives 
an element of {...,â22,â10,2,14,26, ...}. h at might seem unexciting, 
thoughâwhenthereispre-existingintuition,itcanbehardtoseehowan 
operationcouldfailtobewelldef i ned.Withlessintuitionitisof t eneasier, 
so here it might be useful to consider multiplication. We do not tend to 
multiply on clocks, but we can. For instance, 4Ã5 = 20 â¡ 8 (mod 12) so 
4Ã125 = 8. +5

I think it is less obvious that multiplication is well def i ned. Does multi- 
plying something from the congruence class containing 4 by something 
from the congruence class containing 5 always give something from the 
congruence class containing 8? Why? Work this out with clocks, then 
relate that reasoning to the theorem and proof below. Note that the 
proofuses distributivity ofmultiplicationoveraddition,theproperty that 
x(y+z) = xy+xz. Where Theorem: Suppose that x â¡ a(mod 12) and y â¡ b(mod 12).

Two numbers are congruent mod 12 if their difference is divisible by 12.A bendy integer number line is presented as a mental visualization tool for understanding congruence.The integers are partitioned into disjoint congruence classes. Each class contains numbers that are congruent to each other modulo 12.Theorem and Proof for Addition in Modular Arithmetic:A theorem is presented stating that the sum of two numbers congruent modulo 12 is congruent to the sum of their remainders modulo 12.A proof is provided, working through the steps algebraically.Multiplication in Modular Arithmetic:The text introduces the idea of multiplication in modular arithmetic. It's noted that while we often don't multiply on clocks, we can.A theorem about multiplication is presented, stating that the product of two numbers congruent modulo 12 is congruent to the product of their remainders modulo 12.A proof is provided, highlighting the use of the distributive property of multiplication over addition.Zero Divisors:The text touches on a specific property in modular arithmetic, namely that multiplication modulo 12 does not always allow solutions to every equation.For instance, no multiple of 9 is congruent to 1 mod 12. This leads to the idea of zero divisors, where a non-zero number multiplied by another non-zero number results in zero in the modular system.The zero product property, valid in standard arithmetic, doesn't hold true for all modular systems.The text seems to be setting up a foundation for more advanced algebraic structures and concepts that might be discussed in subsequent chapters. It encourages readers to think about these concepts and their implications, prompting them with questions and tasks to further understand and appreciate modular arithmetic.3.4 Equivalence classes 
Modulararithmeticformsthebasisforanimportantclassofstructuresin 
Abstract Algebra. One common notation for these structures focuses not 
on remainder relationships for individual elements but on congruence 
classes as sets. For instance, for congruence modulo 12, the congru- 
ence class containing 0 is denoted 12Zbecause 12Z= {12n|n âZ} = 
{...,â24,â12,0,12,24, ...}. In fact, 12Zis a subgroup of the additive

groupZ, because it is a subset ofZthat is a group in its own right. 
SubgroupswillbeexploredinChapter6.Fornow,extendingthenotation, 
it makes sense to denote other congruence classes by 
1+12Z= {1+12n|n âZ} = {...,â23,â11,1,13,25, ...}, 
2+12Z= {2+12n|n âZ} = {...,â22,â10,2,14,26, ...}, and so on. 
Also, for notational consistency, 12Zcan be written 
0+12Z= {0+12n|n âZ} = {...,â24,â12,0,12,24, ...}. 
h esecongruenceclassesarecosetsofthesubgroup12ZinZ,wherecosets 
were introduced brief l y in Section 2.6 and will be explored in Chapter 
7. Here, coset notation like 1+12Zpermits a reframing of the previous 
section because 
14 â¡ 2(mod 12) â 14 â 2+12Zand, in general, 
x â¡ a(mod 12) â x â a+12Z. 
h us coset addition and multiplication are well def i ned: it is meaningful 
to write (a+12Z)+(b+12Z) = (a+b)+12Zand 
(a+12Z)(b+12Z) = (ab)+12Z. 
Now, it might be useful to know that congruence modulo 12 def i nes an 
equivalence relation onZwith the cosets as equivalence classes. h is book 
could manage without these notions, but many undergraduate degree 
programmes introduce equivalence relations before Abstract Algebra in 
a course called something like Foundations or Introduction to Reasoning 
or Sets and Proofs. So Abstract Algebra lecturers might assume that 
equivalence relations are familiar and prove theorems about cosets by 
quoting theorems about equivalence classes. I will not do that, but I 
will discuss equivalence relations now to highlight some links. (if these 
notionsareunfamiliarandyouf i ndtheremainderofthissectiondif i cult, 
do skip to the next)ChatGPT3.4 Equivalence ClassesIn abstract algebra and related areas of mathematics, an equivalence class is a subset of a set that is defined by an equivalence relation. When a set is partitioned into equivalence classes, each class consists of elements that are equivalent to each other and distinct from elements of other classes.Equivalence Relation:An equivalence relation on a set SSS is a relation that satisfies three properties:Reflexivity: For every element aaa in SSS, aaa is equivalent to itself. Symbolically, aâ¼aa \sim aaâ¼a.Symmetry: If aaa is equivalent to bbb, then bbb is equivalent to aaa. Symbolically, if aâ¼ba \sim baâ¼b, then bâ¼ab \sim abâ¼a.Transitivity: If aaa is equivalent to bbb and bbb is equivalent to ccc, then aaa is equivalent to ccc. Symbolically, if aâ¼ba \sim baâ¼b and bâ¼cb \sim cbâ¼c, then aâ¼ca \sim caâ¼c.The notation aâ¼ba \sim baâ¼b denotes that elements aaa and bbb are equivalent under the given relation.Equivalence Classes in Modular Arithmetic:Consider the set of integers, Z\mathbb{Z}Z, and the equivalence relation defined by congruence modulo 12. Two integers aaa and bbb are said to be congruent modulo 12 if their difference is divisible by 12. Symbolically, aâ¡b (mod 12)a \equiv b \ (\text{mod}\ 12)aâ¡b (mod 12).For each integer aaa, the set of all integers that are congruent to aaa modulo 12 forms an equivalence class. This class is denoted by [a][a][a] or sometimes as a+12Za + 12\mathbb{Z}a+12Z.For example:The equivalence class of 0 is 0+12Z0 + 12\mathbb{Z}0+12Z = {..., -24, -12, 0, 12, 24, ...}.The equivalence class of 1 is 1+12Z1 + 12\mathbb{Z}1+12Z = {..., -23, -11, 1, 13, 25, ...}.And so on.Each integer belongs to exactly one equivalence class modulo 12. The set of all such classes is a partition of the integers.Relevance in Algebra:Understanding equivalence classes and equivalence relations provides foundational knowledge for various topics in algebra, such as cosets, quotient groups, and factor rings. The idea that we can group elements based on certain properties and then work with these groups (or classes) instead of individual elements simplifies many algebraic processes and proofs.It probably âsounds rightâ to speak of congruence in terms of equiv- 
alence, saying things like â14 is equivalent to 2 modulo 12â. And this is consistent with theory, because congruence modulo 12 satisf i es the 
criteria below (if these take ef f ort to process, try thinking in terms of 
remainders on division by 12). 
Ref l exivity âx âZ, x â¡ x(mod 12); 
Symmetry âx,y âZ, if x â¡ y(mod 12) then y â¡ x(mod 12); 
Transitivity âx,y,z âZ, if x â¡ y(mod 12) and y â¡ z(mod 12) 
then x â¡ z(mod 12). 
h is means that congruence modulo 12 is an equivalence relation on 
Z, because it satisf i es the def i nition below. In this def i nition, âx â¼ yâ 
can be read as âx is related to yâ, where ââ¼â is a tilde (but I have heard 
mathematicians call it âtwiddlesâ).

Symmetric âx,y â X, if x â¼ y then y â¼ x; 
Transitive âx,y,z â X, if x â¼ y and y â¼ z then x â¼ z. 
h e notation x â¼ y raises potential confusion because it looks a lot like 
xây or x+y. But a relation on X is not an operation on X. For an 
operation, every two elements x,y â X can be combined to give another. 
For a relation, nothing is combined. Rather, two elements x,y â X might 
be related, in which case we write x â¼ y, or not related, in which case we 
write x Ì¸â¼ y. For instance, 14 â¡ 2(mod 12) but 15 Ì¸â¡ 2(mod 12). 
A simple equivalence relation is = on the setQ: this is ref l exive, sym- 
metric and transitive. But not all relations are equivalence relations: the

equivalence relations are special, and one consequence of their def i nition 
is that every equivalence relation partitions its set into equivalence classes: 
it distributes the elements into disjoint subsets each containing a full 
set of equivalent elements. Congruence modulo 12 partitions the inte- 
gers into congruence classes according to their remainders modulo 12.

every coset has the same number of elements. But that is neither part nor 
consequence of the equivalence relation def i nitionâequivalence classes 
could have dif f erent numbers of elements. You will, though, see a proof 
that every equivalence relation partitions its set. Here I provide a specif i c 
version for the theorem below (you can think of the cosets as congruence 
or equivalence classes). 
Theorem: h e cosets of 12ZinZpartitionZ. 
h is is not a theorem for which a proof will make you more convinced. 
Instead, it should clarify links to wider theory. To understand a proof, 
I think it helps i rst to think about the relevant logic. What does it mean 
to say that cosets partition a set? It means that every element of the 
set is in a coset, and that the cosets are disjoint. For 12ZinZ, every 
element ofZis in a coset because every a âZis in a+12Z. But how to 
capture the notion of âdisjointâ? One way is to say that for any two cosets, 
either the intersectionâthe overlapâis empty, or the sets are the same. 
Mathematicians denote the intersection of two sets X and Y by Xâ©Y 
(âX intersect Yâ) and the empty set by â. So we want to prove that for 
anytwocosetsa+12Zandb+12Z,either(a+12Z)â©(b+12Z) = âor 
a+12Z= b+12Z.ChatGPTLet's break down the concepts and connect the dots.Equivalence Relations and Congruence Modulo n:An equivalence relation, as defined on set XXX, must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. The relation of congruence modulo 12 fits these criteria for the set Z\mathbb{Z}Z:Reflexivity: For any integer xxx, xâ¡xx \equiv xxâ¡x (mod 12). This means any integer is congruent to itself modulo 12.Symmetry: If xâ¡yx \equiv yxâ¡y (mod 12), then yâ¡xy \equiv xyâ¡x (mod 12). This means if xxx leaves the same remainder as yyy when divided by 12, then the reverse is also true.Transitivity: If xâ¡yx \equiv yxâ¡y (mod 12) and yâ¡zy \equiv zyâ¡z (mod 12), then xâ¡zx \equiv zxâ¡z (mod 12). In simpler terms, if xxx and yyy leave the same remainder when divided by 12, and yyy and zzz do too, then xxx and zzz will also leave the same remainder when divided by 12.Cosets and Partitions:The equivalence relation of congruence modulo 12 naturally partitions the set of integers Z\mathbb{Z}Z into equivalence classes, or congruence classes. These congruence classes can also be thought of as cosets of the subgroup 12Z12\mathbb{Z}12Z.For instance, the coset 2+12Z2+12\mathbb{Z}2+12Z consists of all integers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 12. The theorem presented is essentially an observation of this partitioning: every integer will belong to one and only one such coset.Proof Idea for the Theorem:Statement: The cosets of 12Z12\mathbb{Z}12Z in Z\mathbb{Z}Z partition Z\mathbb{Z}Z.To prove this, consider two arbitrary cosets: a+12Za+12\mathbb{Z}a+12Z and b+12Zb+12\mathbb{Z}b+12Z.If aâ¡ba \equiv baâ¡b (mod 12), then every element in a+12Za+12\mathbb{Z}a+12Z will also be in b+12Zb+12\mathbb{Z}b+12Z and vice versa, meaning the two cosets are the same.If aâ¡Ì¸ba \not\equiv baî â¡b (mod 12), then the two cosets will have no integers in common. That is, (a+12Z)â©(b+12Z)=â(a+12\mathbb{Z}) \cap (b+12\mathbb{Z}) = \emptyset(a+12Z)â©(b+12Z)=â.By demonstrating that any two cosets are either identical or have no overlap, we show that the cosets of 12Z12\mathbb{Z}12Z in Z\mathbb{Z}Z indeed partition Z\mathbb{Z}Z.In conclusion, the concept of equivalence relations and their connection to partitions through cosets is foundational in abstract algebra. The understanding of congruences, equivalence classes, and cosets provides a framework to explore more complex structures in the subject.possible(a

h is âorâ statement can be proved by demonstrating that if (a+12Z)â© 
(b+12Z) Ì¸= â, then a+12Z= b+12Z. h ink about why, then read the 
theorem and proof below (note that âX â Yâ means âX is a subset of Yâ). 
Theorem: h e cosets of 12ZinZpartitionZ. 
Proof: Let a âZ. 
Observe that 0 â 12Z. 
So a = a+0 â a+12Z. 
h us every element appears in a coset. 
Now suppose that b âZand (a+12Z)â©(b+12Z) Ì¸= â. 
h en âx â (a+12Z)â©(b+12Z). 
Because x â a+12Z, ân1âZsuch that x = a+12n1. 
Because x â b+12Z, ân2âZsuch that x = b+12n2. 
So a+12n1= b+12n2and, rearranging, 
b = a+12(n1ân2) and a = b+12(n2ân1). 
Now let y â b+12Z. 
h en ân3âZsuch that y1= b+12n3 
= a+12(n1ân2+n3) â a+12Z. 
So b+12Zâ a+12Z. 
Similarly let y â a+12Z. 
h en ân3âZsuch that y = a+12n3 
= b+12(n2ân1+n3) â b+12Z. 
So a+12Zâ b+12Z. 
Hence b+12Zâ a+12Zand a+12Zâ b+12Z. 
So a+12Z= b+12Z.
h us we have proved that 
if (a+12Z)â©(b+12Z) Ì¸= â then a+12Z= b+12Z. 
Hence the cosets of 12ZinZpartitionZ.

Guidance on reading proofs ef f ectively is provided in Section 3.6âyou

Now, some courses def i ne equivalence relations more formally, intro- 
ducing an equivalence relation on a set X as a subset of the Cartesian 
product XÃX (âX cross Xâ). h at is pretty abstract, so here is a quick 
explanation. h e set XÃX is the set of all pairs of the form (x,y) 
where x,y â X. h e notation (x,y) might call to mind a plane, which 
is appropriate because if X =RthenRÃRis indeed âthe planeâ in the 
usual sense. If X =ZthenZÃZis an inf i nite grid of points with integer 
coordinates. If X is i nite, then XÃX is a i nite grid. An equivalence 
relation is a subset of XÃX because only some elements are related to 
each other (usually). For instance, for the above equivalence relation on 
X = {a1,a2,a3,b1,b2,b3,c1,c2,c3}, the grid below has dots at all points 
(x,y) for which x â¼ y. How is ref l exivity manifest in the diagram? How 
about symmetry?
It is not practical to provide a similar diagram for congruence modulo 
12 onZ, becauseZÃZis an inf i nite grid and 12 is too big. However, 
below is a partial version for congruence modulo 3, where the cosets or 
congruence classes of 3ZinZare 
0+3Z= {0+3x|x âZ} = {...,â6,â3,0,3,6,9, ...}; 
1+3Z= {1+3x|x âZ} = {...,â5,â2,1,4,7,10, ...}; 
2+3Z= {2+3x|x âZ} = {...,â4,â1,2,5,8,11, ...}.

As I say, this way of thinking about equivalence relations is pretty 
abstract. For the ideas in this book, I i nd it more useful to represent 
each element just once and capture relationships in the layout. For 
instance, for congruence modulo 3, the diagram on the lef t below is a 
âstretched outâversionofthebendynumberlinewrapped aroundacircle, 
as if the numbers are spiralling upward so that congruent numbers line 
up vertically. Each column is a coset; the lef t most is the subgroup 3Z. 
Looking horizontally, each coset is âof f setâ from the subgroup by a i xed 
number. Looking vertically, the elements within every coset dif f er from 
one another by elements of the subgroup (in this case, multiples of 3). 
Chapter 7 will apply this idea to other groups.ChatGPTThe user is discussing equivalence relations in mathematics. Equivalence relations are a fundamental concept in mathematics, especially in abstract algebra and number theory.Hereâs a brief overview of the topics presented by the user:Equivalence Relations: A relation on a set XXX is said to be an equivalence relation if it satisfies three properties:Reflexivity: Every element is related to itself.Symmetry: If xxx is related to yyy, then yyy is related to xxx.Transitivity: If xxx is related to yyy and yyy is related to zzz, then xxx is related to zzz.Congruence Modulo nnn: This is a specific equivalence relation on integers. Two integers aaa and bbb are said to be congruent modulo nnn if their difference is divisible by nnn. This is denoted by aâ¡ba \equiv baâ¡b (mod nnn).Equivalence Classes: Given an equivalence relation, the set can be partitioned into equivalence classes. Each class consists of elements that are related to each other. For congruence modulo nnn, the equivalence classes are the residues 0,1,2,â¦,nâ10, 1, 2, \ldots, n-10,1,2,â¦,nâ1.Cosets: The text also discusses cosets, which are related to equivalence classes but come up specifically in group theory. If GGG is a group and HHH is a subgroup of GGG, then the left coset of HHH in GGG associated with an element aaa in GGG is the set of products aÃha \times haÃh where hhh ranges over HHH.Visualization: The user touches on different ways to visualize equivalence relations, like plotting them on XÃXX \times XXÃX, which is a Cartesian product, or representing them in a number line or a circle for congruences.Proof: The user presented a proof that the cosets of 12Z12\mathbb{Z}12Z in Z\mathbb{Z}Z partition Z\mathbb{Z}Z. This means that every integer can be expressed as a representative from one of the 12 congruence classes mod 12, and no integer belongs to more than one class.This is a complex topic with a lot of details, but the user's explanation is comprehensive and touches on the essential points related to equivalence relations, especially as they apply to congruences and group theory. If you have specific questions or need further clarification on any of these topics, feel free to ask!3.5 Logic in theorems 
We now return to logic, which underlies all of mathematics and which 
is important when reading theorems because misinterpreting a theorem 
leaves you unlikely to understand its proof or to appreciate its place in a 
theory.First,somespecif i cinformationonquantif i ers.Whenmathemati- 
cians talk about quantif i ers, they mean 
the universal quantif i er âââ (âfor allâ), and 
the existential quantif i er âââ (âthere existsâ). 
h e universal quantif i er appears in the def i nition of associative. 
Def i nition: h e operation â is associative on the set S if and only if 
âs1,s2,s3â S, (s1âs2)âs3= s1â(s2âs3). 
h is bears on the question in Section 2.3 about whether an operation 
could be associative on a set but not on a smaller subset. It could notâ 
canyouseewhy?Ifapropertyholdsforeveryelementofaset,itholdsfor 
every element of every subset. Associativity involves three elements, but 
that makes no dif f erence: if it holds for every three elements of S, it holds 
for every three elements of every subset of S. 
LOGIC IN THEOREMS51 
h e universal and existential quantif i ers appear together in the group 
identity axiom. As noted in Section 2.3, quantif i er order matters: this 
axiom is about the existence of a single element that interacts in a certain 
way with all group elements. 
Identity âe â G such that âg â G, eâg = gâe = g. 
To prove that something exists, it is enough to produce one. For instance, 
in the set of 2Ã2 matrices, a multiplicative identity is 
(1 
0 
01 ) 
, because for every matrix (a 
b 
cd ) 
, 
(1 
0 
01 )(a 
b 
cd ) = (a 
b 
cd )(1 
0 
01 ) = (a 
b 
cd ) 
. 
Students sometimes worry about such assertions, though. h ey feel that 
it is âcheatingâ just to produce an object, that they ought somehow to 
derive it. But that is not necessary. Justif i cations are of t en expected, but 
it is usually i ne ef f ectively to say âLook, here is one that works, let me 
prove itâ. 
Onceweknowthatsomethingexists,wecanprovethingsaboutit.T h is 
might be straightforward: for instance, the axiom implies that an identity 
commutes with every element in its set. But it might take more work. ChatGPTThe provided passage delves into the importance of logic in the context of mathematical theorems, particularly focusing on the usage of quantifiers. Let's break down the main points:Quantifiers: These are symbols that specify the extent to which a predicate (a statement or property) holds over a set. There are two primary quantifiers:Universal Quantifier, âââ (read as "for all"): Indicates that the following statement or property applies to all elements in a particular set.Existential Quantifier, âââ (read as "there exists"): Suggests that there is at least one element in a set for which the subsequent statement or property holds true.Associativity: The text gives the definition of associativity using the universal quantifier. An operation â*â is deemed associative on a set SSS if, for all possible triples of elements from SSS, the operation holds true for both grouped ways of combining them. The key takeaway is that if an operation is associative for all elements of a larger set, it's also associative for all elements of any of its subsets.Identity Element in Groups: Groups are fundamental structures in algebra, and one of their axioms is the existence of an identity element. The given axiom combines both quantifiers: there exists an identity element eee such that for every element ggg in the group, the operations with eee and ggg yield ggg again. This axiom states the existence of a single identity element that works universally for all elements in the group.Proof by Demonstration: The passage concludes by pointing out that, in mathematics, if you're trying to prove the existence of something, it suffices to just provide an example. They give the instance of the 2x2 identity matrix as an example of a multiplicative identity. This means, instead of deriving the identity element in an abstract or theoretical manner, one can present an explicit example and then verify its properties.To summarize, the passage emphasizes the crucial role of logic and quantifiers in mathematical proofs and theorems. Understanding quantifiers and their implications helps in accurately interpreting and proving mathematical statements.For instance, your lecturer might prove that for any set and operation, the identity is unique, meaning that there is only one identity. For numbers, 
thismightseemweirdâofcoursethereisonlyoneâ1â.Butrememberthat 
identitiesgowithoperationsâthereisonlyone1,butthereisalsoa0.And 
how sure are you that only one 2Ã2 matrix is a multiplicative identity? 
With that in mind, read the following theorem and proof. h e proof uses 
a common strategy for proving that something is unique: assume there 
are two and prove that they must be the same. 
Theorem: h e identity element for an operation on a set is unique. 
Proof: Suppose that e1and e2are both identity elements for â on S. 
h ene1= e1âe2because e2is an identity 
= e2because e1is an identity. 
52THEOREMS AND PROOFS 
I have always thought this argument rather cute. But it is so short that it 
canseemvacuous,soitisusefultorelateittosomespecif i csetsandoper- 
ations. For instance, suppose that S =R, the operation is multiplication, 
e1= 1, and e2is a i ctitious other identity element. h en the algebraic 
part of the argument reads 1 = 1e2= e2. Similarly, if S is the set of 2Ã2 
matrices, the operation is matrix multiplication, 
e1= (1 
0 
01 ) 
and (e 
a eb 
eced ) 
is another identity, 
then the algebraic part reads 
(1 
0 
01 ) = (1 
0 
01 )(e 
a eb 
eced ) = (e 
a eb 
eced ) 
. 
Now, I observed that the identity matrix commutes with all other 
matrices. Does this contradict the fact that matrix multiplication is not 
commutative? No,because quantif i ed statementsdo nothavestraightfor- 
ward âoppositesâ, so def i ning not commutative requires careful negation.ChatGPTThis passage is discussing the concept of the "identity element" in various mathematical contexts, and proving its uniqueness for a given operation.Here's a breakdown:Identity Element: This is a concept from algebra which, when combined with any element in a set using a specific operation, doesn't change that element. For example, for multiplication in real numbers, 1 is the identity since any number multiplied by 1 remains unchanged. For addition, 0 is the identity because any number added to 0 remains the same.Uniqueness of Identity: The passage asserts the uniqueness of the identity element for any operation on a set. The proof is straightforward. It starts by assuming there are two identity elements, e1e_1e1â and e2e_2e2â. Using the properties of identities, the proof demonstrates that e1e_1e1â and e2e_2e2â must, in fact, be the same element.Examples: The passage then illustrates this using real numbers and 2x2 matrices.For real numbers, if 1 is an identity for multiplication and there's a hypothetical other identity e2e_2e2â, the argument reduces to 1 = e2e_2e2â.For 2x2 matrices, if a matrix (equivalent to the identity matrix) multiplies another hypothetical identity matrix, the result remains the same identity matrix.Matrix Multiplication: The passage mentions a notable point about matrix multiplication. While the identity matrix commutes with all other matrices (meaning the order in which you multiply doesn't matter), matrix multiplication itself is not generally commutative. The passage emphasizes the need for precision when defining terms, especially when stating the opposite of quantified statements.To conclude, the passage underlines the importance of understanding the underlying principles and logic behind mathematical theorems and proofs. It emphasizes the uniqueness of the identity element in various mathematical contexts and touches upon the intricacies of matrix multiplication.Commutativity is def i ned with a universal quantif i er. 
Def i nition: h e binary operation â is commutative on the set S if and

Anaiveâoppositeâmightbethatâs1,s2â S,s1âs2Ì¸= s2âs1.Butthatisnot 
a valid negation. Commutativity fails if s1âs2Ì¸= s2âs1for even one pair 
of elementsâa single counterexample refutes a universal statement. In 
the actual negation below, note the new quantif i er and think about how 
it relates to matrices. 
Def i nition: h e binary operation â is not commutative on the set S if 
and only if âs1,s2â S such that s1âs2Ì¸= s2âs1. 
As explained in Chapter 2, all def i nitions have if and only if structures. 
But many theorems are conditional statements that hold only in âone 
directionâ; their converses might be untrue. Section 3.2 considered this 
LOGIC IN THEOREMS53 
via the two statements below. For multiplication on some sets, both are 
true; for others, just the second is true. 
If ab = 0 then a = 0 or b = 0. 
If a = 0 or b = 0 then ab = 0. 
For practice, consider these statements too. Is each true for all operations 
on all sets? 
If e is the identity then eâe = e. 
If eâe = e, then e is the identity. 
h e i rst is true for any identityâwhy? h e second is of t en not true, even 
in simple cases. For instance, in the integers, (â1)(â1) = 1, but (â1) is 
not the multiplicative identity. Conditional statements thus merit careful 
attention, which is challenging in Abstract Algebra for two reasons. First, 
unsurprisingly, the statements themselves can be complex. Second, the 
same theorem can of t en be written in multiple ways. For instance, the 
following theorems capture the same information about cyclic groups. 
Cyclic groups are discussed in Section 6.3; here, just try to see the logical 
equivalence. 
Theorem: Suppose that G is a cyclic group. h en every subgroup of G 
is cyclic. 
Theorem: Every subgroup of every cyclic group is cyclic. 
Theorem: If G is a cyclic group, then every subgroup of G is cyclic. 
h e i rst formulation gives the premise and conclusion in separate sen- 
tences, one introducing an object and the other saying what can be 
deduced about it. h e second handles everything with universal quanti- 
i ers so that the premise and conclusion are packed in together. h e third 
is clearest with regard to conditionality: its structure is âif this premise then this conclusionâ. However, a purist would say that it is not properly 
delimited and that it should say this. 
Theorem: ForeverygroupG,ifGisacyclicgroup,theneverysubgroup 
of G is cyclic. 
54THEOREMS AND PROOFS 
I tend to be a bit slapdash about delimiting; I think it obvious that this 
theorem is about all groups and i nd the longer version is a bit of a 
mouthful. But lack of clear delimiting can introduce ambiguityâdoes âif 
y > 0 then ...â refer to integers or real numbers, for instance? Certainly 
it is mathematically polite to introduce everything properly, so attend to 
your lecturerâs approach and maybe err on the side of caution. 
Regardless of its formulation, this theorem is true, so the cyclic groups 
form a subset of groups for which every subgroup is cyclic. But it leaves 
open the question of whether the converse is also true: if every subgroup 
of a group is cyclic, must the group be cyclic? Or are the smaller nested 
sets below in fact the same? If you have studied groups, you might know 
the answer. If not, you will i nd it in Chapter 6.

âdividesâ is a tidy way to say âis a factor ofâ. (If Lagrangeâs h eorem looks 
dif f erent in your course, see Section 7.7.) 
Lagrangeâs Theorem: Suppose that G is a i nite group and H is a 
subgroup of G. h en the order of H divides the order of G. 
h e premise of Lagrangeâs h eorem states that G is a i nite groupâ 
something like a modular arithmetic group as in Section 3.3âand H is 
a subgroup. h e conclusion says that the order of H divides the order 
of G. So, for instance, a group of order 12 can have subgroups of order 
4 but not of order 5. Does that mean that subsets of order 4 necessarily 
formsubgroups?No:asubsetmightnotcontaintheidentity,forinstance.
So the converse of Lagrangeâs h eorem is not true. h e contrapositive, 
however, is true, and serves to restrict possible sizes of subgroups within

and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent. 
Statement: 
If A then B. 
Contrapositive: 
If not B then not A. 
I think about this as follows. Assume that the statement âIf A then Bâ is 
true. h is means that if B is not true, then A cannot be true because if 
it were, then B would be true (I do not claim that this is elegant, but I 
prefer it to more austere, formal explanations). It is useful to be aware of 
this logical equivalence, because one of a conditional statement and its 
contrapositive might be easier to work with.ChatGPTThe passage delves into various aspects of mathematical logic, focusing primarily on the definitions and intricacies of conditional statements, their contrapositives, and the concept of commutativity.Here's a brief summary:Commutativity and Its Negation:An operation is commutative if, for all elements in a set, the order of operation doesn't matter. This is defined universally.The negation of this statement isn't just flipping the "=" sign, but it involves the existence of at least one pair of elements where the operation isn't commutative.Conditional Statements and Their Converses:The passage explains that while some conditional statements are true in one direction, their converse might not be. Examples given include multiplication conditions and the property of an identity element.An important takeaway is that while a statement might be true, its converse might not necessarily be.Theorems and Their Formulations:The passage illustrates that the same theorem can be written in various ways. For instance, the properties of cyclic groups are presented in multiple formats, each with a different logical structure but conveying the same information.Lagrange's Theorem:This theorem relates the size (order) of a subgroup to its parent group. The theorem asserts that the order of a subgroup divides the order of the parent group. However, not every subset of a particular size is necessarily a subgroup, and thus the converse of this theorem doesn't hold.Contrapositives:The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. For a statement "If A then B", its contrapositive is "If not B then not A".Being aware of this logical equivalence is crucial because, in some situations, one might be easier to work with or prove than the other.The passage encourages a thoughtful approach to mathematical reasoning, emphasizing the importance of precision in definitions, understanding the logical structure of statements, and recognizing the implications and limitations of theorems and their formulations.3.6 Self-explanation training

I ask because research has shown that students do not always read 
mathematics ef f ectively. h is is not surprising: many are not accustomed 
to reading mathematics at all. In school, and perhaps in some under- 
graduate classes, they have watched experts demonstrate how to perform 
calculations, then practised. h ey have probably taken notes, but those 
who understand well might rarely consult those notes, needing only the 
occasional reminder. 
56THEOREMS AND PROOFS 
In Abstract Algebra, occasional reading is unlikely to suf i ce. Most 
students do not understand entire lecturesâthe material is too complex

sounds like it should be easy because undergraduates have been reading 
for perhaps 15 years. But mathematical reading is not like ordinary 
reading. As discussed in the preceding sections, it requires abnormal 
attention to logic. Moreover, when practised by experts, it is not linear. 
Mathematicians do not start at the beginning of a page and read until the

ChatGPTThe passage introduces the concept of "self-explanation training" and underscores the importance of effective mathematical reading.Here's a summary:Self-explanation Training in Mathematics:Challenges of Mathematical Reading:Despite being adept readers, many students struggle with reading mathematics effectively. This is primarily because mathematical reading differs significantly from conventional reading.In traditional education systems, students often learn mathematics by watching and then practicing. This method may not demand intensive reading.However, in higher-level courses like Abstract Algebra, relying solely on lectures isn't sufficient. The complexity of the content and the pace of delivery necessitate post-lecture note revision.Nature of Mathematical Reading:Unlike ordinary reading, mathematical reading demands exceptional attention to logical details.Experts don't read mathematics linearly. Instead, they jump back and forth, connecting symbols and statements, ensuring a thorough understanding of logical relationships.Benefits of Self-explanation Training:Self-explanation training teaches students to read mathematics more like experts. It's a strategy proven to enhance problem-solving and comprehension across various academic subjects.One research cited indicates that students who underwent this training performed significantly better in understanding proofs compared to those who didn't.Although the training doesn't promise instant mastery, consistent practice will likely lead to better comprehension of mathematical texts.The main takeaway is that mathematical reading is a unique skill that requires a different approach than reading other texts. Self-explanation training provides a structured method for students to hone this skill and thereby improve their understanding of complex mathematical concepts.3 h e same training appears in How to h ink about Analysis so you can skip this if

SELF-EXPLANATION TRAINING57 
How to self-explain 
To improve your understanding of a proof, there is a series of techniques 
you should apply. 
After reading each line: 
â¢Try to identify and elaborate the main ideas in the proof. 
â¢Attempttoexplaineachlineintermsofpreviousideas.Thesemaybeideas 
from the information in the proof, ideas from previous theorems/proofs, 
or ideas from your own prior knowledge of the topic area. 
â¢Consider any questions that arise if new information contradicts your 
current understanding. 
Before proceeding to the next line of the proof you should ask yourself 
the following: 
â¢Do I understand the ideas used in that line? 
â¢Do I understand why those ideas have been used? 
â¢How do those ideas link to other ideas in the proof, other theorems, or 
prior knowledge that I may have? 
â¢Does the self-explanation I have generated help to answer the questions 
that I am asking? 
Below you will i nd an example showing possible self-explanations 
generated by students when trying to understand a proof (the labels 
â(L1)â etc. in the proof indicate line numbers). Please read the example 
carefully in order to understand how to use this strategy in your own 
learning. Example self-explanations 
Theorem: No odd integer can be expressed as the sum of three even 
integers. 
Proof: (L1) Assume, to the contrary, that there is an odd integer x 
such that x = a+b+c, where a,b and c are even integers.

(L2) Then a = 2k,b = 2l and c = 2p, for some integers k,l 
and p. 
(L3) Thus x = a+b+c = 2k+2l+2p = 2(k+l+p). 
(L4) It follows that x is even; a contradiction. 
(L5) Thus no odd integer can be expressed as the sum of three 
even integers.? 
After reading this proof, one reader made the following self- 
explanations: 
â¢âThis proof uses the technique of proof by contradictionâ.5 
â¢âSince a,b and c are even integers, we have to use the def i nition of an even 
integer, which is used in L2.â 
â¢âThe proof then replaces a,b and c with their respective def i nitions in the 
formula for x.â 
â¢âThe formula for x is then simplif i ed and is shown to satisfy the def i nition 
of an even integer also; a contradiction.â 
â¢âTherefore, no odd integer can be expressed as the sum of three even 
integers.âChatGPTThe given section describes a technique called "self-explanation training" for better understanding mathematical proofs.Self-explanation Training:How to self-explain:After reading each line of a proof:Identify and elaborate the main ideas.Explain each line using previous ideas, which could be from the proof itself, from past proofs, or from existing knowledge of the topic.Contemplate questions that emerge if new data clashes with your current understanding.Before moving to the next line:Ensure you comprehend the ideas in the current line.Understand the rationale for using those ideas.Determine how the ideas connect with other ideas in the proof, with other theorems, or with prior knowledge.Reflect if your self-explanation clarifies your questions.Example Proof with Self-explanations:Theorem: No odd integer can be expressed as the sum of three even integers.Proof:(L1) Begin with the assumption that an odd integer x can be expressed as the sum of three even integers a, b, and c.(L2) Define a, b, and c in terms of even integers: a = 2k, b = 2l, and c = 2p, where k, l, and p are integers.(L3) Rewrite x in terms of a, b, and c: x = 2k + 2l + 2p = 2(k + l + p).(L4) This implies x is even, which contradicts the initial assumption.(L5) Conclude that no odd integer can be expressed as the sum of three even integers.Self-explanations by a reader:The proof uses the "proof by contradiction" method.L2 uses the definition of an even integer for a, b, and c.L3 substitutes a, b, and c using their respective definitions to express x.The result for x is shown to fit the definition of an even integer, creating a contradiction.Hence, it's proven that no odd integer can be expressed as the sum of three even integers.In essence, self-explanation training encourages readers to critically analyze each step of a proof and clarify their understanding using their existing knowledge. This strategy can significantly improve comprehension of mathematical texts.Do the proof againChatGPTCertainly! Let's delve into the proof and its self-explanation step by step.Theorem: No odd integer can be expressed as the sum of three even integers.Proof:(L1) Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there is an odd integer xxx such that x=a+b+cx = a + b + cx=a+b+c, where aaa, bbb, and ccc are even integers.(L2) By definition of even integers:
a=2ka = 2ka=2k, b=2lb = 2lb=2l, and c=2pc = 2pc=2p,
for some integers kkk, lll, and ppp.(L3) Substituting in the values of aaa, bbb, and ccc we get:
x=2k+2l+2px = 2k + 2l + 2px=2k+2l+2p,
which can be simplified to x=2(k+l+p)x = 2(k + l + p)x=2(k+l+p).(L4) This implies that xxx is divisible by 2, which means xxx is even. This contradicts our initial assumption that xxx is odd.(L5) Therefore, our assumption was false and no odd integer can be expressed as the sum of three even integers.Self-explanations for each line:(L1) We're using a method called "proof by contradiction." We start by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove.(L2) We're defining aaa, bbb, and ccc based on the standard definition of even integers. Every even number can be expressed as 2 times some integer.(L3) We express xxx in terms of our defined even integers. This helps us see the structure of xxx more clearly.(L4) Upon simplifying, it becomes clear that xxx is even, which contradicts our original assumption of xxx being odd.(L5) Having reached a contradiction, we conclude that our initial assumption was wrong, proving the theorem.By actively walking through each step and explaining it to oneself, you deepen your understanding of the proof. This is the essence of self-explanation training.Self-explanations compared with other comments 
You must also be aware that the self-explanation strategy is not the same 
as monitoring or paraphrasing. These two methods will not help your 
learning to the same extent as self-explanation. 
Paraphrasing 
âa,b and c have to be positive or negative, even whole numbers.â 
There is no self-explanation in this statement. No additional information 
is added or linked. The reader merely uses different words to describe 
5 Proof by contradiction is discussed along with other types of proof in Chapter 6 of 
How to Study for/as a Mathematics Degree/Major. 
what is already represented in the text by the words âeven integersâ. You 
should avoid using such paraphrasing during your own proof compre- 
hension. Paraphrasing will not improve your understanding of the text 
as much as self-explanation will. 
Monitoring 
âOK, I understand that 2(k+l+p) is an even integer.â 
This statement simply shows the readerâs thought process. It is not 
the same as self-explanation, because the student does not relate the 
sentence to additional information in the text or to prior knowledge. 
Please concentrate on self-explanation rather than monitoring. 
A possible self-explanation of the same sentence would be: 
âOK, 2(k+l+p) is an even integer because the sum of 3 integers is 
an integer and 2 times an integer is an even integer.â 
In this example the reader identif i es and elaborates the main ideas 
in the text. They use information that has already been presented to 
understand the logic of the proof. This is the approach you should 
take after reading every line of a proof in order to improve your 
understanding of the material. 
h at is the end of the self-explanation training. h e version used in 
the research study then provided two theorems and proofs for self- 
explanation practice. Here, I recommend that you l ip back to the the- 
orems and proofs in this chapter and practise with those.ChatGPTThis excerpt highlights the differences between self-explanations and other strategies like monitoring and paraphrasing when studying mathematical proofs. Let's break it down:Paraphrasing: It involves rewording the original content without adding any new understanding or context. The example given is rephrasing "even integers" as "positive or negative, even whole numbers". This does not add to the comprehension but merely rewords the content.Monitoring: This involves acknowledging one's understanding or lack thereof. It's a self-check without deepening comprehension. For instance, stating "I understand that 2(k+l+p)2(k+l+p)2(k+l+p) is an even integer" simply indicates acknowledgment without explaining why.Self-Explanation: This strategy goes beyond mere acknowledgment or rewording. It involves making connections between the current material and prior knowledge or other parts of the text. For the statement about 2(k+l+p)2(k+l+p)2(k+l+p) being even, the self-explanation involves recognizing that the sum of three integers is an integer and that multiplying an integer by two yields an even integer. This way, you're not just understanding the statement, but you're explaining its foundation and logic.For optimal understanding, it's suggested that readers focus on self-explanation over the other methods. This strategy allows students to actively engage with the content, making connections and deepening their comprehension. It's an active learning approach, which has been shown to be more effective than passive learning.In essence, when you come across a mathematical statement or proof, rather than just reading it or rephrasing it, you should aim to connect it with what you already know, explain its logic to yourself, and see how it fits within the broader mathematical landscape.It seems like this is a general strategy in everyday life. Can you think of any examples?ChatGPTCertainly! The self-explanation strategy, while illustrated in the context of mathematical proofs, is a powerful tool that can be applied in various aspects of everyday life. Here are some examples:Cooking: Imagine you're following a new recipe. Instead of just going through the steps, you could delve deeper. For example, if the recipe says to let dough rest for an hour, you might remind yourself that this allows the yeast to ferment, which makes the dough rise. By linking the instruction to its purpose, you gain a deeper understanding of the cooking process.Assembling Furniture: When putting together a piece of DIY furniture, instead of just following the instruction steps, think about why each part fits where it does and how the structure holds together. Recognizing the role each component plays can help you better understand the overall design and function of the item.Learning a New Sport: If you're trying to master a new sport or physical activity, don't just mimic the motions. Try to understand the mechanics and the purpose behind each move. For example, in tennis, instead of just hitting the ball, think about why you're positioning your feet a certain way or why you're swinging the racket with a specific motion.Budgeting: When managing finances, rather than simply allocating money based on percentages or general advice, delve into the reasons behind each budget choice. For instance, why should you save a certain percentage for retirement? Understanding the logic behind these decisions makes them more meaningful and easier to stick to.Reading News: When you read a news article, don't take it at face value. Ask yourself why certain events are happening, what led to them, and what the implications might be. This approach will give you a more profound understanding of global events and their interconnectedness.Gardening: When planting, don't just put seeds in the ground. Understand why certain plants need more sun, why some should be planted in the spring versus the fall, or why particular soil types are better for certain plants. This deeper understanding can lead to a more thriving garden.In all these situations, the underlying principle is the same: don't just accept or follow information. Dive deeper, make connections, and ask yourself why things are the way they are. This active engagement not only helps in understanding the task at hand better but also enhances memory retention and application in future scenarios.Yeah when following written instructions for building a prefabricated shed, you kind of make hypothesis of how all of the pieces fit together, and what they are used for in other stepsChatGPTExactly! When assembling something as complex as a prefabricated shed, the process involves more than just blindly following the steps. Here's how the self-explanation strategy plays out in this context:Making Predictions: Before diving into the instructions, you might glance at the different parts and materials provided and make educated guesses or hypotheses about where each piece might fit and its function.Understanding Purpose: For each step in the instruction, rather than just fitting pieces together, you might ask, "Why is this piece used here?" or "How does this contribute to the overall stability and structure of the shed?"Connecting Steps: As you move from one step to the next, you'd relate the current step to the previous one. You might think, "This step is building upon the foundation we laid in the last step," or "This part reinforces what we assembled earlier."Troubleshooting: If something doesn't fit or seems out of place, instead of feeling frustrated, you'd engage in problem-solving. "Did I miss a step? Is there a reason this doesn't align? What have I overlooked?"Visualizing the End Result: As you progress, you'd likely be visualizing the finished shed in your mind, thinking about how each component contributes to the final product.Reflecting on the Process: Once the shed is assembled, taking a moment to review the process, thinking about what each part does, and how they all come together can reinforce your understanding and make it easier if you ever have to assemble something similar in the future.This method of active engagement and self-explanation not only makes the assembly process more intuitive but also enhances the satisfaction of seeing the completed shed, knowing that you truly understand its structure and components.So it is kind of like the curry-howard isomorphism. The instructions are the program and the working shed at the end is the proof. One time someone got stuck I had to undo a bunch of steps remove the roof and flip a few of the frame pieces. aroundChatGPTThat's a rather insightful analogy! The Curry-Howard isomorphism establishes a correspondence between computer programs and mathematical proofs, and it seems you've applied that perspective to shed assembly.Program = Instructions: Just like in programming where code specifies a set of instructions to be executed, the manual for the shed provides a series of steps to follow.Proof = Working Shed: The proof in the Curry-Howard isomorphism verifies the correctness of a theorem, just as the completion and functionality of the shed validates the accuracy and effectiveness of the instructions.Refactoring & Debugging: In programming, when something goes wrong or when an inefficiency is detected, we refactor or debug the code. Similarly, when you found an issue during the assembly (like the misplacement of roof or frame pieces), you had to "debug" by undoing several steps and making the necessary corrections.In this analogy, each step of the assembly and each part of the shed corresponds to lines of code and functions or modules in a program. If one part is out of place, it can affect the whole system, just as a bug in code can cause a program to malfunction.The self-explanation strategy, in this context, would be akin to commenting on or documenting code. By understanding each step, why it's there, and how it fits into the overall structure, you're better equipped to troubleshoot issues and achieve a successful end result.I am building a house from a blueprint now. There are some things that are not specified exactly and you have to consult building codes or online instructionsChatGPTBuilding a house from a blueprint is a significant undertaking and, much like programming or assembling a shed, requires careful attention to detail, interpretation, and troubleshooting. Here's how the process of constructing a house can relate to the aforementioned concepts:Blueprint = High-level Design/Specification: Just as a program's design might be outlined in high-level pseudocode or specifications, the blueprint provides an overview of the house's structure. It lays out the primary components and their relationships.Building Codes = Syntax & Semantics: In programming, syntax refers to the rules that dictate how program statements must be written, and semantics refers to the meaning behind these statements. Building codes serve a similar function in construction, ensuring that the house is built safely and efficiently according to accepted standards.Online Instructions & Consultations = Libraries & Frameworks: Just as a programmer might consult documentation or use external libraries to achieve specific functionalities without "reinventing the wheel," a builder might refer to online instructions or experts to address details not explicitly covered in the blueprint.Ambiguities & Gaps: No blueprint can cover every single detail of a construction process, just as no program specification can account for every possible scenario. In such cases, builders rely on their expertise, best practices, and external resources to fill in the gaps and make judgment calls.Iterative Building & Testing: As construction progresses, there are phases of building, inspecting, and sometimes revising based on unforeseen challenges, much like the iterative process of writing, testing, and debugging code.The self-explanation strategy can again be applied here. By consistently questioning and understanding each step of the construction process, why certain materials are used, how they fit into the overall structure, and the implications of building decisions, you're better equipped to handle ambiguities, ensure the safety and longevity of the house, and achieve a successful end result.Some steps might be communative or non communitive. For example, the wiring and plumbing should be done before the walls are drywalled, and the the first floor before the roof,  but it is arbitrary whether you start at the front of the back, whether the doors or windows are installed first and sometimes you can work around other workers schedules or delivery schedulesChatGPTAbsolutely! In both programming and construction, certain tasks or operations are commutative, meaning their order can be switched without affecting the end result, while others are non-commutative, and must be done in a specific sequence to achieve the desired outcome.Using your construction example:Non-commutative steps:The foundation must be set before you start building the walls.As you mentioned, wiring and plumbing should be done before the walls are sealed with drywall.The basic structural frame of the house must be up before you can put on the roof.Commutative steps:Whether you install the windows before the doors or vice-versa won't generally affect the final product as long as both are done after the walls are up but before any interior finishing begins.Within a certain phase, like during framing, you might choose to start at the front or the back of the house based on convenience or other non-sequential reasons.The installation of fixtures in different rooms can often be done in any order.Flexibility in the order of commutative steps can be advantageous, as it allows for better coordination around external factors, like worker availability, material delivery delays, or even weather conditions.This principle can be found in many disciplines. In programming, certain lines of code or functions can be rearranged without changing the program's outcome, while others must be executed in a strict order. Understanding which steps or operations are commutative and which are non-commutative is crucial in efficiently organizing tasks, optimizing workflows, and troubleshooting issues.Give more explicit connection to the mathematical topics we've discussedChatGPTCertainly! Let's delve into a deeper connection between the construction process and mathematical principles, particularly with respect to the topics of self-explanation and the Curry-Howard isomorphism.Self-Explanation:Math: When studying a mathematical proof, one employs self-explanation to clarify each step, linking it to prior knowledge, and understanding the logic. If a step in the proof is unclear, one might have to reference earlier theorems or definitions to grasp its significance.Construction: In the building process, if an aspect of the blueprint is ambiguous, you would resort to prior knowledge, building codes, or additional resources. This mirrors the self-explanation process in math; you're effectively "explaining" the construction step in terms of other known information.Curry-Howard Isomorphism:Math/Programming: The Curry-Howard isomorphism establishes a correspondence between computer programs and mathematical proofs. In this analogy, a proof in logic corresponds to a program in a type-theoretic language, and a proved theorem corresponds to a type (or specification) that the program inhabits.Construction: The blueprint for your house can be thought of as the "program." The finished house, when built according to code and specifications, serves as the "proof" that the blueprint (program) is correct. If there's an error in construction (analogous to a bug in a program), you have to "debug" by perhaps deconstructing a part of the house and rebuilding.Commutativity:Math: In mathematics, particularly in algebra, operations like addition and multiplication are commutative for real numbers, meaning the order doesn't matter (e.g., a+b=b+aa + b = b + aa+b=b+a). However, many operations, like matrix multiplication or subtraction, are non-commutative.Construction: As you mentioned, certain construction tasks can be done in any order (commutative) like installing doors and windows, while others must follow a strict sequence (non-commutative) like laying the foundation before erecting walls. Recognizing which tasks are order-sensitive is crucial for efficient and correct construction.The parallels here highlight that many processes, whether in math, programming, or construction, require a rigorous and systematic approach. Recognizing patterns, applying logic, and referencing prior knowledge are essential in all these disciplines.I think that the terminology is often different and it might not be recognized as math because it is so complicated and uses so many heuristics and shortcuts that are unwritten or impliedChatGPTAbsolutely, and this is an insightful observation. The underlying principles between different disciplines often share fundamental similarities, but the terminology and specific methodologies may vary widely. This can obscure the common logical structures and patterns that underpin them.Terminology Differences:In mathematics, we discuss theorems, proofs, lemmas, and corollaries.In construction, it's about blueprints, codes, plans, and specifications.In cooking, it's recipes, ingredients, methods, and techniques.Each discipline has its own jargon, but beneath the surface, many of the processes involve a systematic application of knowledge, a sequence of steps to achieve an end result, and error-checking along the way.Implicit Knowledge & Heuristics:Experienced professionals in any field develop a kind of "intuition" or heuristics that guide their decisions. These shortcuts are often based on years of experience and are sometimes so ingrained they aren't even consciously recognized.For instance, a seasoned carpenter might be able to judge distances or angles by eye without using a ruler or protractor. A mathematician might see a complex equation and immediately recognize a simplifying strategy because they've encountered similar problems so many times before.Unwritten Rules:Every discipline has its "best practices" that aren't always explicitly stated in textbooks or manuals but are passed down through mentorship, hands-on experience, or communal knowledge.In mathematics, there's a "feel" for when a particular approach to a problem might be fruitful, even if it's not the most direct or obvious path.In construction, there might be unwritten rules about the order of tasks based on the practical experience of what works best in different situations.These observations highlight the importance of interdisciplinary thinking. Recognizing the underlying patterns and structures that span across different fields can lead to innovative solutions, more efficient methodologies, and a deeper understanding of the world around us. The beauty lies in the universality of logical thinking, no matter the domain.I coined the term "functional reactive math" to describe this processChatGPT"Functional Reactive Math" is a fascinating term that seems to blend ideas from functional programming, reactive programming, and mathematical reasoning. Here's a speculative breakdown based on the name and the context you've provided:Functional:This likely refers to the idea of functions as first-class citizens, as seen in functional programming. In math, functions map inputs to outputs without side effects. In construction, each task or module (e.g., installing a window, laying a foundation) can be thought of as a function that transforms the state of a building from one stage to the next.The emphasis would be on composition, where smaller tasks or functions are combined to create more complex behaviors or structures.Reactive:In programming, reactive paradigms respond to changes or events. Applied to math or construction, this could refer to the idea of adapting or responding to changes in real-time. For instance, if a particular construction material is delayed, the schedule or order of tasks might need to be adjusted reactively.The system would be set up to "listen" for certain conditions or changes and then adjust accordingly.Math:This underscores the logical and structured approach to the process. Every decision, action, or adjustment is rooted in mathematical reasoning, whether it's optimizing the order of tasks, ensuring structural integrity, or calculating material quantities.In a real-world scenario like construction, "Functional Reactive Math" might describe a method where each construction task is a function, and the entire construction process is a composition of these functions. If an unexpected event occurs (like a delay in materials or weather disruptions), the process reacts by recalculating and adjusting the sequence of tasks. The entire methodology would be deeply rooted in mathematical principles to optimize efficiency, costs, and time.If you're developing this concept further, it would be intriguing to delve into how this approach could be formalized and how it contrasts with traditional methods in various fields. It also opens up avenues for software tools that embody this paradigm, aiding professionals in dynamically adjusting their workflows based on real-time feedback.Develop the concept a bit further.ChatGPTAlright, let's delve deeper into the "Functional Reactive Math" (FRM) paradigm, especially as it applies to real-world tasks like construction:1. Foundations of FRM:Functional Principles:Modularity: Each task in a project can be represented as an independent, self-contained module (or function). This module takes specific inputs (resources, time, prior tasks) and produces outputs (a completed sub-part of the project).Composition: Bigger tasks can be broken down into these smaller modules. The overall project progresses by chaining or nesting these modules, much like how functions can be composed in mathematics.Statelessness: Ideally, each task or function doesn't rely on external mutable states. This makes tasks more predictable and easier to manage. However, in real-world scenarios, certain states (like weather conditions) are inevitable, but their effects can be minimized or managed.Reactive Principles:Event-Driven: The system constantly monitors for specific events or triggers. These might include unexpected issues like supply delays, or planned events like inspections.Adaptive: On detecting an event, the system recalculates the best path forward. It might delay certain tasks, prioritize others, or even call for a revisiting of completed tasks if required.Feedback Loops: After adapting, the system gauges the results of its adjustments, feeding this data back into its decision-making process. This continuous feedback ensures that the system can refine its strategies over time.2. Applying FRM in Construction:Planning Phase: Decompose the entire construction process into functional modules. For a house, this might include foundations, walls, roof, electrical wiring, plumbing, etc. Each of these modules would then be further broken down.Scheduling: Using mathematical optimization strategies (like linear programming), determine the most efficient order to execute these modules, considering constraints like dependencies between tasks, availability of resources, etc.Monitoring: Sensors and software tools track the progress of the construction in real-time, monitoring for events that might disrupt the schedule.Adaptation: When disruptions occur, the system recalculates the optimal path forward, adjusting tasks and schedules on-the-fly. For example, if there's a delay in the delivery of bricks, the system might prioritize internal wiring or plumbing until the bricks arrive.Feedback: As the project progresses, the system collects data on the actual time taken for tasks, resource consumption, etc., refining its internal models and predictions.3. Advantages of FRM:Flexibility: The reactive nature allows the system to adjust to unexpected changes, making the entire process more resilient.Efficiency: By optimizing task sequences and reacting in real-time, the system can potentially save time and resources.Predictability: By breaking tasks into functional modules and minimizing external states, outcomes become more predictable, reducing risks.4. Challenges:Complexity: Implementing an FRM system requires sophisticated software tools, sensors, and possibly even AI-driven decision-making processes.Initial Setup: Decomposing tasks functionally and setting up monitoring systems requires an initial investment of time and resources.Resistance to Change: Traditional industries might be resistant to adopting such a novel approach, and there's a learning curve involved.In conclusion, "Functional Reactive Math" offers a structured, adaptive, and data-driven approach to managing complex projects. While it requires a significant shift in methodology and tools, the potential benefits in efficiency, adaptability, and predictability make it a compelling strategy to consider.I was thinking more of the abstract non technical applications. Obviously larger construction projects have more explicit specifications. There are several framing inspections before certain work can proceed, but it is important to find a balance between doing little tasks, setting up staging, and breaking the task up into smaller and smaller modulesChatGPTUnderstood. Let's re-approach the concept of "Functional Reactive Math" (FRM) in more abstract, non-technical terms, emphasizing its general applicability to tasks and processes beyond construction:Functional Reactive Math in Everyday Contexts:Functional Principles:Modularity: The idea is that any task, no matter how complex, can be broken down into simpler sub-tasks or steps. This mirrors how we naturally approach challenges: by dissecting them into more manageable pieces. For instance, planning a party can be segmented into invitations, venue selection, menu planning, etc.Composition: Once you've identified these sub-tasks, you can assemble them in various ways to achieve the larger goal. This is akin to putting together a puzzle: you focus on small sections, and as those sections come together, you start seeing the bigger picture.Statelessness: In an ideal scenario, each sub-task should be complete in itself without relying on external, unpredictable factors. In reality, this is challenging, but the aim is to minimize these dependencies. For example, while baking, you'd ideally want all ingredients ready before you begin, rather than running to the store midway.Reactive Principles:Event-Driven: Life is unpredictable. Instead of rigidly sticking to a plan, it's essential to be aware of changing circumstances and adjust accordingly. If rain spoils your outdoor event, having a backup indoor venue is a reactive solution.Adaptive: Being adaptable means recalibrating your approach based on current circumstances. If you're organizing a study group, and a key member can't make it, you might reschedule or find alternative ways to share the information with them.Feedback Loops: After each task or event, reflect on what went well and what could've been better. This self-assessment ensures that you're always improving. After a workout, for instance, you might adjust the intensity or duration based on how you felt during and after.FRM in Daily Tasks:Morning Routine: Your alarm didn't go off, and you're running late (Event). Instead of your usual hour-long routine, you adapt by shortening each activity (Functional Modular Breakdown) and prioritizing essential tasks.Cooking: You're preparing a meal, but realize midway you're missing an ingredient (Event). Instead of panicking, you adapt by substituting with something available (Reactivity), ensuring the dish still tastes good.Work/Study Sessions: You planned a 3-hour study session, but you're getting distracted (Event). Instead of forcing through, you adapt by breaking it into smaller, focused time blocks (Functional Modularity) with breaks in between.Conclusion:At its core, FRM is about embracing the natural, human approach to problem-solving, which involves breaking tasks down, adapting to circumstances, and learning from experiences. By understanding these principles, we can navigate daily challenges more efficiently and effectively.I think making a painting is similar except you only need to show what it looks like from one angle and are thinking of the dynamics of color mixing and light and visual composition.ChatGPTAbsolutely! Painting and the art creation process indeed bear resemblance to the principles of Functional Reactive Math (FRM). Let's dive into how the world of painting embodies these concepts:Functional Reactive Math in the Painting Process:Functional Principles:Modularity: When starting a painting, artists often break down their composition into individual elements or focal points. For instance, in a landscape painting, there might be the sky, the foreground, a water body, and maybe some wildlife. Each of these can be thought of as a 'module' or sub-task in the larger composition.Composition: After identifying these elements, an artist decides how they should be arranged on the canvas. They consider elements like balance, symmetry, and the rule of thirds to compose a visually pleasing scene.Statelessness: Although every brush stroke influences the next in a painting, each element or section of the painting can be created and appreciated in its own right. The sky doesn't need the forest to be complete, though they influence one another when viewed together.Reactive Principles:Event-Driven: Artists must often adapt to unexpected events. Maybe a certain shade of blue runs out, or a brush stroke doesn't go as planned. The painter reacts to these 'events' and modifies their approach.Adaptive: As the painting progresses, an artist may realize that a particular shade or element isn't working as they initially imagined. They might then choose to adapt by overlaying a new color, adjusting the light and shadow, or even painting over an area.Feedback Loops: Artists frequently step back to view their work from a distance, gaining a fresh perspective. This allows them to assess the current state of their painting and decide on the next steps. This constant feedback loop helps in refining the artwork.FRM in the Painting Process:Choosing a Subject: The artist may have an initial idea but adapts it based on the size of the canvas, available colors, and their current mood or inspiration.Layering: Painting often involves layers. An artist might lay down a background color (Functional Modularity), then react to how it dries or its interaction with subsequent layers (Reactivity).Final Touches: As the painting nears completion, the artist tweaks elements based on how they come together (Composition) and the feedback received from peers or their own critical eye.Conclusion:Painting, much like other tasks in life, is a balance between planning and reacting. The canvas embodies both the artist's initial vision and the unexpected turns that the creative process took along the way. Understanding the FRM principles helps appreciate the depth and dynamism involved in creating a piece of art.So maybe this is obvious but learning to cook and build models and installation and repair can develop into activities like building a house or writing programsChatGPTAbsolutely. The skills and methodologies acquired in simpler tasks such as cooking, model building, installation, and repair can be foundational and scale up to more complex tasks like constructing a house or writing software programs. Here's how:Cooking:Fundamental Concepts: Measuring ingredients, understanding reactions (e.g., how baking powder works), sequencing (when to add which ingredient), and temperature control.Scaling Up: These principles are similar to chemical engineering, where precise measurements, reactions, and sequencing are critical. The process of creating a complex dish can also parallel project management in larger tasks.Building Models:Fundamental Concepts: Following instructions, understanding the significance of each part, patience, precision, and envisioning a 3D structure from a 2D blueprint.Scaling Up: Architectural design and construction. The precise and methodical approach of model building translates well into constructing real-world structures.Installation and Repair:Fundamental Concepts: Troubleshooting, understanding systems and components, reading manuals, and applying solutions.Scaling Up: These skills are foundational for roles like systems engineering or maintenance engineering in large facilities. Diagnosing issues and knowing how systems work together is vital.Programming:Fundamental Concepts: Logic, sequencing, loops, and conditionals in simple tasks or programs.Scaling Up: Building complex software or even operating systems. The basics of coding lay the groundwork for developing intricate systems and software solutions.In essence, many skills begin with simple tasks but have the potential to scale up to more advanced applications. As one progresses from basic to advanced levels, the foundational principles remain, but their implementation becomes more intricate and requires a deeper understanding. This progression not only aids skill development but also helps in recognizing patterns and drawing parallels across different domains.A list of all of the topics we've discussed.ChatGPTCertainly! Here's a summary of the topics we've discussed:Concept of Ambiguity:Definition and examples.Role in language and machine learning.Theorem and Proofs:Importance in mathematics.How students read and understand them.The challenge of reading mathematical texts.The approach mathematicians take in reading.Self-Explanation Training:Difference from monitoring or paraphrasing.Application and importance in learning.Practical Analogy with the Curry-Howard Isomorphism:Comparing the process of building (from instructions/blueprints) to the process of proving theorems.House Building from a Blueprint:Steps and sequencing in construction.Implications of commutativity in construction tasks.Functional Reactive Math:A term coined to describe practical applications of math.Comparison of Different Activities and Their Underlying Mathematical Foundations:CookingBuilding modelsInstallation and repairProgrammingArtistic Endeavors and their Mathematical Underpinnings:Painting and its relation to visual composition and dynamics.The Notion that Simple Activities Can Scale Up:How skills acquired in simpler tasks can be foundational for more complex tasks.Throughout our discussion, we've navigated through mathematical concepts, practical applications, and the intersections between them. We've touched on the relationship between basic activities and the foundational principles behind them that can scale up to more complex tasks.ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.
