Summarize: [EDIT: there is an ongoing confrontation between physicists, from different areas of expertise, concerning talk of energy conservation in cosmological settings. This post DOES talk in terms of energy conservation. This is in the spirit of how Guth thought about energy when he first came up with the ideas of inflation. The original purpose of writing this was to help me understand what HE meant ... as the subject has developed that way of thinking has gone out of favor ... I'll leave it at that so you can do your own exploration of this topic] 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

One nice way to develop some intuition for the evolution of the expanding universe is to learn a few formulas for the different energy types and then use energy conservation to calculate how the universe will expand with time.

The early universe goes through three distinct periods where the universe is dominated by one of three types of energy:

1. Vacuum energy
2. Radiation energy
3. Matter energy

Common to all three phases though is gravity so we should add:

4. Gravitational energy

So then we can describe the three phases in energy terms:

1. Gravitational energy generating vacuum energy (inflation)
2. Radiation energy losing energy back to gravity (redshift, radiation pressure)
3. Matter energy decoupled from gravitational energy (pressureless expansion)

Using a textbook formula for gravitational energy, I show below how we can use this to calculate the expansion curve for the matter phase. The result is a 2/3 power law:

a(t) ��� t^(2/3)

This matches our intuition about gravity between masses (at rest) as an attractive force which should slow down the rate of the universe's expansion over time, even though there in no actual energy exchange taking place.

Summary:
There is debate among physicists regarding energy conservation in cosmological contexts. The post explores this concept, referencing how Alan Guth originally conceived energy during the development of inflationary theory. To understand the expansion of the universe, it's essential to consider different energy types dominating distinct phases:
Vacuum energy
Radiation energy
Matter energy
Gravitational energy (common in all phases)
These phases depict:
Gravitational energy leading to vacuum energy (inflation).
Radiation energy reverting to gravitational energy (manifested as redshift and radiation pressure).
Matter energy independent of gravitational energy (undergoing pressureless expansion).
Using gravitational energy formulas, the expansion curve for the matter phase can be determined to follow a 2/3 power law: a(t) ��� t^(2/3). This supports the notion of gravity acting as a decelerative force on the universe's expansion, even without a direct energy exchange.

It seems that the natural state of the universe is not Minkowski space but de Sitter space.

Certainly it seems that the very early phase of the universe must have been de Sitter like : the inflationary phase.

For reasons largely unknown, that structure broke down: the universe got polluted with quantum particles. Those particles' gravitational attraction distorted the de Sitter structure.

But the underlying de Sitter structure ensured that continued expansion dilutes away those particles, returning the universe to its pure de Sitter structure.

For our own universe that process of dilution took order 10 billion years, so we happen to be living through the beginning of that transition: the so called Cosmic Coincidence.

Summary:
The universe's inherent state appears to be de Sitter space, rather than Minkowski space. The initial phase of the universe, known as the inflationary phase, likely exhibited de Sitter characteristics. At some point, this structure was disrupted due to the emergence of quantum particles, which distorted the de Sitter structure through gravitational attraction. However, the fundamental de Sitter nature ensures that ongoing expansion will gradually diminish these particles, eventually reverting the universe back to a pure de Sitter state. For our universe, this dilution process spanned approximately 10 billion years, and we currently exist at the onset of this transition, a phenomenon referred to as the "Cosmic Coincidence."

Sure, let's link the two concepts:
The universe's evolution and expansion are closely related to the varying dominance of different types of energy. As previously discussed, there were three main phases dominated by vacuum energy, radiation energy, and matter energy. Adding gravitational energy, which permeates all phases, gives us a comprehensive view of the universe's dynamics.
Now, linking this to the idea of de Sitter space:
Vacuum Energy & de Sitter Space:
The early universe's inflationary phase, dominated by vacuum energy, closely aligns with the de Sitter space concept. During inflation, the universe experienced rapid expansion, akin to the expansion described in a de Sitter universe.
Quantum Particles & Disruption of de Sitter Structure:
As the universe evolved, quantum particles emerged, which influenced gravitational dynamics and energy. This influx of particles could be seen as the universe transitioning from its dominant vacuum energy phase, potentially disrupting the pure de Sitter structure.
Dilution of Particles & Return to de Sitter:
As the universe continued expanding, matter and radiation energy played pivotal roles. This expansion, as described, dilutes the quantum particles, aligning with the notion of the universe returning to its inherent de Sitter state. The 2/3 power law (a(t) ��� t^(2/3)) for the matter phase indicates how this expansion and dilution occur over time.
Cosmic Coincidence:
Living through the beginning of the transition back to a pure de Sitter state is the 'Cosmic Coincidence'. This may be connected to the gravitational energy's influence, as it impacts all phases of the universe's evolution.
In summary, the universe's energy dynamics and its inherent preference for a de Sitter space structure are interconnected, painting a holistic picture of cosmological evolution.

In mathematical physics, n-dimensional de Sitter space (often abbreviated to dSn) is a maximally symmetric Lorentzian manifold with constant positive scalar curvature. It is the Lorentzian analogue of an n-sphere (with its canonical Riemannian metric).

The main application of de Sitter space is its use in general relativity, where it serves as one of the simplest mathematical models of the universe consistent with the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. More specifically, de Sitter space is the maximally symmetric vacuum solution of Einstein's field equations with a positive cosmological constant {\displaystyle \Lambda }\Lambda  (corresponding to a positive vacuum energy density and negative pressure).

de Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space are named after Willem de Sitter (1872���1934),[1][2] professor of astronomy at Leiden University and director of the Leiden Observatory. Willem de Sitter and Albert Einstein worked closely together in Leiden in the 1920s on the spacetime structure of our universe. de Sitter space was also discovered, independently, and about the same time, by Tullio Levi-Civita.[3]

Definition
de Sitter space can be defined as a submanifold of a generalized Minkowski space of one higher dimension. Take Minkowski space R1,n with the standard metric:

{\displaystyle ds^{2}=-dx_{0}^{2}+\sum _{i=1}^{n}dx_{i}^{2}.}{\displaystyle ds^{2}=-dx_{0}^{2}+\sum _{i=1}^{n}dx_{i}^{2}.}
de Sitter space is the submanifold described by the hyperboloid of one sheet

{\displaystyle -x_{0}^{2}+\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{2}=\alpha ^{2},}{\displaystyle -x_{0}^{2}+\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{2}=\alpha ^{2},}
where {\displaystyle \alpha }\alpha  is some nonzero constant with its dimension being that of length. The metric on de Sitter space is the metric induced from the ambient Minkowski metric. The induced metric is nondegenerate and has Lorentzian signature. (Note that if one replaces {\displaystyle \alpha ^{2}}\alpha ^{2} with {\displaystyle -\alpha ^{2}}-\alpha ^{2} in the above definition, one obtains a hyperboloid of two sheets. The induced metric in this case is positive-definite, and each sheet is a copy of hyperbolic n-space. For a detailed proof, see Minkowski space �� Geometry.)
de Sitter space can also be defined as the quotient O(1, n) / O(1, n ��� 1) of two indefinite orthogonal groups, which shows that it is a non-Riemannian symmetric space.

Topologically, de Sitter space is R �� Sn���1 (so that if n ��� 3 then de Sitter space is simply connected).

PySR3is an open-source library for practical symbolic regression, a type of machine learning 
which aims to discover human-interpretable symbolic models. PySR was developed to democra- 
tize and popularize symbolic regression for the sciences, and is built on a high-performance dis- 
tributed backend, a l exible search algorithm, and interfaces with several deep learning packages. 
PySR���s internal search algorithm is a multi-population evolutionary algorithm, which consists 
of a unique evolve-simplify-optimize loop, designed for optimization of unknown scalar constants 
in newly-discovered empirical expressions.PySR���s backend is an extremely optimized Julia li- 
brary SymbolicRegression.jl4, which can be used directly from Julia. It is capable of fusing 
user-def i ned operators into SIMD kernels at runtime, performing automatic dif f erentiation, and 
distributing populations of expressions to thousands of cores across a cluster. In describing this 
software, we also introduce a new benchmark, ���EmpiricalBench,��� to quantify the applicability of 
symbolic regression algorithms in science. This benchmark measures recovery of historical empirical 
equations from original and synthetic datasets. 
1 Introduction 
Johannes Kepler discovered his famous third law of 
planetary motion, (period)2��� (radius)3, from search- 
ing for patterns in thirty years of data produced by 
Tycho Brahe���s unaided eye. Kepler did not discover 
this by searching through all conceivable relationships 
with a genetic algorithm on a computer, but by his 
own geometrical intuition. ���And it was Kepler���s Third 
Law, not an apple, that led Isaac Newton to discover 
the law of gravitation��� [1]. Likewise, Planck���s law was 
not derived from i rst principles, but was a symbolic 
form i t to data [2]. This symbolic relationship would 
inspire the development of Quantum Mechanics. 
Now, this i rst step���discovering empirical rela-

tionships from data or based on human intuition��� 
is both dif i cult and time-consuming, even for low- 
dimensional data where it has been shown to be NP- 
hard [3].In modern, high-dimensional datasets, it 
seems an impossible task to discover simple symbolic 
relationships without the use of automated tools. 
This brings us to an optimization problem known 
as ���symbolic regression,��� or SR. In this paper, we de- 
scribe an algorithm for performing SR, and describe 
software dedicated to equation discovery in the sci- 
ences. 
Symbolic Regression.SR describes a supervised 
learning task where the model space is spanned by 
analytic expressions. This is commonly solved in a 
multi-objective optimization framework, jointly min-

imizing prediction error and model complexity.In 
this family of algorithms, instead of i tting concrete 
parameters in some overparameterized general model, 
one searches the space of simple analytic expressions 
for accurate and interpretable models.In the his- 
tory of science, scientists have often performed SR 
���manually,��� using a combination of their intuition and 
trial-and-error to i nd simple and accurate empirical 
expressions. These empirical expressions then might 
lead to new theoretical insights, such as the afore- 
mentioned discoveries of Kepler and Planck leading 
to classical and quantum mechanics respectively. SR 
algorithms automate this discovery of empirical equa- 
tions, exploiting the power of modern computing to 
test many more expressions than our intuition alone 
could sort through. 
SR saw early developments as a tool for science be- 
ginning in the 1970s and 1980s, with works such as [4], 
and the creation of the tool Bacon in [5] with fur- 
ther development in, e.g., [6, 7]. Via a combination 
of heuristic strategies for brute force searching over 
possible expression trees, Bacon and its follow-ups 
such as Fahrenheit [8], demonstrated the ability to 
discovery a variety of simple physics laws from ideal- 
ized data. The use of genetic algorithms, which allow 
for a more l exible search space and fewer prior as- 
sumptions about these expressions, was popularized 
with the work of [9]. Finally, with the development of 
the user-friendly tools Eureqa in [10, 11, 12], as well 
as HeuristicLab in [13], SR started to become practi- 
cal for use on real-world and noisy scientif i c data and 
empirical equations.

Symbolic Regression (SR):
Definition
: A supervised learning method where the model space is described by analytic expressions.
Functionality
: Instead of fitting fixed parameters in a general model, SR searches for simple analytic expressions that can serve as accurate, interpretable models.

Tools like Bacon were introduced, which used heuristic strategies to search over potential expression trees, helping identify basic physics laws from idealized data.
Genetic algorithms offered a more flexible search space and reduced prior assumptions.
User-friendly tools like Eureqa and HeuristicLab made SR more practical for real-world scientific data.
In summary, this work presents the PySR tool, aiming to provide a powerful and optimized platform for symbolic regression, making it easier to find meaningful symbolic models in scientific datasets.

Equation Discovery for Science.Today Eureqa 
is a closed-source proprietary tool, and has fallen out 
of common use in the sciences. In addition to other 
early work such as [14, 15, 16, 17], there have recently 
been a signif i cant number of exciting new develop- 
ments in SR as well as SR for science. These have 
largely been focused on genetic algorithms on expres- 
sions represented as trees, and include core advances 
to genetic algorithms, such as [18, 19], which propose 
modif i ed strategies for selecting an individual to mu- 
tate and [20, 21] which use an adaptive form of recom- 
bination based on emerging statistical patterns. New 
strategies for SR altogether have also been developed: 
in particular, our previous work [22, 23, 24] proposes 
SR as a way of interpreting a neural network. Neural 
networks can ef i ciently i nd low-dimensional patterns 
in high-dimensional data, and so this mixed strat- 
egy also presents a way of performing SR on high- 
dimensional or non-tabular data. 
Additional techniques include [25, 26] which pro- 
pose a Markov chain Monte Carlo-like sampling for 
SR; [27, 28] which trains deep generative models to 
propose mutated expressions; [29, 30] which pre-train 
a large transformer model on billions of synthetic ex- 
amples, in order to autoregressively generate expres- 
sions from data; [31, 32, 33] which develop techniques 
for discovering symmetries with SR; [34] which opti- 
mizes a sparse set of coef i cients in a very large pre- 
def i ned expression with stochastic gradient descent; 
and i nally [35, 36] which apply genetic algorithms to 
a l exible space of dif f erential equations. 
Apart from trees, a few other data structures 
are used for representing symbolic expressions, such 
as imperative representations (���Linear Genetic Pro- 
gramming���) [e.g., 37, 38, 39, 40], and sequence repre- 
sentations [e.g., 29, 30, 32]. One of the most popular 
alternatives to genetic algorithms on trees, especially 
for the study of PDEs, is ���SINDy��� (Sparse Identi- 
i cation of Nonlinear Dynamics)[41, 42, 43] which 
represents expressions as linear combination of a dic- 
tionary of i xed nonlinear expressions. Similar ideas 
of a linear basis of terms is used in the initializa- 
tion of the ���Operon��� genetic algorithm [44], as well 
as in ���FFX��� [45]. This strategy can also be combined 
with deep learning [e.g., 43, 46, 47, 48, 49] or other 
techniques to i nd expressions on high-dimensional 
data [e.g., 36]. Additional techniques include mixed 
integer nonlinear programming [50] and greedy tree 
searches [51], and combining theory as a type of con- 
straint over the space of models [52]. 
However, here we argue that many existing algo- 
rithms lack certain features which make them prac- 
tical in a broad setting for discovering interpretable 
equations in science. The requirements for ���scientif i c 
SR��� are signif i cantly more dif i cult than for SR ap- 
plied to synthetic datasets, which many algorithms 
are implicitly trained on via synthetic benchmarks.

1. an empirical equation in science quite often 
contains unknown real constants5The set of 
5One could argue that any constant in a scientif i c model must 
depend on a i nite number of known constants of physics 
(e.g., the speed of light) and mathematics (e.g., ��). How- 
ever, this introduces signif i cantly more complexity than is

possible expressions considered by some SR 
algorithms such as [31]: operators, integers, 
and variables���is discrete and i nite up to a 
given max size. This set is even searchable 
with brute force, as is used in [31] in com- 
bination with a symmetry and dimensional 
analysis module.However, with arbitrary 
real constants, the set of equations one must 
search is uncountably inf i nite. The dif i culty 
of searching this set is further compounded 
by several factors: 
2. The discovered equation must provide in- 
sight into the nature of the problem. The 
equation which often holds the most insight, 
and is therefore adopted by scientists, is not 
always the most accurate (many other ML 
algorithms could be used instead for accu- 
racy), but is instead an equation which bal- 
ances accuracy with simplicity. 
3. An empirical equation in science is discov- 
ered from data containing noise, which often 
has heteroscedastic structure. 
4. Many empirical equations are not dif f eren- 
tiable, instead being composed of dif f erent 
expressions active in only parts of parame- 
ter space (e.g., exp(x) for x < 0 and x2+ 1 
for x ��� 0). 
5. Discovered expressions in science must sat- 
isfy known constraints, e.g., mass conserva- 
tion. 
6. Empirical relations are frequently comprised 
of operators which are unique to one partic- 
ular i eld of science, so the equation search 
strategy must allow for custom operators. 
7. Observationaldataisoftenhigh- 
dimensional, and the SR algorithm must 
either manage this internally, or be layered 
with a feature selection algorithm. 
8. The search tool must be capable of i nding 
relationships in non-tabular datasets, such 
as sequences, grids, and graphs (for example, 
by using aggregation operators such as P). 
9. Finally, and most importantly, any SR pack- 
age useful to scientists must be open-source, 
cross-platform, easy-to-use, and interface 
with common tools.For more discussion, 
being reduced, as the relationship with fundamental con- 
stants to derived constants might be arbitrarily complex. 
the references [53, 54] consider this from the 
point of view of the astrophysics community.

This passage discusses the challenges and intricacies involved in finding empirical equations in science through Symbolic Regression (SR) and introduces a new tool named "PySR" to address these challenges.
Summary:
Challenges in Empirical Equation Discovery:
Complexity of Constants
: While a scientific model's constants may depend on a finite number of known constants, like the speed of light or ��, they can introduce significant complexity, making the set of potential equations vast.
Insightful Equations
: The most insightful equation, which scientists tend to adopt, might not be the most accurate. It often balances accuracy with simplicity.
Noise in Data
: Data from which equations are derived often contains noise, which might have a heteroscedastic structure.
Non-differentiable Equations
: Many equations have parts that aren't differentiable, meaning they use different expressions depending on the parameter space.
Satisfying Known Constraints
: Found expressions should align with known constraints, like mass conservation.
Custom Operators
: Empirical relations might use operators specific to a scientific field, so the search strategy needs flexibility for custom operators.
High-dimensional Observational Data
: The SR algorithm should either handle high-dimensional data or be paired with a feature selection method.
Handling Non-tabular Data
: The tool must be adept at finding relationships in non-standard data structures, such as sequences, grids, and graphs.
Open-Source & User-Friendly SR Packages
: An effective SR tool for scientists should be open-source, cross-platform, user-friendly, and compatible with common tools.
Introduction of PySR:
PySR is introduced as a Python and Julia package designed specifically for Scientific Symbolic Regression.
The package is available as "pysr" on PyPI and Conda for Python and as "SymbolicRegression" for Julia.
The tool is developed with scientific discovery as the primary focus, meeting the outlined challenges for discovering empirical equations.
The authors' intention behind PySR's creation was its application in their own fields for equation discovery.
In essence, PySR is presented as a comprehensive tool that addresses the numerous challenges associated with deriving empirical equations in the scientific realm through symbolic regression. The subsequent sections of the paper likely provide a detailed discussion of how PySR meets these challenges.

2 Methods 
First, we give an in-depth discussion of the internal 
algorithm in PySR in section 2.1, and then describe 
the software implementation in section 2.2. We then 
discuss a few additional implementation features in 
section 2.3, section 2.4, and section 2.5. 
2.1 Algorithm 
PySR is a multi-population evolutionary algorithm 
with multiple evolutions performed asynchronously. 
The main loop of PySR, operating on each popula- 
tion independently, is a classic evolutionary algorithm 
based on tournament selection for individual selection 
(f i rst introduced in the thesis of [55] and generalized 
in [56]), and several mutations and crossovers for gen- 
erating new individuals. Evolutionary algorithms for 
SR was i rst popularized in [9], and has dominated the 
development of l exible SR algorithms since. PySR 
makes several modif i cations to this classic approach, 
some of which are motivated by results in recent work. 
A simple evolutionary algorithm proceeds as fol- 
lows: 1. Assume one has a population of individuals, 
a i tness function, and a set of mutation op- 
erators. 
2. Randomly select an ns-sized subset of indi- 
viduals from the population (e.g., classical

7github.com/MilesCranmer/SymbolicRegression.jl 
3 
Figure 1: A mutation operation applied to an expres- 
sion tree. 
Figure 2: A crossover operation between two expres- 
sion trees. 
tournament selection uses ns= 2, but larger 
tournaments are also allowed). 
3. Run the tournament by evaluating the i t- 
ness of every individual in that subset. 
4. Select the i ttest individual as the winner 
with probability p. Otherwise, remove this 
individual from the subset and repeat this 
step again.If there is one remaining, se- 
lect it.Thus, the probability will roughly 
be p,p(1���p),p(1���p)2,... for the i rst, sec- 
ond, third i ttest, and so on. 
5. Create a copy of this selected individual, and 
apply a randomly-selected mutation from a 
set of possible mutations. 
6. Replace a member of the population with 
the mutated individual. Here, one would re- 
place the weakest of the population or sub- 
set. 
This algorithm is computationally ef i cient and al- 
lows for massive parallelization by splitting step 2. 
into groups of individuals which can evolve indepen- 
dently, with asynchronous ���migration��� between the 
groups.For the i rst of the modif i cations, we re- 
place the eldest member of a population in step 5., 
rather than the individual with the lowest i tness, 
which is known as ���age-regularized��� evolution [57]. 
We record the age from the Unix time at which the 
individual was created during step 5.. Its inclusion in 
PySR was motivated by the impressive Neural Ar- 
chitecture Search results of [57, 58] ��� though it is 
worth noting similar regularizations used earlier in 
SR, e.g., [59] and [60] ��� which found this simple 
modif i cation could prevent early convergence without 
hurting performance. This prevents the population 
from specializing too quickly and getting stuck in a 
local minimum of the search space. The implemen- 
tation in [58] uses p = 1 and explores 4 ��� ns��� 64, 
though here we allow p to be less than 1, among sev- 
eral other dif f erences. 
Modif i cations.Our algorithm in PySR, i rst re- 
leased publicly in 2020 [61], makes three changes to 
this evolutionary algorithm. We apply simulated an- 
nealing [62] to step 4.: given a temperature T ��� [0,1], 
a mutation is rejected with some probability related 
to the change in i tness after mutation. The probabil- 
ity for rejection is p = exp ? 
LF���LE 
��T ? 
, for LFand LE 
the i tness of the mutated and original individual re- 
spectively, and �� a hyperparameter. This allows the 
evolution to alternate between high temperature and 
low temperature phases, with the high temperature 
phases increasing diversity of individuals and the low 
temperature phases narrowing in on the i ttest indi- 
viduals.�� controls the scale of temperature, with 
�� ��� ��� being equivalent to regular tournament selec- 
tion, and �� ��� 0 rejecting all mutations which lower 
i tness. Since the value of p also controls the diver- 
sity of the population, we can also couple the value 
of p to temperature, setting a larger value of p for 
a higher temperature, and a smaller value of p for 
a lower temperature. Simulated annealing is a sim- 
ple yet powerful strategy for optimizing over discrete spaces, and we i nd in section 3 that simulated an- 
nealing can signif i cantly speed up the search process. 
The second modif i cation we make to tournament 
selection is specif i c to the individuals we wish to 
consider: mathematical expressions. We embed the 
genetic algorithm inside an evolve-simplify-optimize 
loop.���Evolve��� is a repeated application of tourna- 
ment selection-based evolution for a set number of 
mutations. In other words, this is an entire evolu- 
tion of a population. ���Simplify��� here refers to equa- 
5 
tion simplif i cation���equations are simplif i ed to an 
equivalent form during the loop using a set of alge- 
braic equivalencies (since this happens infrequently 
enough, it tends to not harm discovery by constrain- 
ing the search space). The ���Optimize��� part of this al- 
gorithm is a few iterations of a classical optimization 
algorithm (BFGS [63] is used by default, though any 
optimizer in the Optim.jl package can be used [64]) 
to optimize constants in every equation explicitly. 
This part of the algorithm signif i cantly improves 
the discovery of equations containing real constants, 
which is essential for practical application of SR to 
science.It has been shown since at least [65] that 
performing local gradient searches on numerical con- 
stants in expressions can vastly improve the perfor- 
mance of SR���we closely integrate an optimized and 
stochastic version of this. 
The reason why several mutations (as well as 
crossovers) are performed before proceeding to the 
simplify-optimize stage is because some equations are 
only accessible via a redundant intermediate state. 
For example, x���x���x���x would normally simplify to 
0, but if the simplif i cation is avoided, the next mu- 
tation might change one of the x���s to y, resulting in 
x ��� x ��� x ��� y. Simplifying only occasionally is a way 
of allowing redundant but necessary intermediate ex- 
pressions while at the same time reducing the size of 
the search space. 
Finally, the third modif i cation we make is the use 
of a novel adaptive parsimony metric. But i rst, we 
give a def i nition of complexity. 
Complexity: By default, complexity in PySR 
is equal to the number of nodes in an expression 
tree, regardless of each node���s content. 
However, complexity in PySR is completely 
user-conf i gurable. We argue that the best def i- 
nition for a ���simple��� expression is the one that 
is most interpretable by the user. An expression 
containing a dilogarithm may look commonplace 
to the particle physicist���and in fact be a great 
prior over the space of models for certain parti- 
cle physics data���but extremely unusual to the 
l uid dynamicist, and perhaps not coincidentally 
a bad choice of prior for l uids data. 
The traditional mechanism for penalizing complexity 
would be to use a constant parsimony, which would 
involve adding a loss term equal to the complexity of 
an expression times a constant factor: 
���(E) = ���pred(E) + (parsimony) �� C(E),(1) 
for C(E) the complexity of an expression E and ���pred 
the predictive loss. Instead, we adaptively tune a per- 
complexity penalty such that the number of expres- 
sions at each complexity is approximately the same. 
This is expressed roughly as: 
���(E) = ���pred(E) �� exp(frecency[C(E)]),(2) 
where the ���frecency��� of C(E) is some combined mea- 
sure of the frequency and recency of expressions oc- 
curring at complexity C(E) in the population.In 
PySR, we simply count the number of expressions 
with a moving window in time, and divide by a tun- 
able constant.Thus, this is a simple way to pun- 
ish complexities adaptively by how frequent they are 
in the population.This encourages the evolution- 
ary search to explore the problem from simple, less- 
accurate expressions, as well as from complex, more 
accurate expressions. This qualitatively seems to help 
alleviate situations where the search specializes too 
early in the wrong functional form, and can only seem 
to make small iterations to it, and is discouraged from 
starting from scratch. 
Pseudocode for the outer loop of PySR is given 
in algorithm 1, which includes the migration steps 
shown in i g. 4. Algorithm 2 gives pseudocode for the 
main evolve-simplify-optimize loop, formalizing parts 
of the cartoon in i g. 3. Algorithm 3 outlines the set 
of mutations, supplemented with simulated anneal- 
ing. Finally, algorithm 4 describes the tournament 
selection strategy.

This section discusses the methods used in the PySR algorithm, which is a tool for Scientific Symbolic Regression (SR). Here's a brief summary:
1. Overview of PySR:
PySR is a multi-population evolutionary algorithm.
Its primary mechanism is based on a classic evolutionary algorithm utilizing tournament selection for individual selection.
2. Classic Evolutionary Algorithm:
Starts with a population of individuals.
Selects a subset of individuals from the population.
Evaluates the fitness of each individual in the subset.
Selects the fittest individual as the winner.
Makes a copy of the winner and applies a mutation.
Replaces a member of the population with the mutated individual.
This algorithm can be highly parallelized by evolving different groups of individuals independently.
3. Modifications in PySR:
Age-regularized Evolution:
PySR replaces the oldest member of a population instead of the individual with the lowest fitness.
Simulated Annealing:
A technique where mutations may be accepted or rejected based on their fitness, aiding the algorithm in not getting stuck in local minima.
Evolve-Simplify-Optimize Loop:
The 'evolve' step repeatedly applies the evolutionary algorithm, the 'simplify' step condenses the mathematical expressions, and the 'optimize' step refines the constants in the expressions.
This loop allows the discovery of various equations, some of which might be accessible only through intermediate redundant states.
4. Adaptive Parsimony Metric:
PySR introduces an adaptive measure of complexity, where the penalty for complexity is tuned based on the frequency and recency of expressions of similar complexity in the population.
This approach helps the algorithm avoid settling too quickly into a specific functional form.
5. Pseudocode Explanation:
The given text provides pseudocode for the main procedures in PySR, detailing the steps involved in the evolve-simplify-optimize loop, the mutations, and the tournament selection strategy.
Overall, PySR offers a robust and flexible algorithmic approach to SR, with the capacity to adapt and optimize based on the unique challenges of each problem space.

Additional Features.PySR includes a variety of 
additional features for various types of data and sce- 
narios: 
��� Noisy data. PySR supports multiple strategies 
for working with noisy data: 
��� First, PySR includes an optional denoising 
preprocessing step that optimizes a Gaussian 
process on the input dataset with a kernel of 
the form k(x,x0) = ��2exp ? ���|x ��� x0|2/2l2 ?

33end modif i es the mean of the Gaussian process). 
After this kernel is optimized, the Gaussian 
process is used to predict denoised targets for 
each input point, which are then passed to the 
main PySR algorithm. 
��� Second, PySR allows one to specify a set of 
weights for each input data point. This could 
be used, for instance, if a user knows the un- 
certainty in a measurement beforehand to be 
�� > 0, for �� the standard deviation of the mea- 
surement, and thus weights each data point in 
the loss by the signal-to-noise 1/��2. 
��� Thirdly, the user can def i ne a custom likeli- 
hood to optimize, which can also take into ac- 
count weights. This is explained in the follow- 
ing point. 
��� Custom losses. PySR supports arbitrary user- 
def i ned loss functions, passed as either a string 
or a function object. These take a scalar predic- 
tion and target, and optionally a scalar weight, 
and should return a real number greater than 0. 
These per-point losses are then summed over the 
dataset. With this, the user is capable of def i n- 
ing arbitrary regression objectives, custom like- 
lihoods (def i ned as log-likelihood of a single data 
point), and classif i cation-based losses. This also 
allows one to def i ne implicit objectives. 
��� Custom operators.One of the most powerful 
features of PySR is the ability to def i ne custom 
operators.Dif f erent domains of science have 
functions unique to their i eld which appear in 
many formulae and hold a specif i c meaning. It

is crucial for symbolic regression tools to be adaptable and incorporate these domain-specific functions. With PySR, users can add their custom operators, allowing for a tailored symbolic regression that understands and incorporates functions specific to a given scientific domain.
���
Parallelization and Scaling.
PySR has been designed for parallel computation. As shown in the algorithm description, the evolution loop is parallelized over workers. This enables PySR to handle large datasets and execute complex symbolic regression tasks efficiently by leveraging multiple cores or even distributed systems.
���
Flexibility with Input Data Types.
PySR can handle a wide range of data types. This includes time-series data, multivariate data, or even data with missing values. It provides tools and preprocessing steps to make working with diverse datasets straightforward.
���
Interpretability.
One of the primary goals of symbolic regression is to find human-readable formulas. PySR emphasizes this by providing simplification steps and optimization of constants to ensure the resulting expressions are as interpretable as possible.
���
Post-processing Capabilities.
After obtaining the symbolic expressions, PySR offers tools for further analysis and visualization. This includes sensitivity analysis, plotting, and tools to convert expressions to other programming languages or formats.
���
Extensive Documentation and Tutorials.
To assist users in getting the most out of the tool, PySR offers comprehensive documentation covering all features and use-cases. Tutorials guide new users, ensuring they can utilize the power of PySR effectively.
In conclusion, PySR is a robust and versatile symbolic regression tool, offering an array of features for various data types and scenarios. Its design considerations for noisy data, flexibility in defining losses and operators, and emphasis on parallelization make it stand out as an efficient solution for symbolic regression challenges in diverse scientific domains.

Certainly! Let's break down the provided algorithm for PySR step by step:
PySR Algorithm
Input:
X
: Dataset for which symbolic expressions are to be found.
Parameters:
np
: Number of populations, default is 40.
L
: Number of expressions in each population, default is 1000.
��H
: Replacement fraction using expressions from
H
, default is 0.05.
��M
: Replacement fraction using expressions from union of
Mi
, default is 0.05.
Algorithm Steps:
Initialization:
For each population
i
in the range of total populations (
np
):
Create an initial set
Pi
containing
L
random symbolic expressions, each of complexity 3. For instance, the expression (3.2 + x1) has a size of 3.
Initialize an empty set
Mi
. This will store the best expressions encountered in the population
Pi
.
Initialize an empty set
H
that will store the best expressions overall across all populations.
Evolution Loop:
The outer loop runs for
niter
iterations (though
niter
is not specified in the provided algorithm). Within this loop:
Each population
Pi
undergoes the evolve-simplify-optimize process in parallel:
Evolve:
Modify
Pi
based on evolutionary strategies to get better expressions.
For each expression
E
in
Pi
:
Simplify:
Reduce the complexity of
E
without changing its meaning.
Optimize:
Adjust constants in
E
to better fit the data.
Update the set
Mi
with the most accurate expression in
Pi
at each complexity level. In reality,
Mi
is updated continuously during the evolve process.
Update the global set
H
with the most accurate expression from the union of all
Mi
and
H
at each complexity.
Migration Process:
This helps in sharing good expressions between populations.
For each expression
E
in a population
Pi
:
With probability
��H
, replace
E
in
Pi
with a random expression from the global set
H
.
With probability
��M
, replace
E
in
Pi
with a random expression from another population
Mj
(j not equal to i).
Output:
After all iterations are complete, return the set
H
, which contains the best symbolic expressions for the dataset
X
across all complexities.
In essence:
The algorithm aims to find the best symbolic expressions to represent the data
X
. It does this by evolving multiple populations of expressions in parallel. The best expressions from each population are shared with other populations and globally to ensure convergence to an optimal solution.

is therefore very important that these operators 
be available in an SR library, and so PySR al- 
lows custom user-def i ned unary or binary func- 
tions. So long as a function can be def i ned as 
either f : R ��� R or R2��� R, it can be used as 
a user-def i ned operator. PySR does not treat 
built-in operators any differently than user-de- 
i ned ones. Apart from simplif i cation strategies, 
PySR does not know the dif f erence between the 
+ operator and a Bessel function. 
��� Feature selection. Similar to the Gaussian pro- 
cess preprocessing step for denoising, PySR 
also uses a simple dimensionality reduction pre- 
processing step. Given a user-def i ned number 
of features to select, PySR uses a gradient- 
boosting tree algorithm to i rst i t the dataset, 
then select the most important features. These 
features are fed into the main search loop. 
��� Constraints.PySR allows various hard con- 
straints to be specif i ed for discovered expres- 
sions. These are enforced at every mutation: if a 
constraint is violated, the mutation is rejected.

Let's break down the
Evolution Algorithm
:
Input:
P
: A set of symbolic expressions.
X
: Dataset for which symbolic expressions are to be found (as in Algorithm 1).
Output:
P
: The evolved (modified) set of symbolic expressions.
Parameters:
nc
: Number of mutations for each evolve() call, with a default of 300000.
pcross
: The probability of doing a crossover operation, defaulting to 0.01.
Algorithm Steps:
Mutation and Crossover Loop:
This loop runs for
nc
iterations.
With a probability of
1 - pcross
, the algorithm opts for a mutation; otherwise, it goes for a crossover operation.
Mutation:
E
is selected from the set
P
through a tournament process. This typically means selecting the best out of a random subset of
P
based on how well they fit the data
X
.
Calculate the annealing temperature
T
as
1 - (k/nc)
. This temperature is likely used to control the extent of the mutation. As iterations progress, the temperature decreases, leading to smaller mutations.
E*
is the mutated version of
E
based on the temperature
T
.
The oldest expression in
P
is replaced with this new mutated expression
E*
.
Crossover:
Two expressions
E1
and
E2
are selected from
P
through the tournament process.
Crossover operation is performed on
E1
and
E2
to produce two new expressions
E*1
and
E*2
.
The algorithm ensures that both new expressions satisfy certain constraints. If they don't, the crossover process is repeated until they do.
The oldest two expressions in
P
are replaced with
E*1
and
E*2
.
Output:
After all mutations and crossovers are performed, the evolved set
P
is returned.
Further Context from the provided text:
PySR allows for
custom operators
. Users can define their own unary or binary functions which can then be utilized in the symbolic regression just like built-in functions. This makes PySR versatile and applicable to various scientific domains with specialized functions.
Feature Selection:
Before delving into the symbolic regression, PySR can perform dimensionality reduction. It uses a gradient-boosting tree algorithm to first fit the dataset and then selects the most influential features. These chosen features are then used in the main search algorithm.
Constraints:
Users can define specific constraints for the expressions. If a mutation results in an expression that violates any of these constraints, that mutation is rejected. This ensures that the evolved expressions remain within user-defined boundaries or specifications.

Choose Mutation Type:
A mutation type, represented by the integer
i
, is chosen randomly based on the weights
w1,...,w8
.

a
based on a random number and the annealing temperature
T
.
If a random number is less than 0.5, negate the value of
a
.
Multiply a random constant in the expression by
a
.
Case 2 (Mutate Operator):
Replace an operator in the expression with another operator of the same degree.
Case 3 (Append/Prepend Node):
Add a random node either at the start or end of the expression tree.
Case 4 (Insert Node):
Insert a random node at a random position inside the expression.
Case 5 (Delete Subtree):
Replace a random node and its child nodes from the expression with either a constant or variable.
Case 6 (Simplify Tree):
Simplify the expression tree using predefined simplification rules.
Case 7 (New Tree Entirely):
Replace the expression with an entirely new random expression.
Case 8 (No Mutation):

C
and
C*
of the original and mutated expressions respectively.
Evaluate the accuracy
L
and
L*
of the original and mutated expressions respectively.
Calculate the annealing acceptance probability
qanneal
using a formula based on the accuracy values, the temperature scale
��
, and the annealing temperature
T
.
Calculate the parsimony pressure probability
qparsimony
based on the complexity of the original expression.
Accept or Reject Mutation:
If a random number is less than the product of
qanneal
and
qparsimony
, the mutated expression
E*
is accepted.
Otherwise, the original expression
E
is retained.
Return Expression:
The selected expression (either mutated or original) is returned as the result.
Summary:
The
Mutations Algorithm
defines how a symbolic expression undergoes changes or mutations, using several strategies, including modifying constants, changing operators, and restructuring the expression tree. Mutations are accepted or rejected based on their complexity and accuracy.

It seems that you have to choose the operators and choose the desired level of complexity.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Indeed, symbolic regression (SR) techniques, like those employed by PySR, allow for the automated discovery of mathematical expressions that fit given data. Choosing the appropriate operators and setting a complexity level are essential parts of ensuring that the discovered expressions are both accurate and interpretable.
Choosing Operators:
Built-in Operators:
These are standard mathematical operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. PySR would inherently understand these and can use them in formulating expressions.
Custom Operators:
As mentioned in the provided text, PySR's flexibility shines here. Different scientific domains might have specific functions or operations that are commonly used. By allowing users to define their custom unary or binary functions, PySR can create expressions that make sense within the context of specific scientific domains. For instance, a physicist might want to include a Bessel function as an operator because it frequently appears in physics-related equations.
The key takeaway here is that PySR doesn't discriminate between built-in and user-defined operators when formulating expressions. Both are treated equally, with the only distinction being in simplification strategies.
Setting Complexity Level:
In symbolic regression, an expression's complexity can be seen as the number of operators, operands, and functions that constitute it. A simple expression like
x
+
2
x + 2
x
+
2
has lower complexity than a more convoluted expression like
sin
���
(
x
2
+
3
x
���
4
)
\sin(x^2 + 3x - 4)
sin
(
x
2
+
3
x
���
4
)
.
Why is complexity important? There's a balance to strike. Overly simple expressions might not fit the data well, leading to high error. However, very complex expressions might overfit the data, capturing noise rather than the underlying relationship. Such overfitted models perform poorly on unseen data. Therefore, setting a desired level of complexity helps in controlling the trade-off between underfitting and overfitting.
In PySR, constraints on expression size (which relates to complexity) can be enforced. If an expression exceeds the maximum allowed size or complexity, it can be pruned or rejected during the evolutionary search process.
In summary, choosing the right operators and setting an appropriate complexity level are vital decisions in symbolic regression. They determine the types of expressions that will be considered and the balance between simplicity and accuracy. Properly setting these parameters helps in finding models that are both interpretable and accurate.

The
tournament
function is a method of selection used in genetic algorithms (and symbolic regression, in this context) to choose individual candidates from a population for subsequent operations like crossover and mutation. The method works by selecting a subset of the population and choosing the "fittest" individual from that subset.
Here's a step-by-step explanation of Algorithm 4:
Function:
tournament(P,X)
Input:
A population of expressions
P
and a dataset
X
.
Output:
A single expression, the winner of the tournament.
Steps in the
tournament
function:
Step 2:
Select a random subset
Q
from the population
P
with size
ns
(which is 12, as per the given parameters).
Step 3-9:
Continually find the fittest expression from the subset
Q
and potentially remove it until only one expression remains or a stopping condition (based on
ptournament
) is met.
Step 4:
Call the
get_fittest
function to retrieve the fittest expression
E
from the current subset
Q
.
Step 5:
There's a probability
ptournament
(given as 0.9) to immediately break out of the loop and select
E
as the winner.
Step 8:
If the loop doesn't break, then the current fittest expression
E
is removed from the subset
Q
.
Step 10:
Return the final expression
E
, which is the winner of the tournament.
Function:
get_fittest(P)
Input:
A set of expressions
P
.
Output:
The fittest expression from
P
.
Steps in the
get_fittest
function:
Step 13-23:
Iterate over each expression
E
in
P
to find the fittest one.
Step 15:
Calculate the complexity of expression
E
.
Step 16:
Determine the accuracy
���
of expression
E
.
Step 17-18:
Apply adaptive parsimony to the accuracy. Parsimony is a method used in genetic programming to prevent overfitting and encourages simpler solutions. The
frecency
parameter adjusts the accuracy based on the complexity
C
of the expression, acting as a penalty for more complex expressions.
Step 19-22:
Compare the modified accuracy
���
of expression
E
with the best accuracy observed so far (
���best
). If
E
is better (i.e., has a lower adjusted accuracy), it becomes the new best candidate
E���
.
Step 24:
Return the fittest expression
E���
.
In summary, the
tournament
function is a method of selecting individual expressions based on their fitness. The fitness in this context is determined by an expression's accuracy and complexity. The tournament continues until only one expression remains, or a predefined probability condition is met, at which point that expression is returned as the winner.

2.2 Software implementation 
The search algorithm itself underlying PySR, as de- 
scribed in pseudocode in algorithms 1 to 4, is written 
in pure-Julia under the library name SymbolicRe- 
gression.jl8. Julia boasts a combination of a high- 
level interface9with very high performance compara- 
ble to languages such as C++ and Rust10. However, 
the key advantage of using Julia for this work is the 
fact that it is a just-in-time compiled (JIT) language. 
This allows PySR to make use of optimizations not 
possible with a statically compiled library: for in- 
stance, compiling user-def i ned operators and losses 
into the core functions. The most signif i cant advan- 
tage of using JIT compilation for PySR, in terms of 
performance, is that operators can be fused together 
into single compiled operators. For example, if a user 
declares + and- as valid operators, then PySR will 
compile a SIMD-enabled kernel for +, -, as well as 
their combination: (a- b) + c, and so on. This 
happens automatically for every single combination 
of operators up to a depth of two operators, even for 
user-def i ned operators. Simply by fusing operators in 
this way, the expression evaluation code, which re- 
mains the bottleneck in PySR, experiences a signif- 
icant speedup. Because Julia is JIT compiled, these 
operators need not be pre-def i ned in the library: they 
will be just as performant as if they were. 
PySR exposes a simple Python frontend API 
tothispure-Juliabackendsearchalgorithm.

This section discusses the software implementation of the PySR algorithm. Here's a breakdown of the given text:
Software Implementation Overview:
Library and Language:
The search algorithm of PySR is implemented in a library named
SymbolicRegression.jl
using the
Julia
programming language.
Julia combines the ease of a high-level interface with performance comparable to languages like C++ and Rust.
Advantages of Julia:
Julia is a
just-in-time compiled (JIT)
language. This JIT nature allows for on-the-fly optimizations that can't be done with statically compiled libraries.
A major benefit for PySR is that operators (both built-in and user-defined) can be combined or "fused" into single compiled operators. For instance, if '+' and '-' are defined as valid operators, PySR can automatically compile a combined operation like
(a - b) + c
.
This fusion of operations, especially up to a depth of two operators, provides a significant speed boost. The reason is that evaluating symbolic expressions is often the performance bottleneck in symbolic regression.
Julia's JIT compilation ensures that these fused operators perform optimally, even if they aren't predefined in the library.
Python Frontend:
While the core algorithm is written in Julia, PySR provides a user-friendly Python API.
The style of this frontend API is inspired by the popular
scikit-learn
machine learning library.
Usage Example:
The given example showcases how to use PySR in Python.
Initialization:
Use
PySRRegressor
to create a symbolic regression model. You can specify options like model selection strategy and which unary and binary operators to consider during the search.
Loading Data:
Data is loaded with shapes
(n_rows, n_features)
for input
X
and
(n_rows)
or
(n_rows, n_targets)
for output
y
.
Training:
The
fit
method starts the symbolic regression search on the provided data.
Results:
Discovered symbolic expressions can be viewed by printing the model object.
Prediction:
Use the
predict
method to make predictions using discovered expressions. You can specify which expression to use based on its position in the Pareto front (a concept in multi-objective optimization where solutions are ranked based on trade-offs between objectives, like simplicity and accuracy in this context).
In summary, PySR is a bridge between Julia and Python, leveraging Julia's performance capabilities while providing the ease and familiarity of Python's interface. The JIT nature of Julia enables optimizations, particularly the fusion of operations, which drastically enhances performance, making symbolic regression more efficient and effective.

It is also very important to note that these results are 
from the datasets specif i c to this competition. Many 
of these algorithms may do very well against synthetic 
datasets generated for each expression. For example, 
Hubble���s law is simply a linear relation, so it could be 
surprising that many algorithms are not able to i nd 
it. However, to perform well at the benchmark, each 
algorithm must i nd these expressions from the noisy 
and sometimes biased datasets shown in i g. 5. 
What is also interesting is that the two pure deep 
learning approaches, EQL and SR-Transformer, re- 
covered the fewest expressions out of all tested al- 
gorithms.One of these, EQL, learns the expres- 
sion in an online fashion, while SR-Transformer per- 
forms fast inference based on pre-trained weights. 
SR-Transformer, in particular, is pre-trained on bil- 
lions of randomly-generated synthetic expressions on 
a cluster of GPUs for weeks.However, the ���un- 
trained��� algorithms written using classic heuristics: 
PySR, Operon, DSR, and QLattice, all out-performed 
these modern deep learning models. Perhaps this is 
an insight into the dif i culty of preparing deep learn- 
ing systems for real-world data and unexpected ���long- 
tail��� examples, whereas handwritten standard algo- 
rithms will often perform just as well on unexpected 
examples.In SR especially, the space of potential 
expressions is so massive and nonlinear that inter- 
polation techniques might suf f er; consider that x/y 
and x �� y are just a single mutation away, but in- 
i nitely distinct in their data representation. In spite 
of this, while pure deep learning strategies appears 
to require improvements in architecture or training 
to be useful in a real world SR setting, its success 
in, e.g., [23, 27, 30] shows there is indeed strong po- 
tential long-term for such hybrid methods, and these 
directions should continue to be pursued. 
4 Conclusion 
In this paper, we have presented PySR, an open- 
source library for practical symbolic regression. We 
have developed PySR with the aim of democratizing 
and popularizing symbolic regression in the sciences. 
By leveraging a powerful multi-population evolu- 
tionary algorithm, a unique evolve-simplify-optimize 
loop, a high-performance distributed backend, and in- 
tegration with deep learning packages, PySR is ca- 
pable of accelerating the discovery of interpretable 
symbolic models from data. 
Furthermore, through the introduction of a new 
benchmark, EmpiricalBench, we have provided a 
means to quantitatively evaluate the performance of 
symbolic regression algorithms in scientif i c applica- 
tions. 
Our results indicate that, despite advances in 
deep learning, classic algorithms build on evolution 
and other untrained symbolic techniques such as 
PySR, Operon, DSR, and QLattice, still outperform 
pure deep-learning-based approaches, EQL and SR- 
Transformer, in discovering historical empirical equa- 
17 
tions from original and synthetic datasets. This high- 
lights the challenges faced by deep learning methods 
when applied to real-world data with its biases and 
heteroscedasticity, and the nonlinearity of the space 
of expressions. 
However,weemphasizethatdeeplearning 
techniques���inclusive of generative models like [30], 
reinforcement learning methods such as [27], and 
symbolic distillation [23]���all hold potential for im- 
proving symbolic regression, and encourage further 
exploration of such hybrid methods. 
Over the past several years since the release of 
PySR in 2020, there have been a number of exciting 
PySR applications to discover new models in various 
subf i elds. There are too many to list here in detail, 
but we list some examples: [89] use PySR to discover 
a new symbolic parameterization for cloud cover for- 
mation; [90] use PySR alongside other ML techniques 
to discover electron transfer rules in various mate- 
rials; [91, 92, 93] combine PySR with dimensional 
analysis to discover new astrophysical relations; [94] 
use PySR in economics, to i nd ef f ective rules gov- 
erning international trade; [95] demonstrates how to 
use PySR to extract dynamical equations learned by 
a neural dif f erential equation; and, i nally, [96] use 
PySR to discover interpretable population models of 
gravitational wave sources. 
In some ways this list of recent applications pro- 
vides the strongest validation yet of the science and 
user-focused approach we argued for in section 1, as 
PySR has already been applied successfully to model 
discovery in a variety of i elds. It is our hope that 
PySR will continue to grow as a community tool, 
and provide value to researchers, helping discover in- 
terpretable symbolic relationships in data and ulti-

This excerpt discusses the performance of different symbolic regression (SR) algorithms, emphasizing the PySR library. Here's a summary:
Performance on Datasets:
The results discussed pertain to specific competition datasets.
Although some relationships might seem simple, such as Hubble's law, they are not always easily discovered by every algorithm, especially when the data is noisy or biased.
Deep Learning Approaches vs. Classic Heuristics:
EQL (an online learning model) and SR-Transformer (which uses pretrained weights) are deep learning-based methods for symbolic regression. Despite SR-Transformer being pre-trained on billions of synthetic expressions, it couldn't outperform algorithms that were based on classic heuristics.
Classic heuristic-based algorithms like PySR, Operon, DSR, and QLattice outperformed these deep learning models. This highlights a challenge with deep learning methods: while they can be powerful, they may struggle with real-world data that has unexpected examples or "long-tail" scenarios.
The nature of symbolic regression, with its vast space of potential expressions, might be a factor. For instance, two expressions
x
/
y
x/y
x
/
y
and
x
��
y
x \times y
x
��
y
are very different but only a small mutation apart.
Although current deep learning methods for SR may need further improvements, their successes in other works indicate a potential for hybrid methods that combine classical and deep learning techniques.
About PySR:
PySR is an open-source library developed for practical symbolic regression. Its main goal is to make symbolic regression widely accessible, especially in scientific domains.
PySR's strengths include:
A powerful evolutionary algorithm
A unique loop of evolving, simplifying, and optimizing expressions
High-performance distributed backend
Integration with deep learning packages
The new benchmark, EmpiricalBench, was introduced to evaluate the performance of SR algorithms in scientific contexts.
Despite the rise of deep learning, classic algorithms (like PySR and others) still perform better in certain symbolic regression tasks. However, the potential of deep learning in improving SR shouldn't be ignored.
Applications of PySR:
Since its release in 2020, PySR has found applications in a variety of scientific fields, including:
Modeling cloud cover formation
Discovering electron transfer rules in materials
Uncovering new astrophysical relations
Economic studies on international trade
Extracting equations learned by neural differential equations
Modeling gravitational wave sources
These applications validate the science and user-centric approach of PySR. The hope is for PySR to further help researchers in discovering meaningful symbolic relationships in their data.
In conclusion, while deep learning offers exciting opportunities for symbolic regression, classic heuristic-based methods remain vital and often more effective in certain scenarios. PySR, as a tool, stands as a testament to this, demonstrating success across multiple domains.

I am curious about using this technique, photographs, microscopes, spectrographs, centrifuges, and ingredient lists, with GANs to help design meat and cheese replacements using iterative genetic algorithms, and simulate their flavor, texture, and protein, fat, and carbohydrate ratios.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in tandem with symbolic regression and genetic algorithms to design meat and cheese replacements is an ambitious but exciting proposition. Here's a potential approach to how this might be done:
Data Collection and Processing
:
Photographs
: Collect images of various meats and cheeses at high resolution.
Microscopes
: Obtain detailed microscopic images to understand the texture and cellular structures.
Spectrographs
: Analyze the chemical composition.
Centrifuges
: Separate the constituent components.
Ingredient lists
: Obtain lists from popular replacements or existing products.
GANs for Texture and Appearance
:
Train a GAN on the photographs to generate images of potential meat and cheese replacements.
Another GAN can be trained on the microscopic images to try and simulate the intricate textures at a cellular level.
Symbolic Regression for Nutrient Balancing
:
Given the desired protein, fat, and carbohydrate ratios, use symbolic regression to derive equations that can predict the nutrient balance of a given formulation. This can guide the ingredient selection and ratios.
Iterative Genetic Algorithms for Recipe Optimization
:
Use genetic algorithms to optimize the ingredient mix. At each iteration, "offspring" recipes are generated based on successful "parent" recipes, with some variation (mutation) introduced. This iterative process is continued until a desired nutritional profile, texture, and flavor are achieved.
GANs for Flavor Simulation
:
This is trickier since flavor is subjective. However, if you have data (like spectrograph readings) linked to flavor profiles, you might train a GAN to generate new flavor profiles.
Feedback Loop
:
Actual tasting and feedback would be essential. Collect feedback on the taste, texture, and overall acceptability of the generated products.
This feedback can be fed back into the system to refine the algorithms and improve the replacements.
Production
:
Once a formulation is approved, it can be moved to production. However, scaling up from a lab recipe to mass production can introduce new challenges.
Iterative Refinement
:
As more feedback is collected, and as more data becomes available, the algorithms can be refined and improved upon.
This kind of data-driven, iterative approach has the potential to revolutionize the way food products are developed. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like GANs and symbolic regression, it's possible to significantly shorten the product development cycle and come up with replacements that are more palatable and nutritionally balanced.
However, it's essential to remember that while algorithms can help in the design phase, human taste testing, and expertise in food science will always play a crucial role in the final product development.
1 / 1
Yeah the taste tests can be used to help with reinforcement learning.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Incorporating reinforcement learning (RL) can be a critical step in refining the products based on taste tests. Here's how this can be integrated:
Environment Setup
:
In the context of RL, the environment is the product itself (e.g., a meat or cheese replacement). Every time the algorithm proposes a new formulation, it's like taking an action in the environment.
Feedback as Reward
:
After a taste test, feedback can be quantified into a reward signal. Positive feedback (e.g., "tastes like real meat") can be given a positive reward, while negative feedback (e.g., "too grainy" or "lacks flavor") can result in a negative reward or penalty.
Model Update
:
Based on the reward, the RL agent updates its model, trying to maximize the reward for its next action (i.e., the next product formulation). The goal of the agent is to find the formulation that maximizes cumulative rewards (positive feedback from taste tests).
Exploration vs. Exploitation
:
A critical aspect of RL is balancing exploration (trying entirely new formulations) with exploitation (refining promising ones). This ensures that while the algorithm can hone in on a good recipe, it also has the freedom to discover potentially better alternatives.
Iterative Improvement
:
This process of proposing formulations, gathering feedback, and updating the model continues iteratively. Over time, the RL agent becomes better at proposing product formulations that are likely to be well-received during taste tests.
Incorporate Other Data
:
While taste is paramount, other data like texture, appearance, and nutritional content can also be incorporated into the reward function, ensuring that the final product is not just tasty but also visually appealing and nutritionally balanced.
Policy Improvement
:
After several iterations, the policy (strategy) that the RL agent uses to propose formulations becomes more refined. Once the policy is deemed satisfactory, it can be "frozen" and used to design products without further RL, until there's a need to develop new variants.
Integrating RL into the product development process can make the process more adaptive and responsive to user feedback. Moreover, by continuously refining the algorithm's model, the time to develop a satisfactory product could be shortened significantly, saving resources and accelerating market entry.

Ok well we will also be making tortillas and yogurt from giant kelp and cattail root.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Interesting choices! Both giant kelp and cattail root have unique properties that could be harnessed for food production. Here's how you could integrate them into the above pipeline:
1.
Data Collection
:
Ingredients Database
: Include data on giant kelp and cattail root - taste profiles, nutritional values, possible processing techniques, etc.
Existing Products
: If there are existing products made from these ingredients, gather their specifications.
2.
Initial Model Creation with GANs
:
Adjust the GANs to consider the unique properties of kelp and cattail root when generating potential ingredient combinations.
3.
Reinforcement Learning Setup
:
The RL setup remains largely unchanged but ensures that the algorithm recognizes the constraints and benefits of using kelp and cattail root.
4.
Iterative Product Testing
:
Given the uniqueness of these ingredients, you might need more iterative cycles. People may be unfamiliar with the taste, so refining based on feedback will be crucial.
5.
Reinforcement Learning Model Update
:
Ensure the RL model understands any feedback specifically related to the kelp or cattail root.
6.
Symbolic Regression for Relationship Discovery
:
Particularly important to determine how much kelp or cattail influences the overall taste and texture.
7.
Exploration vs. Exploitation Phase
:
This phase becomes even more important. You're working with unconventional ingredients, so the discovery of unexpected but successful combinations might happen more often.
8.
Validation
:
Due to the novelty of the ingredients, a rigorous validation process is crucial. It ensures the products are not only tasty but also safe and nutritious.
9.
Scaling & Production
:
Pay attention to the sourcing of giant kelp and cattail root. Ensure that their harvest is sustainable.
10.
Feedback Loop
:
Be prepared for a wider range of feedback due to the novelty. Use this information to improve subsequent batches.
Additional Notes

I was thinking that we could cook and ferment the fibers to make various sugars from the starches.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Absolutely, fermentation is a key process in many traditional food preparations, and it can transform the initial flavors, textures, and nutritional qualities of the ingredients. When you're working with starchy plants like cattail root, fermentation can help convert those starches into simpler sugars, which could be useful for various culinary applications.
Here's how you might integrate fermentation into the pipeline:
1.
Pre-Fermentation Prep
:
Cooking
: This will break down some of the cell walls and make the starches more accessible.
Milling/Blending
: Turn the cooked roots or fibers into a mash or slurry. This will increase the surface area and improve the fermentation process.
2.
Starch Hydrolysis
:
Before fermentation, you might need enzymes (like amylase) to break down the starches into fermentable sugars. Some of these enzymes can be naturally present, or they might need to be added.
3.
Fermentation
:
Yeast/Bacteria Selection
: Depending on the desired end product (alcohol, lactic acid, etc.), you'll choose an appropriate microorganism. For example, if you're going for a yogurt-like product, you'd lean towards lactic acid bacteria.
Controlled Environment
: Monitor and control temperature, pH, and other conditions to optimize fermentation.
Time
: Depending on what you're aiming for, this could range from hours to days or even weeks.
4.
Post-Fermentation Processing
:
Separation
: Separate any solids from liquids if necessary.
Cooking/Heating
: This can halt fermentation, and also adjust texture and flavor.
Blending with Other Ingredients
: If you're making a complex product like yogurt, this is where you'd add flavors, stabilizers, or other components.
5.
Sensory Evaluation
:
Given the unique and potentially variable nature of fermentation, sensory evaluation becomes crucial. Adjust the product based on feedback.
6.
Iterative Product Improvement with ML
:
Use feedback to guide the next batch, adjusting factors like fermentation time, added enzymes, or other processing steps.
Given the complexity and variability of fermentation, the data you gather can be valuable in refining the process. Use reinforcement learning to understand which factors contribute most significantly to the desired outcome.
7.
Validation and Scaling
:
Once you've honed in on the desired process and product characteristics, you can look into scaling up and ensuring consistent quality.
Fermentation can add a layer of complexity to the product development process due to its biological and somewhat unpredictable nature. However, it's also a powerful tool, capable of creating a vast array of flavors, textures, and nutritional profiles. Machine learning, with its ability to process and make sense of large datasets, can be a valuable partner in this exploration.

In both cosmology and food science, experimentation and iteration are key. Just as cosmologists test hypotheses about the universe, food scientists experiment with ingredients and processes to achieve the desired taste, texture, and nutritional profile.
Interdisciplinary Approaches
:
Cosmology doesn't exist in isolation; it intertwines with physics, mathematics, and even philosophy.
Similarly, creating food replacements using technology involves biology, chemistry, gastronomy, and computer science (especially when integrating AI models like GANs).
Modeling & Simulation
:
In cosmology, we use mathematical models to simulate and predict the behavior of the universe.
In food development, AI models can simulate the possible outcomes of various ingredient combinations, processing techniques, and fermentation processes, guiding researchers towards the most promising solutions.
Evolving Knowledge
:
Our understanding of the universe and its properties, such as de Sitter space, evolves as we gather more data and refine our theories.
The development of meat, cheese, and other replacements also relies on evolving knowledge, as researchers gather feedback, refine recipes, and incorporate new techniques or ingredients.
Addressing Real-World Challenges
:
While cosmology may seem distant from daily life, it addresses fundamental questions about our place in the universe and can indirectly inspire technological innovations.
The endeavor to develop sustainable and nutritious food replacements addresses pressing challenges like climate change, resource scarcity, and health concerns.
In essence, both fields���though seemingly disparate���are bound by the principles of scientific inquiry, experimentation, and the quest to address real-world problems, be they understanding our cosmic origins or addressing global food sustainability.

How do we distill very large models into scientific insights?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Distilling very large models into scientific insights requires a combination of techniques, strategies, and methodologies. Here's a potential pipeline for this process:
Understand the Model's Objective
:
Before distilling insights, it's essential to have a clear understanding of what the model was designed to achieve. This will set the context for any derived insights.
Feature Importance
:
Use techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), permutation importance, or feature importance from tree-based models to identify which features (or variables) have the most influence on the model's predictions.
Model Simplification
:
One common method is to train a simpler model, such as a linear regression or decision tree, to approximate the predictions of the complex model. This simpler model can then be inspected to gain insights.
Visualization
:
Visual tools can help in understanding complex models. Heatmaps, partial dependence plots, and other graphical methods can show how variables interact and influence model outputs.
Rule Extraction
:
Techniques like decision trees or rule-based algorithms can be applied to extract decision rules from complex models.
Surrogate Models
:
Train a simpler, interpretable model (the surrogate) to approximate the complex model's outputs. By analyzing the surrogate, you can gain insights into the original model.
Sensitivity Analysis
:
Investigate how slight changes in input features affect the model's output. This can provide insights into how different features influence the model's decisions.
Error Analysis
:
By examining instances where the model errs, you can gain insights into its limitations and potential biases.
Case Studies
:
Dive deep into specific instances or predictions made by the model. By understanding why the model made a particular prediction in a given case, you can often generalize and gain broader insights.
Feedback Loop with Domain Experts
:
Engaging with experts in the field can provide valuable insights. They can help validate findings, provide context, or even identify areas where the model might be making incorrect assumptions.
Regularization Techniques
:
Techniques like L1 (Lasso) regularization can help in making models sparser, reducing the number of influential features and making them more interpretable.
Symbolic Regression
(like PySR):
This can be used to derive symbolic mathematical equations that capture the relationships in the data, providing a more human-readable insight.
By combining these methods and continuously iterating based on feedback and validation, it becomes possible to distill complex models into meaningful scientific insights. However, it's also crucial to remember that no single method will fit all scenarios, and the approach should be tailored based on the specific model and domain.

Certainly! Let's imagine a scenario where we're trying to understand a complex and magical artifact: a "Crystal Ball" that can predict the future. Here's our journey to unravel its secrets:
Understand the Model's Objective
:
Setting the Scene
: Before attempting to understand the Crystal Ball, we ask ourselves: "What was this artifact made for?" It's like understanding the legend or the prophecy behind a magical artifact.
Feature Importance
:
The Guardians' Test
: We encounter guardians of the artifact. Each guardian emphasizes certain aspects or qualities (features) that are most vital to the Ball's predictions. The more emphasis, the more important the feature.
Model Simplification
:
The Old Sage's Tale
: We seek advice from an old sage who tells us a simplified story or legend about the Crystal Ball, making its powers easier to understand, though it might not capture all its nuances.
Visualization
:
Magic Lens
: We use a magical lens to see patterns and colors inside the Crystal Ball, visualizing its workings and how different elements interact.
Rule Extraction
:
The Enchanted Scroll
: Inside the artifact's chamber, there's a scroll that provides rules or commandments on how the Ball operates.
Surrogate Models
:
The Miniature Replica
: A skilled artisan creates a smaller, less detailed replica of the Crystal Ball. While it doesn't capture all the details, it mimics the original closely enough for us to study.
Sensitivity Analysis
:
The Trial Rituals
: By performing different rituals or tweaks (changing inputs), we observe how the Ball's glow changes (outputs), understanding which rituals or elements affect it the most.
Error Analysis
:
The Oracle's Mistakes
: We find records of times the Crystal Ball's predictions were wrong and study them to understand its limitations.
Case Studies
:
Heroic Tales
: We listen to specific stories of past heroes who used the Crystal Ball, understanding why it made certain predictions for them and what those outcomes were.
Feedback Loop with Domain Experts
:
Council of Elders
: We convene with a group of wise elders who are familiar with many magical artifacts. They provide context, validation, and further insights into the Ball's workings.
Regularization Techniques
:
The Purifying Ritual
: A ritual that removes any distractions or unnecessary magic from the Ball, making its core powers shine more clearly.
Symbolic Regression
:
The Book of Symbols
: In the artifact's chamber, there's a book translating the Ball's magic into symbolic equations, making its predictions more tangible and interpretable.
Throughout this journey, we go from being in awe of the Crystal Ball's complexity to understanding its essence, its strengths, and its limitations. The path is filled with challenges, but with determination, tools, and guidance, we distill its vast magic into comprehensible insights.
