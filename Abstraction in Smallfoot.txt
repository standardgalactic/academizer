What do AB tests actually measure?

If you’re like me, you’ve done a lot of AB tests before thinking too deeply about the experiment methodology. After all, they’re standard, battle-tested methods for making data-driven product decisions. We randomize exposure to variants A and B; we make sure the test sticks to users across sessions; we wait long enough for dynamic effects to stabilize. It turns out there’s still a potentially big problem. There are also strategies for overcoming it. Let’s start with a motivating example.

Website X has a pretty good user following. They’re a proud, data-driven site, and, whenever possible, make product decisions based on the results of carefully designed AB tests. When a user lands on a page where a test is running, the user is assigned to variant A or variant B at random, and the assignment sticks to that user across different sessions on the site.

When website X runs an AB test, they let the test run. Users visit their site, and are included in the AB test by assigning them randomly to test or control at the time of their visit by hashing their cookie IDs to a test bucket. The experimenters wait until they get a large enough sample size to have enough statistical power to test their hypothesis, and they stop the test.

Can you see what has gone wrong here? It’s really one critical mistake that can manifest in several different ways. The problem is called “self-selection bias,” and this example manifests at least two different versions of it. (I’ve looked around for some papers on self-selection bias in AB testing, but haven’t found much on the subject. If anyone has references, I’d love for you to post them in the comments!)

Self-selection Bias

The basic problem is that people aren’t selected at random into the experiment. There is a whole universe of people, U. Some subset of them, I, are users of the internet, where I ⊆ U. Some subset of them, W, are users of your website, so W ⊆ I. Some subset, T, of those will be online and assigned into your AB test while the test is running, so T ⊆ W. This subset T is not a random subset of all potential site users (i.e. the set I, or arguably, U). They’re not even a random subset of site users.

When most of us think of running an AB test, we’re thinking about running the test in W, not T. Have you ever considered whether the user group selected into your test is representative of the general population of your site? There’s a mechanism that can make sure it’s not: time. We’ll elaborate more on this in the next section.

Even worse than this temporal bias, sometimes we’d like to be running the test in I, the whole internet population, not W. Consider the case when your performance metric (your key performance indicator, or KPI) is related to growth. If your user base, U, is much smaller than I, and you successfully change your site in a way that people in I will love but U will hate, then your test will give very negative results in the short term, even though it has opened up enormous potential for growth.

Time to get Quantitative

Now that we understand the problem, we’d like to know how to solve it. It’s time to get some code and math involved.

The following embed will work better if you view it on github. You can find it here

So the upshot is that the experiment is really measuring a conditional average treatment effect: the experiment’s effect on people who entered into the experiment. This makes sense: we know we’re really doing the experiment to measure a treatment effect within the population who visits the site while our experiment is running. The key problem is when you don’t consider whether they are the right population for your experiment. If it’s not, then you have to worry about whether the effect you measure is really the one you’re interested in. In this example, there was a large bias!

The problem can get worse than this. Suppose instead that the u variable is actually the user’s level of activity: a user with higher u would tend to click on more things, visit the site more often, share more often, etc.

In the early days of an AB test, you really select users with high visit rates: they’re more likely to be on the site at a given time. If a treatment is more effective on highly active users, then your test ends up biased because it really only measures the treatment effect on very active users of the site.

Even worse, if a test is very successful among power users, and hurts normal users, it would be possible to have a positive AB test result while whittling away your audience!

A way to avoid some of this bias is by doing assignment offline from users who have visited over a long time range (more representative of U), and doing intent-to-treat analysis after the fact. This way, you can give up on getting a point estimate in order to be sure about your confidence intervals.

Another way that’s consistent with the AB testing implementation on site X is to let the test run for a longer period of time, to get a more representative sample of the general population on the website, and not just the ones who perform the most actions.

Both of these methods are still just for typical site visitors. There is a good body of literature on adjusting a non-representative sample (T isn’t representative of I) to look more like a representative sample. Post-stratification weighting is commonly used, e.g. in google consumer surveys.

In summary, AB tests don’t measure treatment effects over the general population, U, of all people, or even the general internet population, I, or even the general population of your website, W. They measure treatment effects over a population, T, that selects themselves into the AB test by visiting your site during the time the test is running. This can cause these users not to be representative of the population you might prefer to run your experiment on!

ChatGPT
Adam Kelleher's article from July 5, 2017, delves into the intricacies of AB testing, highlighting a critical oversight in the typical experiment methodology: self-selection bias. This bias arises because the subset of users participating in an AB test (T) isn't randomly selected from the overall potential user base but from those who visit the site during the test period. This group may not be representative of the site's general user base (W), let alone the entire internet-using population (I), which can skew test results.

Kelleher explains that AB tests essentially measure the conditional average treatment effect on the subset of users who enter the experiment, not the general population or even the general site population. This specificity can lead to biased results, especially if the treatment effects differ across user activity levels or if the experiment's timing affects who participates. For instance, early in an AB test, highly active users are more likely to be selected, potentially biasing results if these users react differently to the treatment than the general user base.

To mitigate self-selection bias, Kelleher suggests two strategies: performing assignments offline from a broader user base to capture a more representative sample and using post-stratification weighting to adjust the sample to resemble a more representative group. Moreover, running the test over a longer period can help include a more diverse cross-section of users, though this approach still focuses on site visitors during the test period rather than the entire potential user base.

The article underscores the importance of considering whether the subset of users in an AB test represents the target population for the experiment. Without addressing self-selection bias, the results may not accurately reflect the effect of changes on the broader population, potentially leading to misguided decisions based on the data.

Can you give some examples as metaphors were we might use AB testing in everyday life?
ChatGPT
AB testing, at its core, is about comparing two versions of something to see which one performs better based on a specific outcome or goal. This concept is widely applicable, not just in business or technology but also in everyday life. Here are some metaphorical examples:

Cooking Recipes: Imagine you're trying to perfect your chocolate cake recipe. You use butter in one version (A) and oil in another (B) to see which one results in a moister cake. Your family members are the "testers," and their preferences on moisture and taste determine the "winner."

Gardening Techniques: You have two sections in your garden where you want to grow tomatoes. In section A, you use organic fertilizer, and in section B, chemical fertilizer, to see which yields healthier plants and more tomatoes. This is AB testing to optimize plant growth.

Study Habits: A student preparing for an exam tries two different study methods. For one week, they study in short, focused bursts with breaks in between (Pomodoro technique, A), and the next week, in longer uninterrupted sessions (B). They then compare which method leads to better retention and understanding of the material.

Fitness Routines: To increase running endurance, a runner tries two different training approaches over separate months. In month A, they focus on long, slow runs. In month B, they incorporate high-intensity interval training (HIIT). They compare the two months based on improvement in running times and overall fitness level.

Commuting Options: Someone commuting to work decides to test two different routes for a week each to determine which is faster and more pleasant. Route A is a scenic, potentially longer path, while Route B is more direct but through heavier traffic. They evaluate based on time taken and overall commuting satisfaction.

Clothing for Impressions: Before a series of important meetings, an individual decides to wear formal attire on some days (A) and smart casual on others (B) to gauge reactions and see which attire leads to more positive interactions and engagement from colleagues and clients.

In all these examples, the essence of AB testing is to control variables and compare outcomes between two different approaches, aiming to make informed decisions based on the results.

I think the Pepsi challenges is often cited as an example of this. Immediate reaction to sweetness in a test doesn't necessarily indicate overall taste or consumer preferences. 
ChatGPT
Yes, the Pepsi Challenge is a classic real-world example often associated with the principles of AB testing, though it also underscores the complexity of interpreting such tests beyond immediate, controlled responses. In these challenges, participants were given two unmarked cups: one containing Pepsi and the other Coca-Cola. They were then asked to taste both and select which one they preferred based solely on taste.

The Pepsi Challenge highlighted a few key points relevant to AB testing and consumer behavior:

Immediate vs. Long-Term Preferences: Participants often chose Pepsi over Coca-Cola, supposedly due to its sweeter taste in the small quantities provided during the test. However, this immediate preference did not necessarily translate into long-term consumer behavior or indicate a preference for drinking an entire can or bottle.

Contextual Influence: The test conditions—a quick taste test—differ significantly from how consumers typically enjoy soft drinks, which is usually not in a blind comparison but as part of a meal, a social setting, or as a preferred refreshment choice over time. These environmental and situational factors can heavily influence preferences and purchase decisions.

Brand Loyalty and Image: The challenge also demonstrated the power of brand perception. Despite some people preferring the taste of Pepsi in blind tests, Coca-Cola continued to maintain a strong market share, indicating that factors beyond immediate taste, such as brand loyalty, marketing, and personal identity with a brand, play significant roles in consumer choices.

Complexity of Taste Preferences: The preference for sweetness in a sip test doesn't necessarily equate to a preference in normal consumption scenarios. People's taste preferences can be complex and vary significantly with quantity, context, and even over time.

The Pepsi Challenge serves as a reminder that while AB testing can provide valuable insights into immediate preferences or behaviors under controlled conditions, interpreting these results in the broader context of consumer behavior, brand loyalty, and market dynamics requires a nuanced approach. It's a prime example of how a simple preference in a controlled setting doesn't always predict overall market behavior or preferences in real-world scenarios.

Another natural example might be dark mode versus light mode in various applications. In dark mode you need different images or else they are jarring
ChatGPT
Absolutely, the choice between dark mode and light mode in applications is an excellent contemporary example of an area where AB testing can be particularly informative. When software developers or designers are deciding which mode to default to or how to optimize their user interface for both, AB testing can help determine not just which mode users prefer overall, but also how different elements within those modes—like images, text color, and button styles—impact user engagement, satisfaction, and comfort.

Why It's a Good Test Case
User Preference: Some users might find dark mode easier on the eyes, especially in low-light conditions or during night-time use, potentially reducing eye strain. Others might prefer light mode for clearer visibility in brightly lit conditions or simply due to personal taste.

Engagement Metrics: By comparing how long users stay in the app, how they interact with it, and whether there's a difference in usage patterns between the two modes, developers can gather insights into how these settings affect user engagement.

Aesthetic and Functional Harmony: As you mentioned, images and other visual elements can appear differently in dark mode versus light mode. What looks good and is effective in one mode might be less so in the other. AB testing can help determine the best way to adapt these elements for each mode to maintain or improve user experience.

Application and Design Considerations
Adapting Visual Elements: It's crucial to consider how to adapt images, icons, and other design elements for each mode to prevent them from appearing too jarring or out of place. This might involve using different image assets or applying filters to better suit the background.

Text Legibility: Text color and size might need adjustment between modes to ensure readability and reduce eye strain. AB testing can help find the optimal settings for readability across different devices and lighting conditions.

Preference Persistence: It's also valuable to study whether users stick with their initial mode choice over time or switch according to external factors like ambient light or time of day. This can inform whether applications should remember user preferences or offer easy toggling between modes.

Broader Implications
This kind of AB testing not only informs developers about user preferences but also pushes towards more inclusive and adaptable design practices. By accommodating both light and dark mode preferences effectively, applications can cater to a wider range of users, including those with visual impairments or sensitivities, thereby enhancing overall accessibility.

The dark mode versus light mode choice illustrates how AB testing in design can yield insights that go beyond mere aesthetic preferences, touching on usability, accessibility, and even health considerations.

So what did Kelleher argue AB tests actually measure?
ChatGPT
Adam Kelleher argued that AB tests actually measure the conditional average treatment effect on the subset of users who enter into the experiment, rather than on the general population or even the general user base of a website. This distinction is crucial because it points to a significant limitation in AB testing: the results apply primarily to the specific group of users who participated in the test, who may not be representative of the broader population the experimenters are most interested in.

Kelleher highlighted the problem of self-selection bias in AB testing, which occurs when the group of users included in the test (T) is not a random sample from the site's overall user base (W), the broader internet-using population (I), or the general population (U). This bias can lead to skewed results because the participants in the AB test might differ significantly from those not included, in terms of behaviors, preferences, and other characteristics.

Furthermore, Kelleher pointed out that factors such as time of day or the specific conditions under which the test is conducted can affect which users are more likely to participate, potentially introducing additional biases. For example, an AB test run over a short period might disproportionately include users who are more active or engage differently with the website, thereby not accurately reflecting the impact of changes on less active users or the entire user base.

To address these challenges, Kelleher suggested methods such as offline assignment, which involves selecting participants from a broader and more representative sample of past users, and intent-to-treat analysis, to better approximate the effects on a general population. He also mentioned the technique of post-stratification weighting as a way to adjust a non-representative sample to more closely resemble a representative one.

In summary, Kelleher's argument is that while AB tests can provide valuable insights, they inherently measure the treatment effect on a specific, potentially non-representative group of users who participate in the test. Recognizing and addressing this limitation is crucial for interpreting AB test results accurately and making informed decisions based on them.

It turns out that it’s shockingly easy to do some very reasonable things with data (aggregate, slice, average, etc.), and come out with answers that have 2000% error! In this post, I want to show why that’s the case using some very simple, intuitive pictures. The resolution comes from having a nice model of the world, in a framework put forward by (among others) Judea Pearl.

We’ll see why it’s important to have an accurate model of the world, and what value it provides beyond the (immeasurably valuable) satisfaction of our intellectual curiosity. After all, what we’re really interested in is, in some context, what is the effect of one variable on another. Do you really need a model to help you figure that out? Can’t you just, for example, dump all of your data into the latest machine-learning model and get answers out?

What is bias?

In this second post (first here) in our series on causality, we’re going to learn all about “bias”. You encounter bias any time you’re trying to measure something, and your result ends up different from the true result. Bias is a general term that means “how far your result is from the truth”. If you wanted to measure the return on investment from an ad, you measured a 1198% increase in searches for your product, instead of the true 5.4% . If you wanted to measure sex discrimination in school admissions, you measured strong bias in favor of men, when it was actually (weakly) in favor of women.

What causes bias? How can we correct it, and how does our picture of how the world works factor in to that? To answer these questions, we’ll start with some textbook examples of rain and sidewalks. We’ll return to our disaster example from the last post, and compare it with something called “online activity bias”.

A Tale of Wet Sidewalks

Judea Pearl uses a simple and intuitive example throughout his discussion of paradoxes. We’ll borrow his example, mainly for its clarity, and then move on to some other examples we might care more about.


Fig. 1: How the sidewalk gets wet
In this example, we’re examining what causes the sidewalk to get wet. We have a sprinkler that runs on a timer, and gets the sidewalk wet whenever it comes on. We also know that the sidewalk gets wet whenever it rains. We record these three variables every day, and come up with a nice data set. Our diagram summarizes our model for how the world works, and it suggests a nice sanity check: we can check to see if the rain is correlated with the sprinkler being on. When we do this on our hypothetical data set, we find that it’s not. Everything looks good!

Now, consider a thought problem. What if I know (1) that the sidewalk is wet, and I know that (2) it didn’t rain. What does that tell me about whether or not the sprinkler was on?

If we remove one explanation for the sidewalk being wet (we know it didn’t rain), then the others have to become more likely! If you know that the sidewalk is wet, suddenly knowing that it didn’t rain tells you something about whether the sprinkler is on. In the context of our knowledge about the wetness of the sidewalk, the sprinkler and the rain become statistically dependent! This isn’t a harmless effect. Let’s spend another minute trying to understand what’s going on.

If we restricted our data to only include days when the sidewalk was wet, we’d find a negative relationship between whether it has rained and whether the sprinkler was on. This happens for the reason we’ve been talking about: if the sidewalk is wet, and it hasn’t rained, then the sprinkler was probably on. If the sidewalk is wet and the sprinkler wasn’t on, then it has probably rained. Even though the two are uncorrelated in the original data, in the restricted data they are negatively correlated!

This happens because we’re not examining the world naively. We know something. If “the sidewalk is wet” and “it didn’t rain”, then “the sprinkler was probably on”. Statements like “If … then …” are called “conditional” statements. When we’re reasoning in the context of knowing something (the part that follows the “if”, before the “then”), then we’re talking about “conditional” knowledge. We’ll see that conditioning without realizing it can be extremely dangerous: it’s causes bias.

It turns out that this effect happens in general, and you can think of it in terms of these pictures. Conditioning on a common effect results in two causes becoming correlated, even if they were uncorrelated originally! This seems paradoxical, and it has also been called “Berkson’s paradox”. Looking at the diagram, it’s easy to identify a common effect, and trace the variables upstream from it: we know that conditional on this common effect, all of the upstream variables can become dependent.

We can put precise math terms on it for anyone who is interested (understanding the rest of the article doesn’t depend on understanding the next two sentences). The sprinkler and rain are independent, but they are not conditionally independent. Conditional independence doesn’t imply (and it not implied by) independence.

Now, we can see how the same structure leads to a type of bias that can easily happen in an experiment.
ChatGPT
Adam Kelleher, in his discussion about bias in the context of causality, highlights how easily and subtly bias can distort our understanding and analysis of data, leading to significant errors in our conclusions. He illustrates this with simple yet insightful examples, grounding his explanation in Judea Pearl's framework of causal inference.

What is Bias?
Kelleher defines bias as the deviation of your measurement from the true result. He provides straightforward examples: an overestimated return on investment from an advertisement campaign or a misjudgment in measuring sex discrimination in school admissions. These examples serve to underline how bias can lead to dramatically incorrect conclusions, either by overestimating or underestimating the effect or presence of a phenomenon.

Causes and Correction of Bias
To delve deeper into what causes bias and how it can be corrected, Kelleher uses the metaphorical example of wet sidewalks, borrowed from Judea Pearl. This example involves three variables: the occurrence of rain, the operation of a sprinkler, and the resulting wetness of the sidewalk. The example is elegantly simple but reveals a complex underlying principle of causality and bias: the relationship between observing an effect and inferring the causes behind it.

When we observe that the sidewalk is wet and know that it did not rain, we might infer that the sprinkler was on. This inference arises from conditional reasoning, based on the information available to us. However, if we were to restrict our data only to the instances when the sidewalk was wet, we would find a negative correlation between rain and the sprinkler being on—despite there being no direct correlation between these two causes in general. This phenomenon demonstrates how conditioning on a common effect can lead to erroneous correlations between causes, a situation referred to as Berkson's paradox.

The Implications of Conditioning
Kelleher emphasizes the dangers of conditioning without awareness, as it introduces bias into our analysis. The wet sidewalk example serves as a metaphor for how easily our assumptions and the scope of our data can lead us to draw incorrect conclusions. The act of conditioning on a common effect—like the wetness of the sidewalk—without realizing its implications can significantly skew our understanding of the relationships between causes and effects.

Conclusion
The crux of Kelleher's argument is the importance of having an accurate model of the world. Without such a model, and without a keen awareness of the biases our analytical methods might introduce, we're at risk of drawing conclusions that are not just slightly off, but potentially wildly inaccurate. Kelleher’s insights underscore the necessity of critical thinking and sophisticated modeling in causal inference, reminding us that the tools and methods we use to analyze data can greatly influence the validity of our conclusions.

I wanted to add that etymologically "bias" meant a slant or a tilt, often referring also to a hem. Mathematically a bias might be a scalar coefficient
ChatGPT
Indeed, the term "bias" has an interesting etymology and application across different fields, each adding a layer to our understanding of the concept. Originally, the word "bias" comes from Old French "biais," meaning "oblique, slant, sideways, askance, against the grain." Historically, it referred to a slanted line or direction, differing from the straight or expected path. This origin beautifully captures the essence of bias as a deviation from the norm or expected result, a theme that persists across its various uses today.

In the context of sewing or tailoring, "bias" refers to cutting fabric on the bias or diagonal to the fabric's weave. This technique takes advantage of the fabric's greater stretch in this direction, allowing for garments that closely follow the body's curves. The metaphorical connection to deviation or departure from the straight path (the grain of the fabric in this case) is clear and directly ties back to the term's etymology.

In mathematics and statistics, "bias" acquires a more defined and quantifiable meaning. Mathematically, as you mentioned, bias can refer to a scalar coefficient that is added to a set of linear equations or a model to adjust the output. In statistical modeling and machine learning, bias is a measure of how far the expected model predictions are from the true values. A model is said to be biased if it consistently either overestimates or underestimates the parameters. This mathematical bias can be considered a "slant" or "tilt" in the model's predictions, echoing the original sense of the word.

Furthermore, in statistics, the concept of bias is critical in understanding the accuracy and reliability of estimators. An unbiased estimator is one whose expected value is equal to the parameter it aims to estimate, meaning it does not systematically overestimate or underestimate the true value. On the other hand, a biased estimator deviates from this ideal, introducing a systematic error into the estimates.

The evolution of "bias" from a general notion of slant or tilt to a specific technical term in statistics and machine learning illustrates how the concept has broadened while still retaining its core meaning of deviation from an expected or normative path. This multiplicity of meanings across different domains enriches our understanding of bias, emphasizing its role in indicating departure from neutrality, accuracy, or expectedness.

Bias of an estimator

View history
Edit

For broader coverage of this topic, see Bias (statistics).
In statistics, the bias of an estimator (or bias function) is the difference between this estimator's expected value and the true value of the parameter being estimated. An estimator or decision rule with zero bias is called unbiased. In statistics, "bias" is an objective property of an estimator. Bias is a distinct concept from consistency: consistent estimators converge in probability to the true value of the parameter, but may be biased or unbiased; see bias versus consistency for more.

All else being equal, an unbiased estimator is preferable to a biased estimator, although in practice, biased estimators (with generally small bias) are frequently used. When a biased estimator is used, bounds of the bias are calculated. A biased estimator may be used for various reasons: because an unbiased estimator does not exist without further assumptions about a population; because an estimator is difficult to compute (as in unbiased estimation of standard deviation); because a biased estimator may be unbiased with respect to different measures of central tendency; because a biased estimator gives a lower value of some loss function (particularly mean squared error) compared with unbiased estimators (notably in shrinkage estimators); or because in some cases being unbiased is too strong a condition, and the only unbiased estimators are not useful.

Bias can also be measured with respect to the median, rather than the mean (expected value), in which case one distinguishes median-unbiased from the usual mean-unbiasedness property. Mean-unbiasedness is not preserved under non-linear transformations, though median-unbiasedness is (see § Effect of transformations); for example, the sample variance is a biased estimator for the population variance. These are all illustrated below.

An unbiased estimator for a parameter need not always exist. For example, there is no unbiased estimator for the reciprocal of the parameter of a binomial random variable.
ChatGPT
The concept of bias in the context of statistical estimators is fundamental to understanding how different statistical methods measure and predict underlying real-world phenomena. Bias refers to the difference between the expected value of an estimator (i.e., the average value it would produce over an infinite number of samples from the population) and the true value of the parameter being estimated. An estimator is considered unbiased if its expected value equals the true parameter value; otherwise, it is biased.

Key Points About Bias:
Objective Property: Bias is an objective measure, not influenced by the observer's perspective or interpretation. It quantifies the systematic error inherent in an estimator, distinguishing it from random errors that might cancel out over multiple observations or samples.

Bias vs. Consistency: Consistency is another important property of estimators, referring to the idea that as more data is collected (i.e., as the sample size approaches infinity), the estimator converges in probability to the true parameter value. An estimator can be consistent but biased if it eventually converges to the true value as sample size increases, yet the expected value of the estimator does not equal the true value at finite sample sizes.

Unbiased vs. Biased Estimators: While unbiased estimators are generally preferable because they do not systematically overestimate or underestimate the parameter, there are many situations in which a biased estimator might be chosen over an unbiased one. Reasons for choosing a biased estimator include:

Lack of an unbiased estimator without imposing additional assumptions.
Computational difficulties associated with unbiased estimators.
Lower mean squared error (MSE) achieved by a biased estimator, making it preferable in terms of overall accuracy.
Unbiased estimators may be impractical or not useful in certain cases.
Bias With Respect to Different Measures: While bias is typically measured with respect to the mean (expected value), it can also be measured with respect to the median. An estimator can be median-unbiased but not mean-unbiased, and vice versa. This distinction is important because mean-unbiasedness does not necessarily hold under non-linear transformations, whereas median-unbiasedness often does.

Implications of Bias: The presence of bias in an estimator affects how we interpret its results. Knowing an estimator is biased allows researchers to adjust their interpretations or to apply corrections to the estimator to reduce the bias. In practice, the choice between using a biased or unbiased estimator often involves trade-offs, such as between bias and variance (another key statistical concept), where reducing bias may increase variance, and vice versa.

Examples and Consequences:
A classic example of bias in estimators is the sample variance formula, which, if naively calculated as the average of squared deviations from the sample mean, underestimates the population variance. A correction factor (dividing by 
�
−
1
n−1 instead of 
�
n, where 
�
n is the sample size) is used to make the estimator unbiased.

Another example is in the estimation of standard deviation, where the unbiased estimator is more complex and harder to compute, leading practitioners sometimes to prefer biased estimators for simplicity or computational efficiency.

In summary, understanding the bias of an estimator is crucial for correctly interpreting statistical results and for choosing the most appropriate method for estimation in various contexts. It underscores the importance of a deep understanding of statistical properties and their implications in real-world data analysis.

{\displaystyle x}). The second equation follows since θ is measurable with respect to the conditional distribution

)
{\displaystyle P(x\mid \theta )}.

An estimator is said to be unbiased if its bias is equal to zero for all values of parameter θ, or equivalently, if the expected value of the estimator matches that of the parameter.[3] Unbiasedness is not guaranteed to carry over. For example, if 
�
^{\displaystyle {\hat {\theta }}} is an unbiased estimator for parameter θ, it is not guaranteed that g(
�
^{\displaystyle {\hat {\theta }}}) is an unbiased estimator for g(θ).[4]

In a simulation experiment concerning the properties of an estimator, the bias of the estimator may be assessed using the mean signed difference.
ChatGPT
In the context of statistical models, bias is a key concept that helps assess the accuracy of estimators—functions or algorithms used to estimate parameters (θ) of a probability distribution based on observed data (x). The formal definition of the bias of an estimator 
�
^
θ
^
  with respect to the true parameter θ is given by the difference between the expected value of the estimator and the true parameter value. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

Bias

=

^
]
−
�
Bias( 
θ
^
 ,θ)=E 
x∣θ
​
 [ 
θ
^
 ]−θ

This definition indicates that if an estimator's expected value—considering all possible observations x from the distribution 
�
(
�
∣
�
)
P(x∣θ)—is equal to the actual parameter θ, the estimator is unbiased. Otherwise, the difference represents the bias.

Unbiasedness of Estimators
An estimator 
�
^
θ
^
  is unbiased if, for all values of θ, the bias is zero. This means the expected value of 
�
^
θ
^
  is equal to θ. Unbiasedness is a desirable property because it implies that, on average, the estimator will yield the true parameter value across many samples from the distribution.

Non-linearity and Unbiasedness
It's important to note that unbiasedness does not necessarily preserve under transformations. That is, even if 
�
^
θ
^
  is an unbiased estimator of θ, a function of the estimator, 
�
(
�
^
)
g( 
θ
^
 ), may not be an unbiased estimator of 
�
(
�
)
g(θ). This property highlights the complexity of constructing unbiased estimators, especially for functions of parameters.

Assessing Bias in Practice
In empirical studies or simulation experiments, the bias of an estimator can be evaluated using the mean signed difference between the estimated values and the true parameter value. This approach allows researchers to quantify how much and in which direction (
+
+ or 
−
−) an estimator tends to deviate from the true value on average, providing a practical measure of the estimator's accuracy.

Summary
Bias is a fundamental concept in statistics that measures the systematic error of an estimator. Understanding and assessing the bias of estimators are crucial for developing accurate statistical models and for making reliable inferences based on data. While unbiased estimators are ideal, in practice, the choice of an estimator often involves trade-offs between bias, variance, and computational feasibility.

Real World Bias

Bias due to common causes is called “confounding”, and it happens all the time in real contexts. This is the source of the (greater than) 1000 percentage point bias we mentioned in the introduction. The world actually looks something like figure 4. It’s the reason why it’s wrong to naively group objects by some property (e.g. article category) and compare averages (e.g. shares per article).


Fig 4: Real world bias
In this picture, we’re interested in whether people search for a product online. We want to understand how effective an advertisement is, and so we’d like to know the causal effect of seeing the ad on whether you’ll search for a product. Unfortunately, there’s a common cause of both. If you’re an active internet user, you’re more likely to see the ad. If you’re an active internet user, you’re also more likely to search for the product (independently of whether you see the ad or not). This kind of bias is called “activity bias,” and the effect you’d measure without taking it into account is more than 200 times greater than the true effect of the ad.

Fortunately, experiments can get around this problem. If you randomize who gets to see the ad, then you break the relationship between online activity and seeing the ad. In other words, you delete the arrow between “activity” and “sees ad” in the picture. This is a very deep concept worth its own post, which we’ll do in the future!

You could also remove the bias by conditioning, but that depends strongly on how good your measurement of activity is. Experiments are always the first choice. If you can’t do one, conditioning is a close second. We’ll also detail some different approaches to conditioning in a future post! For now, let’s try to draw out the basic conclusions.

To Condition or Not to Condition?

We’ve seen that bias can come from conditioning when you’re conditioning on a common effect, and doesn’t exist when you don’t condition. We’ve also seen that bias can come from not conditioning on a common cause, and goes away when you do condition. The “back-door criterion” tells you, given any sufficiently complete (strong caveat!) picture of the world, what you should and shouldn’t condition on. There are two criteria: (1) You don’t condition on a common effect (or any effects of “Y”), and (2) you do condition on common causes! This covers all of our bases, and so applying the back-door criterion is the solution, but the requirement that you have to know the right picture of the world is strong one. This leaves the question open about how we should “do science”. Do we try to build the picture of the world, and find the right things to condition on, so we can estimate any effect we like? Is the world sufficiently static that the picture changes slowly enough for this approach to be okay? (Pearl makes arguments that the picture is actually very static!). Or will it only ever be feasible to do one-off experiments, and estimate effects as we need them. Physics certainly wouldn’t have gotten as far as it has if it had taken the latter approach.

Finally, you may have realized that conditioning on “the right” variables is a stark contrast to the usual, dump-all-of-your-data-in approach to machine learning. This is also a topic worth its own post! It turns out that if you want the best chance of having a truly “predictive” model, you probably want to do something more like applying the back-door criterion than putting all of your past observational data into a model. You can get around this by being careful not to put downstream effects into the model. The reason why has to do with the “do” operation, and the deep difference between intervention and observation. It’s definitely worth its own article!
ChatGPT
Adam Kelleher delves into the complex issue of real-world bias in data, particularly focusing on confounding bias, which is a prevalent problem in observational studies. Confounding occurs when an outside factor, known as a confounder, influences both the independent variable (e.g., exposure to an advertisement) and the dependent variable (e.g., searching for a product online), leading to a spurious association between the two.

Activity Bias as an Example
Kelleher introduces "activity bias" as a specific instance of confounding, where an individual's likelihood of both seeing an advertisement and searching for a product online is influenced by their level of internet activity. This scenario illustrates how confounding can drastically exaggerate the perceived effectiveness of an advertisement. In the absence of controlling for this bias, the effect measured could be more than 200 times greater than the actual effect.

Solutions to Confounding: Experiments and Conditioning
To mitigate confounding, Kelleher suggests two main approaches:

Randomized Experiments: By randomly assigning participants to either be exposed to the advertisement or not, researchers can break the link between internet activity and ad exposure. This method effectively controls for confounding variables by ensuring they are evenly distributed across both groups, allowing for a more accurate estimation of the advertisement's effect.

Conditioning: Another strategy involves conditioning on the confounding variable (in this case, internet activity) to adjust for its effects. However, the effectiveness of this approach heavily relies on the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the activity measurement. Although experiments are generally preferred for their ability to establish causal relationships, conditioning serves as a viable alternative when experiments are not feasible.

The Back-door Criterion
The back-door criterion, as proposed by Judea Pearl, offers a systematic way to determine when and what to condition on to address confounding bias. It suggests that one should not condition on a common effect or its downstream effects but should condition on common causes. This criterion requires a sufficiently detailed understanding of the causal structure of the data, emphasizing the importance of accurately mapping out the causal relationships among variables.

Implications for Science and Machine Learning
Kelleher raises broader questions about the scientific method and the role of machine learning. He contrasts the traditional, exploratory approach of building a comprehensive model of the world and conditioning on the right variables with the data-driven, predictive focus of machine learning. The discussion highlights the crucial distinction between intervention (doing something to the system) and observation (watching what happens naturally), underscoring the deep implications of this difference for predictive modeling and causal inference.

Overall, Kelleher's exploration into real-world bias, particularly confounding, underscores the challenges and nuances of accurately measuring effects and establishing causality in observational data. It emphasizes the importance of careful experimental design, the thoughtful application of conditioning, and the critical distinction between correlation and causation in scientific research and data analysis.

Do you know the movie Littlefoot about yeti living in a mountain with a gong that brought up the sun?
ChatGPT
Yes, you're referring to "Smallfoot," an animated film released in 2018. "Smallfoot" turns the Bigfoot legend upside down when a bright young Yeti finds something he thought didn't exist—a human. The news of this "smallfoot" brings him fame and a chance with the girl of his dreams. It also throws the simple Yeti community into an uproar over what else might be out there in the big world beyond their snowy village, leading to a quest full of adventure and discovery. The film explores themes of curiosity, truth, and the breaking down of misconceptions. It's a fun and heartwarming story for audiences of all ages.

User
Ok well the connection was that there was a AB test, the gong had to be hit with a slingshotted gong ringer with a helmet, but the sun came up even when struck with two gongs (the broken helmet) or when not struck. The smallfoot was said to be none existent by the stone runes
ChatGPT
That's an interesting perspective! In "Smallfoot," the Yeti community follows a set of beliefs carved into stone runes, one of which involves the daily ritual of waking the sun with a gong. This practice, as you've noted, can indeed be likened to an AB test scenario:

Version A (Control): The traditional method where a Yeti strikes the gong with a slingshotted gong ringer, believing it causes the sun to rise.
Version B (Variant): The helmet breaks, altering the method of striking the gong, or the gong isn't struck at all.
The observation that the sun rises regardless of whether the gong is struck in the traditional manner, with a broken helmet, or not at all, provides a humorous yet insightful commentary on questioning traditions, beliefs, and the nature of causality—essentially, challenging the community's longstanding assumptions.

The storyline cleverly introduces the concept of skepticism and the scientific method (experimentation, observation, and conclusion) to a younger audience. It suggests that just because an action is followed by an outcome, it doesn't necessarily mean the action caused the outcome—a fundamental principle in understanding causality versus correlation.

Moreover, the denial of the "smallfoot's" (human's) existence by the stone runes and the societal leaders reflects on how communities can be resistant to evidence that contradicts established beliefs, further enriching the film's narrative with themes of discovery, truth-seeking, and the importance of open-mindedness.

User
I thought the yeti represented children and animals (the mountain was a complex ecosystem, with the runes instructing how to build and maintain the cloud generating devices, and the humans adults. The mountain also could represent filter bubbles, nuclear families, communities, and social media platforms in general.
ChatGPT
Your interpretation adds a rich layer of metaphorical meaning to "Smallfoot," highlighting the film's ability to engage with complex themes under the guise of a children's animation. Viewing the Yeti as representatives of children and animals, and the mountain as a complex ecosystem, introduces an allegory for how societies organize and maintain themselves, often through traditions and rules that may not be based on empirical truth but serve to uphold a certain order or serve specific purposes—like the cloud-generating devices that sustain the Yetis' secluded way of life.

The comparison of the mountain to "filter bubbles," nuclear families, communities, and social media platforms is particularly insightful. It reflects on how individuals or groups often live within their own "echo chambers," where beliefs and norms are reinforced without exposure to or consideration of alternative perspectives. The stone runes, in this context, can symbolize the foundational but sometimes unexamined beliefs that guide behaviors within these bubbles.

The film's exploration of discovery, challenging established norms, and ultimately bridging the gap between two worlds (the Yetis and the humans) can serve as a commentary on the importance of breaking out of these bubbles. It advocates for curiosity, critical thinking, and the pursuit of knowledge beyond the confines of one's immediate environment or ingrained belief systems. This interpretation resonates with current societal concerns about polarization, the role of education, and the potential of open, honest communication to foster understanding and empathy across diverse groups.

In essence, "Smallfoot" can be seen as an encouragement to question, explore, and connect—valuable lessons for both young audiences and adults, making it more than just an entertaining animated film, but a conversation starter about growth, understanding, and the nature of truth in our complex, interconnected world.

I was a little distracted by the animation style and cartoon physics. 
ChatGPT
The animation style and cartoon physics in "Smallfoot" indeed play a significant role in the film's appeal, especially to younger audiences. These elements are not just for entertainment; they also serve to enhance the storytelling, making complex themes more accessible and engaging. The exaggerated physics and vibrant animation can draw viewers in, creating a fun and captivating world that contrasts with and highlights the deeper messages within the story.

Animation allows filmmakers to explore and exaggerate scenarios in ways that live-action cannot, enabling them to visually emphasize certain aspects of the story or themes without the constraints of real-world physics. For example, the cartoon physics in "Smallfoot" can symbolize the larger-than-life realizations and changes the characters undergo. It can also make the exploration of serious themes like skepticism, truth-seeking, and challenging societal norms more palatable and less intimidating for children.

Moreover, the distinct animation style contributes to the film's unique identity, helping it stand out among other animated movies. It can be a double-edged sword, though; while it attracts and holds the attention of many viewers, it can also be a distraction for others who might find it hard to look beyond the surface and engage with the underlying messages of the film.

In the end, the use of animation and cartoon physics in "Smallfoot" is a creative choice that plays a crucial role in how the story is told and experienced. It demonstrates the power of animated films to not only entertain but also to educate and provoke thought across a wide range of ages.

I just thought it was disturbing how close their eyes were together and they didn't have noses. The mouth movements didn't seem believable. I thought maybe it was intended to help tame pareidolic monster interpretation in children, and then I thought that many people might be looking at one person's eye when talking to a person but be thinking of it as two eyes because of their own binocular rivally. Likewise I thought the cartoon motion and movement might be more believable if people are tracking the shadows and curve outlines of a small part of the face like their mustache or the shadows on their cheeks, and yet think of it as the whole person talking
ChatGPT
Your observations delve into the intricate relationship between animation style, character design, and viewer perception, highlighting how these elements influence audience engagement and interpretation. The design choices in "Smallfoot," such as the characters' closely set eyes, lack of noses, and the specific mouth movements, can indeed impact how viewers connect with the characters and the narrative. These choices are often intentional, crafted to evoke certain responses or to align with the film's thematic goals.

The idea that the design might be used to "tame pareidolic monster interpretation in children" is fascinating. Pareidolia, the tendency to see familiar patterns (like faces) in random or ambiguous visual patterns, is a common psychological phenomenon. By simplifying character features, animators could potentially make characters appear less threatening and more approachable to young viewers, easing the engagement with creatures (like Yetis) that might otherwise be interpreted as monstrous or frightening.

Your thoughts on binocular rivalry and focusing on parts of a face (like a mustache or cheek shadows) during conversation extend this idea further. They suggest that the animation and motion design might not need to replicate reality precisely to be effective. Instead, by emphasizing certain features or movements, animators can guide viewers' attention and create a coherent sense of character and emotion. This principle is fundamental to animation and character design, where exaggeration and selective detail can convey personality and emotion more effectively than photorealistic replication.

Such design decisions demonstrate the depth of consideration that goes into animated films like "Smallfoot." They're not just about telling a story but also about how that story is presented visually and how it engages the audience's perceptions and emotions. Animation offers a unique canvas for exploring complex themes in an accessible and often more emotionally resonant way, leveraging artistic exaggeration and focusing on key details to communicate with viewers across different ages and backgrounds.

User
Yeah I mean more that the reason it might be tolerable to watch is that humans are not modeling a person's skeleton or physics while talking to them. The shadows and coherent colour space areas might be moving in the kinds of ways that these creatures move. I was thinking of this to help me suspend disbelief.
ChatGPT
Your perspective offers a compelling insight into how audiences engage with and interpret animated characters, suggesting that the tolerability and believability of these characters don't necessarily stem from an accurate representation of human anatomy or physics. Instead, the visual cues provided by shadowing, color spaces, and the general movement of characters can create a sufficient basis for viewers to suspend disbelief and engage with the narrative.

In essence, animation capitalizes on the human brain's ability to recognize patterns and infer emotion, intention, and life from minimal cues. This principle, known as the "law of closure" in Gestalt psychology, suggests that humans tend to see complete figures even when part of the information is missing. Animated films often use this to their advantage by simplifying characters to essential traits that evoke recognition and empathy, without the need for detailed realism.

The movement of shadows and coherent color spaces, as you mentioned, can mimic the essence of life-like motion, prompting viewers to fill in the gaps with their imagination. This approach not only makes the animation process more manageable but also engages the audience's creative thinking, making the viewing experience interactive in a sense. The human brain does not require a frame-by-frame recreation of reality to understand or empathize with a character; it only needs suggestive motion and visual cues that resonate on an emotional or intuitive level.

By focusing on these aspects rather than striving for photorealistic accuracy, animators can craft characters and worlds that are both fantastical and emotionally resonant. This creative latitude allows for the exploration of themes, narratives, and characters that might be difficult to achieve with more realistic representations, broadening the scope of storytelling and audience engagement. In watching "Smallfoot" or similar animations, the audience's ability to suspend disbelief is thus not a passive process but an active engagement with the film's visual and narrative cues, facilitated by the brain's pattern-recognition capabilities.

Connections with the earlier topics
ChatGPT
Let's draw connections between our discussion on "Smallfoot," its animation style, and the earlier topics we've explored. This reflection will reveal how diverse conversations about animation, statistical analysis, and cognitive processing share underlying themes of perception, interpretation, and the quest for understanding.

1. AB Testing and Experimentation in "Smallfoot":
The narrative of "Smallfoot" includes elements of experimentation and skepticism, akin to AB testing principles. Just as in AB testing, where different versions are tested to understand their impact, the Yeti community in "Smallfoot" undergoes a form of real-world testing. They challenge their beliefs about the human world (their version A) against the new evidence presented by the human (the version B), leading to new insights about their reality. This parallels the process of challenging assumptions and validating hypotheses through controlled experiments or observations in various domains.

2. Bias and Misinterpretation:
Our discussions about bias, particularly in statistical estimators and real-world contexts, can relate to the misconceptions held by the Yeti community about humans ("smallfoots") and vice versa. Just as bias in data analysis can lead to incorrect conclusions, the Yetis' and humans' preconceived notions about each other represent a form of cognitive bias. Overcoming this requires gathering more data (through interaction) and adjusting their models of understanding, echoing the process of correcting bias in statistical analysis.

3. Perception and Simplification in Animation:
The conversation about the animation style in "Smallfoot" and how humans interpret animated characters connects deeply with our discussions on bias and experimentation. Animation simplifies complex realities into digestible, engaging forms, much like how statistical models simplify and interpret complex data. The effectiveness of animation in conveying emotion and narrative through simplified visual cues mirrors the challenge in data science of distilling complex information into actionable insights.

4. Breaking Down Misconceptions and Exploring New Perspectives:
"Smallfoot" challenges its characters (and its audience) to question their long-held beliefs, fostering a theme of discovery and understanding. This mirrors the essence of statistical analysis and scientific inquiry—challenging existing hypotheses, exploring new data, and ultimately revising our understanding of the world. Both the film's narrative and the practice of data analysis encourage an openness to new information and the readiness to adjust one's perspective based on evidence.

5. Engaging with Complex Themes through Accessible Means:
Just as "Smallfoot" uses animation to make complex themes of skepticism, community norms, and the fear of the unknown accessible to a younger audience, our discussion utilized metaphors and examples from everyday life and familiar scenarios to explore abstract concepts like AB testing, bias, and causality. This approach underscores the value of leveraging accessible formats to engage with and educate on complex topics.

In sum, our journey from statistical concepts to the intricacies of animation and narrative storytelling in "Smallfoot" underscores the interconnectedness of human inquiry, whether it be in the pursuit of scientific truth, the crafting of engaging stories, or the exploration of how we perceive and interpret the world around us. Each topic, though seemingly distinct, shares a common thread: the desire to understand, interpret, and ultimately connect more deeply with the reality we inhabit.

User
Ok well I am not exactly sure I can recommend the movie or not. There were hundreds or thousands of "messages" implied by the film. The sociological and philosophical narratives might be just as cartoonish and simplistic as the physics and the animation
ChatGPT
Your ambivalence towards recommending "Smallfoot" reflects a nuanced understanding of how media, especially films targeted at children, embeds and communicates complex themes. Films often encapsulate a wide range of messages, some more overt than others, and the depth and nuance with which these messages are conveyed can vary significantly.

"Smallfoot" indeed juggles numerous sociological and philosophical themes, such as questioning authority, the importance of curiosity and skepticism, the fear of the unknown, and the process of discovery. While the film attempts to make these themes accessible to a younger audience through simplified narratives and exaggerated animation, the simplification process can sometimes result in a portrayal that some viewers might find too cartoonish or lacking in depth. This can make it challenging for viewers to fully engage with or take seriously the film's attempt to tackle such themes.

Furthermore, the portrayal of complex ideas through a cartoonish lens might not resonate with everyone, especially if viewers are seeking a more nuanced or realistic exploration of these themes. On the other hand, this approach can serve as a valuable conversation starter for younger audiences, providing an opportunity for parents, educators, and viewers to discuss and explore these themes further in a more nuanced context.

The decision to recommend "Smallfoot" might then depend on what one hopes to get out of the film. For viewers seeking an entertaining way to introduce children to the ideas of challenging societal norms and embracing curiosity, "Smallfoot" could be a valuable pick. However, for those looking for a more in-depth exploration of its underlying sociological and philosophical narratives, the film's treatment of these themes might not meet their expectations.

In the end, "Smallfoot" offers an opportunity to reflect on how animated films balance entertainment with the conveyance of messages, and how such messages are received and interpreted by diverse audiences. Your thoughtful consideration of its merits and limitations highlights the complexity of evaluating media content that straddles entertainment, education, and the introduction of young viewers to significant life concepts.

It looks like it is trying to teach ecological issues, but it also seems like it contains subliminal messages to overthrow the status quo
ChatGPT
Your observation touches on the multifaceted nature of "Smallfoot" and similar animated films, which often incorporate layers of meaning to appeal to a wide range of viewers. On one level, these films can introduce and discuss ecological issues and the importance of respecting and understanding our environment, which is a crucial lesson for all ages, especially given the current global ecological challenges.

The film's narrative, involving the Yeti community's discovery of humans and the broader world beyond their snowy village, can indeed be seen as a metaphor for ecological awareness. It suggests a need to look beyond our immediate surroundings and consider the broader impact of our actions on the planet. This message encourages viewers to think about coexistence, conservation, and the importance of questioning practices that harm the environment.

On another level, "Smallfoot" explores themes of questioning authority and challenging the status quo. The Yeti's journey represents a quest for knowledge, truth, and the courage to challenge existing beliefs for the sake of discovery and improvement. While the primary narrative might not directly call for overthrowing the status quo, it does advocate for critical thinking, skepticism towards unfounded beliefs, and the value of scientific inquiry and openness to change.

The notion of "subliminal messages" to overthrow the status quo might stem from the film's encouragement of questioning and reevaluating societal norms and truths. In a broader context, these themes resonate with contemporary social and political discourse, advocating for awareness, dialogue, and action in the face of injustice or environmental degradation.

Films like "Smallfoot" use their narratives and characters to spark conversation and reflection among their audiences about these issues. For younger viewers, the film can serve as an introduction to thinking critically about the world around them. For older viewers, it can act as a reminder of the power of questioning and the importance of staying informed and engaged with societal and environmental issues.

In recommending the film, it's valuable to consider these layers and the conversations they might inspire. "Smallfoot" can be a tool for education and discussion, encouraging viewers of all ages to think more deeply about their relationship with the world and their role in shaping its future.

I just thought that you can really prove anything through a single isolated event because of theory-ladenness
ChatGPT
Your insight touches on a critical aspect of scientific inquiry and epistemology: the concept of theory-ladenness. This idea suggests that our observations, interpretations, and even the seemingly straightforward "facts" we gather from the world are influenced by our prior beliefs, theories, and the conceptual frameworks within which we operate. In essence, what we see and how we understand it is laden with theoretical assumptions.

The notion that "you can really prove anything through a single isolated event" speaks to the limitations and challenges inherent in interpreting data or evidence without considering the broader context and the theoretical underpinnings of our interpretations. A single observation or event can be made to support various hypotheses if it is abstracted from its context or if the interpretative framework is flexible enough.

This theory-ladenness is why scientific practice emphasizes reproducibility, peer review, and the accumulation of evidence from multiple, independent observations before drawing broad conclusions. The scientific method attempts to mitigate the influence of individual biases and theoretical presuppositions by exposing ideas to empirical testing and critical scrutiny from the scientific community.

In the context of films like "Smallfoot" and discussions about ecological issues or challenging the status quo, the concept of theory-ladenness reminds us to be cautious about drawing sweeping conclusions from individual narratives or events. It encourages us to look for broader patterns, seek diverse perspectives, and critically assess our assumptions and biases in interpreting information.

Moreover, theory-ladenness underscores the importance of education and critical thinking skills in navigating a world rich with information and competing interpretations. By being aware of the theoretical frameworks that shape our understanding, we can strive for a more nuanced and informed engagement with the issues and narratives we encounter.

In summary, your observation highlights the complexity of interpreting observations and the need for a critical, informed approach to understanding the world around us. It serves as a reminder of the value of skepticism, the pursuit of knowledge, and the openness to revising our views in light of new evidence and perspectives.

I was trying to can't prove anything through isolated events, but in a way, all events are unique isolated events, so we have to abstract the invariant elements or symmetries before we can analyze them
ChatGPT
Ah, I see your point now, and it's a profound one. The idea that "you can't prove anything through isolated events" aligns with a fundamental principle of scientific inquiry and critical thinking. It underscores the challenge in generalizing from singular occurrences due to their unique, context-specific nature. Yet, as you rightly noted, every event in its entirety is, in some sense, an isolated incident, infused with unique conditions and variables. This presents a paradox for understanding the world and deriving general principles or laws that govern phenomena.

The resolution to this paradox, as you suggest, involves abstracting invariant elements or identifying symmetries from these unique events. This process allows us to distill patterns, principles, or laws that apply across different contexts, despite the individual uniqueness of each event. In science, this often involves identifying variables that significantly influence outcomes and understanding how these variables interact under various conditions. Through experimentation and observation across diverse contexts, scientists aim to isolate these invariant elements, thus enabling the formulation of theories that hold true across many supposedly isolated events.

This abstraction process is critical in fields ranging from physics to sociology. For example, in physics, the laws of motion apply regardless of where an object is or what it is made of, abstracting away from the specifics of individual objects and their unique paths through space. In sociology, researchers look for patterns in human behavior that persist across different cultures and historical periods, despite the unique circumstances of each society.

In the context of interpreting films like "Smallfoot" or engaging with complex ecological and societal issues, this principle reminds us to look beyond the specifics of the narrative or singular events depicted. Instead, we are encouraged to extract broader themes and lessons that apply beyond the movie's plot or a single real-world incident. It's about identifying those invariant elements within the stories we tell and the events we witness that resonate with universal experiences or truths.

Your insight beautifully captures the balance between recognizing the uniqueness of each event and seeking the underlying patterns that allow us to make sense of the world and navigate it more effectively. It highlights the importance of abstraction in moving from observation to understanding, and from understanding to meaningful action or insight.

So maybe all films and books have something in them that will appeal to them personally. At first I kept wanting to turn off the movie, but then something would happen that reminded me of something thing that had happened to me, or that were related to things I was thinking about, despite not having met any yetis. For example, I have a theory that Neanderthals built lithophones from stalagtites in caves in Bruniquel France, and then I saw a yeti playing icicles like a xylophone, which I took as positive evidence for my theory.

Your experience with "Smallfoot" illustrates a fascinating aspect of human engagement with stories, whether they unfold on screen or within the pages of a book. It highlights how personal relevance and connections can significantly enhance our engagement with and appreciation for narratives, even when their surface elements seem distant from our own realities.

The moment in "Smallfoot" where a yeti plays icicles like a xylophone resonating with your theory about Neanderthals and lithophones is a perfect example of this phenomenon. While the movie and your historical theory about Neanderthals exist in vastly different contexts, the thematic similarity bridged that gap, drawing you deeper into the narrative and, perhaps, validating your interests and ideas in an unexpected way. This speaks to the power of stories to connect with us on deeply personal levels, often in ways that the creators might not have anticipated.

This connection also underscores the concept of "apophenia," which is the human tendency to perceive meaningful patterns within random data. While the scene in "Smallfoot" was not intended to comment on Neanderthal behavior, your personal interest and research allowed you to draw a parallel that enriched your viewing experience and linked it to your broader interests and theories.

Moreover, your reaction to the film highlights the subjective nature of narrative interpretation. Each viewer brings their own experiences, interests, and biases to their interpretation of a story, which means that the same film or book can evoke a wide range of responses and takeaways. This subjectivity is what makes the discussion and sharing of interpretations so enriching—it allows for a diverse range of insights and connections that can deepen our understanding of both the narrative and our own selves.

In essence, stories, whether conveyed through film, literature, or other mediums, serve as a canvas upon which we project our own narratives, questions, and theories. This interplay between narrative and personal experience is a testament to the richness of storytelling as an art form and its capacity to resonate on multiple levels, often in profoundly personal ways.

It looks like your search for "abstraction in Smallfoot" led to results related to a different context of "Smallfoot," specifically in the realm of computer science and programming, rather than the animated film. The references to "Smallfoot" here pertain to a tool and research related to assertion checking in programming with separation logic.

Separation Logic and Smallfoot in Computer Science:

Separation Logic: This is a branch of logic used for reasoning about computer programs and, more specifically, about how programs interact with memory. It's particularly useful for verifying properties of programs that manipulate pointers and dynamically allocated memory, helping ensure they do so correctly without errors such as memory leaks or pointer dereference issues.
Smallfoot: Within this context, Smallfoot is a tool designed to automate the process of assertion checking in C programs based on separation logic. It aims to verify that programs handle memory and pointers correctly according to the specifications provided by the developer. By automating this process, Smallfoot helps in identifying potential errors and verifying program correctness, reducing the likelihood of bugs related to memory management.
The concept of "abstraction" in these search results likely refers to the process of abstracting or simplifying the complex interactions between parts of a program and its use of memory to make them more manageable and understandable for verification purposes. Abstract interpretation, mentioned in one of the summaries, is a technique used in static program analysis to provide an over-approximation of the program's behavior, allowing for the analysis of its properties without executing the program.

While these results diverge from the animated film "Smallfoot," they highlight an interesting crossover in naming conventions between completely different fields—one rooted in animated storytelling and the other in the technical discipline of computer science. This serves as a reminder of the broad and varied applications of concepts like abstraction across different domains, each with its unique challenges and methodologies for seeking understanding and ensuring correctness, whether in narratives or software.
