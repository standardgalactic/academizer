Step-Back Prompting (STP) interfaces with one LLM only and in an iterative process.
As you will see later in this article, STP can be used in conjunction with RAG with comparable results.
As seen in the image below, STP is a more technical prompt engineering approach where the original question needs to be distilled into a stepback question. And the stepback answer used for the final answer.

Considering the example below I executed using LangSmith, a prompt can be created which instructs the LLM on how to generate a stepback question:
You are an expert at world knowledge. 
Your task is to step back and paraphrase a question to a more generic 
step-back question, which is easier to answer. 

Here are a few examples:
Original Question: Which position did Knox Cunningham hold from May 1955 to Apr 1956?
Stepback Question: Which positions have Knox Cunning- ham held in his career?

Original Question: Who was the spouse of Anna Karina from 1968 to 1974?
Stepback Question: Who were the spouses of Anna Karina?

Original Question: Which team did Thierry Audel play for from 2007 to 2008?
Stepback Question: Which teams did Thierry Audel play for in his career?
Here the stepback question is generated via LangSmith making use of GooglePalm text-bison-001.

I do get the sense that this prompting technique is too complex for a static or prompt template approach and will work better in an autonomous agent implementation.
As we have seen with most prompting techniques published, Large Language Models (LLMs) need guidance when intricate, multi-step reasoning is demanded from a query, and decomposition is a key component when solving complex request.

A process of supervision with step-by-step verification is a promising remedy to improve the correctness of intermediate reasoning step

The most well known prompting technique when it comes to decomposition is chain-of-thought reasoning. In this study Step-Back Prompting is compared to COT prompting.

The text below shows a complete example of STP with the original question, the stepback question, principles, and the prompt for the final answer to be generated by the LLM.

Original Question: "Potassium-40 is a minor isotope found in naturally occurring potassium. It is radioactive and can be detected on simple radiation counters. 

How many protons, neutrons, and electrons does potassium-40 have when it is part of K2SO4?

Choose an option from the list below:

0) 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 18 electrons
1) 20 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons
2) 21 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons
3) 19 neutrons, 19 protons, 19 electrons"

Stepback Question: "What are the chemistry principles behind this question?"

Principles:
"Atomic number: The atomic number of an element is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom of that element."

Final Answer:
This chart shows the strong performance of Step-Back Prompting which follows an abstraction and reasoning scheme. Evidently this approach leads to significant improvements in a wide range of more complex tasks.

Step-Back Prompting (STP) is a new technique that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to abstract and understand high-level concepts, aiding in accurate answers. This method interfaces with a single LLM iteratively and can be combined with RAG for comparable outcomes. In this approach, an original question is transformed into a more general "stepback" question which simplifies the answering process. For instance, instead of asking for Knox Cunningham's position from May 1955 to Apr 1956, the stepback question might inquire about all positions he held in his career. The technique is particularly useful for complex questions requiring multi-step reasoning, with decomposing queries being crucial. While Chain-of-Thought (COT) reasoning is a known technique for decomposition, STP is being compared to it. An example provided involves determining the number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in Potassium-40 when it's part of K2SO4. Performance charts reveal that Step-Back Prompting significantly enhances results in intricate tasks, notably improving predictions on the TimeQA dataset when compared to baseline and RAG predictions.
The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise. ��� Edsger W. Dijkstra

This study again illustrates the versatility of Large Language Models and how new ways of interacting with LLMs can be invented to leverage LLMs even further.

This technique also shows the ambit of static prompting and clearly shows that as complexity grows, more augmented tools like prompt-chaining and autonom
ChatGPT
ous agents are needed to optimize the interaction with LLMs. As we push the boundaries of what these models can achieve, it becomes evident that we must continually evolve our techniques and tools to harness their full potential. The importance of abstraction, as highlighted by Dijkstra, is to reach new levels of precision and clarity. Step-Back Prompting embodies this principle by simplifying complex queries into their essence, ensuring accuracy in responses. The future of LLM interaction lies in developing such innovative techniques that strike a balance between abstraction and precision.

We present Step-Back Prompting, a simple prompting technique that enables LLMs to do abstractions to derive high-level concepts and first principles from instances containing specific details. Using the concepts and principles to guide the reasoning steps, LLMs significantly improve their abilities in following a correct reasoning path towards the solution. We conduct experiments of Step-Back Prompting with PaLM-2L models and observe substantial performance gains on a wide range of challenging reasoning-intensive tasks including STEM, Knowledge QA, and Multi-Hop Reasoning. For instance, Step-Back Prompting improves PaLM-2L performance on MMLU Physics and Chemistry by 7% and 11%, TimeQA by 27%, and MuSiQue by 7%.
ChatGPT
The paper titled "Take a Step Back: Evoking Reasoning via Abstraction in Large Language Models" by Huaixiu Steven Zheng and colleagues introduces a technique called Step-Back Prompting. This method allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to abstract specific details from given instances, leading them to understand overarching concepts and fundamental principles. By guiding LLMs with these abstractions, the models become better equipped to navigate the reasoning process effectively, ultimately leading to more accurate solutions.
The authors tested Step-Back Prompting using the PaLM-2L model and documented notable improvements in tasks that require intensive reasoning. For areas like STEM, Knowledge QA, and Multi-Hop Reasoning, this method proved particularly beneficial. Specifically, performance improvements were observed as follows:
An increase of 7% and 11% on MMLU Physics and Chemistry respectively.
TimeQA performance boosted by 27%.
MuSiQue saw an enhancement of 7%.
This study underscores the potential of abstract reasoning in LLMs and offers a promising technique to further enhance their performance on complex tasks.

Step-Back Prompting (Question-Answering)
One prompting technique called "Step-Back" prompting can improve performance on complex questions by first asking a "step back" question. This can be combined with regular question-answering applications by then doing retrieval on both the original and step-back question.

ChatGPT
This code demonstrates the implementation of the "Step-Back Prompting" technique for question-answering. Here's a summary:
Step-Back Prompting (STP)
: It's a technique where before answering a specific question, you first ask a more generic "step-back" question. This approach can help improve performance on complex queries.
Implementation
: The code uses the Python programming language and utilizes the LangChain API. There are three main parts:
Setting Up STP
: This section initializes the STP process. It includes defining "few-shot" examples, which are examples of the original question and the step-back question. This is used to train the model on how to derive the step-back question from the original.
Question Generation
: This part takes an input question, uses the ChatOpenAI model to convert it into a step-back question, and then searches for relevant context for both the original and step-back questions using the DuckDuckGo Search API Wrapper.
Answer Generation
: Two approaches are used.
The first approach utilizes the contexts retrieved from both the original and step-back questions. It passes these contexts to the ChatOpenAI model, which then generates a comprehensive answer.
The baseline approach only uses the context from the original question to generate an answer.
Results
: Using the sample question "was chatgpt around while trump was president?", the STP method provides a more accurate response: "No, ChatGPT was not around while Donald Trump was president. ChatGPT was launched on November 30, 2022, which is after Donald Trump's presidency.". Meanwhile, the baseline approach gives a contradictory answer, suggesting that ChatGPT was around during Trump's presidency.
Resources
: Links to the research paper on the technique and a blog post by Cobus Greyling are provided.
This code serves as a practical guide to implementing STP, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving question-answering performance.
So how does it decide how to ask a step-up question?
ChatGPT
The "Step-Back Prompting" technique, as described in the provided code, uses the concept of abstraction to "step back" from a specific question to generate a more general, high-level question. The way it decides to ask a "step-back" or more generic question is based on the following components:
Few-Shot Examples
: The technique employs few-shot learning. This involves providing the model with a limited number of examples where a specific question (input) is mapped to its more generic step-back version (output). These examples guide the model in understanding the kind of abstraction expected.
Template-based Prompting
: The provided examples are embedded within a templated prompt that instructs the model to generate a step-back question. The template reads: "You are an expert at world knowledge. Your task is to step back and paraphrase a question to a more generic step-back question, which is easier to answer. Here are a few examples:". The subsequent examples then help the model contextualize this task.
Model's Internal Knowledge
: Large Language Models like ChatOpenAI (which is presumably based on OpenAI's models) are trained on vast amounts of data and have learned patterns of abstraction. By giving it the right prompting and context, you're directing the model to use its inherent capability to abstract details.
Iterative Refinement (if employed)
: While not explicitly shown in the provided code, an additional step that could be used is iterative refinement. If the step-back question generated is not satisfactory, it could be fed back into the model to generate an even more abstracted version.
In the given examples:
The question "Could the members of The Police perform lawful arrests?" is abstracted to "what can the members of The Police do?"
The question "Jan Sindel���s was born in what country?" is abstracted to "what is Jan Sindel���s personal history?"
The main idea is to move from specific details to broader concepts or categories. The model uses the guidance provided by the few-shot examples, the context from the prompt, and its own internal knowledge to make this abstraction.
I wonder if you can give me some examples, I want to see if I have been using some version of this technique in my prompting
ChatGPT
Certainly! The "Step-Back Prompting" technique is essentially about generalizing or abstracting a specific query to make it more generic. Here are some examples to demonstrate this:
Historical Events
:
Specific Question: "Why did Napoleon invade Russia in 1812?"
Step-Back Question: "What were the major events of Napoleon's reign?"
Scientific Concepts
:
Specific Question: "What's the function of the mitochondria in a cell?"
Step-Back Question: "What are the main parts of a cell and their functions?"
Geographical Information
:
Specific Question: "What's the capital city of France?"
Step-Back Question: "Can you provide some general information about France?"
Entertainment
:
Specific Question: "Who won the Oscar for Best Actress in 2018?"
Step-Back Question: "Who were the major Oscar winners in 2018?"
Literature
:
Specific Question: "What is the main conflict in Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet'?"
Step-Back Question: "What are the main themes and conflicts in Shakespeare's plays?"
Technology
:
Specific Question: "How does the QuickSort algorithm work?"
Step-Back Question: "What are the different types of sorting algorithms and their basics?"
The step-back question, in essence, moves from specific to more general, allowing the user (or a system) to then refine the question further if needed. If you've been prompting questions in a way that starts from a broad overview before diving into specifics, then you've been using a version of this technique.
Ok so it sounds kind of like an enthymeme. I would say you could branch to get multiple related generalizations and nest it one or two more times.  If I want to discuss a particular topic I often present relevant abstracts from papers or snippets from earlier conversations. I start as general as I can given what I think you know.
ChatGPT
Yes, you've grasped the essence of it! Enthymemes, often considered as incomplete syllogisms in classical rhetoric, require the audience to fill in the missing premise. Similarly, the Step-Back Prompting method nudges one to operate at a more generalized level, and then refine or delve deeper based on the response or the understanding established.
The approach you mentioned���branching to multiple related generalizations and potentially nesting them���sounds very similar to a hierarchical structure or tree of thought. Starting with a general idea (the root) and branching down into more specific concepts or details (the leaves) is a commonly used technique in various disciplines, including teaching, brainstorming, and software design.
Presenting abstracts or snippets from earlier conversations as a starting point is an excellent strategy. It helps establish a foundational understanding or context before diving into the nuances or specifics of a topic. It's akin to providing a "map" of the terrain before exploring a specific route.
In the context of interacting with Large Language Models like me, providing such general or abstracted context can indeed help in generating more nuanced and contextually appropriate responses.
There was a popular self-help book called the question behind the question.
ChatGPT
Yes, "The Question Behind the Question" (often abbreviated as QBQ!) is a book written by John G. Miller. It delves into the concept of personal accountability and how it can lead to success both in one's personal and professional life.
The main premise of the book is to encourage individuals to ask better questions. Instead of asking questions that place blame ("Who dropped the ball?") or convey procrastination ("When will someone train me?"), Miller suggests asking questions that focus on personal accountability, such as "What can I do to contribute?" or "How can I make a difference?"
The idea is that by asking the right questions, individuals can shift their mindset from a victim mentality to one of empowerment and ownership. The book is aimed at promoting positive action and improving decision-making by addressing the underlying or "real" questions we should be asking ourselves.
Your mention of this ties well into our discussion on abstraction and step-back prompting. Just as "The Question Behind the Question" emphasizes getting to the root of an issue through better questioning, Step-Back Prompting encourages getting to the fundamental or high-level concepts for better reasoning and understanding.
What year was it published?
ChatGPT
"The Question Behind the Question" by John G. Miller was first published in 2004.
This study again illustrates the versatility of Large Language Models and how new ways of interacting with LLMs can be invented to leverage LLMs even further.

Step-Back Prompting (STP) interfaces with one LLM only and in an iterative process.

As you will see in this article, Step-Back Prompting (STP) can be used in conjunction with RAG with comparable results.

Step-Back Prompting (STP) is a more technical prompt engineering approach where the original question needs to be distilled into a stepback question. And the stepback answer used for the final answer.

I do get the sense that this prompting technique is too complex for a static or prompt template approach and will work better in an autonomous agent implementation.

Corbus Greyling emphasizes the potential and adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs). He introduces the Step-Back Prompting (STP) technique which refines a given query by stepping back to a more generic question, aiding in obtaining a more comprehensive final answer.

ChatGPT
Certainly!
Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) is a system designed to enhance the abilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) such as ChatGPT. The unique feature of RAG is that it integrates an information retrieval mechanism. This mechanism scours a vast set of data to fetch relevant information in response to a query. Once this data is retrieved, it's provided to the LLM, which then uses this contextual information to generate a more informed and precise response. In essence, RAG combines the power of extensive data search capabilities with the advanced language generation skills of an LLM, allowing the model to pull in and leverage external knowledge more effectively.

Abstract 
Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge 
in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when i ne-tuned on down- 
stream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowl- 
edge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance 
lags behind task-specif i c architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their 
decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre- 
trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric 
memory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We 
explore a general-purpose i ne-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation 
(RAG) ��� models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric mem- 
ory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric 
memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense 
vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We com- 
pare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages 
across the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages 
per token. We i ne-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge- 
intensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain QA tasks, 
outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specif i c retrieve-and-extract 
architectures. For language generation tasks, we i nd that RAG models generate 
more specif i c, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only 
seq2seq baseline. 
1Introduction 
Pre-trained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of in-depth knowl- 
edge from data [47]. They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized 
implicit knowledge base [51,52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down- 
sides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can���t straightforwardly provide insight into 
their predictions, and may produce ���hallucinations��� [38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric 
memory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [20,26,48] can address some of these 
issues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be 
inspected and interpreted. REALM [20] and ORQA [31], two recently introduced models that 
combine masked language models [8] with a differentiable retriever, have shown promising results,

We endow pre-trained, parametric-memory generation models with a non-parametric memory through 
a general-purpose i ne-tuning approach which we refer to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). 
We build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the 
non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural 
retriever. We combine these components in a probabilistic model trained end-to-end (Fig. 1). The 
retriever (Dense Passage Retriever [26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on 
the input, and the seq2seq model (BART [32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with 
the input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation, 
either on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token 
basis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens). Like T5 [51] or BART, RAG 
can be i ne-tuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned. 
Therehasbeenextensivepreviousworkproposingarchitecturestoenrichsystemswithnon-parametric

augmented networks [25] and memory layers [30]. In contrast, we explore a setting where both 
parametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive 
knowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is 
present without additional training.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks
by Patrick Lewis and collaborators from Facebook AI Research, University College London, and New York University delves into a cutting-edge approach for handling knowledge-intensive tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Key Points:
Large Pre-trained Models:
These models, like ChatGPT, store factual knowledge in their architecture and perform exceptionally on various NLP tasks. However, they sometimes fall short on knowledge-intensive tasks compared to task-specific architectures. Additionally, updating their knowledge or providing a source for their conclusions remains a challenge.
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):
The study introduces RAG, an innovative approach that fuses a pre-trained parametric (like seq2seq models) memory with a non-parametric memory (a dense vector index of Wikipedia) accessed by a pre-trained neural retriever. This allows the model to pull in specific knowledge when generating language.
Comparison:
Two variations of RAG are compared. One uses the same retrieved information for the entire generated sequence, while the other uses different information for each token.
Performance:
RAG models set new benchmarks on three open domain QA tasks, surpassing both traditional seq2seq models and specific retrieve-and-extract systems. Moreover, when generating language, RAG models produced more detailed, diverse, and factual content compared to the top parametric-only seq2seq models.
Visualization (Fig. 1):
It provides an overview of the RAG approach. The process combines a pre-trained retriever with a pre-trained seq2seq model and fine-tunes them in tandem. The retriever locates the top-K relevant documents from the corpus, and the seq2seq model then uses this retrieved information, alongside the original input, to generate an output.
Uniqueness:
While there have been systems in the past that incorporate non-parametric memories, the novelty of RAG lies in its use of both parametric and non-parametric memory components that are pre-trained and loaded with comprehensive knowledge. Importantly, the ability to access this knowledge doesn't require additional training.
In essence, this study proposes a robust mechanism to bolster the capabilities of pre-trained NLP models for knowledge-intensive tasks by allowing them to retrieve and utilize specific external knowledge from a dense vector index of Wikipedia.

Over time, as it accumulates more data, its accuracy and utility would likely improve, making it an invaluable asset for various knowledge-intensive tasks.
First it scans the database looking for essays and essay outlines or titles, and identifies their level of completion or interest level
ChatGPT
Certainly! The first phase would be database scanning and content categorization. Here's how the ACADEMIZER system might operate for this specific task:
Database Scanning & Content Categorization:
Content Identification:
The system begins by scanning through the entire database/repository to identify and flag documents or entries that resemble essays or essay outlines. This identification can be based on structure, length, keyword density, and other identifiable patterns typical of essays.
Assessing Level of Completion:
For full essays: The system can check for a beginning (introduction), middle (body), and end (conclusion) structure. Completeness can also be gauged by checking the overall length, cohesion, and the presence of core components typical of essays.
For outlines: The system would recognize hierarchical or bullet point structures, with clear headings and subheadings. The depth and detail of these outlines can give a clue about their completion level.
Interest Level Determination:
Based on factors like the frequency of related entries in the database, the depth of detail, or even external metrics (if available) like how often a topic is referenced or read.
Another metric can be the frequency with which you, as the user, have engaged with or referenced a particular topic in your interactions with LLMs.
Metadata Annotation:
After assessing the content, the system can annotate each essay or outline with metadata indicating its category (essay or outline), its level of completion (e.g., draft, near complete, complete), and its interest level (e.g., high, medium, low).
Database Update:
Post-categorization, the system updates the database, making it easier for subsequent searches or tasks. Entries can now be quickly filtered based on their type, completion status, and interest level.
This preliminary scanning and categorization phase ensures that subsequent operations, like content expansion or fact-checking, are more efficient as the system has a clear understanding of the status and nature of each piece of content.
I think it will be necessary to track the development of ideas over time, in some cases
ChatGPT
Absolutely. Tracking the evolution of ideas over time can offer invaluable insights into the refinement, expansion, or shifts in thinking. It also helps in maintaining continuity and consistency. Here's how ACADEMIZER could facilitate this:
Idea Development Tracking:
Timestamping:
Assign a timestamp to each entry in your database. This will allow you to understand when each idea or essay was first introduced or edited.
Versioning:
Maintain versions of each essay or outline. Whenever an idea is expanded or modified, instead of overwriting the original, create a new version while retaining the older one. This is similar to version control systems used in software development, like Git.
Dependency Mapping:
Some ideas might stem from or be expansions of prior ones. Create a dependency map that shows how ideas are linked or branched from one another.
Annotation and Tagging:
As ideas evolve, have a system of annotations or tags that can denote significant shifts, expansions, or sources of inspiration.
Visualization:
Implement a visual representation of the idea's evolution. For instance, a flowchart or timeline that shows how an idea has changed and grown over time, including its various offshoots or related ideas.
Milestones:
Define key milestones in the development of an idea. These could be significant expansions, the integration of new research or data, or decisions to take the idea in a different direction.
Feedback Loop:
If you're using LLMs or other systems to aid in the development of your ideas, ensure there's a feedback loop. The insights or expansions proposed by these systems should be tracked as they play a part in the evolution of the idea.
Review and Reflection:
Periodically review the development path of your ideas. This reflection can lead to new insights and ensure that the core essence or objective of the original idea isn't lost over time.
By implementing these strategies, ACADEMIZER can provide a comprehensive overview of how your ideas are growing and changing, ensuring you have a clear path of development and can easily trace back the origins and evolution of each idea.

I suspect we may need to use this at some point as well: This repo supports the paper "QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs", an effort to democratize access to LLM research.

QLoRA uses bitsandbytes for quantization and is integrated with Hugging Face's PEFT and transformers libraries. QLoRA was developed by members of the University of Washington's UW NLP group.

Updates
7/19/2023 - Added LLaMA 2 example script and updated version requirements
7/18/2023 - Fixed non-frozen embeddings when adding new tokens
Overview
We present QLoRA, an efficient finetuning approach that reduces memory usage enough to finetune a 65B parameter model on a single 48GB GPU while preserving full 16-bit finetuning task performance. QLoRA backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters (LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) Double Quantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants, and (c) Paged Optimizers to manage memory spikes. We use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for 4-bit training
