5.1Prompting LLMs 
In recent years, large pre-trained language mod- 
els (LLMs) have shown promising performance on 
zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks by prompt- 
based in-context learning (Radford et al., 2019; 
Brown et al., 2020, inter alia). By explicitly cu- 
rating to include code (programming language) 
into pre-training corpora (Wang, 2021; Chen et al., 
2021; Chowdhery et al., 2022, inter alia), LLMs 
exhibit surprising ability in symbolic tasks such 
as semantic parsing (Shin and Van Durme, 2022) 
and code generation (Austin et al., 2021; Poesia 
et al., 2021; Rajkumar et al., 2022). Nevertheless, 
prompt-based inference with LLMs suffers from 
several problems including low inference eff i ciency 
and expensive deployment cost. In this work, we 
employ LLMs as data generators rather than direct 
inferencer, which generate supervised data with 
minimal human effort to improve the performance 
of much smaller models for eff i cient inference on 
downstream tasks. 
5.2Data Generation 
Data generation is an alternative to data augmen- 
tation by creating entirely new examples instead 
of combining original ones (Jia and Liang, 2016; 
Andreas, 2020; Aky��rek et al., 2020; Guo et al., 
2020; Qiu et al., 2022a) (see Appendix F for de- 
tails). Conventional approaches adopt i ne-tuned 
generative models (Zhong et al., 2020b; Guo et al., 
2021; Wang et al., 2021a, inter alia) as input gener- 
ators, with a semantic parser (e.g., PCFG grammar) 
for sampling symbolic outputs. Considering the dif- 
i culty in designing grammar to sample useful sym- 
bolic forms in complex domains, Yang et al. (2022) 
assumes access to an unlabeled corpus of symbolic 
language, which is represented in canonical forms, 
and simulates natural language inputs via LLMs. 
In comparison, we explore directly generating sym- 
bolic forms as well as natural languages without 
the need to design task-specif i c grammars for sym- 
bolic forms or synchronous context-free grammars 
(SCFG) that map between canonical forms and 
symbolic forms. Data generation has also been ex- 
plored for cross-lingual semantic parsing (Rosen- 
baum et al., 2022), python program (Haluptzok 
et al., 2022), and instruction generation (Wang 
etal.,2022), whileweunifythedatagenerationpro- 
cedure for various symbolic languages tasks. Addi- 
tionally, for simple classif i cation tasks, it has been 
found a smaller model trained on data generated 
with a few or even zero human demonstrations can 
achieve better performance than the LLMs (Schick 
and Sch��tze, 2021; Meng et al., 2022; Ye et al., 
2022b,a; Gao et al., 2023). This work i lls in the 
gap by exploring such an approach to complex sym- 
bolic language tasks. 
6Conclusion 
In this work, we treat LLMs as data generators 
rather than task inferencer for complex symbolic 
language tasks, with the generated data being used 
to train much affordable model for depolyment and 
inference. We demonstrate that a 1%-sized model 
trained under SYMGENcan achieve superior per- 
formance to the LLM inferencers. We especially 
show the effectiveness in low-resource scenarios, 
which is a common situation for symbolic language 
tasks due to the annotation-expensive characteris- 
tics. Additionally, we also reveal the possibility 
of obtaining a well-performed task model through 
SYMGENeven without any human annotations. 
Limitations 
This work is based on prompting and in-context 
learning with informative prompts for symbolic 
data generation. However, the information that 
can be packed into the prompt is hard limited by 
the prompt length, as language models are cre- 
ated and trained to only handle sequences of a cer- 
tain length. The problem becomes more acute for 
symbolic languages with complex grammars and 
rarely seen by the LLMs during the pre-training 
stage. Possible solutions are internalizing the gram- 
mar knowledge into the output rather than input 
through constrained decoding algorithms (Scholak 
et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021; Shin et al., 2021; Shin 
and Van Durme, 2022), identifying a limited rele- 
vant documentation when generating data (Agar- 
wal et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2022), or improv- 
ing the architectures of LLMs to handle long in- 
puts (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; 
Press et al., 2021).

This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) as data generators for complex symbolic language tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable abilities in zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks, as well as tasks like semantic parsing and code generation, their usage is hindered by low inference efficiency and high deployment cost. The authors propose using LLMs to generate supervised data that can be used to train smaller, more efficient models.
In the realm of data generation, an alternative to data augmentation, the authors discuss the conventional approaches and their limitations. Traditional techniques use fine-tuned generative models as input generators and a semantic parser for sampling symbolic outputs. This process is complicated by the need for specific grammar designs to sample useful symbolic forms in complex domains.
This paper's approach, however, directly generates symbolic forms as well as natural language, without the need for task-specific grammars. This method of data generation has been successful in various symbolic language tasks, and for simple classification tasks, it has been found that smaller models trained on generated data can outperform the LLMs.
The authors argue that their work fills a gap by applying this approach to complex symbolic language tasks. They demonstrate that a 1% sized model trained under SYMGEN (presumably their data generation method) can perform better than the LLMs, particularly in low-resource scenarios common in symbolic language tasks.
However, the paper does highlight certain limitations. While their work is based on prompting and in-context learning, the amount of information that can be packed into the prompt is restricted by the prompt length. This issue is especially problematic for symbolic languages with complex grammars. They suggest potential solutions like improving LLM architectures to handle longer inputs or identifying relevant documentation when generating data.

Generating Data for Symbolic Language with Large Language Models

While large language models (LLMs) bring not only performance but also complexity, recent work has started to turn LLMs into data generators rather than task inferencers, where another affordable task model is trained for efficient deployment and inference. However, such an approach has primarily been applied to natural language tasks and has not yet been explored for symbolic language tasks with complex structured outputs (e.g., semantic parsing and code generation). In this paper, we propose SymGen which utilizes LLMs for generating various annotation-expensive symbolic language data. SymGen consists of an informative prompt to steer generation and an agreement-based verifier to improve data correctness. We conduct extensive experiments on six symbolic language tasks across various settings. Compared with the LLMs, we demonstrate the 1\%-sized task model can achieve comparable or better performance, largely cutting inference and deployment costs. We also show that generated data with only a few human demonstrations can be as effective as over 10 times the amount of human-annotated data when training the task model, saving a considerable amount of annotation effort. SymGen sheds new light on data generation for complex tasks, and we release the code at

This paper introduces SymGen, a system that employs large language models (LLMs) for generating complex, annotation-expensive symbolic language data. The study aims to address the high complexity and costs associated with the deployment and inference tasks of LLMs by transforming them into data generators instead of task inferencers. This approach has primarily been applied to natural language tasks and has yet to be explored for symbolic language tasks that entail complex structured outputs, such as semantic parsing and code generation.
SymGen works by leveraging an informative prompt to guide data generation and an agreement-based verifier to enhance the accuracy of the generated data. Through extensive experiments on six symbolic language tasks in various settings, the authors demonstrate that a model only 1% the size of the LLMs can achieve comparable or even superior performance, significantly reducing inference and deployment costs.
Furthermore, it is shown that data generated with minimal human demonstrations can be as effective as over ten times the amount of human-annotated data when training the task model. This potentially saves a considerable amount of annotation effort. Thus, SymGen offers a new perspective on data generation for complex tasks. The authors have released the code for SymGen on GitHub.

ABSTRACT 
There is a rising interest in further exploring the zero-shot learning potential of 
large pre-trained language models (PLMs). A new paradigm called data-generation- 
based zero-shot learning has achieved impressive success. In this paradigm, the 
synthesized data from the PLM acts as the carrier of knowledge, which is used 
to train a task-specif i c model with orders of magnitude fewer parameters than 
the PLM, achieving both higher performance and eff i ciency than prompt-based 
zero-shot learning methods on PLMs. The main hurdle of this approach is that the 
synthesized data from PLM usually contains a signif i cant portion of low-quality 
samples. Fitting on such data will greatly hamper the performance of the task- 
specif i c model, making it unreliable for deployment. Previous methods remedy 
this issue mainly by i ltering synthetic data using heuristic metrics(e.g., output 
conf i dence), or ref i ning the data with the help of a human expert, which comes 
with excessive manual tuning or expensive costs. In this paper, we propose a 
novel noise-robust re-weighting framework SUNGENto automatically construct 
high-quality data for zero-shot classif i cation problems. Our framework features the 
ability to learn the sample weights indicating data quality without requiring any 
human annotation. We theoretically and empirically verify the ability of our method 
to help construct good-quality synthetic datasets. Notably, SUNGEN-LSTM yields 
a 9.8% relative improvement than the baseline on average accuracy across eight 
different established text classif i cation tasks. 
1INTRODUCTION 
Owing to the superior generative capacity of large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs), there 
has been an emerging trend of using these powerful models (e.g., GPT) to generate training data for 
downstream tasks (Anaby-Tavor et al., 2020; Puri et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2021, 
inter alia). Among them, a new line of generation-based zero-shot learning using the unf i netuned 
PLM pushes the envelope further (Schick & Sch��tze, 2021; Ye et al., 2022a; Meng et al., 2022), 
featuring total annotation-free training for downstream tasks. Ye et al. (2022a) (ZEROGEN) further 
boosts the eff i ciency by using the generated data to train tiny task models (TAM), which have orders- 
of-magnitude fewer parameters than the PLM. Specif i cally, they i rst design prompts incorporating 
the task description and label information, then use them to guide the data generation from the PLM. 
Subsequently, the synthesized dataset is used to train the tiny task-specif i c models. Compared with the 
classic prompt-based zero-shot learning on PLM, this new paradigm enjoys two favorable properties: 
(1) since the task model has orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters than the PLM, it demonstrates 
much lower inference latency; (2) with the large amount of PLM-generated training data, the task 
model often shows better performance than prompt-based zero-shot PLM counterparts. 
In the above paradigm, the amount and the quality of the generated data are crucial factors for the 
task model���s performance. Unfortunately, despite the unlimited training data that one can generate

Abstract 
Image captioning has emerged as an interesting research i eld 
in recent years due to its broad application scenarios. The tra- 
ditional paradigm ofimage captioningrelieson pairedimage- 
caption datasets to train the model in a supervised manner. 
However, creating such paired datasets for every target lan- 
guage is prohibitively expensive, which hinders the extensi- 
bility of captioning technology and deprives a large part of 
the world population of its benef i t. In this work, we present a 
novel unpaired cross-lingual method to generate image cap- 
tions without relying on any caption corpus in the source or 
the target language. Specif i cally, our method consists of two 
phases: (i) a cross-lingual auto-encoding process, which uti- 
lizing a sentence parallel (bitext) corpus to learn the map- 
ping from the source to the target language in the scene graph 
encoding space and decode sentences in the target language, 
and (ii) a cross-modal unsupervised feature mapping, which 
seeks to map the encoded scene graph features from image 
modality to language modality. We verify the effectiveness of 
our proposed method on the Chinese image caption genera- 
tion task. The comparisons against several existing methods 
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. 
1Introduction 
Image captioning has attracted a lot of attention in recent 
years due to its emerging applications, including assisting 
visually impaired people, image indexing, virtual assistants, 
etc. Despite the impressive results achieved by the existing 
captioning techniques, most of them focus on English be- 
cause of the availability of image-caption paired datasets, 
which can not generalize for languages where such paired 
dataset is not available. In reality, there are more than 7,100 
different languages spoken by billions of people worldwide 
(source: Ethnologue(2019)). Building visual-language tech- 
nologies only for English would deprive a signif i cantly large 
population of non-English speakers of AI benef i ts and also 
leads to ethical concerns, such as unequal access to re- 
sources. Therefore, similar to other NLP tasks (e.g. parsing, 
question answering) (Hu et al. 2020; Conneau et al. 2018; 
Gu et al. 2020), visual-language tasks should also be ex- 
tended to multiple languages. However, creating paired cap- 
tioning datasets for each target language is infeasible, since

Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. 
the labeling process is very time consuming and requires ex- 
cessive human labor. 
To alleviate the aforementioned problem, there have been 
several attempts in relaxing the requirement of image- 
caption paired data in the target language (Gu et al. 2018; 
Song et al. 2019), which rely on paired image-caption data 
in a pivot language to generate captions in the target lan- 
guage via sentence-level translation. However, even for En- 
glish, the existing captioning datasets (e.g., MS-COCO (Lin 
et al. 2014)) are not suff i ciently large and comprise only lim- 
ited object categories, making it challenging to generalize 
the trained captioners to scenarios in the wild (Tran et al. 
2016). In addition, sentence-level translation relies purely 
on the text description and can not observe the entire im- 
age, which may ignore important contextual semantics and 
lead to inaccurate translation. Thus, such pivot-based meth- 
ods fail to fully address the problem. 
Recently, a few works explore image captioning task in 
an unpaired setting (Feng et al. 2019; Gu et al. 2019; Laina, 
Rupprecht, and Navab 2019). Nevertheless, these methods 
still rely on manually labeled caption corpus. For example, 
Gu et al. (2019) train their model based on shuff l ed image- 
caption pairs of MS-COCO; Feng et al. (2019) use an image 
descriptions corpus from Shutterstock; Lania et al. (2019) 
create training dataset by sampling the images and captions 
from different image-caption datasets. Despite they belong 
to unpaired methods in spirit, one could still argue that they 
depend heavily on the collected caption corpus to get a rea- 
sonable cross-modal mapping between vision and language 
distributions ��� a resource that is not always practical to as- 
sume. It therefore remains questionable how these methods 
would perform when there is no caption data at all. To the 
best of our knowledge, there is yet no work that investigates 
image captioning without relying on any caption corpus. 
Despite the giant gap between images and texts, they 
are essentially different mediums to describe the same en- 
tities and how they are related in the objective world. Such 
internal logic is the most essential information carried by 
the medium, which can be leveraged as the bridge to con- 
nect data in different modalities. Scene graph(Wang et al. 
2018), a structural representation that contains 1) the ob- 
jects, 2) their respective attributes and 3) how they are re- 
lated as described by the medium (image or text), which 
has been developed into a mature technique for visual un-

derstanding tasks in recent years(Johnson, Gupta, and Fei- 
Fei 2018). Previous researches on scene graph generation 
have demonstrated its effectiveness in aiding cross-modal 
alignment (Yang et al. 2019; Gu et al. 2019). However, 
existing scene graph generators are only available in En- 
glish, which poses challenges for extending its application 
on other languages. One naive approach is to perform cross- 
lingual alignment to other target languages by conducting 
a superf i cial word-to-word translation on the scene graphs 
nodes, which neglects the contextual information of the sen- 
tence or the image. Since a word on a single node can carry 
drastically different meanings in various contexts, such an 
approach often leads to sub-optimal cross-lingual mapping. 
To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-lingual Hi- 
erarchical Graph Mapping (HGM) to effectively conduct 
the alignment between languages in the scene graph en- 
coding space, which benef i ts from contextual information 
by gathering semantics across different levels of the scene 
graph. Notably, the scene graph translation process can be 
enhanced by the large-scale parallel corpus (bi-text), which 
is easily accessible for many languages (Espl` a et al. 2019).

UNISON, a novel unpaired cross-lingual method for generating image captions, is presented in this paper. Traditional image captioning relies on paired image-caption datasets for training, which can be prohibitively expensive to create for every target language. This not only hinders the extensibility of captioning technology but also deprives a large portion of the global population of its benefits.
UNISON attempts to overcome this problem by generating image captions without the need for any caption corpus in the source or target language. It achieves this through two phases: (i) a cross-lingual auto-encoding process that utilizes a sentence parallel corpus to learn the mapping from the source to the target language in the scene graph encoding space, and (ii) a cross-modal unsupervised feature mapping that maps the encoded scene graph features from image modality to language modality.
The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified through the Chinese image caption generation task, where it demonstrated superiority over several existing methods.
The authors acknowledge the ethical concerns of building visual-language technologies solely for English and express the need for visual-language tasks to extend to multiple languages. However, creating paired captioning datasets for each target language is infeasible due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive labeling process.
UNISON's proposed approach helps bridge this gap and presents a practical solution for cross-lingual image captioning without the need for a caption corpus.

In this paper, we propose UNpaIred crosS-lingual image 
captiONing (UNISON), a novel approach to generate im- 
age captions in the target language without relying on any 
caption corpus. Our UNISON framework consists of two 
phases: (i) a cross-lingual auto-encoding process and (ii) a 
cross-modal unsupervised feature mapping (Fig. 1). Using 
the parallel corpus, the cross-lingual auto-encoding process 
aimstotraintheHGMtomapascenegraphderivedfromthe 
source language (English) sentence to the space of the tar- 
get language (Chinese), and learns to generate a sentence in 
the target language based on the mapped scene graph. Then, 
a cross-modal feature mapping (CMM) function is learned 
in an unsupervised manner, which aligns the image scene 
graph features from image modality to language modality. 
The features in language modality is subsequently mapped 
by HGM, and then fed to the decoder in phase (i) to gener- 
ate image captions in the target language. Our experiments 
show 1) the effectiveness of the proposed HGM when con- 
ducting cross-lingual alignment(��5.2) in the scene graph en- 
coding space and 2) the superior performance of our UNI- 
SON framework as a whole(��5.1). 
2Related Work 
Paired Image Captioning. Previous studies on super- 
vised image captioning mostly follow the popular encoder- 
decoder framework (Vinyals et al. 2015; Rennie et al. 2017; 
Anderson et al. 2018), which mostly focus on generat- 
ing captions in English since the neural image captioning 
models require large-scale data of annotated image-caption 
pairs to achieve good performance. To relax the requirement 
of human effort in caption annotation, Lan, Li, and Dong 
(2017) propose a l uency-guided learning framework to gen- 
erate Chinese captions based on pseudo captions, which 
are translated from English captions. Yang et al. (2019) 
adopt the scene graph as the structured representation to 
connect image-text domains and generate captions. Zhong 
et al. (2020) propose a method to select the important sub- 
graphs of scene graphs to generate comprehensive caption- 
ing. Nguyen et al. (2021) further close the semantic gap 
between image and text scene graphs by Human-Object- 
Interaction labels. 
Unpaired Image Captioning. The main challenge in un- 
paired image captioning is to learn the captioner without any 
image-caption pairs. Gu et al. (2018) i rst propose an ap- 
proach based on pivot language. They obviate the require- 
ment of paired image-caption data in the target language but 
still rely on paired image-caption data in the pivot language. 
Feng et al. (2019) use a concept-to-sentence model to gen- 
erate pseudo-image-caption pairs, and align image features 
and text features in an adversarial manner. Song et al. (2019) 
introduce a self-supervised reward to train the pivot-based 
captioning model on pseudo image-caption pairs. Gu et al. 
(2019) propose a scene graph-based method for unpaired 
image captioning on disordered images and captions. 
Summary. While several attempts have been made to- 
wards unpaired image captioning, they require caption cor- 
pus to learn a reasonable cross-modal mapping between vi- 
sion and language distributions, e.g. the corpus in (Feng 
et al. 2019) is collected from Shutterstock image descrip- 
tions, Gu et al. (2019) use the MSCOCO corpus after 
shuff l ing the image-caption pairs. Thus, arguably these ap- 
proaches are not entirely ���unpaired��� as they rely on the la- 
belled corpus, limiting their applicability to different lan- 
guages. Meanwhile, our method generates captions in target 
language without relying on any caption corpus. 
3Methods 
3.1Preliminary and Our Setting 
In the conventional paired paradigm, image captioning aims 
to learn a captioner which can generate an image caption �� 
S 
for a given image I, such that �� 
S is similar to the ground-truth 
(GT) caption. Given the image-caption pairs {Ii,Si}NI 
i=1 , 
the popular encoder-decoder framework is formulated as: 
I ��� S :I ��� v ��� 
�� 
S(1) 
where v denotes the encoded image feature. The training 
objective for Eq. 1 is to maximize the probability of words in 
the GT caption given the previous GT words and the image. 
Compared with paired setting, which relies on paired 
image-caption data and can not generalize beyond the lan- 
guage used to label the caption, our unpaired setting does 
not depend on any image-caption pairs and can be extended 
to other target languages. Specif i cally, we assume that we 
have an image dataset {Ii}NI 
i=1 and a source-target parallel 
corpus dataset {(Sx 
i,S 
y i)} 
NS 
i=1. Our goal is to generate cap- 
tion �� 
Syin the target language y (Chinese) for an image I 
with the help of unpaired images and parallel corpus.

The paper you're referring to presents an innovative approach called UNpaIred crosS-lingual image captiONing (UNISON) to generate image captions in the target language without needing any caption corpus.
The method consists of two phases:
Cross-lingual auto-encoding process
: It utilizes a parallel corpus to train the Hierarchical Graph Model (HGM) to map a scene graph derived from the source language (in this case, English) to the target language space (in this case, Chinese), and then generate a sentence in the target language based on the mapped scene graph.
Cross-modal unsupervised feature mapping
: This process trains a function in an unsupervised manner to align image scene graph features from image modality to language modality. The features in the language modality are then mapped by the HGM and fed to the decoder in phase (i) to generate image captions in the target language.
The paper then compares this unpaired image captioning method with paired image captioning, where previous studies have followed the popular encoder-decoder framework to generate captions in English mostly because the neural image captioning models require large-scale data of annotated image-caption pairs to perform well. The need for such a large amount of paired data limits their applicability to different languages.
This limitation led to the development of UNISON, which doesn't depend on any image-caption pairs and can be extended to other target languages. It assumes the availability of an image dataset and a source-target parallel corpus dataset. The goal is to generate a caption in the target language for an image with the help of unpaired images and the parallel corpus.

Zero-shot Learning via PLM.The popular prompt-based zero-shot prediction is proposed by 
GPT (Radford et al., 2019). With well-designed prompts, large-scale PLMs have shown its notable 
zero-shot learning ability in various tasks (Jiang et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2020; Reynolds & McDonell, 
2021). More recently, data-generation-based work via PLM has gained popularity and shown superior 
ability on synthesizing task-specif i c data (Anaby-Tavor et al., 2020; Puri et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 
2020; Lee et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021b; Yoo et al., 2021; Bonifacio et al., 2022). Apart from work 
that still relies on task-related human-annotated data to instruct or i ne-tune the generative PLM, a 
recent line of research explores this direction in zero-shot scenario: Schick & Sch��tze (2021); Meng 
et al. (2022) use PLM with task-dependent prompts to generate data, and i netune another PLM 
on such data for task prediction. To further investigate PLM���s zero-shot ability and alleviate the 
computation cost of PLM, Ye et al. (2022a) study an extreme scenario, which trains a tiny model 
from scratch using the synthetic data. 
Noise Robust Learning.Previous methods of tackling data noise can be categorized into two 
groups: (1) heuristic approaches based on loss values that rely on the assumption that the network 
learns easy samples i rst, which adopt either resampling (Han et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2018; Yu et al., 
2019), loss reweighting (Thulasidasan et al., 2019; Konstantinov & Lampert, 2019; Ren et al., 2018; 
Shu et al., 2019), or label correction (Ma et al., 2018; Kremer et al., 2018; Reed et al., 2014). These 
methods require either manually set a threshold for the loss value or a clean validation set, which 
makes their performance questionable in zero-shot scenario. (2) methods in another line train the 
network with noise-robust loss (Ghosh et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2020; Liu & Guo, 2020; Xu et al., 
2019; Wang et al., 2019). Despite they learn a robust classif i er in theory, they are typically diff i cult 
to train the DNNs and result require more hyper-parameter tuning (Zhang & Sabuncu, 2018; Wang 
et al., 2019). To this end, we take advantages from both lines of research and design an end-to-end 
framework which can reliably i lter out harmful data without requiring a clean validation set. 
7CONCLUSION 
This paper focuses on high-quality data generation in eff i cient zero-shot learning. To address the 
noise in data, we design an end-to-end framework to construct a clean synthetic dataset without 
relying on any human-labeled data or human intervention. Our method can be jointly applied to 
other data generation pipelines to automatically select high-quality data. We hope this paper can 
provide insights for improving the quality of synthetic datasets, and

The paper you are referring to deals with data generation and noise robust learning in a zero-shot scenario. They use a method called SUNGEN to differentiate high-quality data from erroneous ones. As optimization proceeds, SUNGEN gradually separates the weights in the IMDb synthetic dataset, demonstrating its ability to discern between valuable and problematic data.
Examples of removed and selected data in the IMDb synthetic dataset are presented in Table 6. This shows that the method can effectively filter out data with small weights (removed data) and select data with large weights (selected data).
The paper also discusses zero-shot learning via Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and how these have shown notable zero-shot learning ability in various tasks. More recently, work in data generation using PLMs has gained popularity and demonstrated a superior ability to synthesize task-specific data. The paper explores this line of research in a zero-shot scenario and studies an extreme scenario that trains a tiny model from scratch using the synthetic data.
Regarding noise robust learning, the paper describes previous methods which are broadly categorized into two groups: heuristic approaches and methods that train the network with noise-robust loss. Each of these methods has its limitations, and so the authors propose an end-to-end framework that filters out harmful data without requiring a clean validation set.
In conclusion, the authors of the paper aim to improve the quality of synthetic datasets and facilitate more efficient zero-shot learning. The proposed method is an end-to-end framework designed to create a clean synthetic dataset without relying on human-labeled data or human intervention. The authors suggest that this method can be used alongside other data generation pipelines to automatically select high-quality data. They hope that their work can provide insights for improving the quality of synthetic datasets.

Together, dataf l ow transduction and constrained 
decoding allow a compact generation system to 
faithfully and l uently describe a complex and 
open-ended space of actions.We built such a 
hybrid system for calendar event queries in the 
SMCalFlow domain (Semantic Machines et al., 
2020).When evaluated on a subset of an- 
notated dialogues, it was consistently rated as 
more truthful, relevant, and l uent than either a 
rule-based or end-to-end neural system (��5.2). 
Results were similar on MultiWOZ dialogues 
(Budzianowski et al., 2018; Eric et al., 2020) 
(��5.4). Code, data, and trained models used in 
our experiments are released at https://github. 
com/microsoft/dataflow2text. 
2Problem Formulation 
We study the problem of response generation for 
task-oriented dialogue. A dialogue, like the one 
in Fig. 1, consists of a sequence of turns k, each 
consisting of a user utterance xk, one or more ac- 
tions ak, and an agent response yk. The job of a 
dialogue agent is to predict an appropriate action 
and response from a dialogue history, i.e., , to map 
from (x1,a1,y1,x2,a2,y2,...,xn) 7��� (an,yn). 
How is this done? Typically, a language un- 
derstanding module maps the user utterance xk 
(in context) to a formal meaning representation. 
The agent reasons about this meaning representa- 
tion to determine its own actions ak. Finally, a re- 
sponse generation module maps these actions or 
their results (in context) to the agent utterance yk. 
The focus of this paper is the response gener- 
ator. We assume that the formal meaning repre- 
sentation takes the form of an executable program, 
as is common in the semantic parsing literature��� 
and that the actions are produced by evaluating 
this program, possibly with side effects. As de- 
scribed by Semantic Machines et al. (2020), the 
program may be viewed as a dataf l ow graph 
in which each node is labeled with a function, 
constructor, or primitive value, as well as a re- 
turn value once the node is executed.We aim 
to implement a response generator that, when ap- 
plied to an evaluated dataf l ow graph, satisf i es the 
three properties outlined in ��1: description of data 
and its provenance, guaranteed truthfulness, and 
declarative specif i cation. In practice, for guidance 
when developing our generator, we refer to a de- 
velopment set of dialogues annotated with gold- 
standard dataf l ow graphs and agent responses. 
3Dataf l ow Transduction 
Given a dataf l ow graph G (e.g., Fig. 1a) rooted at a 
node vroot(the return value of the program repre- 
sented by the dataf l ow graph), our task is to gener- 
ate a string that describes vrootand its provenance. 
To achieve this, we propose a new formal frame- 
work for generation based on dataf l ow transduc- 
tion. At a high level, the formalism uses declara- 
tiverulesthatdescribehowtotransformadataf l ow 
graph into a small graph-specif i c grammar (specif- 
ically a quasi-synchronous context-free gram- 
mar, or QCFG) that def i nes the space of allowed 
responses. These rules walk along the graph, in- 
troduce new computations (dataf l ow subgraphs) as 
needed, and add rules to the grammar. 
Formally, a dataf l ow transducer S is def i ned by 
a 4-tuple (T ,��,R,tstart) where T is a set of non- 
terminal types,1�� is the set of terminals (word 
types), R is a set of dataf l ow transduction rules 
(see ��3.1), and tstart��� T is the start nonterminal. 
When applied to G, the dataf l ow transducer pro- 
duces a QCFG. As a side effect, it may extend the 
graph with new computations. We use �� 
G to denote 
the extended graph. 
A QCFG (Smith and Eisner, 2006) is a spe- 
cialized CFG whose nonterminals include align- 
ments to the nodes V (��G) of �� 
G. Where an ordi- 
nary CFG might specify ways to generate an NP 
(noun phrase) or a DATE, a QCFG would spec- 
ify ways to generate an NP or DATE that describes 
the result and provenance of v, for each appro- 
priately typed node v ��� V (��G).A 
QCFG re- 
sulting from dataf l ow transduction is a 4-tuple 
(T ��V (��G),��,P,(tstart,vroot)) where T ��V (��G) 
is the QCFG���s set of nonterminals and P is its 
set of productions. A QCFG production has the 
form �� ��� ��1��2��������Nwhere the left-hand-side 
�� = (t,v) ��� T �� V (��G) 
is a QCFG nonterminal, 
and each ��ican be either a nonterminal (ti,vi) or a 
terminal in ��. The viof a right-hand-side nonter- 
minal ��imay have appeared in the original G, or 
may have been added to �� 
G by the dataf l ow trans- 
ducer. These production rules then derive a set of 
strings just as in any CFG.

The provided text appears to be part of a research paper focusing on the problem of response generation in task-oriented dialogues. This work is particularly about generating responses from a dialog agent that can predict an appropriate action and response from a dialogue history.
A dialogue typically consists of a sequence of turns. Each turn includes a user utterance, one or more actions, and an agent response. A dialog agent's job is to predict the appropriate action and response based on the dialogue history.
Typically, a language understanding module translates the user's utterance into a formal meaning representation. The agent then uses this representation to determine its actions. Lastly, a response generation module maps these actions or their results into the agent's response.
This paper focuses on the response generation module. The authors assume that the formal meaning representation takes the form of an executable program and that the actions are produced by evaluating this program.
They also discuss dataflow transduction, which involves transforming a dataflow graph into a small, graph-specific grammar. A dataflow transducer is defined by a four-tuple consisting of a set of non-terminal types, a set of terminals (word types), a set of dataflow transduction rules, and a start nonterminal. When applied to a dataflow graph, the dataflow transducer produces a quasi-synchronous context-free grammar (QCFG).
A QCFG is a specialized CFG (Context-Free Grammar) that includes alignments to the nodes of a dataflow graph. It specifies ways to generate responses that describe the result and provenance of a particular node in the graph. The QCFG consists of non-terminals, terminals, productions, and the start nonterminal.
This method of response generation was implemented and evaluated for handling calendar event queries and showed promising results, being rated more truthful, relevant, and fluent compared to rule-based or end-to-end neural systems.

This repository contains code and instructions for reproducing the experiments in the paper The Whole Truth and Nothing But the Truth: Faithful and Controllable Dialogue Response Generation with Dataflow Transduction and Constrained Decoding (Findings of ACL 2023).

Approach Overview

Introduction (WIP)
There are two key components in our framework: dataflow transduction and constrained decoding, implemented by the dataflow2text package and the clamp package, respectively.

These two packages currently use two different Python versions. The dataflow2text package relies on the structural pattern matching feature introduced in Python 3.10, whereas the clamp package heavily relies on PyTorch and ���� Transformers.
The clamp package is a simplified version of the code for Semantic Parsing with Constrained LM.

Abstract 
We introduce BenchCLAMP, a Benchmark 
to evaluate Constrained LAnguage Model 
Parsing, which produces semantic outputs 
based on the analysis of input text through con- 
strained decoding of a prompted or i ne-tuned 
language model. Developers of pretrained lan- 
guage models currently benchmark on classi- 
i cation, span extraction and free-text genera- 
tion tasks. Semantic parsing is neglected in 
languagemodelevaluationbecauseofthecom- 
plexity of handling task-specif i c architectures 
and representations. Recent work has shown 
that generation from a prompted or i ne-tuned 
language model can perform well at semantic 
parsing when the output is constrained to be a 
valid semantic representation. BenchCLAMP 
includes context-free grammars for six seman- 
tic parsing datasets with varied output mean- 
ing representations, as well as a constrained 
decoding interface to generate outputs covered 
by these grammars. We provide low, medium, 
andhighresourcesplitsforeachdataset, allow- 
ing accurate comparison of various language 
models under different data regimes.Our 
benchmark supports both prompt-based learn- 
ing as well as i ne-tuning, and provides an 
easy-to-use toolkit for language model devel- 
opers to evaluate on semantic parsing. 
1Introduction 
Large pretrained language models when i ne-tuned 
on target data can achieve state-of-the-art perfor- 
mance on a host of NLP tasks (Liu et al., 2019; 
Raffel et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021; He et al., 
2021). Models like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), 
Codex(Chenetal.,2021)andT0(Sanhetal.,2021) 
have also shown impressive zero- and few-shot 
performance, when prompted with task descrip- 
tions and examples. Research on large language 
models is commonly validated by performance on 
downstream NLP tasks. Past work has evaluated 
new pretrained language models on classif i cation, 
extraction, and generation (Liu et al., 2019; He 
et al., 2021). However, semantic parsing is gener- 
ally not considered a testbed for such evaluation 
since most state-of-the-art systems involve dataset- 
specif i c model architectures and meaning represen- 
tation constraints. 
Recently, Shin et al. (2021) and Scholak et al. 
(2021) have shown that standard generation from 
a i ne-tuned or few-shot prompted language 
model can perform competitively in semantic 
parsing tasks, when the output of the language 
model is constrained to produce valid meaning 
representations. However, it is still challenging to 
set up constrained generation for a new dataset 
and language model due to the variation in 
meaningrepresentationsandmodel-specif i c 
tokenization. In this paper, we introduce a new 
benchmark called BenchCLAMP (Benchmark 
for Constrained Language Model Parsing) that 
covers six semantic parsing datasets with four 
different meaning representations.We release 
context-free grammars for each dataset and provide 
a toolkit to perform eff i cient constrained decoding 
to generate valid meaning representations. Our 
benchmark reduces the barrier for language 
model developers to evaluate on semantic parsing.

The text you provided is an abstract and part of the introduction to a paper introducing BenchCLAMP, a benchmark tool to evaluate Constrained Language Model Parsing. This benchmark tool was developed by Microsoft Semantic Machines.
Constrained Language Model Parsing involves using a language model to analyze input text and generate semantic outputs that meet certain constraints. This is typically achieved through prompted or fine-tuned language models. Pretrained language models are usually evaluated based on classification, span extraction, and free-text generation tasks. However, semantic parsing has often been overlooked due to the complexity of handling task-specific architectures and representations.
BenchCLAMP aims to bridge this gap by providing a benchmarking tool for semantic parsing tasks. It includes context-free grammars for six semantic parsing datasets with varied output meaning representations and provides a constrained decoding interface to generate outputs covered by these grammars. The tool offers low, medium, and high resource splits for each dataset, allowing for accurate comparison of various language models under different data regimes.
The BenchCLAMP benchmark supports both prompt-based learning and fine-tuning, making it a versatile toolkit for language model developers. The benchmark and its related resources are available on GitHub.
This benchmark aims to lower the barrier for language model developers to evaluate their models on semantic parsing tasks, fostering better understanding and improvements in this area of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

from the LM prompt (but not from the decoder 
constraints), whereas for group 5, we add the user 
utterance (pref i xed to the computation). Compar- 
ing group 3 and group 4, omitting execution re- 
sults signif i cantly harms the performance of un- 
constrained decoding. In contrast, dataf l ow trans- 
duction rules can execute the computation inter- 
nally, and do not require the LM to condition on 
it. Comparing group 3 and group 5, adding the 
user utterance to the LM prompt does not benef i t 
both approaches much. 
5.4Experiments with MultiWOZ Dataset 
To demonstrate the general applicability of our 
approach for response generation, we carry out 
a brief study on the widely used MultiWOZ 2.1 
dataset (Budzianowski et al., 2018; Eric et al., 
2020). We automatically convert the agent action 
annotations to dataf l ow computations and write 
14 transduction rules. For generating responses, 
we use the predicted agent actions from the MT- 
TOD system (Lee, 2021). Similar to our experi- 
ments on SMCalFlow, we i ne-tune CodeT5-base 
on all training examples, using the ground-truth 
belief state and predicted action as the text used to 
prompt the LM. For evaluation, we randomly sam- 
ple 100 examples from the test split, and two au- 
thors manually rate the generated responses from 
our QCFG-constrained decoding system and the 
MTTOD system. The inter-annotator agreement is 
100%. Almost all generated responses are gram- 
matically correct and relevant to the user utter- 
ance. To rate truthfulness, we use the predicted 
actions as the references. Our QCFG-constrained 
decoding approach produces truthful responses for 
all 100 examples, whereas only 89 responses from 
the MTTOD system are truthful with respect to the 
predicted actions. Among the 11 remaining exam- 
ples, 7 of them are due to imperfect delexicaliza- 
tion and 4 are due to hallucination. 
6Related Work 
One line of response generation research focuses 
on generating l uent and coherent responses di- 
rectly from user utterances without any interme- 
diate structured representation. This paradigm is 
mostly used for chatbots, as in early rule-based 
systems(Weizenbaum,1966;Wallace,2009), neu- 
ral conversation models (Vinyals and Le, 2015; 
Shang et al., 2015; Sordoni et al., 2015; Li et al., 
2016; Serban et al., 2016), and recent large- 
scale pretrained LMs like DialoGPT (Zhang et al., 
2020b) and GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020). 
Another line focuses on generating text from 
structured data, with applications beyond dia- 
logue response generation.For example, the 
WebNLG challenge (Gardent et al., 2017) gen- 
erates natural language descriptions from relation 
tuples, and Lebret et al. (2016) generate a biog- 
raphy from a structured ���infobox��� record. Many 
recent dialogue response generation tasks adopt 
dialogue-act-based meaning representations, in- 
cluding the MultiWOZ dataset (Budzianowski 
et al., 2018), the Schema-Guided dialogue dataset 
(Rastogi et al., 2020), and the E2E NLG challenge 
(Dusek et al., 2020). In contrast, our response gen- 
eration task uses computations as the input, which 
do not directly encode the dialogue acts of the re- 
sponses. This is a more challenging task, as the 
system needs to perform extra reasoning to obtain 
the derived information. In this sense, our task is 
similar to the one in CoSQL (Yu et al., 2019) and 
Logic2Text (Chen et al., 2020). 
Constrained decoding techniques for neural 
LMs have been developed for text generation with 
different types of constraints (Balakrishnan et al., 
2019; Dathathri et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2021, 2022). 
As ��4 noted, we follow Shin et al. (2021) but 
choose our grammar constraints dynamically for 
each response. 
7Conclusion 
We have described a hybrid approach for build- 
ing dialogue response generation systems. Our ap- 
proach introduces a new formalism for transduc- 
ing a dataf l ow graph into a QCFG, which is then 
used in a constrained decoder that intersects the 
QCFG with a neural LM. This formal framework 
makes it possible to write rules to precisely and 
truthfully describe data and its provenance while 
deferring surface realization decisions to a l exible 
language model. 
This new approach outperforms unconstrained 
conditional language modeling in both automatic 
and human evaluations, especially on truthfulness. 
Moreover, using 3% of the training data, the con- 
strained decoding approach is on par with the un- 
constrained decoding approach when it uses 100% 
of the training data, indicating that several expert 
hours spent on authoring rules hold almost equiv- 
alent value to a large volume of training data.

The provided text continues the discussion of a hybrid approach for building dialogue response generation systems. This approach uses a formalism to transduce a dataflow graph into a Quadratic Context-Free Grammar (QCFG), which is then applied in a constrained decoder that intersects the QCFG with a neural Language Model (LM).
This methodology has several advantages: it enables the creation of rules to describe data and its provenance accurately, while leaving the surface realization decisions to a flexible language model. This approach has shown better performance than unconstrained conditional language modeling, particularly in terms of truthfulness, in both automatic and human evaluations.
An interesting finding from the study is the efficiency of the constrained decoding approach even when trained on a significantly smaller dataset. Using only 3% of the training data, the constrained decoding approach matches the performance of the unconstrained decoding approach when it uses 100% of the training data. This indicates that the time spent authoring rules can be almost equivalent in value to having a large volume of training data, pointing to potential efficiencies in model training.
The experiments conducted on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset, a widely-used benchmark in dialogue systems, demonstrate the general applicability of this approach for response generation. The results indicate that the QCFG-constrained decoding approach consistently produces truthful responses, outperforming the MTTOD system in truthfulness relative to the predicted actions.
The text also discusses the existing research on response generation, which typically falls into two categories: generating responses directly from user utterances without any intermediate structured representation, or generating text from structured data. The approach proposed in this study, using computations as the input, presents a more challenging task as it requires additional reasoning to derive information. However, this approach proves more versatile and capable of creating accurate, truthful dialogue responses.

8Limitations and Future Directions 
Authoring transduction rules is relatively easy but 
may still be labor-intensive for complex domains. 
Future work might explore (semi-)automatically 
deriving transduction rules from data, learning to 
synthesize them from domain specif i cations, or 
curating a collection of domain-general transduc- 
tion rules that can be imported into new domains. 
Our experiments in this paper generated text 
only in English.It would be interesting to ap- 
ply the framework to datasets in other languages, 
e.g., GlobalWoZ (Ding et al., 2022). While our 
framework is intended to be agnostic to the out- 
put language, our notation for response templates 
might need to be slightly extended (along the lines 
of Appendix A) to be more convenient to use with 
morphologically complex languages or free-word- 
order languages. In these settings, presumably, the 
QCFG should systematically generate many in- 
l ectionsororderings fortheLMto chooseamong. 
To support multilingual dialogue systems, fu- 
ture work could consider automatically trans- 
lating the response templates into additional 
languages���perhaps by working backwards from 
automatic translations of natural language re- 
sponses that use those templates. 
Relatedly, we have only tested the proposed ap- 
proach on dataf l ow graphs.Future work could 
apply the method to generate textual descrip- 
tions of other graph-structured inputs, such as 
graph databases or abstract meaning representa- 
tion (AMR) graphs. 
While QCFG productions were unweighted in 
this paper, giving them weights would allow the 
QCFG to express its own preferences about which 
productions to use for a given input. For example, 
in a product-of-experts architecture, the probabil- 
ity of a given response y, would be proportional 
to the LM probability of y times the weights of 
all productions used in the QCFG derivation of y 
(summed over all such derivations). Beam search 
(��4) could then be carried out using pref i x weights 
(Opedaletal.,2023). Theweightscouldbetrained 
using gold responses. 
Weighting the QCFG raises the possibility that 
the dataf l ow transduction rules could encode prag- 
matic context-dependent policies.For example, 
a dataf l ow transduction rule could call a neural 
network to assess the suitability of applying the 
rule to a given node in the dataf l ow graph, and 
then weight the resulting QCFG production accordingly.

The provided text discusses the limitations of the proposed dialogue response generation approach and suggests future directions for improving and expanding the method.
While the authoring of transduction rules is relatively straightforward, it may be labor-intensive for more complex domains. Future work could look into deriving these rules semi-automatically from data, learning to synthesize them from specific domain specifications, or developing a collection of general transduction rules that could be applied across various domains.
The approach has currently been applied only to English datasets. Extending the framework to datasets in other languages, such as the GlobalWoZ dataset, is a potential direction for future work. Accommodating morphologically complex languages or languages with free word order may require extending the response template notation. Moreover, the QCFG should generate a variety of inflections or orderings for the language model to choose from.
Future research could also explore automatic translation of response templates into additional languages. This could potentially be achieved by working backwards from automatic translations of natural language responses using those templates, which would be useful for supporting multilingual dialogue systems.
The approach has been tested only on dataflow graphs so far. It would be interesting to see how it performs when applied to generate text descriptions of other graph-structured inputs, such as graph databases or Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs.
The paper suggests the possibility of weighting QCFG productions. This would allow the QCFG to express its own preferences about which productions to use for a given input. For example, in a product-of-experts architecture, the probability of a given response would be proportional to the LM probability of the response times the weights of all productions used in the QCFG derivation of the response.
Weighting the QCFG also opens up the possibility of dataflow transduction rules encoding pragmatic, context-dependent policies. For instance, a dataflow transduction rule could call a neural network to assess the appropriateness of applying the rule to a specific node in the dataflow graph, and then weight the resulting QCFG production accordingly. This could provide an additional layer of adaptability and context-sensitivity to the dialogue response generation system.

Abstract 
We explore the use of large pretrained lan- 
guage models as few-shot semantic parsers. 
The goal in semantic parsing is to generate a 
structured meaning representation given a nat- 
ural language input. However, language mod- 
els are trained to generate natural language. 
To bridge the gap, we use language models 
to paraphrase inputs into a controlled sublan- 
guage resembling English that can be automat- 
ically mapped to a target meaning representa- 
tion. Our results demonstrate that with only 
a small amount of data and very little code to 
convert into English-like representations, our 
blueprint for rapidly bootstrapping semantic 
parsers leads to surprisingly effective perfor- 
mance on multiple community tasks, greatly 
exceedingbaselinemethodsalsotrainedonthe 
same limited data. 
1Introduction 
Large pretrained language models (LMs) like GPT- 
3 (Brown et al., 2020) have shown increasingly 
impressive few-shot performance by formulating 
tasks as text-to-text generation problems (Raffel 
et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020). Given only a 
trained LM and a short textual prompt that de- 
scribes and/or exemplif i es a task, one can produce 
surprisingly accurate models for a variety of natu- 
ral language processing problems. However, task- 
specif i c semantic parsing does not naturally i t into 
this paradigm because such parsers typically use 
custom meaning representations that are unlikely 
to already exist on the web, let alone exist in large 
enough quantities to affect the parameters of these 
LMs. We leverage two key insights to overcome 
this barrier: (1) since LMs excel at generating natu- 
ral language, we should formulate semantic parsing 
as paraphrasing into a controlled sublanguage (Be- 
rant and Liang, 2014; Marzoev et al., 2020) and (2) 
autoregressive LMs can be eff i ciently constrained 
to search over only valid paraphrases, so the sub- 
language does not need to be learned from scratch. 
In particular, following Berant and Liang (2014), 
we envision a developer for some new domain 
i rst writing a synchronous context-free grammar 
(SCFG) that def i nes the space of supported (and 
well-formed) meaning representations along with 
canonical natural language constructions that ex- 
press them. Such a grammar maps between canon- 
ical natural language forms and domain-specif i c 
meaning representations, so that a separate LM- 
based system can focus entirely on mapping an 
unconstrained utteranceuto a canonical (but still 
natural) formc. Furthermore, the grammar can 
be used to constrain this LM-based system so that 
the LM is only allowed to generate canonical ut- 
terances (i.e., utterances that correspond to well- 
formed meaning representations). 
Given such a grammar, an LM, and a handful 
of examples for priming the LM for the task of in- 
terest, our approach immediately yields a working 
semantic parser. While we do not expect the accu- 
racies of our models to reach state-of-the-art perfor- 
mance when compared to models trained on large 
amounts of task-specif i c examples, the ability to 
rapidly prototype semantic parsers in new domains 
can be immensely helpful for developers, both by 
facilitating quick construction of a minimum vi- 
able product and by enabling the bootstrapping 
of new data collection through human-in-the-loop 
processes (Duan et al., 2016). 
We report results on the Overnight (Wang 
et al., 2015), Break (Wolfson et al., 2020) and 
SMCalFlow (Semantic Machines et al., 2020) 
datasets1using GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), 
GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), and BART (Lewis 
et al., 2020) as the underlying LMs.Our re- 
sults demonstrate that our solution:(1) deliv- 
ers greater accuracy when LMs target natural 
language-like representations, (2) is further im- 
proved through the use of explicit decoder con-

This abstract and introduction are from a research paper that presents a novel method for using large pretrained language models as few-shot semantic parsers.
Semantic parsing involves generating structured meaning representations from natural language inputs. This poses a challenge because language models are typically trained to generate natural language. The authors suggest using language models to paraphrase inputs into a controlled sublanguage, resembling English, that can be automatically mapped to a target meaning representation.
The paper demonstrates that this method, with minimal data and code to convert into English-like representations, can quickly bootstrap semantic parsers. It offers a surprisingly effective performance across multiple community tasks, significantly outperforming baseline methods trained on the same limited data.
The authors' method leverages two key insights:
Formulate semantic parsing as paraphrasing into a controlled sublanguage, because language models excel at generating natural language.
Autoregressive language models can be efficiently constrained to search over only valid paraphrases, so the sublanguage doesn't need to be learned from scratch.
By using a synchronous context-free grammar (SCFG) which defines the space of supported meaning representations and canonical natural language constructions, developers can map between canonical natural language forms and domain-specific meaning representations. This way, a separate LM-based system can concentrate entirely on mapping an unconstrained utterance to a canonical (yet still natural) form.
The authors tested their approach on several datasets, using GPT-2, GPT-3, and BART as the underlying language models. The results indicate improved accuracy when language models target natural language-like representations, and further improvement through the use of explicit decoder constraints. The approach performs well with very few examples, suggesting a new opportunity for rapidly prototyping semantic parsers.

6Further Related Work 
Motivated by tasks where a user requires certain 
phrases to be present or absent in the output of a 
text generation system, researchers have explored 
increasingly more eff i cient approaches to restrict- 
ing valid paths in beam search such that they satisfy 
externally provided constraints (e.g., Hokamp and 
7707 
Liu, 2017; Anderson et al., 2017; Post and Vilar, 
2018; Hu et al., 2019). Grammar-constrained de- 
coding restricts some or all of a successful transduc- 
tion path to result in a sequence parseable under 
a grammar. Such techniques were used in task- 
oriented speech recognition systems (Moore et al., 
1997),9where it was assumed a user knew the pre- 
cise way to phrase commands. In contemporary 
settings we retain the notion of a parser support- 
ing task-specif i c features, where we would like to 
enjoy the benef i ts of a grammar in terms of laying 
out prescribed functionality but without constrain- 
ing the user���s linguistic forms. Constraining neural 
semantic parsing decoders has been explored by 
Yin and Neubig (2017) and Krishnamurthy et al. 
(2017), among others, for generating structured 
forms rather than paraphrases. Herzig et al. (2021) 
predict intermediate semantic representations with 
stronger structural correspondence to natural lan- 
guage thanm, replacing the role ofcin our ap- 
proach with a modif i ed meaning representationm0. 
Like the closely related problem of machine 
translation (Wong and Mooney, 2006; Andreas 
et al., 2013), semantic parsing has recently been 
driven by encoder-decoder neural architectures 
(starting with Dong and Lapata, 2016; Jia and 
Liang, 2016; Ko��cisk��y et al., 2016). More recently, 
Chen et al. (2020) used pre-trained LMs, includ- 
ing BART, to initialize both the encoder and the 
decoder of a semantic parser. In concurrent work, 
Desai et al. (2021) reports gains on Chen et al. 
(2020) by modifying a target representation to be 
more natural language-like. We argue that LMs 
are better suited for generating natural language 
directly rather than task-specif i c meaning represen- 
tations, using experiments designed to contrast the 
prof i ciency of LMs on these two output modalities. 
Finally, Wu et al. (2021) concurrently proposed 
a similar solution to our own. We independently 
conf i rm positive results on Overnight, with new 
studies on Break and SMCalFlow. In contrast to 
their primary focus on the unsupervised setting, our 
experiments were largely concerned with the few- 
shot scenario. We consider it reasonable to expect 
small hundreds of examples from a domain expert 
when building a real world parser, and our results 
suggest that this obviates the concerns of Wu et al. 
9Prior to recent advances it was believed that ���practical 
application of speech recognition technology requires a vo- 
cabulary and grammar tailored to the particular application, 
since for high accuracy the recognizer must be restricted as 
to what sequences of words it will consider��� ��� Moore et al. 
on initially tuning a paraphrase model beyond what 
current off-the-shelf pretraining methods provide. 
7Conclusion 
We wish to rapidly develop semantic parsers in 
new domains. To this end, we have demonstrated 
that constrained decoding of powerful language 
models can enable the paraphrasing of user utter- 
ances into a controlled sublanguage, which may 
then be mapped to a task-specif i c representation. 
With small hundreds of examples we are able to 
quickly bootstrap models for a variety of datasets, 
enabling future work that explores human in the 
loop interactions for iterative model ref i nement.

This section discusses the context of the study and its relation to previous work. It considers various other studies on text generation systems where certain phrases are required to be present or absent. This has led to increased exploration of efficient methods for limiting valid paths in beam search that satisfy externally provided constraints. These techniques have been used in task-oriented speech recognition systems where users were assumed to know the precise phrasing for commands.
The authors also highlight recent advances in semantic parsing driven by encoder-decoder neural architectures. They mention the use of pretrained language models, such as BART, to initialize both the encoder and the decoder of a semantic parser. They also acknowledge concurrent research that has proposed similar solutions to their own, but note that their primary focus was on the few-shot scenario.
In conclusion, the authors express their goal of rapidly developing semantic parsers in new domains. They have shown that powerful language models can paraphrase user utterances into a controlled sublanguage using constrained decoding, which can then be mapped to a task-specific representation. Their approach quickly bootstraps models for a variety of datasets with a few hundred examples, and they anticipate future work exploring human-in-the-loop interactions for iterative model refinement.

On Robust Prefix-Tuning for Text Classification

Published: 28 Jan 2022, Last Modified: 08 Jul 2023ICLR 2022 PosterReaders:  EveryoneShow BibtexShow Revisions
Keywords: prefix-tuning, pretrained language models, text classification, robustness in NLP, optimal control
Abstract: Recently, prefix-tuning has gained increasing attention as a parameter-efficient finetuning method for large-scale pretrained language models. The method keeps the pretrained models fixed and only updates the prefix token parameters for each downstream task. Despite being lightweight and modular, prefix-tuning still lacks robustness to textual adversarial attacks. However, most currently developed defense techniques necessitate auxiliary model update and storage, which inevitably hamper the modularity and low storage of prefix-tuning. In this work, we propose a robust prefix-tuning framework that preserves the efficiency and modularity of prefix-tuning. The core idea of our framework is leveraging the layerwise activations of the language model by correctly-classified training data as the standard for additional prefix finetuning. During the test phase, an extra batch-level prefix is tuned for each batch and added to the original prefix for robustness enhancement. Extensive experiments on three text classification benchmarks show that our framework substantially improves robustness over several strong baselines against five textual attacks of different types while maintaining comparable accuracy on clean texts. We also interpret our robust prefix-tuning framework from the optimal control perspective and pose several directions for future research.

The paper "On Robust Prefix-Tuning for Text Classification" by Zonghan Yang and Yang Liu presents a novel framework for robust prefix-tuning in text classification tasks. This work is set against the backdrop of the increasing popularity of prefix-tuning as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for large-scale pretrained language models.
Prefix-tuning is a technique where only the prefix token parameters are updated for each downstream task, while keeping the pretrained models fixed. Despite its advantages such as being lightweight and modular, prefix-tuning is not robust against textual adversarial attacks. Most existing defense techniques require auxiliary model updates and storage, which goes against the core benefits of prefix-tuning.
The authors propose a robust prefix-tuning framework that retains the efficiency and modularity of prefix-tuning. The central concept of this framework is to use the layer-wise activations of the language model, derived from correctly classified training data, as the standard for further prefix fine-tuning.
During the testing phase, an additional batch-level prefix is fine-tuned for each batch and added to the original prefix to enhance robustness. The authors have conducted extensive experiments on three text classification benchmarks. The results show that their framework significantly improves robustness against five different types of textual attacks, while maintaining similar accuracy levels on clean texts when compared to several strong baseline models.
The authors also interpret their robust prefix-tuning framework from the optimal control perspective, suggesting several directions for future research. This work aims to improve the robustness of text classification models, making them more resistant to adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: We propose white-box adversarial robustness evaluation protocols for general deep equilibrium models, and conduct fair comparisons with traditional deep networks.
Abstract: Deep equilibrium models (DEQs) refrain from the traditional layer-stacking paradigm and turn to find the fixed point of a single layer. DEQs have achieved promising performance on different applications with featured memory efficiency. At the same time, the adversarial vulnerability of DEQs raises concerns. Several works propose to certify robustness for monotone DEQs. However, limited efforts are devoted to studying empirical robustness for general DEQs. To this end, we observe that an adversarially trained DEQ requires more forward steps to arrive at the equilibrium state, or even violates its fixed-point structure. Besides, the forward and backward tracks of DEQs are misaligned due to the black-box solvers. These facts cause gradient obfuscation when applying the ready-made attacks to evaluate or adversarially train DEQs. Given this, we develop approaches to estimate the intermediate gradients of DEQs and integrate them into the attacking pipelines. Our approaches facilitate fully white-box evaluations and lead to effective adversarial defense for DEQs. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 validate the adversarial robustness of DEQs competitive with deep networks of similar sizes.

The paper "A Closer Look at the Adversarial Robustness of Deep Equilibrium Models" by Zonghan Yang, Tianyu Pang, and Yang Liu offers an in-depth look at the robustness of Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) against adversarial attacks.
DEQs break away from the traditional stacked-layer model of deep learning and instead seek the fixed point of a single layer. These models have shown promising results in various applications, mainly due to their memory efficiency. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised some concerns.
While some works propose robustness certification for monotone DEQs, there is less effort directed towards investigating the empirical robustness of general DEQs. The authors observed that an adversarially trained DEQ takes more forward steps to reach the equilibrium state, and in some cases, even disrupts its fixed-point structure. Also, due to black-box solvers, the forward and backward paths of DEQs are misaligned, which results in gradient obfuscation when applying off-the-shelf attacks to evaluate or adversarially train DEQs.
To mitigate these issues, the authors propose methodologies to estimate the intermediate gradients of DEQs and integrate them into the attack pipelines. These methodologies allow for complete white-box evaluations and result in effective adversarial defense for DEQs.
The authors performed extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset to verify their approaches, showing that the adversarial robustness of DEQs can compete with deep networks of similar sizes. These findings suggest that DEQs can be a viable choice for applications requiring both memory efficiency and robustness against adversarial attacks.

Improving Adversarial Robustness of Deep Equilibrium Models with Explicit Regulations Along the Neural Dynamics
Zonghan Yang, Peng Li, Tianyu Pang, Yang Liu Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Machine Learning, PMLR 202:39349-39364, 2023.
Abstract
Deep equilibrium (DEQ) models replace the multiple-layer stacking of conventional deep networks with a fixed-point iteration of a single-layer transformation. Having been demonstrated to be competitive in a variety of real-world scenarios, the adversarial robustness of general DEQs becomes increasingly crucial for their reliable deployment. Existing works improve the robustness of general DEQ models with the widely-used adversarial training (AT) framework, but they fail to exploit the structural uniquenesses of DEQ models. To this end, we interpret DEQs through the lens of neural dynamics and find that AT under-regulates intermediate states. Besides, the intermediate states typically provide predictions with a high prediction entropy. Informed by the correlation between the entropy of dynamical systems and their stability properties, we propose reducing prediction entropy by progressively updating inputs along the neural dynamics. During AT, we also utilize random intermediate states to compute the loss function. Our methods regulate the neural dynamics of DEQ models in this manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods substantially increase the robustness of DEQ models and even outperform the strong deep network baselines

In the paper titled "Improving Adversarial Robustness of Deep Equilibrium Models with Explicit Regulations Along the Neural Dynamics", Zonghan Yang, Peng Li, Tianyu Pang, and Yang Liu explore methods to enhance the adversarial robustness of Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models.
DEQ models, which rely on a fixed-point iteration of a single-layer transformation instead of traditional multi-layer stacking of deep networks, have shown competitive performance in various real-world applications. Ensuring their adversarial robustness is critical for their reliable deployment. While adversarial training (AT) has been employed to enhance the robustness of DEQ models, previous works have failed to take full advantage of the unique structures of DEQ models.
The authors approach DEQs through the lens of neural dynamics and discover that AT inadequately regulates intermediate states, which often provide predictions with high entropy. Given the correlation between the entropy of dynamic systems and their stability properties, the authors propose reducing prediction entropy by iteratively updating inputs along the neural dynamics.
During adversarial training, they also use random intermediate states to compute the loss function, which helps regulate the neural dynamics of DEQ models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that these methods significantly improve the robustness of DEQ models, even surpassing strong deep network baselines.
In conclusion, this work offers valuable insights and practical methods to boost the adversarial robustness of DEQ models, paving the way for their more reliable and secure deployment in various applications.

Your ability to choose the right problems to work on is even more important than your raw technical skill. This taste in problems is something you���ll develop over time by watching which ideas prosper and which ones are forgotten. You���ll see which ones serve as building blocks for new ideas and results, and which ones are ignored because they are too complicated or too fragile, or because the incremental improvement is too small.

You might be wondering if there���s a way to speed up the process of developing a good taste for what problems to work on. In fact, there are several good ways.

Read a lot of papers, and assess them critically. If possible, discuss them with others who have a deeper knowledge of the subject.
Work in a research group with other people working on similar topics. That way you can absorb their experiences as well as your own.
Seek advice from experienced researchers on what to work on. There���s no shame in working on ideas suggested by other people. Ideas are cheap, and there are lots of them in the air. Your skill comes in when you decide which one to work on, and how well you execute on it.
Spend time reflecting on what research is useful and fruitful. Think about questions like
When is theory useful?
When are empirical results transferable?
What causes some ideas to get wide uptake, whereas others are forgotten?
What are the trends in your field? Which lines of work will make the other ones obsolete?
Items 1-3 relate to optimizing your environment and getting input from other researchers, whereas item 4 is something you do alone. As empirical evidence for the importance of 1-3, consider how the biggests bursts of impactful work tend to be tightly clustered in a small number of research groups and institutions. That���s not because these people are dramatically smarter than everyone else, it���s because they have a higher density of expertise and perspective, which puts them a little ahead of the rest of the community, and thus they dominate in generating new results. If you���re not fortunate enough to be in an environment with high density of relevant expertise, don���t despair. You���ll just have to work extra-hard to get ahead of the pack, and it���s extra-important to specialize and develop your own unique perspective.

Idea-Driven vs Goal-Driven Research
Roughly speaking, there are two different ways that you might go about deciding what to work on next.

Idea-driven. Follow some sector of the literature. As you read a paper showing how to do X, you have an idea of how to do X even better. Then you embark on a project to test your idea.

Goal-driven. Develop a vision of some new AI capabilities you���d like to achieve, and solve problems that bring you closer to that goal. (Below, I give a couple case studies from my own research, including the goal of using reinforcement learning for 3D humanoid locomotion.) In your experimentation, you test a variety of existing methods from the literature, and then you develop your own methods that improve on them.

Of course, these two approaches are not mutually exclusive. Any given subfield ML is concerned with some goals (e.g., object detection). Any ���idea-driven��� project will represent progress towards the subfield���s goals, and thus in a sense, it���s an instance of goal-driven research. But here, I���ll take goal-driven research to mean that your goal is more specific than your whole subfield���s goal, and it���s more like make X work for the first time than make X work better.

I personally recommend goal-driven research for most people, and I���ve mostly followed this strategy myself.

One major downside of idea-driven research is that there���s a high risk of getting scooped or duplicating the work of others. Researchers around the world are reading the same literature, which leads them to similar ideas. To make breakthroughs with idea-driven research, you need to develop an exceptionally deep understanding of your subject, and a perspective that diverges from the rest of the community���some can do it, but it���s difficult.

On the other hand, with goal-driven research, your goal will give you a perspective that���s differentiated from the rest of the community. It will lead you to ask questions that no one else is asking, enabling you to make larger leaps of progress. Goal driven research can also be much more motivating. You can wake up every morning and imagine achieving your goal���what the result would look like and how you would feel. That makes it easier to stick to a long-running research program with ups and downs. Goals also make it possible for a team of researchers to work together and attack different aspects of the problem, whereas idea-driven research is most effectively carried out by ���teams��� of 1-2 people.

Case Study of Goal-Driven Research: My Work During Graduate School
For the first half of my PhD, my goal was to enable robots to manipulate deformable objects���including surgical robots tying knots, and household robots folding clothes. While this goal was determined by my advisor, Pieter Abbeel, as the main goal for his lab, I developed my own opinion on how to achieve this goal���my approach was based on learning from human demonstrations, and I was going to start with the problem of getting the PR2 to tie knots in rope. Various unexpected subproblems arose, one of which was trajectory optimization, and my work on that subproblem ended up being the most influential product of the knot-tying project.

For the second half of my PhD, I became interested in reinforcement learning. While there are many problem domains in which reinforcement learning can be applied, I decided to focus on robotic locomotion, since the goal was concrete and the end result was exciting to me. Specifically, my goal was to get a 3D robot to learn how to run from scratch using reinforcement learning. After some initial exploration, I decided to focus on policy gradient methods, since they seemed most amenable to understanding and mathematical analysis, and I could leverage my strength in optimization. During this period, I developed TRPO and GAE and eventually achieved the original goal of 3D humanoid locomotion.

While I was working on locomotion and starting to get my first results with policy gradient methods, the DeepMind team presented the results using DQN on Atari. After this result, many people jumped on the bandwagon and tried to develop better versions of Q-learning and apply them to the Atari domain. However, I had already explored Q-learning and concluded that it wasn���t a good approach for the locomotion tasks I was working on, so I continued working on policy gradient methods, which led to TRPO, GAE, and later PPO���now my best known pieces of work. This example illustrates how choosing a different problem from the rest of the community can lead you to explore different ideas.

Goal Driven Research: Restrict Yourself to General Solutions
One pitfall of goal-driven research is taking your goal too literally. If you have a specific capability in mind, there���s probably some way to achieve it in an uninteresting way that doesn���t advance the field of machine learning. You should constrain your search to solutions that seem general and can be applied to other problems.

For example, while working on robotic locomotion, I avoided incorporating domain information into the solution���the goal was to achieve locomotion in simulation, in a way that was general and could be applied to other problems. I did a bit of feature engineering and reward shaping in order to see the first signs of life, but I was careful to keep my changes simple and not let them affect the algorithm I was developing. Now that I am using videogames as a testbed, I make sure that my algorithmic ideas are not specific to this setting���that they equally well could be applied to robotics

In this blog post titled "An Opinionated Guide to ML Research," John Schulman, who is a renowned researcher in machine learning and an expert in reinforcement learning, provides advice to budding researchers in the field. The advice he provides revolves around choosing the right problems to work on and organizing time efficiently.
He explains that one's ability to choose the right problems to work on is even more crucial than raw technical skill. He recommends developing a good sense for problem selection by reading lots of papers, working in a research group, seeking advice from experienced researchers, and spending time reflecting on what research is fruitful and useful. He also emphasizes the importance of being in a high-density environment of relevant expertise, which often leads to more impactful work.
Schulman also discusses two primary approaches to choosing research topics:
Idea-driven research:
This approach involves closely following a sector of the literature and developing ideas for improving on existing work.
Goal-driven research:
This approach involves setting a specific goal or capability you want to achieve and then solving problems that bring you closer to that goal.
Schulman personally recommends goal-driven research, as it often leads to larger leaps of progress and is more motivating. He also cautions about the risk of getting scooped or duplicating work in the idea-driven approach.
He cites his own research during his PhD program as a case study of goal-driven research, focusing first on enabling robots to manipulate deformable objects and then on robotic locomotion using reinforcement learning.
He concludes by warning against taking the goal-driven approach too literally, advising researchers to focus on solutions that are general and could be applied to other problems, rather than focusing on specific, isolated goals.

Aim High, and Climb Incrementally Towards High Goals
Sometimes, people who are both exceptionally smart and hard-working fail to do great research. In my view, the main reason for this failure is that they work on unimportant problems. When you embark on a research project, you should ask yourself: how large is the potential upside? Will this be a 10% improvement or a 10X improvement? I often see researchers take on projects that seem sensible but could only possibly yield a small improvement to some metric.

Incremental work (those 10% improvements) are most useful in the context of a larger goal that you are trying to achieve. For example, the seminal paper on ImageNet classification using convolutional neural networks (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Hinton, 2012) does not contain any radically new algorithmic components, rather, it stacks up a large number of small improvements to achieve an unprecedented result that was surprising to almost everyone at the time (though we take it for granted now). During your day-to-day work, you���ll make incremental improvements in performance and in understanding. But these small steps should be moving you towards a larger goal that represents a non-incremental advance.

If you are working on incremental ideas, be aware that their usefulness depends on their complexity. A method that slightly improves on the baseline better be very simple, otherwise no one will bother using it���not even you. If it gives a 10% improvement, it better be 2 lines of code, whereas if it's a 50% improvement, it can add 10 lines of code, etc. (I���m just giving these numbers for illustration, the actual numbers will obviously depend on the domain.)

Go back and look at the list of machine learning achievements you admire the most. Does your long-term research plan have the potential to reach the level of those achievements? If you can���t see a path to something that you���d be proud of, then you should revise your plan so it does have that potential.

Making Continual Progress
To develop new algorithms and insights in machine learning, you need to concentrate your efforts on a problem for a long period of time. This section is about developing effective habits for this long-term problem solving process, enabling you to continually build towards great results.

Keep a Notebook, and Review It
I strongly advise you to keep a notebook, where you record your daily ideas and experiments. I have done this through 5 years of grad school and 2 years at OpenAI, and I feel that it has been tremendously helpful.

I create an entry for each day. In this entry, I write down what I���m doing, ideas I have, and experimental results (pasting in plots and tables). Every 1 or 2 weeks, I do a review, where I read all of my daily entries and I condense the information into a summary. Usually my review contains sections for experimental findings, insights (which might come from me, my colleagues, or things I read), code progress (what did I implement), and next steps / future work. After I do my week in review, I often look at the previous week to see if I followed up on everything I thought of that week. Also, while doing this review, I sometimes transfer information into other sources of notes. (For example, I keep a list of backburner ideas and projects, separate from my notebook.)

What���s the value in keeping this notebook and doing the regular reviews?

First, the notebook is a good place to write down ideas as soon as you have them, so you can revisit them later. Often, when I revisit my journal entries during the week in review, I���ll fill in a missing piece in a puzzle, which didn���t occur to me at the time.

Second, the notebook helps you keep your experimental results in a unified place, so you can easily find the results later. It���s easy to forget about your conclusions, e.g., which hyperparameters made a difference, and you���ll want to revisit your old notebook entries.

Third, the notebook lets you monitor your use of time. You might wonder ���where did last week go?���, and the notebook will help you answer that question. You might be disappointed with your throughput and realize you need to work on your time management. You also might look back at several months and realize that you���ve been jumping around between ideas too much���that you have a few half-finished projects but you didn���t follow any of these threads long enough to yield a notable result.

Fourth, your notebook can provide emotional support. Everyone has their ups and downs in research, and your notebook can remind you of your progress when you���re feeling stuck. It can also help you remember the thrill of discovery when you���ve hit a low point.
Fifth, your notebook can serve as a draft of a paper or blog post. I often find myself copying and pasting notebook entries into my papers.
The Benefits of Reflection
The process of writing in a notebook and reviewing it regularly allows you to reflect on your progress and adjust your approach as necessary. This is a powerful way to avoid getting stuck in unproductive patterns and to make sure you're on the right track to achieving your larger goals.
The mindset I have found most useful during my reflection process is one of curiosity and self-compassion. Be open to your experiences and observations, and don't beat yourself up over perceived failures or mistakes. Instead, look at them as opportunities for learning and growth.
Iterative Problem-Solving Process
Research, at its core, is about problem-solving. An effective problem-solving process is iterative and involves a cycle of exploration, analysis, and synthesis.
Exploration: When you begin a research project, you might not know exactly what problems you'll encounter or how to solve them. It's important to explore your problem space, try different approaches, and remain open to unexpected findings. This might involve trying out different algorithms, reading relevant literature, discussing ideas with colleagues, or running preliminary experiments.
Analysis: Once you have gathered some information or data, it's time to analyze it. This might involve digging deeper into the details of your algorithms, performing statistical analyses of your data, or critically examining the assumptions of your approach.
Synthesis: After analyzing the information, you need to integrate it and develop new insights or solutions. This might involve coming up with a new approach to your problem, refining your existing methods, or synthesizing insights from different sources.
You then go back to exploration, but this time with a more refined understanding of the problem and possible solutions. You continue this cycle until you've achieved your research goals.
Choosing Tools and Developing Skills
Choose the right tools for your work. The best tools are those that enhance your productivity and help you focus on the most important aspects of your research. They should support your workflow, help you manage your data and code, and make it easy to share your work with others.
Spend time developing skills that will make you more effective in your work. This might include learning a new programming language, mastering a machine learning framework, improving your statistical skills, or becoming more proficient in using a specific tool or software.
Achieving Personal Growth
Successful research also involves personal growth. You need to develop habits and attitudes that help you work effectively and handle the challenges of research. You also need to take care of your mental and physical health, as they are crucial for sustaining the long-term effort needed for successful research.
Develop Good Habits
Good habits are key to productivity. They automate your behavior, saving mental energy for more challenging tasks. They also provide a structure to your day and help you stay focused.
Some good habits for researchers might include:
Prioritizing your tasks and focusing on the most important ones.
Taking regular breaks to avoid burnout.
Keeping your workspace organized.
Regularly reviewing your progress and adjusting your approach as needed.
Seeking feedback and learning from others.
Cultivate a Growth Mindset
Having a growth mindset, as opposed to a fixed mindset, is important for dealing with the challenges of research. With a growth mindset, you believe that your abilities and intelligence can be developed with effort and practice. This makes you more resilient to setbacks and more likely to persevere in the face of difficulties.
Take Care of Your Health
Your mental and physical health have a big impact on your productivity and creativity. Ensure you are getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and engaging in regular physical activity. Also, take care of your mental health by managing stress, practicing mindfulness, and maintaining a positive work-life balance.
In conclusion, successful machine learning research requires working on the right problems, making continual progress, and achieving personal growth. By developing a good taste for problems, aiming high, developing effective problem-solving habits, choosing the right tools and skills, and taking care of your health, you can become a successful researcher in this exciting field.

When to Switch Problems
To solve a challenging problem, you need to spend a sufficient amount of time on it. But in empirical machine learning research, it���s hard to know if you���ve tried an idea hard enough. Sometimes the idea has the potential to work, but if you get one detail wrong, you���ll see no signs of life. But other ideas are simply doomed to fail no matter how hard you work on them.

In my experience, switching problems too frequently (and giving up on promising ideas) is a more common failure mode than not switching enough. Often, while you���re engaged in the long slog towards getting your current idea to work, another promising idea will come along, and you���ll want to jump to that idea. If your idea is quick to try and the potential upside is large, then go ahead and do it. But more commonly, your initial results on the new idea will be disappointing, and it���ll take a more sustained effort to yield significant results.

As a rule of thumb, when you look back at which projects you���ve been working on over a period of months, you should find that there have been lots of small dead ends, but the majority of your time has been directed towards projects that yielded a deliverable such as a paper or a blog post. If you look back at your time and see that a substantial fraction was spent on half-finished projects���which were not definite failures, but which you abandoned in favor of some newer idea���then you should make a stronger effort towards consistency and follow-through in the future.

One strategy, which I haven���t tried personally but makes a lot of sense upon reflection, is to devote some fixed time budget to trying out new ideas that diverge from your main line of work. Say, spend one day per week on something totally different from your main project. This would constitute a kind of epsilon-greedy exploration, and it would also help to broaden your knowledge.

Personal Development
No matter how you allocate your time during your research journey, you are bound to learn a lot. Each project will present new challenges, and you can pick up the background material and skills as you go along. However, you can significantly improve your chances to do great work in the long term by regularly setting aside time for your personal development. Specifically, you should allocate some fraction of your time towards improving your general knowledge of ML as opposed to working on your current project. If you don���t allocate this time, then your knowledge is likely to plateau after you learn the basics that you need for your day-to-day work. It���s easy to settle into a comfort zone of methods you understand well���you may need to expend active effort to expand this zone.

The main ways to build your knowledge of ML are to read textbooks, theses and papers; and to reimplement algorithms from these sources. Early on in your career, I recommend splitting your time about evenly between textbooks and papers. You should choose a small set of relevant textbooks and theses to gradually work through, and you should also reimplement the models and algorithms from your favorite papers.

Most students of machine learning don���t spend time reading textbooks after they finish their school courses. I think this is a mistake, since textbooks are a much more dense way to absorb knowledge than papers. Each conference paper typically contains one main new idea, along with a background section that���s too concise to learn anything from. There���s a lot of overhead, since you typically need to spend more time understanding the notation and terminology than the idea itself. On the other hand, good textbooks collect decades of ideas and present them in the proper order with the same notation. Besides reading the introductory machine learning textbooks, read other books in your areas of interest. A couple of my favorites were Numerical Optimization by Nocedal & Wright, and Elements of Information Theory by Cover & Thomas.

Besides textbooks, I recommend reading PhD theses of researchers whose work interests you. PhD theses in ML usually are ordered as follows: (1) introductory and background material, (2) several papers that were previously published at conferences (it���s said that you just have to ���staple together��� your papers to write your thesis), and (3) a conclusion and outlook. You���re likely to benefit most from parts (1) and (3), since they contain a unifying view of the past and future of the field, written by an expert. Recent theses are often the best place to find a literature review of an active field, but older theses also often contain valuable gems of insight.

Textbooks and theses are good for building up your foundational knowledge, but you���ll also need to read a lot of papers to bring your knowledge up to the frontier. When you are just starting your research career, I recommend spending a lot of time reimplementing ideas from papers, and comparing your results to the published ones. First of all, this gives you a much deeper understanding of the topic than you���d get by passively reading. Second, you���ll gain experience running experiments, and you���ll get much quicker feedback by reimplementing existing work (where the desired level of performance is known) than by doing original research. Once you can easily reproduce the state-of-the-art, you���ll be ready to go beyond it.

Besides reading seminal papers and reimplementing them, you should also keep track of the less exceptional papers being published in your field. Reading and skimming the incoming papers with a critical eye helps you notice the trends in your field (perhaps you notice that a lot of papers are using some new technique and getting good results���maybe you should investigate it). It also helps you build up your taste by observing the dependency graph of ideas���which ideas become widely used and open the door to other ideas.

Go forth and do great research!

Thank you for sharing this link, but please note that as an AI developed by OpenAI, I'm unable to access the internet in real-time or click the link to view the content. I can generate information and responses based on the extensive training data I was built with, which includes a diverse range of sources up until my knowledge cutoff in September 2021.
However, I can certainly provide some additional insights on the topics mentioned in your text.
Switching Research Problems
The decision of when to switch research problems is indeed a challenging one. It's essential to strike a balance between persisting with a problem and knowing when to change directions. This depends on many factors, including your level of interest in the problem, the feasibility of a solution, the potential impact of a solution, the availability of resources, and the progress made so far.
You should also consider whether you've explored different approaches to the problem or have been trying the same strategies over and over again. If it's the latter, you might need to broaden your perspective, seek input from others, or even take a break from the problem to gain new insights.
In any case, keeping a record of your research progress, such as in a research notebook, can help you make more informed decisions about when to switch problems. Regularly reviewing this record can help you assess your progress and determine whether you're moving in the right direction.
Personal Development in Machine Learning Research
In the field of machine learning research, personal development is crucial. This involves continuously expanding your knowledge and improving your skills. You should keep abreast of the latest developments in the field, experiment with new techniques and algorithms, and learn from your research experiences.
One effective way of achieving personal development is by reading widely, including textbooks, research papers, and PhD theses. This not only helps you gain a deeper understanding of machine learning concepts and techniques, but also exposes you to different perspectives and ideas in the field.
Another important aspect of personal development is hands-on practice. Reimplementing algorithms from research papers, for instance, can enhance your understanding of these algorithms and help you develop valuable skills.
Lastly, staying informed about the latest research in your field is important. This not only helps you keep up-to-date with recent advances, but also helps you identify trends, understand the current research landscape, and find inspiration for your own research.
In summary, achieving success in machine learning research requires a combination of choosing important problems, persisting with these problems, constantly learning and developing, and being aware of the latest trends in the field.

We're working with partially observed systems here so instead of the MDP state the 
agents are going to operate on action observation histories (AOH)

We'll also have the fully-observed historical trajectory . Finally, 
we'll use to represent the policy of agent and to denote the joint policy of all the 
agents. Since we'll want to distinguish between di?erent joint policies, we will also use 
subscripts like or to distinguish between di?erent joint policies.

It looks like you're discussing strategies to handle partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Specifically, you're referring to policies that operate on action observation histories (AOHs), rather than states of the system. This is quite common in environments where agents don't have access to the full state but only to observations related to their actions.
Your post also introduces the notion of counterfactual value and counterfactual Q-value. Counterfactual value is the expected value of a trajectory if the agent has been playing with one policy and then switches to another policy. Counterfactual Q-value, on the other hand, is the expected value of taking a particular action in a given observation.
You mention the OBL operator, which transforms an initial policy into a new policy based on the softmax of the counterfactual Q values. This operator takes a temperature parameter T, which controls the randomness of the new policy. As T approaches zero, the operator tends to select the action with the highest counterfactual Q value, hence it moves towards an optimal grounded policy.
Let me explain the core concepts here:
Action Observation Histories (AOHs):
These are sequences of actions and observations. In POMDPs, these histories can serve as a substitute for the underlying system state, which is not fully observable.
Counterfactual Value:
This is the expected value of a trajectory if we've been playing with one policy up until now and then switch to a different policy.
Counterfactual Q-Value:
This is the expected value of taking a specific action after observing a specific state, under the assumption that we were using one policy before, and will switch to another policy afterwards.
OBL Operator:
The Optimal Belief Learning (OBL) operator transforms an initial policy into a new policy based on the softmax of the counterfactual Q-values, with the temperature parameter T controlling the randomness of the new policy.
The key takeaway from your post seems to be that the OBL operator can return an optimal grounded policy as long as it starts with a policy that does not condition on the actions. And these grounded policies can be useful for handling POMDPs where the full system state isn't observable, but agents have access to action-observation histories.
Please note that this interpretation is based on the given text, and without additional context or a specific question, it's difficult to provide more in-depth analysis or explanations.

This is the ?rst in a series of blog posts on either new or important ideas in multi-agent 
learning. There really isn't much out there trying to put some of these ideas into easily 
understood prose and consequently a lot of key innovations are locked up in fairly 
inaccessible papers. My goal here is to make it easier to catch up on the ?eld and to 
highlight some key advances that have been happening recently. 
TLDR: 
If we're coordinating with an unknown agent, it's useful to treat it as though it 
doesn't know any conventions and instead is just interpreting only grounded 
information it observes. 
O?-belief learning gives us a way to generate agents that are grounded / convention- 
free and assume that the agents they are playing with are convention-free as well. 
More generally, o?-belief learning lets us build agents that assume their 
observations are coming from playing with an arbitrary agent of our choosing and 
that their actions in turn will be interpreted by an arbitrary other agent. 
We're starting with what I think is one of the biggest innovations to come out in the last 
year or two: O?-Belief Learning (OBL). OBL is kind of like the blockchain in that a lot of 
questions I ask are often answered with "pretty sure o?-belief learning solves this" but 
it's di?erent than the blockchain because it's obviously useful. It's a clever solution to a 
very ubiquitous problem in multi-agent learning. 
First, the problem OBL is looking to tackle is the problem of improving zero-shot 
coordination by removing arbitrary convention formation from multi-agent self-play (I'll 
de?ne what each of these pieces mean, don't worry). First, arbitrary convention 
formation. There's a nice example of this in the paper:

Here Alice is trying to communicate whether she has a cat or a dog to Bob who will try to 
guess which she has. They both get +10 points if he gets it right and -10 to both if he gets 
it wrong. She can also pay 5 points to remove the wall, clearly exposing which pet she 
has or ?ip a light bulb to its on or o? state. Finally, Alice can choose to exit from the game 
for a reward of 0.5 and Bob can exit the game for a reward of 1 instead of guessing. If we 
run self-play (i.e. Alice and Bob play this game together hundreds of times), Alice and 
Bob will learn a convention like "light-bulb on means dog, light-bulb o? means cat" and 
will use the light switch instead of removing the wall. 
That's all ?ne and good for Alice and Bob but what if we suddenly swap out Bob with 
another player, Candace? Candace has no idea about the convention; when Alice ?icks 
the lighbulb Candace will think "I have no idea what that means. I'm going to exit the 
game for a reward of 1." It's a ?ne strategy for playing with Bob, but it's not a good 
strategy for playing with an arbitrary, new player. This is the challenge of zero-shot 
coordination: how can we construct a strategy that should perform well no matter who 
our partner is? 
Note, this isn't a super well-de?ned problem, in principle no such strategy exists. 
For example, even if Alice were to remove the wall, it's possible that Bob could look at the 
revealed dog and exclaim "Cat!" Under the pessimal assumption that Bob is unable to 
distinguish cats from dogs, the optimal thing for Alice to do is to simply exit the game. 
We need to make some assumptions for coordination to be possible at all. One nice 
assumption that you could make on a partner is that Bob is an optimal grounded agent 
(OGA): an agent that acts optimally based on everything it observes but does not assume 
that observed actions are indicative of any conventions (this is a loose de?nition, we'll 
give a more technical one later). If Bob is an OGA agent and Alice ?ips the switch, Bob 
will simply exit the game because they don't know what the switch means. On the other 
hand, if Alice opens the wall, Bob will immediately guess the right pet. 
In other words, an OGA is an agent that acts only based on its observations of the world, 
but ignores the actions of its partner except to the extent that they reveal information 
about the world i.e. optimally grounded Bob ignores the light switch but pays attention 
to the pets when they're revealed. 
Okay, so how do we construct a self-play process that returns grounded agents instead of 
agents with arbitrary conventions? One of the key insights of the OBL paper is de?ning 
such an agent to be one that acts as though "all prior actions came from a random agent 
and that all my actions will be interpreted by an agent that believes all actions came 
from a random agent." Lets unpack that a bit because it's deeply unintuitive. If we have 
such an agent, then looking at the history of actions we have seen so far, we can't try to 
read conventions out of them since we believe they came from a random agent. However, 
for our action we want to signal as much information as possible to our partner since we 
believe that our partner is a copy of ourselves and will extract as much information as 
possible from the actions without assuming any conventions. 
Lets ?lter this through the lens of Alice and Bob. For any action Alice takes, she knows 
that Bob will believe her action was taken randomly. If she ?ips the light switch, he 
won't know what to do with that information and will exit the game. If she opens the 
door, it doesn't matter to Bob that the door opening occured randomly, he knows what 
the pet is and will guess it right.

Thanks for sharing this interesting excerpt about Off-Belief Learning (OBL) from a blog post on multi-agent learning. The blog post seems to be aimed at explaining some complex concepts from the field in an accessible way.
The concept of OBL aims to improve 'zero-shot coordination' in multi-agent scenarios. Zero-shot coordination refers to the ability of agents to cooperate or coordinate effectively without any prior interaction or communication.
The author explains this by taking an example of a game where Alice tries to communicate the type of her pet to Bob, and they have several options to choose from, such as removing a wall to reveal the pet, flipping a light switch, or exiting the game. If Alice and Bob play together enough times, they might establish a convention (e.g., light switch on means a dog, and light switch off means a cat). This convention, however, won't work with a new player, say Candace, who isn't privy to their convention. Therefore, the ability to play optimally with any new player, without relying on specific conventions, is considered a challenge in zero-shot coordination.
One way to approach this problem is to assume that the agents are 'Optimal Grounded Agents' (OGAs). An OGA acts optimally based on its observations but does not assume that the actions of others are indicative of any conventions. Therefore, in the game mentioned above, if Alice opens the wall to reveal the pet, an OGA like Bob would make the right guess based on his observation, rather than relying on a convention like the light switch's position.
The idea behind OBL, then, is to build agents that behave as though "all prior actions came from a random agent and that all my actions will be interpreted by an agent that believes all actions came from a random agent". This means the agent doesn't try to deduce conventions from previous actions but aims to signal as much information as possible through its actions, as it believes other agents are like itself and will extract as much information as possible without assuming any conventions.
The key takeaway from this post is that OBL is a promising method for creating agents that can optimally perform in multi-agent environments without relying on established conventions. It encourages agents to act on the "grounded" information they observe, thus potentially increasing their effectiveness when interacting with unknown agents.

It appears that you're providing a mathematical formula, but it is currently unintelligible due to a combination of typographical errors and non-standard notation.
If you're trying to formulate an equation related to multi-agent learning, off-policy learning, or reinforcement learning, it would be helpful to provide the complete and correctly formatted equation. In reinforcement learning, equations often include terms for rewards (r), states (s), actions (a), policies (��), and sometimes discount factors (��), along with summations or expectations over states and actions.
If you could provide more context or clarify your equation, I'd be happy to help explain it further.

Thank you for providing more context. Based on your description, it seems that you're referring to the Bellman iteration, which is a key component in reinforcement learning algorithms. The Bellman iteration involves updating the value function based on the Bellman equation.
The Bellman equation expresses the value of a state (or state-action pair) as the expected sum of immediate rewards and discounted future values:
Q(s, a) = E[r + �� * max_a'(Q(s', a')) | s, a],
where Q(s, a) represents the value of taking action a in state s, r is the immediate reward, �� is the discount factor (which determines the importance of future rewards), s' is the next state, and a' is the next action.
The Bellman iteration updates the Q-values iteratively based on the Bellman equation. It involves repeatedly applying the following update rule:
Q(s, a) ��� E[r + �� * max_a'(Q(s', a')) | s, a],
where Q(s', a') represents the current estimate of the value of the next state-action pair.
Please note that the specific notation and details may vary depending on the specific algorithm or context in which the Bellman iteration is used.

the actions of its partner) and we've currently observed trajectory . Then, there's no 
value in trying to read a convention out of , just extract all the information about the 
true state of the world you can without assuming any convention. Now, we know as 
much as we can but what action should we take? Well, if we assume that in the future 
our actions are going to be interpreted as though they're coming from a random agent, 
we might as well signal as much information about the true state of the world as we can. 
We have our OBL operator, we now need an RL procedure that returns the optimum. 
We can perform standard Bellman iteration. If we expand the counterfactual Q-values 
slightly, we can write them in a form that's amenable to sampling: 
A quick note, the term refers to the fact that our current player might not play 
again till steps later. This is just an expanded Bellman equation for the counterfactual 
Q function and we can try to converge to a ?xed point by drawing samples from this 
distribution and minimizing the di?erence between the LHS and RHS as we do in Q- 
learning. They call this approach Q-OBL. 
There's one serious challenge though: drawing samples. Samples from this distribution 
correspond to playing up till time , and our current policy thereafter and these two 
policies might reach very di?erent state distributions. For example, if is a uniform 
random policy, it might reach any interesting states with very low probability. 
Here they introduce another trick to let them sample interesting states with higher 
probability, a method they call LB-OBL: Learned Belief OBL. We're going to play forwards 
under and then at each state we reach, we're going to take the partially observed 
trajectory we've seen under , , and sample a trajectory that is consistent with but 
would have come from a random policy. In practice, this means we're training a belief 
model and drawing samples from it (for more info on this, check out the section 
on learned belief models). We'll then take this new ?ctitious sample and use it to roll 
out a fictitious transition along it and compute the counterfactual Bellman update along 
that fictitious transition.

The OBL operator (Optimal Belief Learning) is a key concept in OBL-based reinforcement learning. It is used to construct agents that assume their observations come from playing with an arbitrary agent and that their actions will be interpreted by another arbitrary agent.
The intuition behind the OBL operator is that, when interacting with an unknown agent, it is beneficial to treat the agent as if it doesn't know any conventions and only interprets grounded information. Therefore, the OBL operator allows an agent to generate policies that are convention-free and assume that the agents they are playing with are convention-free as well.
The OBL operator is applied within a reinforcement learning procedure, typically using a Bellman iteration. The counterfactual Q-values are expanded and formulated in a way that allows for sampling. This expanded Bellman equation for the counterfactual Q-function is then used to converge to a fixed point through sampling and minimizing the difference between the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the equation, similar to Q-learning. This approach is known as Q-OBL.
However, one challenge in sampling is that different policies may result in different state distributions, especially if a policy reaches interesting states with low probability. To address this, a technique called LB-OBL (Learned Belief OBL) is introduced. LB-OBL involves playing forward under a given policy and at each state, sampling a trajectory consistent with the observed partially observed trajectory and a random policy. This fictitious sample is then used to roll out a fictitious transition and compute the counterfactual Bellman update along that fictitious transition.
Overall, the OBL operator and its application in reinforcement learning provide a way to construct convention-free agents that can effectively interact with unknown agents and maximize their understanding of the true state of the world while assuming minimal conventions.

Really well! You can read the paper for that since the goal here was to get the ideas across. 
The idea of using a learned belief model is fairly neat so here's a little section diving into 
it more, with a full exposition in the paper Learned Belief Search: 
E?ciently Improving Policies in Partially Observable 
Sethttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09086.pdftings. For partially observable games, it is 
useful to have a persistent estimate of the likely true state of the world. Sometimes, we 
can explicitly enumerate this true state of the world but in general it can be fairly high 
dimensional. If we train a model that predicts from the current partially observed AOH a 
distribution over the true state of the world, we can simply sample from it for all sorts of 
tasks; in the linked paper they use it for search. 
However, the true state of the world, which combines all private agent observations + 
agent actions + public knowledge can be very high dimensional. Here we can apply a 
useful decomposition of a game into the set of common knowledge (what everyone 
knows) and private knowledge (what only you know). For many games, the set of private 
knowledge can be fairly small! For example, in 2-player poker games like Texas Hold-em, 
the private knowledge is simply the two cards that the opponent holds. Our belief model 
can simply draw samples of the private knowledge and combine this with the public 
knowledge to form the complete state of the game. 
In short, we are going to draw samples from our game and train a supervised model for 
our agents by taking the public observations and using them to predict the private 
observations of the agents. Since we're training this model on rollouts, we have the 
private observations and can use them as labels.

The idea of using a learned belief model is indeed interesting and can be applied in partially observable games to estimate the likely true state of the world. In some cases, it may be possible to explicitly enumerate the true state of the world, but in general, it can be high dimensional.
To address this, a decomposition of the game into common knowledge (what everyone knows) and private knowledge (what only an individual agent knows) can be applied. For example, in a 2-player poker game like Texas Hold'em, the private knowledge is simply the two cards held by the opponent. By combining the private knowledge with the public knowledge, the complete state of the game can be formed.
To train a supervised model for the agents, samples are drawn from the game. The public observations are used as inputs to predict the private observations of the agents. Since the private observations are known during the rollouts, they can be used as labels for training the model.
This approach allows for the development of a belief model that can generate distributions over the likely true state of the world based on the current partially observed action observation history (AOH). These distributions can be sampled to perform various tasks, such as search, in partially observable games.

Learned Belief Search: 
Eff i ciently Improving Policies in Partially Observable Settings 
Hengyuan Hu*1Adam Lerer*1Noam Brown1Jakob Foerster1 
Abstract 
Search is an important tool for computing ef- 
fective policies in single- and multi-agent en- 
vironments, and has been crucial for achieving 
superhuman performance in several benchmark 
fully and partially observable games. However, 
one major limitation of prior search approaches 
for partially observable environments is that the 
computationalcostscalespoorlywiththeamount 
of hidden information. In this paper we present 
Learned Belief Search (LBS), a computation- 
ally eff i cient search procedure for partially ob- 
servable environments.Rather than maintain- 
ing an exact belief distribution, LBS uses an ap- 
proximate auto-regressive counterfactual belief 
that is learned as a supervised task. In multi- 
agent settings, LBS uses a novel public-private 
model architecture for underlying policies in or- 
der to eff i ciently evaluate these policies during 
rollouts. In the benchmark domain of Hanabi, 
LBS can obtain 55% ��� 91% of the benef i t of ex- 
act search while reducing compute requirements 
by 35.8�� ��� 4.6��, allowing it to scale to larger 
settings that were inaccessible to previous search 
methods. 
1. Introduction 
Search has been a vital component for achieving superhu- 
man performance in a number of hard benchmark prob- 
lems in AI, including Go (Silver et al., 2016; 2017; 2018), 
Chess (Campbell et al., 2002), Poker (Morav�� c�� ��k et al., 
2017; Brown & Sandholm, 2017; 2019), and, more re- 
cently, self-play Hanabi (Lerer et al., 2020).Beyond 
achievingimpressiveresults, theworkonHanabiandPoker 
are some of the few examples of search being applied in 
large partially observable settings. In contrast, the work 
on belief-space planning typically assumes a small belief

space, since these methods scale poorly with the size of the 
belief space. 
Inspired by the recent success of the SPARTA search tech- 
nique in Hanabi (Lerer et al., 2020), we propose Learned 
Belief Search (LBS) a simpler and more scalable approach 
for policy improvement in partially observable settings, ap- 
plicable whenever a model of the environment and the poli- 
cies of any other agents are available at test time. Like 
SPARTA, the key idea is to obtain Monte Carlo estimates 
of the expected return for every possible action in a given 
action-observation history (AOH) by sampling from a be- 
lief distribution over possible states of the environment. 
However, LBS addresses one of the key limitations of 
SPARTA. Rather than requiring a suff i ciently small belief 
space, in which we can compute and sample from an ex- 
act belief distribution, LBS samples from a learned, auto- 
regressive belief model which is trained via supervised 
learning (SL). The auto-regressive parameterization of the 
probabilities allows LBS to be scaled to high-dimensional 
state spaces, whenever these are composed as a sequence 
of features. 
Another eff i ciency improvement over SPARTA is replac- 
ing the full rollouts with partial rollouts that bootstrap from 
a value function after a specif i c number of steps. While 
in general this value function can be trained via SL in a 
separate training process, this is not necessary when the 
blueprint (BP) was trained via RL. In these cases the RL 
training typically produces both a policy and an approx- 
imate value function (either for variance reduction or for 
value-based learning). In particular, it is common prac- 
tice to train centralized value functions, which capture the 
required dependency on the sampled state even when this 
state cannot be observed by the agent during test time. 
While LBS is a very general search method for Partially 
Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), our 
application is focused on single-agent policy improvement 
in Decentralized POMDPs (Dec-POMDPs) (in our specif i c 
case, Hanabi). One additional challenge of single-agent 
policy improvement in Dec-POMDPs is that, unlike stan- 
dard POMDPs, the Markov state s of the environment is no 
longer suff i cient for estimating the future expected return 
for a given AOH of the searching player. Instead, since the

other players��� policies also depend on their entire action- 
observation histories, e.g., via Recurrent-Neural Networks 
(RNNs), only the union of Markov state s and all AOHs is 
suff i cient. 
This in general makes it challenging to apply LBS, since 
it would require sampling entire AOHs, rather than states. 
However, in many Dec-POMDPs, including Hanabi, infor- 
mation can be split between the common-knowledge (CK) 
trajectory and private observations.Furthermore, com- 
monly information is ���revealing���, such that there is a map- 
ping from the most recent private observation and the CK 
trajectory to the AOH for each given player. In these set- 
tings it is suff i cient to track a belief over the union of pri- 
vate observations, rather than over trajectories, which was 
also exploited in SPARTA. We adapt LBS to this setting 
with a novel public-RNN architecture which makes replay- 
ing games from the beginning, as was done in SPARTA, 
unnecessary.

The paper "Learned Belief Search: Efficiently Improving Policies in Partially Observable Settings" introduces a computation-efficient search procedure called Learned Belief Search (LBS) for partially observable environments. The goal is to address the limitations of prior search approaches, which struggle to scale with the amount of hidden information.
LBS utilizes an approximate auto-regressive counterfactual belief instead of maintaining an exact belief distribution. This belief is learned as a supervised task, making it more scalable. In multi-agent settings, LBS employs a public-private model architecture to efficiently evaluate policies during rollouts.
One of the key improvements of LBS over previous methods is the use of partial rollouts that bootstrap from a value function after a specific number of steps. This value function can be trained via supervised learning (SL), especially when a blueprint (BP) has been trained using reinforcement learning (RL).
While LBS is a general search method for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), the paper focuses on its application in single-agent policy improvement in Decentralized POMDPs (Dec-POMDPs), particularly in the game of Hanabi. In Dec-POMDPs, the Markov state alone is insufficient for estimating the future expected return, as other players' policies depend on their entire action-observation histories. To address this challenge, LBS tracks a belief over the union of private observations and utilizes a public-RNN architecture.
The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of LBS in the benchmark domain of Hanabi. It achieves a significant portion of the benefit of exact search while reducing compute requirements, enabling scalability to larger settings previously inaccessible to other search methods.

2.1. Belief Modeling & Planning in POMDPs 
Deep RL on POMDPs typically circumvents explicit belief 
modeling by using a policy architecture such as an LSTM 
that can condition its action on its history, allowing it to 
implicitly operate on belief states (Hausknecht & Stone, 
2015). ���Blueprint��� policies used in this (and prior) work 
takethatapproach, butthisapproachdoesnotpermitsearch 
since search requires explicitly sampling from beliefs in or- 
der to perform rollouts. 
There has been extensive prior work on learning and plan- 
ning in POMDPs. Since solving for optimal policies in 
POMDPs is intractable for all but the smallest problems, 
most work focuses on approximate solutions, including of- 
l ine methods to compute approximate policies as well as 
approximate search algorithms, although these are still typ- 
ically restricted to small grid-world environments (Ross 
et al., 2008). 
One closely related approach is the Rollout algorithm 
(Bertsekas & Castanon, 1999), which given an initial pol- 
icy, computes Monte Carlo rollouts of the belief-space 
MDP assuming that this policy is played going forward, 
and plays the action with the highest expected value. In the 
POMDP setting, rollouts occur in the MDP induced by the 
belief states1. 
There has been some prior work on search in large 
POMDPs. Silver & Veness (2010) propose a method for 
performing Monte Carlo Tree Search in large POMDPs 
like Battleship and partially-observable PacMan. Instead 
of maintaining exact beliefs, they approximate beliefs us- 
ing a particle i lter with Monte Carlo updates. Roy et al. 
(2005) attempt to scale to large belief spaces by learning a 
compressed representation of the beliefs and then perform- 
ing Bayesian updates in this space. 
Most recently MuZero combines RL and MCTS with a 
learned implicit model of the environment (Schrittwieser 
et al., 2019). Since recurrent models can implicitly op- 
erate on belief states in partially-observed environments, 
MuZero in effect performs search with implicit learned be- 
liefs as well as a learned environment model. 
2.2. Games & Hanabi 
Search has been responsible for many breakthroughs on 
benchmark games. Most of these successes were achieved 
in fully observable games such as Backgammon (Tesauro, 
1994), Chess (Campbell et al., 2002) and Go (Silver et al., 
2016; 2017; 2018).More recently, belief-based search 
techniques have been scaled to large games, leading to 
breakthroughs in poker (Morav�� c�� ��k et al., 2017; Brown & 
Sandholm, 2017; 2019) and the cooperative game Han- 
abi (Lerer et al., 2020), as well as large improvements in 
Bridge (Tian et al., 2020). 
There has been a growing body of work developing agents 
in the card game Hanabi.While early hobbyist agents 
codif i ed human conventions with some search (O���Dwyer, 
2019; Wu, 2018), more recent work has focused on Han- 
abi as a challenge problem for learning in cooperative 
partially-observed games (Bard et al., 2020). In the self- 
play setting (two copies of the agent playing together), 
the Bayesian Action Decoder (BAD) was the i rst learn- 
ing agent (Foerster et al., 2019), which was improved upon 
by the Simplif i ed Action Decoder (SAD) (Hu & Foerster, 
2020). The state-of-the-art in Hanabi self-play is achieved 
by the SPARTA Monte Carlo search algorithm applied to 
the SAD blueprint policy (Lerer et al., 2020). 
There has been recent work on ad-hoc team play and zero- 
shotcoordination, inwhichagentsarepairedwithunknown 
partners (Canaan et al., 2019; Walton-Rivers et al., 2017; 
Hu et al., 2020).

DEC-POMDP setting, but samples states from the beliefs rather 
than doing rollouts directly in belief space.

In deep reinforcement learning (RL) on partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), explicit belief modeling is often circumvented by using policy architectures such as LSTMs that can condition actions on the agent's history, allowing for implicit operation on belief states. However, this approach does not permit search, as search requires explicit sampling from beliefs for rollouts. Prior work on learning and planning in POMDPs focuses on approximate solutions, including offline methods and approximate search algorithms, typically limited to small grid-world environments. The Rollout algorithm is a related approach that computes Monte Carlo rollouts of the belief-space MDP based on an initial policy and selects the action with the highest expected value.

In recent years, belief-based search techniques have been applied to large games, leading to breakthroughs in poker and the cooperative game Hanabi, as well as significant improvements in Bridge.
Hanabi, a card game, has been the focus of research in developing AI agents. Early agents incorporated human conventions with some search, while more recent work tackles Hanabi as a challenge problem for learning in cooperative partially observed games. The Bayesian Action Decoder (BAD) was one of the first learning agents, followed by the Simplified Action Decoder (SAD). The state-of-the-art in Hanabi self-play is achieved by the SPARTA Monte Carlo search algorithm applied to the SAD blueprint policy.
There has also been recent work on ad-hoc team play and zero-shot coordination, where agents are paired with unknown partners, exploring coordination strategies with unfamiliar teammates.
Overall, the related work covers a range of approaches to belief modeling and planning in POMDPs, with specific applications in games like Hanabi and advancements in search algorithms for large-scale partially observable environments.

AI TimelinesGPTComputing OverhangAI
Curated
Crossposted from the AI Alignment Forum. May contain more technical jargon than usual.
Over on Developmental Stages of GPTs, orthonormal mentions

it at least reduces the chance of a hardware overhang.
An overhang is when you have had the ability to build transformative AI for quite some time, but you haven't because no-one's realised it's possible. Then someone does and surprise! It's a lot more capable than everyone expected.

I am worried we're in an overhang right now. I think we right now have the ability to build an orders-of-magnitude more powerful system than we already have, and I think GPT-3 is the trigger for 100x larger projects at Google, Facebook and the like, with timelines measured in months.

Investment Bounds
GPT-3 is the first AI system that has obvious, immediate, transformative economic value. While much hay has been made about how much more expensive it is than a typical AI research project, in the wider context of megacorp investment, its costs are insignificant.

GPT-3 has been estimated to cost $5m in compute to train, and - looking at the author list and OpenAI's overall size - maybe another $10m in labour.

Google, Amazon and Microsoft each spend about $20bn/year on R&D and another $20bn each on capital expenditure. Very roughly, it totals to $100bn/year. Against this budget, dropping $1bn or more on scaling GPT up by another factor of 100x is entirely plausible right now. All that's necessary is that tech executives stop thinking of natural language processing as cutesy blue-sky research and start thinking in terms of quarters-till-profitability.

A concrete example is Waymo, which is raising $2bn investment rounds - and that's for a technology with a much longer road to market.

Compute Cost
The other side of the equation is compute cost. The $5m GPT-3 training cost estimate comes from using V100s at $10k/unit and 30 TFLOPS, which is the performance without tensor cores being considered. Amortized over a year, this gives you about $1000/PFLOPS-day.

However, this cost is driven up an order of magnitude by NVIDIA's monopolistic cloud contracts, while performance will be higher when taking tensor cores into account. The current hardware floor is nearer to the RTX 2080 TI's $1k/unit for 125 tensor-core TFLOPS, and that gives you $25/PFLOPS-day. This roughly aligns with AI Impacts��� current estimates, and offers another >10x speedup to our model.

I strongly suspect other bottlenecks stop you from hitting that kind of efficiency or GPT-3 would've happened much sooner, but I still think $25/PFLOPS-day is a lower useful bound.

Other Constraints
I've focused on money so far because most of the current 3.5-month doubling times come from increasing investment. But money aside, there are a couple of other things that could prove to be the binding constraint.

Scaling law breakdown. The GPT series' scaling is expected to break down around 10k pflops-days (��6.3), which is a long way short of the amount of cash on the table.
This could be because the scaling analysis was done on 1024-token sequences. Maybe longer sequences can go further. More likely I'm misunderstanding something.
Sequence length. GPT-3 uses 2048 tokens at a time, and that's with an efficient encoding that cripples it on many tasks. With the naive architecture, increasing the sequence length is quadratically expensive, and getting up to novel-length sequences is not very likely.
But there are a lot of plausible ways to fix that, and complexity is no bar AI. This constraint might plausibly not be resolved on a timescale of months, however.
Data availability. From the same paper as the previous point, dataset size rises with the square-root of compute; a 1000x larger GPT-3 would want 10 trillion tokens of training data.
It���s hard to find a good estimate on total-words-ever-written, but our library of 130m books alone would exceed 10tn words. Considering books are a small fraction of our textual output nowadays, it shouldn't be difficult to gather sufficient data into one spot once you've decided it's a useful thing. So I'd be surprised if this was binding.
Bandwidth and latency. Networking 500 V100 together is one challenge, but networking 500k V100s is another entirely.
I don't know enough about distributed training to say whether this is a very sensible constraint or a very dumb one. I think it has a chance of being a serious problem, but I think it's also the kind of thing you can design algorithms around. Validating such algorithms might take more than a timescale of months however.
Hardware availability. From the estimates above there are about 500 GPU-years in GPT-3, or - based on a one-year training window - $5m worth of V100s at $10k/piece. This is about 1% of NVIDIA's quarterly datacenter sales. A 100x scale-up by multiple companies could saturate this supply.
This constraint can obviously be loosened by increasing production, but it'd be hard to on a timescale of months.
Commoditization. If many companies go for huge NLP models, the profit each company can extract is driven towards zero. Unlike with other capex-heavy research - like pharma - there's no IP protection for trained models. If you expect profit to be marginal, you're less likely to drop $1bn on your own training program.
I am skeptical of this being an important factor while there are lots of legacy, human-driven systems to replace. Replacing those systems should be more than enough incentive to fund many companies��� research programs. Longer term, the effects of commoditization might become more important.
Inference costs. The GPT-3 paper (��6.3), gives .4kWh/100 pages of output, which works out to 500 pages/dollar from eyeballing hardware cost as 5x electricity. Scaling up 1000x and you're at $2/page, which is cheap compared to humans but no longer quite as easy to experiment with.
I'm skeptical of this being a binding constraint. $2/page is still very cheap.
Beyond 1000x
Here we go from just pointing at big numbers and onto straight-up theorycrafting.

In all, tech investment as it is today plausibly supports another 100x-1000x scale up in the very-near-term. If we get to 1000x - 1 ZFLOPS-day per model, $1bn per model - then there are a few paths open.

I think the key question is if by 1000x, a GPT successor is obviously superior to humans over a wide range of economic activities. If it is - and I think it's plausible that it will be - then further investment will arrive through the usual market mechanisms, until the largest models are being allocated a substantial fraction of global GDP.

On paper that leaves room for another 1000x scale-up as it reaches up to $1tn, though current market mechanisms aren't really capable of that scale of investment. Left to the market as-is, I think commoditization would kick in as the binding constraint.

That's from the perspective of the market today though. Transformative AI might enable $100tn-market-cap companies, or nation-states could pick up the torch. The Apollo Program made for a $1tn-today share of GDP, so this degree of public investment is possible in principle.

The even more extreme path is if by 1000x you've got something that can design better algorithms and better hardware. Then I think we're in the hands of Christiano's slow takeoff four-year-GDP-doubling.

That's all assuming performance continues to improve, though. If by 1000x the model is not obviously a challenger to human supremacy, then things will hopefully slow down to ye olde fashioned 2010s-Moore's-Law rates of progress and we can rest safe in the arms of something that's merely HyperGoogle.

The article titled "Are we in an AI overhang?" by Andy Jones discusses the possibility of being in an AI overhang, where the capability to build transformative AI exists but hasn't been fully realized. The author expresses concern that we currently have the ability to build significantly more powerful AI systems, with GPT-3 serving as a trigger for larger projects at major tech companies.
The author argues that the investment required to scale up AI systems like GPT-3 is within the budgets of companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, given their substantial R&D and capital expenditure budgets. While the cost of training GPT-3 has been estimated at $5 million in compute and an additional $10 million in labor, these costs are relatively insignificant compared to the overall investment capacities of these companies.
However, the article also acknowledges other constraints that may limit the immediate scalability of AI systems. These include potential breakdowns in scaling laws, sequence length limitations, data availability, networking challenges, hardware availability, commoditization effects, and inference costs. These constraints may pose challenges to the rapid scaling of AI systems in the short term.
The article suggests that despite these constraints, current tech investment could potentially support a 100x to 1,000x scale-up in the near term. The key question is whether a successor to GPT, at 1,000x scale-up, would outperform humans in a wide range of economic activities. If so, further investment through market mechanisms could lead to AI models being allocated a significant portion of global GDP.
The article also discusses the possibility of even larger scale-ups and the role of transformative AI in enabling trillion-dollar market-cap companies or public investments on the scale of the Apollo Program. Furthermore, if AI models at 1,000x scale possess the capability to design better algorithms and hardware, the pace of progress could accelerate even further.
However, the article highlights the importance of continued performance improvement. If AI models at 1,000x scale are not challengers to human supremacy, progress may slow down to traditional rates, and AI would have a more limited impact.
Overall, the article raises questions and considerations regarding the current state and future trajectory of AI development, emphasizing the potential for significant advancements while acknowledging various constraints and uncertainties.

An Overview of Fast Multipole Methods

April 23, 2004 
Sing, Muse, of the low-rank approximations 
Of spherical harmonics and O(N) computation... 
Abstract 
We present some background and results from the body of work collectively referred to as fast multipole 
methods (FMM). These comprise a set of techniques for speeding up so-called N-body problems, in which 
a potential function composed of a sum of pairwise interaction terms from N points is evaluated at an 
equally large number of locations.We present these methods from the viewpoint of low-rank block 
matrix approximations, i rst discussing a heuristic block-matrix approximation method [1], then moving 
into the analytic expansions which form the basis of both the original and new versions of the fast 
multipole method [2].We attempt to provide suf i cient background to understand and compute all 
the relevant results, yet present the material in suf i cient generality that it is easy to understand the 
relationship to similar algorithms such as the fast Gauss transform [3]. 
1Introduction 
In many problem domains and applications, simulation of physics-based interaction models or other direct 
methods result in substantial computational overhead. One such class of problems are described by pairwise 
interaction models, in which the function of interest (perhaps a cost or energy function) can be decomposed 
into sums of pairwise interactions with a set of ���source points��� xi: 
f(y) = 
N X 
i=1 qiK(y ��� xi)(1) 
where the qiare scalar values. In particular, these types of problems are found in such wide-ranging i elds 
as physics (computation of electrostatic or gravitational potentials and i elds), l uid and molecular dynamic 
simulations, and density estimation. They are sometimes called ���N-body��� problems, since they involve N 
���bodies��� of charge, mass, or probability. 
We have not specif i ed the dimensionality of the variables y,xi; in typical applications for physics they 
are three- (or possibly two-) dimensional values. Although this is not necessarily required it is certainly 
convenient for gaining intuition. We will use the variables x,y,z to denote vectors of arbitrary dimension, 
and use |y| to denote the length of y. Otherwise (unless specif i ed) all variables refer to scalar values. In 
order to provide intuition we will often refer to the xias ���point charges��� and qias their associated charge, 
and give examples couched in terms of computing an electrostatic potential. However, precisely the same 
equations apply equally well to e.g. the gravitational potential (with the additional requirement that the qi 
be positive), and the development for many other problems is quite similar. 
Typically the applications of interest involve evaluating f(��) at an equally large number of target locations 
{yj}.For 
many cases, we desire to evaluate f at the same locations xi(with the self-interaction term 
omitted): f(xj) = X 
i6=j K(xj��� xi)(2) 
1 
��� 
Figure 1: The far-f i eld ef f ect from several point charges can be approximated as a single function capturing 
their net ef f ect, rather than requiring that each contribution be calculated individually. 
Notationally, it is convenient to assume at least that the evaluation locations {yj} and point charge locations 
{xi} are approximately equal in size. This makes a direct, exact evaluation of the function f parameterized by 
point charges {qi,xi}N 
i=1 at locations {yj}N 
j=1 nominally a quadratic time operation, O(N2). 
Fast multipole 
methods (FMM) can be used to approximate this calculation to some pre-specif i ed level of accuracy in only 
O(N) time.

The paper titled "An Overview of Fast Multipole Methods" by Alexander T. Ihler provides an introduction to fast multipole methods (FMM) for accelerating N-body problems. N-body problems involve evaluating a potential function composed of pairwise interaction terms between N points at an equally large number of locations.
The paper presents FMM from the perspective of low-rank block matrix approximations. It starts by discussing a heuristic block-matrix approximation method and then delves into the analytic expansions that form the basis of both the original and new versions of FMM. The goal is to provide enough background information to understand and compute the relevant results while maintaining generality to connect with similar algorithms like the fast Gauss transform.
The introduction highlights the computational overhead involved in simulating physics-based interaction models or other direct methods for pairwise interaction models. These models decompose the function of interest into sums of pairwise interactions between source points. The paper uses examples such as electrostatic and gravitational potentials to illustrate the concepts, but notes that the equations apply to various other problems as well.
The main focus of FMM is to approximate the evaluation of the potential function at target locations in O(N) time instead of the nominal quadratic time complexity of O(N^2) for direct evaluations. The paper introduces the concept of the far-field effect, where the contributions from multiple point charges can be approximated as a single function capturing their net effect.
Overall, the paper serves as an overview and introduction to fast multipole methods, providing the necessary background and techniques for accelerating N-body problems by leveraging low-rank block matrix approximations.

Configurational disorder is particularly important for understanding the thermodynamic properties of multi-component materials at finite temperatures. The cluster-expansion (CE) method has been a successful approach for studying the statistical mechanics of configurational disorder in solids [1], [2], [3], [4]. The CE method has been used to calculate phase diagrams in alloys [5], [6], [7], [8] and ionic solids [9], [10], [11], [12], predict the short-range order related properties [13], [14], [15], [16], find the ground-state ordering in alloys [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], and compute voltage profiles of battery electrode materials [23], [24], [25], [26], [27].

The CE method can be understood as a generalization of the Ising model. The micro-states of a solid solution are represented as sequences of occupancy variables , which denote the chemical species occupying the crystallographic sites in a structure. The configuration energy is represented as a function of occupancy variables and is expanded as a sum of many-body interactions, where the cluster basis functions  take as input the occupancy values of different clusters of multiple sites. The cluster basis functions are then grouped and averaged over orbits  of symmetrically equivalent clusters to generate correlation functions ; and  is the multiplicity of orbit  per crystallographic unit cell. The linear-expansion coefficients  are called effective cluster interactions (ECI). In a typical approach, ECIs are fitted to the first-principles calculated energy of a large number of ordered structures using (regularized) linear regression [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. Thermodynamic quantities can be obtained by sampling the CE energy with Monte-Carlo simulations (CE-MC) [6], [37], [38], [39]. The CE-MC workflow allows fast statistical mechanics computation of configurational disorder using only a relatively small amount of first-principles calculations. Further details of the CE-MC method can be found in various review papers [35], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44].

CE-MC can be performed in a canonical ensemble or in a semigrand-canonical ensemble. In a canonical ensemble, the configuration states are sampled with a fixed composition of each species. Using the Metropolis���Hastings algorithm [45], [46], a typical MC step involves swapping the species occupying two randomly chosen sites (canonical swap). In a semigrand-canonical ensemble, the states are sampled under fixed chemical potentials and allowing the relative amounts of each species to vary. An MC step in the semigrand-canonical ensemble usually replaces the occupying species on one randomly chosen site with another species (single-species exchange). Semigrand-canonical simulations are the preferred approach for studying phase transition with compositional changes in solids. In a semigrand-canonical simulation, the system is always in a single-phase state, and transitions between compositions are relatively easy to observe. In contrast, multiple phases with different compositions can coexist in canonical simulations, giving a disproportionate influence to the interfacial energy between phases.

Single-species exchanges can be applied without issue when the species are all charge-neutral atoms. However, in an ionic system in which species carry charge, net zero charge needs to be maintained, essentially coupling allowed species exchanges. For simulating ionic liquids, various methods have been proposed such as: inserting and removing only charge-neutral combinations of ions [47]; performing single insertion or deletion while controlling the statistical average of the net charge to be equal to zero [48], [49]; or using an extended semigrand-canonical ensemble [50]. In practice, methods involving simple multi-species exchanges have been applied to specific battery materials [10], [51]. However, charge-balanced MC methods in lattice-model CEs with arbitrary complexity have not been formally addressed in the literature yet.

In this study, we introduce two CE-MC sampling methods to handle the charge-balance constraint in the semigrand-canonical CE-MC for ionic systems with charge decoration. In the first method, which we refer to as the table-exchange (TE) method, MC samples are kept charge-neutral by using charge-conserving multi-species exchanges. The second method, labeled the square-charge bias (SCB) method, combines single-species exchanges which allows a non-zero charge with a penalty on the net charge to bias the simulation towards zero charge. We benchmark the computational efficiency of both methods over their respective hyper-parameters and demonstrate proper usage strategies using a complex rocksalt system with configurational disorder

Abstract
Monte-Carlo sampling of lattice model Hamiltonians is a well-established technique in statistical mechanics for studying the configurational entropy of crystalline materials. When the species to be distributed on the lattice carry charge, the charge balance constraint on the overall system prohibits single-site Metropolis exchanges in MC. In this article, we propose two methods to perform MC sampling in the semigrand-canonical ensemble in the presence of a charge-balance constraint. The table-exchange method (TE) constructs small charge-conserving excitations, and the square-charge bias method (SCB) allows the system to temporarily drift away from charge neutrality. We illustrate the effect of internal hyper-parameters on the efficiency of these algorithms and suggest practical strategies on how to employ these algorithms in real applications

The given article published in Computational Materials Science discusses semigrand-canonical Monte-Carlo simulation methods for charge-decorated cluster expansions. In statistical mechanics, Monte-Carlo sampling of lattice model Hamiltonians is commonly used to study the configurational entropy of crystalline materials. However, when the species occupying lattice sites carry charge, maintaining charge balance becomes a crucial constraint that affects the Monte Carlo sampling process.
The article proposes two methods to perform Monte Carlo sampling in the semigrand-canonical ensemble while considering the charge-balance constraint. The first method, known as the table-exchange (TE) method, constructs small charge-conserving excitations to ensure charge neutrality during the sampling process. The second method, called the square-charge bias (SCB) method, allows the system to temporarily deviate from charge neutrality while applying a bias to bring it back towards charge balance.
The article explores the efficiency of these algorithms by analyzing the effect of internal hyper-parameters. It also provides practical strategies for utilizing these algorithms in real applications.

The cluster expansion (CE) method has seen continuous and increasing use in the study of conf i guration- 
dependent properties of crystalline materials. The original development of the CE method along with the 
underlying mathematical formalism and assumptions was focused on the study of metallic alloys. Since then 
the methodology has been actively and successfully used in the study of ionic materials as well. In this 
work, we present a cohesive reformulation of the mathematical formalism underlying the CE method based 
on a synthesis of its original formulation, several additions and extensions that have been proposed since, 
and a revised representation of its constituent mathematical objects. We then proceed to describe some of the 
formal implications of using the methodology for charge-neutral conf i gurations in ionic systems. In particular, 
we discuss the reduction of the size of conf i guration spaces and the resulting linear dependencies that arise 
among correlation functions that span the larger unconstrained conf i guration space. Additionally, we explore 
the effects of long-range electrostatic interactions. We also demonstrate how the previously proposed use of a 
point electrostatic term successfully accounts for the majority of the longer-range electrostatic interactions, and 
leaves the cluster expansion terms to capture mostly short-range interactions. Finally, we present and discuss a 
variety of recently developed methodologies, including training structure selection, oxidation state assignment, 
structure mapping, and regression algorithms, that are necessary to address these formal mathematical notions 
for a practical implementation of the CE method in the study of multicomponent ionic materials.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The cluster expansion (CE) method is used to represent 
a coarse graining of materials properties of multicomponent 
crystals based on the possible conf i gurations of species over 
the sites of an underlying disordered crystal structure. The 
CE method coupled with Monte Carlo (MC) analysis has 
become a standard computational tool used for calculating 
thermodynamic properties of crystalline materials with site 
disorder. By representing the formation energy in terms of 
atomic conf i gurations, thermodynamic properties can then 
be calculated by sampling i nite temperature states in MC 
simulations [1���3]. The CE method was originally proposed 
for the study of metallic alloys [4], subsequently extended to 
multisublattice systems [2,5], and eventually introduced in the 
study of oxides and ionic materials [6���10]. 
Since the focus in the original development of the 
CE method formalism was on metallic alloys, several of 
the nuances found in ionic systems (such as maintaining 
charge neutrality and describing long-range interactions) were

not initially considered. The CE method for simple ionic 
systems���such as CaO-MgO, which has binary conf i gura- 
tional degrees of freedom for isovalent cations only [11]���has 
been shown towork well.However, there isincreasing interest 
in applying these methods to more complex systems. Typical 
examples of such complex ionic systems include the recently 
discovered class of disordered rocksalts (DRX) [12,13], par- 
tially disordered spinels (PDSs) [14,15], and high-entropy 
perovskites [16], among many other promising multicompo- 
nent ceramic materials [17,18]. Specif i cally, DRX and PDSs 
are an appealing set of potential cathode materials whose 
systems generally involve a large number of components, 
redox mechanisms that require explicit treatment of cations 
with multiple oxidation states, and even anion disorder [19]. 
For these complex ionic materials, the CE and related lattice 
methods are of utmost importance to computationally probe 
relevant physics, such as ion percolation [20,21], short-range 
order [22���25], and phase diagrams [19,26]. The inherently 
large number of components that make these materials so 
promising also implies the exploration of conf i guration spaces 
with substantially larger dimension than that of binary or 
ternary alloys and layered oxides. 
In theory, the CE method can be used to represent func- 
tions over a conf i guration space of arbitrary dimension. In 
practice, several complexities arise when i tting CE models 
for materials with high-dimensional conf i guration spaces. The 
most signif i cant complexity comprises the increasing gap be- 
tween the polynomial growth in the number of expansion 
basis functions within i xed radial cutoffs, and the number

and supercell size of training structures that are needed for 
successful training. Furthermore, i rst-principles calculations 
used for training cluster expansions become more involved 
as the complexity in the physical interactions among com- 
ponents increases. More complex calculations can result in 
additional diff i culties such as insuff i cient training structure 
sampling or poorly conditioned and/or unstable feature ma- 
trices. To adequately i t cluster expansions for complex ionic 
materials, these practical issues can be addressed at the sta- 
tistical learning level by using appropriate sampling strategies 
[1,27,28], regularized regression models [28,29], and possibly 
hierarchical and/or grouping algorithms [30���32] in order to 
obtain accurate and sparse CE models over high-dimensional 
conf i guration spaces.

The paper titled "Cluster expansions of multicomponent ionic materials: Formalism and methodology" by Luis Barroso-Luque et al. provides a comprehensive overview of the cluster expansion (CE) method and its application to multicomponent ionic materials. The CE method is a widely used technique for studying the configuration-dependent properties of crystalline materials.
The paper starts by discussing the historical development of the CE method, which initially focused on metallic alloys but has been successfully extended to ionic materials. The authors present a reformulation of the mathematical formalism underlying the CE method, synthesizing the original formulation with additional proposed extensions. They also introduce a revised representation of the mathematical objects involved in the CE method.
The paper then addresses the specific challenges posed by charge-neutral configurations in ionic systems. It discusses the reduction of configuration spaces and the emergence of linear dependencies among correlation functions within the larger unconstrained configuration space. The effects of long-range electrostatic interactions are also explored. The authors propose using a point electrostatic term to account for the majority of longer-range interactions while allowing the cluster expansion terms to capture mostly short-range interactions.
In addition to discussing the formal implications, the paper presents various methodologies that have been developed to address these mathematical notions in practical implementations of the CE method for multicomponent ionic materials. These methodologies include training structure selection, oxidation state assignment, structure mapping, and regression algorithms.
The authors highlight the importance of the CE method in studying complex ionic systems such as disordered rocksalts, partially disordered spinels, and high-entropy perovskites. They emphasize the need to adequately address the challenges of high-dimensional configuration spaces and complex physical interactions in fitting CE models for these materials.
Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the CE method's formalism and methodology, highlighting its significance in studying multicomponent ionic materials and discussing practical strategies for its implementation.

Moreover, learning CE models of complex multicompo- 
nent ionic materials introduces an additional set of more 
fundamental obstacles that are not present in the case of 
metallic alloys. The most important difference arises from 
the restriction to a conf i guration space of only charge-neutral 
conf i gurations, which implies satisfying composition con- 
straints that often introduce linear dependencies between 
expansion functions. Additionally, one needs to properly ac- 
count for long-range electrostatic interactions, which has been 
addressed to some extent by considering only structures with 
low electrostatic energy [6]. Lastly, correct oxidation state 
assignment of transition metal species with multiple oxidation 
states is necessary to correctly capture relevant physics in 
complex ionic systems [32]. 
In this work, we reformulate the mathematical formalism 
of the CE method and introduce formal notions���which have 
been largely absent in literature���that arise from its use in 
ionic materials. We then outline relevant regression models 
and auxiliary methodology to effectively address such impli- 
cations in ionic systems and build sparse and accurate cluster 
expansion models of multicomponent ionic materials. The 
assortment of methodology presented is adapted and assessed 
within the context of the conf i guration spaces of ionic ma- 
terials, and includes established methods, recently published 
methods by the same authors [31,32], and a handful of exten- 
sions. The presentation is done with particular focus on the 
use of the CE method to examine the high-dimensional con- 
i gurationspacesassociatedwithmaterialresearchofcomplex 
ionic materials such as DRX and PDSs. 
The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we cover the 
general formalism of the CE method and its specif i c implica- 
tions for conf i guration spaces of ionic materials. Specif i cally, 
Sec. IIA introduces the mathematical formalism used to rep- 
resent conf i guration spaces and construct basis functions to 
represent crystal-symmetry-invariant functions of conf i gura- 
tion. In Sec. IIB1 we describe the formal implications of 
charge-neutrality constraints in conf i guration spaces. Addi- 
tionally, we discuss the practical incorporation of long-range 
electrostatic interactions into CE models. We then proceed to 
discuss and describe auxiliary methods necessary to i t cluster 
expansions of ionic materials using abinitio data in Sec. III. In 
Sec. IIIA we describe methodology that we have found useful 
for oxidation state assignment of systems that include species 
with multiple oxidation states, structure mapping methods to 
effectively include relaxed structures in training, and train- 
ing structure sampling methods for improved accuracy and 
stability of resulting CE models. We also brief l y examine the 
implications of having conf i gurations that are inaccessible by 
i rst-principles calculations due to mechanical and electronic 
instabilities. Finally, in Sec. IIIB we provide an overview of 
linear regression models with a particular focus on regression 
models with structured sparsity. We have found structured- 
sparsity regression models particularly useful when i tting CE 
models of complex ionic materials. 
Throughout Sec. III we provide various results illus- 
trating relevant methodology using for the most part a 
LiMnO2-Li2TiO3-LiF (LMTOF) disordered rocksalt material 
as an example. The LMTOF rocksalt system comprises a 
binary face-centered-cubic (fcc) anion lattice with O2���and 
F���disorder, and a fcc cation lattice with Li+, Mn3+, and Ti4+ 
disorder. The ternary cation and binary anion disorder renders 
the conf i guration space large enough to exhibit cluster expan- 
sion complexities but still manageable to allow an eff i cient 
exploration of the methodology covered. 
II. THE CLUSTER EXPANSION METHOD 
A. Mathematical formalism 
We start by giving an exposition of the mathematical for- 
malism of the cluster expansion method. In its full generality, 
the CE method can be used to represent any scalar, vector, 
or tensor material property as a function of conf i guration 
[33���35]. We limit our exposition to only scalar properties��� 
specif i cally formation energies of materials systems. 
The specif i c conf i guration of a crystalline system can be 
captured by encoding the occupancy of each site in a multi- 
component crystal structure using an occupancy string, 
�� = (��1,��2,��3,...),(1) 
where each element of the occupancy string ��i��� ?iis 
an 
element of a site space ?iassociated with a particular crys- 
tallographic site. In the present case, ?irepresents the set of 
allowed species on the ith site [36]. In a CE, the site spaces 
associated with each site are usually not unique, and only a 
few distinct site spaces are needed to represent the conf i gura- 
tion space of a real material; for example, ionic materials will 
commonly have a site space for cation sites and a site space 
for anion sites. 
More formally, the occupancy string is an element of the 
product space of all included site spaces in the fully disor- 
dered structure. The product of site spaces in its most general 
form is given by �� ��� ?1�� ?2�� ?3�� ������ = ?.(2) 
The expression in Eq. (2) of the conf i guration space is 
universal. Equation (2) includes single lattice structures, such 
as simple alloys where all site spaces ?i= ? are the same, 
as well as ionic structures where more than one unique site 
space must be used to represent the conf i guration space. All 
sites with the same associated site spaces are said to belong 
to the same sublattice [37]. Specif i cally, the CE for an ionic 
system with more than a single sublattice was referred to as 
a coupled cluster expansion in its original development [7]. 
This scenario can be explicitly expressed by grouping equal 
site spaces (i.e., those corresponding to distinct anion and 
cation sublattices). For example, for an ionic system with one anion and one cation sublattice, the conf i guration space can 
be expressed as ? = (��i���A?i) �� (��i���C?i) 
= ?NA 
A �� ?NC 
C = ?A�� ?C,(3) 
where A andC denote the sites in the anion and cation sublat- 
tices, respectively, and NAand NCrefer to the number of anion 
and cation sites in their respective sublattices. 
The conf i guration space in Eq. (2) can be formally repre- 
sented as a hypergrid. Figure 1(a) shows the conf i guration 
space for a hypothetical i nite three-site structure with two 
ternary sites (A1, A2) and one binary site (B). The conf i g- 
uration space is depicted as the representative disordered 
structure and the corresponding three-dimensional conf i gu- 
ration grid. Increasing the number of allowed species at a 
site translates to adding vertices to the hypergrid along the 
corresponding dimension. And adding more sites to the struc- 
ture increases the dimension of the hypergrid, since the 
dimension of the conf i guration space is equal to the number 
of sites in the given system. For a structure with N sites 
the conf i guration space corresponds to a hypergrid in N di- 
mensions. Figure 1(b) shows the conf i guration space for a 
rocksalt system as its underlying disordered crystal structure. 
Figure 1(b) also shows four conf i gurations for a supercell of 
32 sites, which could be represented as particular vertices in a 
32-dimensional hypergrid. 
The CE method in its most general form is used to repre- 
sent functions H(��) over the conf i guration space (hypergrid) 
? in Eq. (2), H : ? ��� R.(4) 
The codomain of H in Eq. (4) does not need to be 
R. In fact, as mentioned previously, CE models have been

used to represent vector and tensor properties of materials 
[33���35,38,39]. 
Furthermore, since the CE method is used to study crys- 
talline materials, the method by construction ensures that the 
functions represented are invariant to symmetry operations of 
the underlying disordered structure, 
H(T��(��)) = H(��),(5) 
where T��is a symmetry operation of the underlying disor- 
dered structure, which is formally represented as permutations 
of the elements of the conf i guration string ��. 
In the following sections, we present the formalism and 
details involved in constructing the basis functions necessary 
to represent the functions in Eq. (4) that satisfy the necessary 
symmetry invariance.

The paper titled "Cluster expansions of multicomponent ionic materials: Formalism and methodology" by Luis Barroso-Luque et al. discusses the mathematical formalism of the cluster expansion (CE) method and its application to multicomponent ionic materials. The CE method is used to represent coarse-grained material properties based on the configurations of species in a crystal structure.
The authors begin by highlighting the challenges of learning CE models for complex multicomponent ionic materials, which differ from metallic alloys. They specifically mention the need to satisfy charge neutrality constraints and describe long-range electrostatic interactions. They also emphasize the importance of correctly assigning oxidation states to transition metal species with multiple oxidation states.
The paper presents a reformulation of the mathematical formalism of the CE method, focusing on scalar properties such as formation energies. The conf i guration of a crystalline system is represented using occupancy strings that encode the occupancy of each site in the crystal structure. The conf i guration space is a product space of site spaces associated with each site, and different sublattices may have distinct site spaces.
The authors describe the conf i guration space as a hypergrid, illustrating its dimensionality and the increase in dimensionality with the number of allowed species and sites. They also discuss the representation of functions H(��) over the conf i guration space, where H can represent scalar, vector, or tensor properties of materials. The CE method ensures that the represented functions are invariant to symmetry operations of the crystal structure.
The paper then proceeds to discuss the construction of basis functions for representing the functions H(��) with symmetry invariance. The basis functions capture the correlation between different clusters of sites and are used to expand the functions over the conf i guration space. The authors emphasize the importance of sparsity in the CE models, as the growth in the number of expansion basis functions and training structures presents practical challenges.
In the later sections of the paper, the authors describe various methodologies necessary for implementing the CE method in the study of multicomponent ionic materials. These methodologies include oxidation state assignment, structure mapping, training structure sampling, and regression models. The authors provide examples and results using a LiMnO2-Li2TiO3-LiF disordered rocksalt material to illustrate the application of these methodologies.
Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive overview of the formalism and methodology of the CE method for multicomponent ionic materials. It addresses the challenges specific to ionic systems, such as maintaining charge neutrality and incorporating long-range electrostatic interactions. The presented methodologies offer practical solutions for implementing the CE method and obtaining accurate and sparse CE models for complex ionic materials.

CONCLUSION 
We have given a revised and extended presentation of 
the mathematical formalism of the CE [4] method integrated 
with the extension to multiple sublattice systems [7]. We 
have further described the formal implications of using the 
formalism for conf i guration spaces with charge-neutrality 
constraints, particularly those with heterovalent cations and 
anions. Charge-neutrality constraints give rise to the linear 
dependencies between correlation functions which essentially 
render the full set of CE correlation functions overcomplete 
for the space over charge-neutral conf i gurations. We also 
showed how including an explicit point electrostatic term 
effectively captures long-range electrostatic interactions al- 
lowing correlation functions with short associated cluster 
diameters to capture short-range interactions more effectively 
[45,52]. 
In addition, we provided a cohesive overview of data 
preparation methodology and regression algorithms that are 
useful to successfully i t CEs of complex multicomponent 
ionic materials. In particular, we explicitly addressed some of 
the differences and nuances of applying structure sampling 
and structure mapping to complex ionic systems���which 
have been largely unaddressed in the literature. We also

which as a convex problem scales more favorably to larger

where all ECIs for correlation functions that act over the same 
clusters of sites are penalized together. This form of structured 
sparsity has also been shown to give accurate and highly

This work is an exposition of the formalism of the cluster 
expansion with a focus on the nuances of its application to 
ionic systems. Similarly, the work provides an overview of 
state-of-the-art methodology for constructing CE models of

of the explosion of machine learning interatomic potentials, 
the CE method remains a critical tool for the study of atomic 
conf i guration phenomena due its simplicity and amenability 
to MC sampling. Further development of advanced structure 
sampling and i tting techniques in the CE method beyond 
those discussed here is imperative to permit its success- 
ful use in the computational study of multicomponent ionic 
materials.

Apologies for the confusion. It seems there might be some confusion or mixing up of topics. I don't recall discussing the topics of "SELF-GUIDED NOISE-FREE DATA GENERATION FOR EFFICIENT ZERO-SHOT LEARNING" or "Iterative Problem-Solving Process" in our conversation.
Regarding the second part of your statement, it appears to be unrelated to the previous topics we discussed. It seems to refer to the concept of grounded policies in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Grounded policies are policies that condition on action-observation histories rather than the full system state. They are useful in situations where the full state is not directly observable but can be inferred from past actions and observations.

Title: Thoughts on the Predicting and Reflecting Framework for Dual Process Theory of Reasoning and LLMs
Introduction:
In recent years, the fields of computational methods, machine learning, and cognitive science have witnessed significant advancements that have revolutionized our understanding of complex problem-solving, reasoning, and decision-making processes. Within this interdisciplinary landscape, two prominent areas of research have emerged: the predicting and reflecting framework for dual process theory of reasoning and the application of Large Pre-trained Language Models (LLMs). The integration of these two fields presents a compelling avenue for exploring the capabilities and limitations of computational models in simulating and augmenting human cognitive processes.
The predicting and reflecting framework is rooted in the influential dual process theory of reasoning, which posits that human reasoning involves both intuitive, automatic processes (System 1) and deliberate, controlled processes (System 2). By leveraging computational methods and machine learning techniques, researchers have made significant strides in developing models that can predict human reasoning outcomes based on large-scale datasets. These predictive models provide valuable insights into cognitive mechanisms and have proven effective in a wide range of domains, from cognitive psychology to decision science.
Simultaneously, the rise of Large Pre-trained Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and BERT, has brought about remarkable advancements in natural language processing and understanding. LLMs have been extensively trained on vast amounts of textual data and can generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses to a wide range of language-based tasks. Their performance in zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks, along with their ability to generalize to new tasks and domains, has opened up new possibilities for language-based AI applications.
This essay aims to explore the intersection of the predicting and reflecting framework for dual process theory of reasoning and LLMs, delving into the potential synergies and implications of their integration. We will delve into the ways in which computational methods and machine learning techniques can inform our understanding of human cognitive processes, while also examining the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in simulating and augmenting human-like reasoning abilities. Additionally, we will explore the implications of this integration for fields such as cognitive science, decision-making, and artificial intelligence.
Throughout this essay, we will analyze and synthesize findings from a collection of research articles that address topics ranging from cluster expansions of multicomponent materials and Monte-Carlo simulation methods to improving the adversarial robustness of deep models and optimizing policies in partially observable Markov decision processes. By examining these diverse topics, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the broader landscape in which the predicting and reflecting framework and LLMs operate.
In conclusion, the integration of the predicting and reflecting framework for dual process theory of reasoning and LLMs presents an intriguing opportunity to bridge the gap between computational models and human cognition. This interdisciplinary approach holds great promise for advancing our understanding of complex problem-solving, decision-making, and natural language processing. By examining the connections and implications of these fields, we can foster new insights and pave the way for future research and applications in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and beyond.

Abstract 
Dual Process Theory has increasingly gained fame as a framework for explaining evidence in reasoning and decision making tasks. This theory proposes there must be a sharp distinction in thinking to explain two clusters of correlational features. One cluster describes a fast and intuitive process (Type 1), while the other describes a slow andreflective one (Type 2), (see Evans, 2008; Evans & Stanovich, 2013; Kahneman, 2011). However, as Samuels (2009) has noted, there is a problem of determining why these group of features form clusters, more than what the labels Type (or system) 1 and 2 can capture, the unity problem. We understand there might be differences in the processingarchitecture that grounds each type of process, thus requiring distinct cognitive frameworks for each. We argue that the predictive processing approach (as held by Hohwy, 2013 and Clark, 2016) is a more suitable framework for Type 1 processing. Such an approach proposes cognition is in the job of attempting to predict what will perturb sensory inputs next. These are not personal predictions but rather multiple sub-personalpredictions that even the visual system makes at various layers at each millisecond that passes. Rather than being based on a symbolic representation of each aspect of the world, these predictions are made on the basis of statistical information updated moment by moment. This statistical content tracks previous sensory states and the causes of theseprevious sensory states. Kahneman (2011) has been arguing that there is a link between perception and Type 1 processing. What we hold is that such link obtains because Type 1 judgments actually are predictions stemming from higher layers of perceptual systems which work by means of predictive processing. On the other hand, we propose sucharchitecture does not handle Type 2 processes. Rather, these seem to be based on classical symbol systems executing heuristic search as explained by Newell (1980). In conclusion, we propose a dual framework is necessary for explaining why there are two clusters of features. Such a framework would include predictive processing for explaining Type 1processing and computations on symbolic representations for Type 2 processing

Title: Predicting and Reflecting: A Dual Framework for Dual Process Theory
Abstract:
Dual Process Theory has emerged as a prominent framework for understanding reasoning and decision-making processes. This theory posits that there are two distinct clusters of cognitive features: one characterized by fast and intuitive processing (Type 1), and the other characterized by slow and reflective processing (Type 2). While this theory provides a useful distinction, it raises the question of why these features form distinct clusters, leading to the unity problem. In this article, we propose a dual framework that integrates the predictive processing approach for Type 1 processing and symbolic representations for Type 2 processing.
The predictive processing approach, rooted in the work of Hohwy and Clark, suggests that cognition operates by constantly attempting to predict incoming sensory inputs. These predictions are not personal but rather sub-personal, made at various layers of the perceptual system based on statistical information and updated in real-time. This approach aligns with the link proposed by Kahneman between perception and Type 1 processing, as Type 1 judgments can be seen as predictions stemming from higher layers of the perceptual system.
In contrast, Type 2 processes appear to rely on classical symbol systems and heuristic search, as explained by Newell. These processes involve computations on symbolic representations and deliberate, controlled reasoning.
We argue that a dual framework is necessary to explain the existence of two distinct clusters of features. Such a framework would involve predictive processing to account for Type 1 processing, which operates through sub-personal predictions based on statistical information. Meanwhile, Type 2 processing relies on symbolic representations and heuristic search.
By integrating the predictive processing approach and symbolic representations, this dual framework provides a more comprehensive understanding of the cognitive processes underlying reasoning and decision-making. It sheds light on the mechanisms that drive both fast and intuitive processing and slow and reflective processing, bridging the gap between predictive and reflective cognitive operations.
In conclusion, the predicting and reflecting framework offers a novel perspective on dual process theory, providing insights into the cognitive mechanisms at play in different types of processing. This framework has the potential to advance our understanding of human cognition and inform future research in fields such as psychology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.

Introduction 
This introduction is twofold. The first part presents an outline of how the thesis will look 
like, introducing problems, our line of argument and hypotheses while providing a first inspection 
into each of the chapters. The second part presents an introduction to the Fodorian architecture of 
the mind which will serve as our theoretical starting point. 
I Problems, line of argument and hypotheses 
When solving math problems, it is interesting to note how some calculations, such as 
���2+2���, almost seem to carry with it its own answer. Thus, when we hear or read such calculation, 
the number four rushes to mind inevitably. This observation is at odds with other calculations such 
as ���74-37��� which are also simple but no answer comes along. One applies a few mental steps in 
order to reach the answer, it is easy, but the answer does not come to mind as one reads or hears 
the numbers. Regardless of what the characteristics of the numbers are which evokes this difference 
in thought, it is notable that there seems to be a difference between springing to mind inevitably 
and applying mental steps. 
This sort of observation has led psychologists working under reasoning, judgment and 
decision making to suppose there are two sorts of processing in thinking which are responsible in 
one side for faster and effortless judgments and on the other side slower and effortful reasoning. 
Of course, the evidence for a distinction in two types of processing is not limited to such 
simple observation but rather has appeared repeatedly since the 60s when (mainly) the tradition 
known as heuristics and biases started studying human reasoning, judgment and decision making 
by crafting tasks in which conflicting responses were common. In Chapter one���Research in 
Reasoning and Rationality���we will then review some of the most famous tasks in such tradition 
along with possible interpretations given to the results. Including heuristics, evolutionary 
psychology, pragmatics and dual process theories. 
Dual process theories also are not limited to such simple theorizing and characterizations 
as we introduced. Thus in Chapter two���Basic Dual Process Theory���we work on fundamental 
2 
theoretical questions1 that have been raised for dual process theories, including: if dual process 
theories can be seen as a complete theory of cognition or only of reasoning; what features 
characterizes each type of processing and which are defining; how one process communicates with 
the other and even if there are different processes at all or if distinct features points to dual systems, 
dual minds or dual modes (the reference problem). 
Samuels (2009) notes that even if one considers the evidence to be convincing and the 
dichotomy of processes (termed Type 1 and Type 2) and their property clusters (termed S1 and S2) 
well placed, we still have a basic research question open, which he calls the unity problem: 
"though positing mechanisms is a standard strategy for explaining the existence of property clusters, 
it does not, by itself, constitute a satisfactory explanation. Rather one needs to specify those features 
of the proposed mechanisms that account for such clustering effects. In the present case, we need to 
specify those characteristics of type-1 systems that yield S1-exhibiting processes, and those 
properties of type-2 systems that yield S2-exhibit-ing processes. Again, this does not strike me as a 
serious objection so much as a challenge for future research���one that requires a more detailed 
account of the systems responsible for type-1 and type-2 processes." (Samuels, 2009, p.141).

Introduction:
The study of human cognition and decision-making has long been a topic of interest in psychology. One intriguing phenomenon observed in these processes is the distinction between fast and intuitive judgments and slow and reflective reasoning. This distinction has led to the development of dual process theories, which propose that there are two distinct types of cognitive processes at work in human thinking.
In this essay, we will explore the concept of dual process theory and its implications for understanding human cognition. Our goal is to present a dual framework that integrates different theoretical perspectives and provides a comprehensive explanation for the observed differences in cognitive processing.
The first part of the introduction outlines the structure of the essay and introduces the main problems, line of argument, and hypotheses that will be addressed. We will examine various tasks and experiments from the field of reasoning, judgment, and decision-making, and explore different interpretations and theories, including heuristics, evolutionary psychology, pragmatics, and dual process theories. This exploration will be presented in Chapter one - Research in Reasoning and Rationality.
Moving on to Chapter two - Basic Dual Process Theory, we will delve into fundamental theoretical questions related to dual process theories. We will explore whether dual process theories provide a complete theory of cognition or if they are specific to reasoning processes. Additionally, we will examine the defining features of each type of processing and investigate how these processes communicate with each other. We will also address the question of whether dual process theories imply the existence of separate systems, minds, or modes of cognition.
However, despite the progress made in dual process theories, there remains an open research question known as the unity problem. This problem, as highlighted by Samuels (2009), calls for a more detailed account of the characteristics of the systems responsible for Type 1 and Type 2 processes. It challenges researchers to specify the features of Type 1 systems that give rise to processes exhibiting the characteristics of Type 1 (termed S1), as well as the properties of Type 2 systems that yield processes exhibiting the characteristics of Type 2 (termed S2).
In conclusion, this essay aims to provide a comprehensive examination of dual process theory and its implications for understanding human cognition. By exploring various theoretical perspectives and addressing the unity problem, we hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying different types of cognitive processing. Through this dual framework, we aim to bridge the gap between fast and intuitive judgments and slow and reflective reasoning, shedding light on the complexities of human thought processes.

The unity problem is distinct from the reference problem. The reference problem is the 
problem of determining what these property clusters refer to in the mind, to which a possible answer 
would simply be ���distinct systems���, for instance. The unity problem asks: even supposing there 
really are two main systems responsible for the way we reason, what are the characteristics of these 
systems that explain why they exhibit these distinct features, rationalities and responses? What 
kind of systems are these that explain why they bind these group of properties together? 
The unity problem guides our endeavors as we strive to explain what is underlying our 
mental architecture that is responsible for computational differences which result in the cognitive 
and behavioural effects observed by dual process theorists. 
Fodor (1983) shares a similar duality of mind, which will be our starting point in the next 
part of this introduction. He argues the mind can be divided into modular input systems (or vertical 
faculties more generally) and domain-general central systems (or horizontal faculties). Following 
the frame problem2, Fodor (1983, 1987, 2001), one of the philosopher most responsible for

developing the computational theory of mind in the first place, dismissed it as a complete picture 
of mind. He detects the problem originates because such theory cannot apply to central systems��� 
which in his descriptions are abductive, based on semantics, and open to any aspect of the person���s 
whole web of belief���but only to input systems which proceed syntactically and are 
informationally encapsulated. 
One of the intuitions3 that started our project is that Fodor (2001) diagnosed this inversely. 
We think rather that it is his characterization of input systems (inflexible) that renders central 
systems obsolete. If there is something like central systems in our cognition any sort of input to it 
must already be contextualized and relevant before even reaching it. We are with Fodor���s starting 
chapters (in 1975) where he started to propose the language of thought as means of explaining our 
psychology of propositional attitudes for decision and choice. This is the main role for classical 
architectures in our proposal and not its application to input and perception (like in Fodor, 1983). 
We hold that what he characterized as input systems is better understood under a 
Hierarchical Bidirectional Predictive Processing (HBPP) framework as proposed by Friston (2003, 
2005, 2008, 2010), Hohwy (2013) and Clark (2016), which is also a computational theory of mind, 
but not the computational theory of mind of Fodor. The predictive processing account unifies 
aspects of different models (such as predictive coding, emulation theory, active inference) about a 
very similar story. Such story suggests the brain should be thought of as in a restless, active cycle 
of predicting what will perturb it in a proximal and distal future. Instead of being understood as 
reading input from the world, the predictive brain story suggests the brain uses statistics to 
anticipate input before they even arrive. These predictions are based on expectations (or a statistical 
generative model) which foresees the most likely outcome of stimuli and events and takes a bet 
that thus and so will obtain. By keeping and polishing expectations, the brain can poise itself ahead 
of the game when it comes to dealing with the world. 
These models suggest the brain is formed by a hierarchy of processing (comprising higher 
and lower levels) where multiple layers of neurons are organized to compose a network with two 
major streams of information flow. The top-down flow is understood as conveying multiple

Introduction:
In the study of human cognition, the distinction between fast and intuitive judgments and slow and reflective reasoning has led to the development of dual process theories. These theories propose that there are two distinct types of cognitive processes at work in human thinking. However, the existence of these two types of processes raises the question of what underlying mental architecture binds the distinct features, rationalities, and responses exhibited by each process. This question is known as the unity problem.
The unity problem drives our efforts to understand the computational differences underlying the observed cognitive and behavioral effects in dual process theories. To explore this problem, we turn to the work of Fodor (1983) and his concept of modular input systems and domain-general central systems. Fodor's distinction between these vertical and horizontal faculties provides a starting point for our theoretical framework.
However, we challenge Fodor's characterization of input systems as inflexible and argue that it is this characterization that renders central systems obsolete. We propose that if there are central systems in our cognition, any input to these systems must already be contextualized and relevant before reaching them. Our approach aligns with Fodor's early work on the language of thought, specifically in explaining the psychology of propositional attitudes for decision-making and choice.
To further develop our theoretical framework, we adopt the Hierarchical Bidirectional Predictive Processing (HBPP) framework proposed by Friston, Hohwy, and Clark. This computational theory of mind posits that the brain is constantly engaged in predicting and anticipating future stimuli and events. Rather than passively receiving input from the world, the brain uses statistics and expectations to generate predictions about what will perturb it in the proximal and distal future. By maintaining and refining these expectations, the brain can effectively interact with the world.
The HBPP framework suggests that the brain operates through a hierarchical structure with multiple levels of processing and two major streams of information flow: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down flow involves the transmission of predictions and expectations from higher levels to lower levels, while the bottom-up flow involves the processing of incoming sensory information. This hierarchical organization enables the brain to anticipate and adapt to the environment.
In this essay, we will explore how the HBPP framework provides insights into the underlying mental architecture responsible for the computational differences observed in dual process theories. By considering the interplay between predictive processing and hierarchical organization, we aim to address the unity problem and gain a deeper understanding of the distinct cognitive processes and their properties.

We are reviewing an actual article now, just give a summary: We understand this thesis can answer the unity problem by explaining how computational 
differences in mechanisms used in each type of process make these property clusters come about. 
Thus, what explains S1 properties are the powers and limitations of predictive processing. On the 
other hand, what explains the S2 cluster is the powers and limitations of classical architectures. 
Simply exposed, these are the main problems, our line of argument and hypotheses that this 
thesis follows5. 
II The Fodorian architecture as a starting point 
We have now presented the path taken by thesis and the first step is to introduce the 
Fodorian architecture of mind. The Fodorian architecture is actually a dual process theory in its 
own, and one that is supposed to apply to all functions of the mind. The duality proposed by Fodor 
(1983) is one of input systems and general systems. What is interesting about this proposal is that 
it is very detailed and specific. Thus, Fodor (1983) lists very rigid criteria to explain each system. 
It is not exaggerated to say that any dual process theory in cognitive science was at least partially 
influenced by this proposal. 
Fodor (1983) enumerates a few features which input systems are likely to have. He argues 
input systems are domain specific, that is, they respond to stimuli in one specific type of domain 
and ignore other modalities. Now, Fodor���s domain-specificity is strong. That is because a domain 
specific system in his view is not that which deals with specific kinds of input, it must deal with 
only such inputs and must be specifically structured as to account for such input, rendering it blind 
to other domains. The property he mentions as one that helps identify domain-specificity is 
handling eccentric stimuli domains. These are domains that need specific handling and that differ 
from more general and usual tasks of the mind. For instance, a usual task is categorizing items 
according to their class, but to understand sentences one cannot classify tokens of language 
sentences, it is probable that some specific biases are necessary in order to constrain human 
5 The reader is advised to return to this short explanation of the path of the thesis if at any moment he feels 
lost.

sentences understanding as Chomsky (1975) has noted. Thus, so the argument goes, language 
might need domain-specific modules that recognize important characteristics that makes it unique. 
The second characteristic is that input systems are mandatory, they are obligatorily applied 
when they encounter their domain stimuli. Another example from language is that one cannot hear 
language as noise even if she tries. Also, Fodor argues there are few ways in which perception 
captures the world. In contrast, central processes are flexible and allow for a nearly unlimited 
amount of thoughts about the same object. 
A third characteristic is that central processes (or at least conscious reports), have limited 
access to intermediate levels of inputs systems processing. That is, people have little or no 
conscious access and thus cannot report on how input systems might get the details of processing. 
That is why people have no intuitions about how the brain treats visual images. In contrast, the 
final consequences of input processing are perfectly understandable and reportable. 
Input systems are fast and faster than thoughtful processes. This is a strange phenomenon 
since the sort of computations required to process the perceptual stimuli seem to be complex but 
input systems get them done in fractions of seconds. As Fodor (1983, p.63) puts is: ���[...] the puzzle 
about input analysis is precisely that the computational complexity of the problem to be solved 
doesn't seem to predict the difficulty of solving it; or, rather, if it does, the difference between a

Summary:
This article aims to address the unity problem in dual process theories by explaining how computational differences in mechanisms used in each type of process give rise to the observed property clusters. The thesis argues that the powers and limitations of predictive processing explain the S1 properties, while the powers and limitations of classical architectures explain the S2 cluster.
The article begins by introducing the Fodorian architecture of mind, which is a dual process theory that applies to all functions of the mind. Fodor's architecture proposes a duality between input systems and general systems. Input systems are characterized by domain specificity, obligatoriness, limited access to intermediate levels of processing, and fast computation. In contrast, general systems are flexible, allow for unlimited thoughts about the same object, and have access to the final consequences of input processing.
The thesis builds on Fodor's ideas by incorporating the concept of predictive processing, which suggests that the brain is constantly engaged in predicting and anticipating future stimuli and events. Predictive processing accounts for the S1 properties, as it relies on statistical generative models and anticipates sensory input before it arrives. On the other hand, classical architectures explain the S2 cluster, as they involve symbolic representations and heuristic search processes.
By combining Fodor's architecture with predictive processing and classical architectures, the article proposes a dual framework that can explain the distinct features observed in dual process theories. This framework provides insights into the computational differences underlying the cognitive and behavioral effects associated with each type of process.
Overall, the article seeks to contribute to the understanding of the unity problem by examining the underlying mental architecture responsible for the computational differences between S1 and S2 processes.

A key feature of the Fodorian architecture is that input systems are informationally 
encapsulated. This means that there is a part of these systems which is blind to contextual 
information or knowledge information located elsewhere in cognition. Thus, there might be a 
module for color perception which does not take in suggestions from what subjects know about 
forests, that they are green. The famous case is the Muller-Lyer illusion, an illusion where two lines 
that are the same length look as if they are of different lengths. Measuring them and knowing that 
they are of different length does not help us see them as the same. Fodor (1983) argues some level 
of input analyzers are closed from other information in the system. He does concede that contextual 
information can bias perception, but he thinks this is because perception is not limited to input 
analyzers, so this bias can be applied by higher areas. Also, when it comes to priming language it 
7 
may be that lexical content is represented inside language analyzers, thus biases that come from 
related words may show up even if the system is blind to other contextual and knowledge 
information from the broader system. So there is a very specific sense in which information is 
encapsulated and it is not any sort of priming bias which can falsify Fodor���s requirements. As he 
puts it: ���[...] to demonstrate that sort of interaction between input analyses and 
background knowledge is not, in and of itself, tantamount to demonstrating the cognitive 
penetrability of the former; you need also to show that the locus of the top -down effect is 
internal to the input system. That is, you need to show that the information fed back 
interacts with interlevels of input-processing and not merely with the final results of such 
processing. The penetrability of a system is, by definition, its susceptibility to top-down 
effects at stages prior to its production of output.��� (FODOR, 1983, p.73). 
Interestingly, information encapsulation is, in the Fodorian architecture, the essential 
feature of input systems and also that which answers the unity problem in Fodor���s (1983) dual 
process theory. That is because other features can be explained as resulting from the suggestion 
that input systems are informationally encapsulated. This concept, however, does not work along 
with recent approaches in understanding modularity (see Anderson, 2014, Lupyan, 2015, Clark, 
2016) and even dual process theorists themselves have been skeptical (see Stanovich, 2004). 
However, by letting go of this essential concept in Fodor���s view, dual process theorists lose the 
answer to the unity problem and lack a philosophical base that guides theoretical coherence. This 
is the sort of base we attempt to provide for dual process theorists in this thesis. Although the focus 
is not in whether cognitive impenetrability has been demonstrated or not. 
Moving onto Fodor���s sixth feature we have that input systems have shallow outputs. 
Because input systems are said to be encapsulated, one can expect that their outputs will not be 
conceptually inflated. Thus, the output of a visual input system will not be theory-laden, that is, 
such output will not be in the form of ���photons��� for the physicist. Such conceptually inflated 
perception must be subsequent to input analyzers. Fodor (1983) explains in details what the output 
of such systems would be, he defines this class as basic categorization. Basic categorization is that 
which is in an intermediate level of categorization, that is, the output is not something like colors 
or shapes but a concept, although a concept in just the right level of abstraction. Thus, when one 
sees a dog, the basic categorization output is ���dog��� rather than features such as ���skinny old��� or more abstract categorizations such as ���mammal���. Fodor argues these basic categories are: more frequent 
in language use; are learned earlier; are the least abstract concept in the conceptual hierarchy it is 
placed; are used to teach children; will come faster to mind than other related concepts; are the 
favored ones when used to describe what we see or hear; appear to be phenomenologically salient 
and are concrete such that you could draw a dog but not draw something that is just an animal. 
Seventh is the proposal that input systems are associated with fixed neural structures. 
���Neural architecture, I'm suggesting, is the natural concomitant of informational encapsulation��� 
Fodor (1983, p.99). This seems to be a basic premise of neuropsychology, since for dissociations 
and double dissociations6 to occur there must be some sort of regional-functional mapping. As we 
will briefly mention in chapter four, however, there are various ways of understanding the relations 
of functional and regional mapping (see Anderson 2014, for differences in functional 
differentiation and specialization). The eighth feature is also very related to the neuropsychological 
discussion, that these input systems are subject to very specific breakdown patterns. This is the 
claim that input systems are more prone, in lesions, to exhibit isolated function deficiencies. Thus, 
various neuropsychological patients might have specific lesions in the visual system but Fodor 
(1983) believes it is harder to find isolated lesions of central processes. The ninth and last 
characteristic of input systems is that they seem to develop in various children in a similar pace 
and following an innate path, sometimes present in infants, such as in vision, and in other cases 
following orderly steps of development in children, such as in language. 
While the unity problem for input systems is solved by the postulation of information 
encapsulation, central systems are defined as global, in opposition to encapsulation. Such globality 
is better explained in terms of four very much related features described for central processes, 
namely, that central processes are domain general, horizontal, isotropic and Quinean. 
Central processes are believed to be isotropic because elements relevant for a given thought 
might be drawn from any belief web in the system. Thus, when we think about atoms, we might 
relate them to solar systems. Furthermore, we might have used vision to see the image of an atom 
6 These are the main successes of neuropsychology, where dissociation is when a lesion is found to disrupt function 
A but not B and double dissociation when another such lesion is found to disrupt B but not A. 
9 
in a paper and speak in words and sounds about solar system, thus these processes are domain 
general. That is, they can easily relate different modalities. 
Central processes are also understood as horizontal because the same sort of computations 
might be applied for any sort of task, they were not tailored for any sort of task as were input 
systems and so they apply the same sort of principles to solve various sorts of tasks. Finally, they 
are Quinean because the value of one thought depends on the value of various other related thoughts 
in the web of belief. In this sense, how we judge the worthiness of the thought that animals are 
important depends or our views on morality, biology, culture, social status and so forth. 
The two main features are that central processes are isotropic and Quinean and these are 
the ones that grant ���Fodor���s first law of the nonexistence of cognitive science���. This ���law��� states 
that the more processes are global, the less cognitive science will be able to understand them. In 
short, Fodor (1983, 2001) believes only encapsulated processes can be studied by cognitive science 
since the computational theory of mind cannot accommodate isotropic and Quinean features and 
the computational theory of mind, in his mind, is the only serious proposal cognitive science has.

Summary:
The Fodorian architecture of mind is characterized by a duality between input systems and general systems. Input systems are informationally encapsulated, meaning they are blind to contextual and knowledge information located elsewhere in cognition. This encapsulation allows input systems to be domain-specific, obligatorily applied, and have limited access to intermediate levels of processing. Input systems also have shallow outputs, producing basic categorizations rather than conceptually inflated perceptions. They are associated with fixed neural structures, subject to specific breakdown patterns, and develop in a similar pace in children.
On the other hand, central processes in the Fodorian architecture are domain general, horizontal, isotropic, and Quinean. They can draw elements from any belief web in the system, apply the same computations to various tasks, and their value depends on related thoughts in the web of belief.
The key features of information encapsulation and isotropy in central processes solve the unity problem in Fodor's dual process theory. However, recent approaches to modularity and skepticism among dual process theorists challenge the concept of information encapsulation. Without this essential concept, dual process theories lack a philosophical base and theoretical coherence.
Fodor argues that only encapsulated processes can be studied by cognitive science, as the computational theory of mind, which he considers the only serious proposal in cognitive science, cannot accommodate the isotropic and Quinean features of central processes.

This answer will go roughly like this: If there is any sense in which input systems transfer 
its properties to Type 1 features and central processes transfers to Type 2 features, what Fodor took 
as computationally encapsulated input systems can be better accounted as the working of 
contextualized predictive processing and what Fodor took to be global central processes are 
actually capacity limited, classic computational, propositional processes that depend on (relevant) 
content from the latter processes. The globality phenomenon is not as global as Fodor has described 
but rather content limited by statistical correlations of previous occurrences. 
We must, in advance, however, place an important caveat. We need to make it clear from 
start that, unlike Fodor, we will not propose a framework for the mind or any general solution to 
fundamental problems in cognitive science. What we propose is a framework for dual process 
theory of reasoning and decision making, and such is not a complete theory of the mind (and 
probably not even of reasoning). Thus, our proposal of an answer for the unity problem is for dual 
10 
process theory alone, it does not imply that the mind has a dual structure explained by a distinction 
between predictive and classical computations. In other words, we will not try to fix Fodor���s dual 
process theory, rather, we will try to help dual process theories of reasoning by giving them (what 
Fodor did not) an answer to the unity problem compatible with the realm of cognitive science.

Summary:
In contrast to Fodor's view, it is proposed that the properties of input systems can be better accounted for as contextualized predictive processing, while central processes can be understood as capacity-limited, classic computational, propositional processes that depend on relevant content from input systems. The globality phenomenon attributed to central processes is not as global as Fodor described, but rather content-limited by statistical correlations of previous occurrences.
However, it is important to note that this proposal does not attempt to provide a comprehensive framework for the mind or solve fundamental problems in cognitive science. It focuses specifically on dual process theory of reasoning and decision making, offering an answer to the unity problem within the context of cognitive science. The goal is to provide dual process theories with an answer that addresses the compatibility of the unity problem with cognitive science, rather than attempting to fix Fodor's dual process theory itself.

1 Research in Reasoning and Rationality 
In order to understand where dual process theories come from and how they are grounded 
on evidence of psychological tasks, in this chapter we will develop an analytic review of theories 
that attempt to account for empirical data on tasks of reasoning, judgment and decision making. 
We start by exposing the means by which we believe such theories should acknowledge evidence, 
and that is by accounting for data without the influence of evaluative normativism. Since rationality 
discussions have been developed in parallel, sometimes in confusion with, reasoning theories, we 
will also mention what sort of use we must make of rationality theories in reasoning. The 
experiments on reasoning, judgment and decision making are vast and hence we will concentrate 
in exposing three of the most famous tasks: the Wason selection task, the Linda conjunction 
problem, and the Harvard Medical School problem. Finally, we will review some of the most 
famous interpretations to these problems and theories developed for explaining them, by the 
heuristics and biases tradition, evolutionary psychologists, pragmatics and dual process theories. 
We agree, with what Samuels et al. (2002) has noted, that behind what seemed to be a polemic 
field, mostly because of what was termed ���the rationality wars���, a gathering consensus in theories 
of reasoning and decision making was in fact emerging. We propose to show that the current form 
of this consensus is best captured by dual process theories. 
1.1 Reasoning and rationality without evaluative normativism 
The most famous methodology for evaluating a cognitive function in psychology is using 
tests, which are designed in the form of tasks that should have correct and false answers. Depending 
on which answers are given, and by the variation of tasks, psychologists believe they can determine 
some of the structure of cognitive processes. For example, they may use digit span to determine 
how many digits one can hold in working memory, and which processes they can execute while 
holding this information. In such case, the digits are given and psychologists expect the subject to 
repeat the given digits as requested. This is a clear case where there is one correct answer (the 
correct digits) while any other digit sequence would be incorrect. If correct, then psychologists 
13 
infer that working memory was successful, while if incorrect they can determine that working 
memory failed, and possibly why. This is the basic model of psychological research of cognitive 
processes. When it comes to reasoning and decision making however, determining which should 
be the correct answer for some task is not so simple. 
Following Samuels' et al. (2004) classification, the reasoning and rationality agenda 
includes three projects. The descriptive7 project, in which scientists mean to discover how people 
actually reason and to describe the cognitive processes that underlie human reasoning as it is. In 
contrast to what is researched in logic, the descriptive project should have little interest in which 
are the most valid forms of reasoning, or how to optimize argumentation. Rather, the project means 
to discover exactly what is happening in one���s mind when he reasons in everyday situations or in 
laboratory tasks. The normative project has more of a philosophical aspect as it means to determine 
what it is to be rational. The goal of such project is to discuss on what grounds we should base our 
judgments of reasoning or rationality, to specify principles, standards and norms that people might 
follow in reason. Given such norms and principles, the evaluative project aims to empirically 
determine, on groups of people, which individual is reasoning correctly, or which is rational. Using 
tasks such as the descriptive project does and basing judgments on a norm from the normative

Summary:
In this chapter, the focus is on the research in reasoning and rationality, with an emphasis on understanding the consensus that has emerged in the field and how it aligns with dual process theories. The chapter begins by discussing the methodology used in evaluating cognitive functions, particularly through tests that have correct and false answers. However, when it comes to reasoning and decision making, determining the correct answer is not as straightforward.
The chapter explores three projects within the reasoning and rationality agenda: the descriptive project, which aims to discover how people actually reason and describe the cognitive processes involved; the normative project, which discusses the criteria for rationality and the principles that guide reasoning; and the evaluative project, which aims to empirically determine correct reasoning based on norms and principles.
The chapter also highlights the famous tasks of reasoning, including the Wason selection task, the Linda conjunction problem, and the Harvard Medical School problem. Various interpretations and theories, such as those from the heuristics and biases tradition, evolutionary psychologists, pragmatics, and dual process theories, are reviewed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the field.
Overall, the chapter presents the consensus that has been reached, suggesting that dual process theories best capture the current understanding of reasoning and decision making. The chapter sets the stage for further exploration and analysis of dual process theories in subsequent chapters.

independent abstractions are not always the ideal against which all cognitive success should be 
measured by. That the relative costs and benefits between being guided by relevance or abstracting 
away need to be taken in consideration. In a way he is also arguing against making an evaluative 
use of normativism for reasoning tasks. On the other hand, Sperber and Wilson (1995) really make 
a distinctive contribution, from the pragmatics camp, to descriptive theories of reasoning. 
1.3.4 The hidden emerging consensus 
The initial accepted understanding of the field was that the heuristics and biases and the 
evolutionary psychology ideas were really at odds with one another. However, Samuels et al. 
(2002) point out that behind the collection of rhetorical excesses of both traditions, a hidden 
consensus based on their real core claims was emerging. They argue that once one eliminates such 
rhetorical excesses on both sides, the challenge of evolutionary psychology is really no challenge 
at all. Moreover, that the claims of evolutionary psychology could not make sense if not by 
endorsing the core claims of heuristics and biases tradition. An example of a rhetorical excess of 
the heuristics and biases tradition is claiming our species is probability-blind. Whereas an excess 
by the evolutionary psychologists would be claiming that we have ���elegant mechanisms��� designed 
to solve our problems. 
39 
Possibly one of the main reasons for the apparent dispute has emerged from the different 
focus of theses research projects. While the heuristics and biases tradition has focused on finding 
experiments in which subjects do not accord to normativity and on explaining these ���failures���, 
evolutionary psychology has been concerned in showing the reasons behind our ���success��� in 
various tasks. 
Therefore, perhaps because of methodology, the heuristics and biases tradition were 
showing cases where our mechanisms do fail to accord to normativity. Evolutionary psychology 
must agree that these mechanisms do fail, in order to propose cases where they do not fail. Both 
traditions agree that we have mental processes built by evolution to solve adaptation problems and 
that when facing the problems of today, these mechanisms might fail in various tasks but succeed 
in many others. 
For instance, because of the evidence, heuristics and biases agree that frequency format or 
specific content will result in the success of participants because that is when these mechanisms 
are truly working. On the other hand, evolutionary psychology will also contend that in various 
cases people do not accord to normativity because the mechanisms are not designed to deal with 
such. It is important to notice that in both cases the total system will yield many mistakes although 
it will also result in correct answers. 
The heuristics and biases tradition also does seem to contend that the mind is composed of 
a group of different specialized mechanisms. Kahneman et al. (1982, p.88) compare problem 
solving "with the operation of a flexible computer program that incorporates a variety of potentially 
useful subroutines". They also argue that "the actual reasoning process is schema-bound or content- 
bound so that different operations or inferential rules are available in different contexts", and that 
"consequently, human reasoning cannot be adequately described in terms of content-independent 
formal rules." (Kahneman and Tversky 1982, p.499). 
The same can be found in the other way around, evolutionary psychologists (Cosmides and 
Tooby, 2001, p. 162) can also be found endorsing heuristics and biases claims: 
���A male robin red breast may not look particularly intelligent when overcoming 
obstacles to attack a tuft of red features; nor does a human male when he spends time 
looking for pornographic pictures rather than courting actual women [���] These 
mechanisms lead to such odd outcomes because there are things in the world other than 
rival robins and living women that satisfy the input conditions for the monitoring devices

Summary:
In this section, the hidden emerging consensus between the heuristics and biases tradition and evolutionary psychology is discussed. Initially, these two traditions were seen as being at odds with each other. However, Samuels et al. (2002) argue that beneath the rhetorical excesses of both traditions, there is a hidden consensus based on their core claims.
The heuristics and biases tradition focuses on experiments where individuals deviate from normative standards and aims to explain these deviations. On the other hand, evolutionary psychology seeks to understand the reasons behind our success in various tasks. Despite their different focuses, both traditions agree that we have mental processes shaped by evolution that may fail in certain tasks but succeed in others.
The heuristics and biases tradition acknowledges that mechanisms based on frequency format or specific content can lead to success, while evolutionary psychology argues that failures to conform to normativity occur because the mechanisms are not designed for those particular situations. Both traditions recognize that the overall system will result in both correct and incorrect answers.
Both traditions also agree that the mind is composed of specialized mechanisms. The heuristics and biases tradition views problem solving as a flexible computer program with various subroutines, while evolutionary psychologists endorse the idea that mechanisms may lead to odd outcomes due to the input conditions they monitor.
This hidden consensus suggests that there is common ground between the heuristics and biases tradition and evolutionary psychology, despite their apparent differences. By recognizing this consensus, researchers can move towards a more integrated understanding of reasoning and decision making.

employed by the computational systems that (respectively) regulate aggression in robins 
and courtship in humans���. 
These apparent differences come because of making an evaluative use of normativism, not 
because of major differences in descriptive theories. Piattelli-Palmarini (1994) even admits a 
subscription to the modularity of mind for reasoning tasks, but argues (p.2) that: 
���This cognitive unconscious is a trait that [...] may have saved our ancient 
ancestors from wild beasts and famine, but even granted that such a simpleminded 
Darwinism should have actually been at work in their creation, for a very long time these 
illusions have been no more than a burden. Darwinism or not, we should all learn how to 
protect ourselves, individually and collectively, from the effects of our cognitive 
subconscious���. 
Perhaps not so surprisingly, of the three points Samuels et al. (2002) point out as the real 
disputes between these traditions, two are problems that stem from making an evaluative use of 
normativity. 
The first is how to best apply probability in given tasks, which norm should be used in 
evaluating responses in specific probability tasks is not agreed on. However, if both agree that in 
some cases people fail to reason according to some norms and in others people do succeed, what 
difference does determining which is the best norm make for descriptive psychology? The answers 
to the problems stay the same regardless of the way you choose to evaluate correctness. Multiple 
normative standards can be used to understand what subjects were thinking. 
The second problem noted in using normativism in an evaluative fashion is even further 
away from the realms of descriptive theories, it is a real dispute about which the correct 
interpretation of probability theory is, a Bayesian version or a frequentist version. While this is a 
real dispute, it is not for psychology to determine. 
The third is a real descriptive theory incompatibility that points to others. Evolutionary 
psychology argues that their opponents propose limited explanations, they believe a better account 
of specific reasoning mechanisms need to be described, rather than just heuristics like 
representativeness or availability. In fact this seems like a good critique, but perhaps the main 
characteristic of heuristics and biases was in identifying the biases, not the reasons why. 
However, we believe this leads to some further different incompatibilities that add to what 
Samuels et al. (2002) pointed out. For instance, it is not convincing that proponents of heuristics 
and biases would buy the story of social contract theory. While heuristics and biases and 
41 
evolutionary psychology as general level frameworks do not differ too much, many differences 
might lie in specific theories for explaining specific phenomenon. However, these are differences 
that theorists in the same general framework tend to encounter and dispute over. It is a type of 
difference that Cosmides and Tooby could have with other evolutionary psychologists, not a core 
difference between traditions. 
It is also important to note that even though Piattelli-Palmarini did claim these heuristics 
were designed by natural selection, he was a critic of adaptationism. Recently, he (Fodor and 
Piattelli-Palmarini, 2010) even attacked the idea of natural selection directly. However, this should 
not count as differences from the two reasoning traditions since these recent ideas are not taken 
very seriously and have very few supporters, they are not tied the heuristics and biases tradition. 
This does not however, change the fact that as Samuels et al. (2002) pointed out, there is 
an emerging consensus on what these reasoning, judgment and decision making tasks tell us, 
namely that the mind is, in great part, sensitive to differences in type of input and that themes 
relevant to adaptation and social practice are favored over normativity. Mind mechanisms are 
efficient in dealing with what they are trained to work on, but might be responsible for unexpected 
answers in some tasks which are not in the form which they were designed to deal with. For these 
reasons, sometimes modal answers will accord to the expected normativity, while in others, other

Summary:
The apparent differences between the heuristics and biases tradition and evolutionary psychology stem from making an evaluative use of normativity. Piattelli-Palmarini argues that while the cognitive unconscious may have been beneficial in the past, it can be burdensome in modern times. However, these differences do not significantly impact descriptive theories of reasoning and decision making.
One disagreement concerns the application of probability and which norm should be used to evaluate responses. However, the core understanding remains the same: people succeed in some cases and fail in others, regardless of the specific normative standard used.
Another disagreement revolves around the interpretation of probability theory, whether Bayesian or frequentist. This is a real dispute, but it is not the role of psychology to determine the correct interpretation.
While there may be differences in specific theories within each framework, such as heuristics and biases or evolutionary psychology, these are disputes that arise within the same general framework and do not represent core differences between traditions.
The emerging consensus is that the mind is sensitive to different types of input and favors themes relevant to adaptation and social practice over normativity. Mind mechanisms are efficient in dealing with what they are designed for but may yield unexpected answers in tasks that do not align with their specific design. As a result, modal answers may align with expected normativity in some cases, while in others, alternative explanations may be more prevalent.

3 Intuitive Predictions 
From here on, our efforts will be focused on elaborating a framework, a broader story of 
the mechanisms that explain why there are Type 1 and Type 2 processes. Thus, we will present an 
answer to the unity problem as proposed by Samuels (2009). Fundamentally, we will propose that 
what distinguishes these two type of processes is that they are based on intrinsically different 
computational principles. The computational principles which underlie the features of Type 1 
processing is predictive processing. While the computational principles that underlie Type 2 
processing is classical symbolic processing. Therefore, rather than attempting to add new features 
to DPT (a burden that is laid mostly on empirical professionals), the job of this philosophical work 
is to provide an explanatory framework for each type of process, further developing on why they 
need to be seen as distinct, thus providing a richer story of how thinking works. 
We will start by reviewing what predictive processing models are like (section 3.1), then 
we will make progress towards our goal by showing how predictive processing accounts for Type 
1 features (section 3.2). Finally, we will proceed to show how predictive processing cannot account 
for Type 2 processes (section 3.3). 
3.1 Predictive Processing 
Marr (1982) and Gibson (1979) were researchers of very different views, but their 
endeavors shared at least one similarity. Although their work had the study of perception as a 
primary focus (mostly concentrated on vision) they also incited broader approaches of how to 
understand the mind. Marr (1982) understood the mind as a system that reads input from external 
stimuli in order to construct a rich inner representation of various aspects of the world. His model 
emphasized a bottom-up flow of information to communicate feature detection which culminated 
in higher representations. Gibson (1979) proposed there was no sense in reconstructing the world 
and rather that animals (human and non-human) pick up information directly from the environment 
for action, although the internal mechanisms for this was not much explored. 
107 
Predictive processing, as Clark (2013a, 2016) reads it, proposes a new shift to these 
approaches which also ends up generating a possibility for a broader framework to understand the 
mind. Predictive processing is a term that groups a strand of similar models developed by 
computational neuroscientists. The specific formulation of most interest to us is Hierarchical and 
Bidirectional Predictive Processing (HBPP) (Friston, 2003, 2005, 2008; Hohwy, 2013). 
This mathematically formulated model proposes a form of processing where multiple layers 
of neurons are organized hierarchically (comprising higher and lower levels) that form a network 
with two major streams of information flow. The top-down flow is understood as conveying 
multiple predictions, each higher layer attempts to predict the workings of the one underneath it. 
The bottom-up flow conveys error correction on previously made predictions to each higher layer. 
Thus, despite having emphasis on top-down processing, the model proposes a bidirectional flow 
of information processing where the forward and backward flow bare unique and specified 
functions. 
The upshot of such model is that the mind, instead of just capturing information from the 
world for action or representing the world in order to plan, is actually in the job of attempting to 
predict what will perturb it next. For an illustration, consider a person that is surprised by the 
absence of coffee of the table. That person���s surprise is not caused by a perceived object but rather 
by a failure of prediction. His cognitive systems predicted coffee would be on the table, but no

Summary:
In this section, the focus is on predictive processing and its role in explaining Type 1 processes. Predictive processing models propose a new approach to understanding the mind and offer a broader framework for thinking. The specific model of interest is Hierarchical and Bidirectional Predictive Processing (HBPP), which suggests that the mind operates through multiple hierarchical layers of neurons with two streams of information flow: top-down predictions and bottom-up error correction.
The key idea of predictive processing is that the mind is engaged in predicting future events rather than simply perceiving or representing the world. Instead of perceiving an object, for example, a person's surprise is caused by a failure of prediction. The mind constantly generates predictions based on prior experiences and compares them to incoming sensory information, adjusting its predictions through error correction.
This section sets the stage for further exploration of how predictive processing accounts for Type 1 features but falls short in explaining Type 2 processes.

These are not necessarily personal predictions but rather multiple sub-personal predictions 
that even the visual system makes at various layers at each millisecond that passes. Rather than 
being based on a symbolic representation of each aspect of the world, these predictions are made 
on the basis of statistical information updated moment by moment. This statistical content is based 
on previous sensory states and the causes of these previous sensory states. This is possible since 
the system reads its own inner states and since it can establish causes60 by proximal occurrence. 
Very roughly, It predicts that its own inner structure will probably be in a state Y given that it is in 
state X and previously inner state X was mostly followed by state Y. 
60 Friston (2005, p.819) defines causes as ���quantities or states that are necessary to specify the products of a 
process generating sensory information���. 
108 
3.1.1 Generative models 
Predictions are made on the basis of generative models. These models are not a picture-like 
representation of the environment or even a symbolic model, they are encoded in the form of 
probability density functions. A probability density function is a function that describes the chances 
of a variable having a determinate value based on the chances of occurrence of a range of similar 
values. Therefore, it is implied by definition that there is nothing absolutely determinate in the way 
the model is sustained. For an illustration, consider how Clark (2016, p.41) explains the difference 
of such encoding from traditional symbolic representations with an example: 
���Instead of simply representing ���CAT ON MAT,��� the probabilistic Bayesian brain will 
encode a conditional probability density function, reflecting the relative probability of this 
state of affairs (and any somewhat-supported alternatives) given the available information. 
[...] At first, the system may avoid committing itself to any single interpretation, while 
confronting an initial flurry of error signals [...] This is typically followed by rapid 
convergence upon a dominant theme (CAT, MAT), with further details (STRIPEY MAT, 
TABBY CAT) subsequently negotiated.��� 
Each level uses generative models computing the given likelihood of events to generate 
predictions about the level underneath it. These predictions are constrained by ���priors���, which are 
previous probability distributions fixed before considering the evidence. The source of such 
previous probability distribution comes from previous learning which can range from evolutionary 
selection, developmental influences and other varying models at a higher level of the hierarchy. 
Whereas the idea of a prior is usually problematic for traditional Bayesian statisticians since it is 
hard to see what prior information we could have on data we study, in the case of predictive 
processing the idea of a prior fits naturally in the form of previous information the brain has 
gathered on some issue (following empirical Bayes, see Friston, 2003, 2005). 
One can notice that there is not one generative model for the whole brain at any given time 
or brain state because models are updated constantly and because each level holds (at a given time 
t) a unique model. This update is primarily possible because of the forward flow (bottom-up) which 
communicates prediction error. This is a very strong and interesting shift that the predictive 
processing approach suggests. It proposes that the forward flow consists not of all the features that 
were detected and would be passed onwards to higher levels but only the error necessary to correct

Summary:
Predictive processing operates on the basis of generative models, which are encoded as probability density functions rather than symbolic representations. These models describe the likelihood of events based on available information and previous learning. Predictions are generated at each level of the hierarchy, constrained by prior probability distributions. Priors represent previous information gathered by the brain, and their use aligns with the concept of empirical Bayes.
The brain constantly updates its generative models, and each level holds a unique model at a given time. This update is facilitated through the bottom-up flow of information, which communicates prediction errors. Rather than passing all detected features to higher levels, only the necessary error signals are transmitted for error correction.
This shift in perspective emphasizes the role of prediction and error correction in the mind's processing, highlighting the continuous updating and refinement of generative models.

and update models. Instead of conveying all information from the environment, rather it provides 
a natural funnel which guarantees processing economy by focusing on newsworthy information in 
the form of error correction. 
3.1.2 Prediction error 
Predictions flow downwards at each level and error correction flows upwards showing what 
exactly is faulty and needs to be corrected for future models. Therefore, lower levels will bring 
news flash since they detect the most recent error correction to propagate upwards, but the higher 
levels will have error correction coming from various other strands of the network. Thus, the higher 
layers will have models corrected from various sources and the lower levels will have tokens of 
newest corrections to be made, that is why at any given time there is not one generative model but 
various co-evolving models and also why there is a bidirectional flow of information. The upward 
flow has specific destinations while the downward flow has more ramification between areas, as 
found anatomically (see Friston, 2005). 
Prediction error is also related to an important concept in this approach which is that of 
surprisal. Predictions are based on models which are a form of sub-personal expectation. When 
these expectations are not met, prediction error flags them with surprisal. Therefore, the system 
with its two directions of flow is always attempting to find a match from higher61 expectations to 
the next information reported from the bottom. Surprisal occurs, therefore, when there is a 
mismatch between expectation and the information conveyed by error signaling. The goal of the 
system at every second is to minimize surprisal. To reach such goal it must constantly update its 
models in order to correspond to novelty. Having environmentally-tuned predictions enables the 
system to keep surprisal at the lowest level possible. 
61 higher here does not mean cognitive (philosophical ���cognitive���), or conscious; in examples of visual processing 
they are higher areas in the visual cortex itself. 
110 
3.1.3 Free energy 
One can have different ranges of mismatch, a minor mismatch might not alert the system 
in surprisal while major mismatches certainly will. To explain this variation (among other issues62) 
Friston (2010) formulated the free energy principle. Free energy is related to thermodynamics and 
information theory, but instead of entering in these more complex realms, let us understand the 
definition of free energy, in general, simply as energy that can be converted to work and as it is 
applied to predictive processing. So, according to Friston (2010), in Bayesian predictive 
processing: ���[...] free energy is63 just the difference between the models predictions and the 
sensations or representations that are predicted. Minimizing free energy then corresponds to 
explaining away prediction errors.��� Less free energy corresponds to having more stable models 
and less mismatch while having more free energy corresponds to requiring further processing64 to 
explain away higher rates of surprisal. Explaining away means hypothesizing distal causes that 
accommodate the error signal. 
The free energy principle states that ���all the quantities that can change; i.e. that are part of 
the system, will change to minimize free-energy.��� (Friston & Stephan, 2007, p.427). This 
characterizes cognition as a process of minimizing its free energy. This means that cognition will 
always attempt to explain away surprisal, always polishing its generative models. Clark (2013a) 
reads this relation to free energy as putting more of the system���s resources to effective work in

Summary:
Predictive processing involves the flow of predictions downward and error correction upward through hierarchical levels. Prediction error, which occurs when expectations are not met, is flagged with surprisal. The system aims to minimize surprisal by constantly updating its models to correspond to novelty. Free energy, a concept borrowed from thermodynamics and information theory, is used to explain the variation in the response to prediction errors. Minimizing free energy corresponds to explaining away prediction errors and maintaining stable models. The free energy principle states that cognition seeks to minimize its free energy by constantly refining its generative models. This allocation of resources ensures effective processing.

order to minimize surprisal. However, a caveat must be added. When free-energy is at minimum, 
when predictions are working correctly is when effort is also at minimum, little effort is needed to 
navigate in an easily predicted world. And ���using more of the systems resource��� is usually an 
expression related to effort. Perhaps a better way of reading what this means is that when the system 
knows what to do with incoming information, when entropy65 is low, that is, when prediction error 
is not too high, the systems will be put to effective work. However, when too much unexpected 
material follows from information, then systems will not know what to do with it, entropy will rise

and free energy (as energy that can be put to work) will accumulate, new strategies will be needed 
to use such free energy and to solve prediction error. Thus, it must be noted that effort is higher 
when entropy is higher, not when entropy is lower. Not that Clark necessarily claims anything 
different, but the way he mentioned the relation to free energy might make the concept of effort 
confusing. 
3.1.4 Precision 
An interesting philosophical moral of the predictive processing model is that ���What we 
perceive depends heavily upon the set of priors [...] that the brain brings to bear in its best attempt 
to predict the current sensory signal.��� (CLARK, 2013a, p.7). However, proponents of the model 
use the concept of precision to indicate that the system will not be doomed to be locked-in by its 
own expectations. That is because the value of bottom-up versus a top-down is decided in real- 
time. Responsible for the forward flow are error units, which are units specialized in error detection. 
For backward flow there are representational units which are specialized in certain features in order 
to predict lower level activity. The system is flexible in the sense that at any given situation, error 
units might be given more weight than representational units. In such case then, inner models would 
influence further processing and behavior less. Precision is the weighting of units. Precision 
enables flexibility which allows the system to focus on error when the model does not seem reliable. 
In contrast, when models are getting everything correct they are most reliable and more weight can 
be given to representational units. In such scenario the system can be guided directly by 
expectations which will make it faster and more successful. Precision is not calculated by some 
central system but distributed among layers. 
Precision is the inverse of a signals variance, it measures how much such the signal 
fluctuates around its mean. Such measure can be used to decide whether the current information 
should propose a revision of prior hypotheses. It applies to the hierarchical economy which results 
in the power of strengthening what seems reliable for a given moment and attenuating what is 
misleading. By measuring uncertainty, it can boost the value given either to error signaling or to 
predictions. This is a major bet of the model because it explains (in Hohwy, 2013 and Clark, 2013a,

Summary:
In predictive processing, the brain's perception heavily depends on the set of priors it brings to predict the current sensory signal. Precision, the weighting of units in the forward and backward flow of information, allows flexibility in determining the influence of predictions and error detection. Precision is based on the variance of signals and can be used to revise prior hypotheses and strengthen reliable information while attenuating misleading information. This approach provides a framework for understanding how the brain adapts to uncertainty and optimizes its processing based on the reliability of predictions.

Active Inference Glossary:
Generative Model: It is a model that describes the mapping between hidden states and the expected outcomes of actions and sensory inputs. In the context of active inference, generative models are used to generate predictions about the sensory inputs an agent expects to receive based on its internal states and the actions it takes.
Generative Process: It refers to the underlying dynamics in the environment that generate agent observations and predictions. The generative process encompasses the rules or mechanisms by which the environment generates sensory inputs and evolves over time.
Niche: It represents the ecological system in which the generative process operates. It is distinct from the agent that constructs a generative model. The niche includes the context, conditions, and constraints within which the agent interacts and makes predictions. The agent's generative model is tailored to the specific niche it operates in.
Non-Equilibrium Steady State: It refers to a system with unchanging dynamics or stationarity that is not time reversible. In active inference, this concept relates to the idea that the dynamics of the generative process are not in equilibrium but maintain a steady state over time. The generative process may exhibit patterns or regularities that are not easily reversed or undone. This non-equilibrium steady state can influence the predictions and actions of the agent.

Perception: In active inference, perception involves the process of inferring posterior states based on new observations or sensory data. It is the mechanism through which an agent updates its internal beliefs or states in light of incoming sensory information.
Salience: Salience refers to the extent or degree to which a cue or stimulus commands an agent's attention. It is influenced by the agent's attentional regime, which determines the weighting or priority given to different cues or sensory inputs based on their perceived importance or relevance.
Hierarchical Model: A hierarchical model in active inference consists of estimators operating at different spatiotemporal scales or levels. These estimators track features or variables at different levels of abstraction or granularity. The hierarchical structure allows for the integration of information across multiple levels and facilitates efficient processing and inference.
Living System: In active inference, a living system refers to an agent that is engaged in autopoiesis, meaning it is capable of self-maintenance and self-regulation. It sustains its own existence by actively engaging with its environment, perceiving and acting to fulfill its needs and maintain its internal states.
Multi-scale System: A multi-scale system in active inference is a hierarchical model that operates across multiple scales or levels. It captures the dynamics and interactions between variables at different levels of complexity, enabling the modeling of processes occurring at various spatiotemporal resolutions.
System: In the context of active inference, a system represents a set of relations described by the state space of a model. It is characterized by variables and functions that govern the dynamics and interactions within the system. The system can include both internal states and external factors that influence the agent's behavior and perception.
Posterior: In Bayesian inference, the posterior refers to the updated belief distribution after incorporating sensory data or evidence. It represents the agent's updated beliefs or probability distribution over latent causes or variables of interest after observing new information. The posterior distribution reflects the agent's current state of knowledge or beliefs.
Prediction: Prediction in active inference involves estimating the future state of a model based on a learned generative model. It uses prior knowledge and the current state of the system to forecast or anticipate the value of a hidden state or variable in the future. Predictions play a crucial role in guiding perception and action in active inference.
Prior: The prior in Bayesian inference refers to the initial belief distribution or state of knowledge before observing any sensory data. It represents the agent's prior assumptions or expectations about the latent causes or variables of interest. The prior distribution provides a starting point for inference and is updated based on new evidence to yield the posterior distribution.

Uncertainty: Uncertainty is the measure of unpredictability or expected surprise associated with a random variable or outcome. It represents the lack of precise knowledge or information about the true value or outcome. Uncertainty can be quantified using various statistical measures, such as variance or entropy, and is a fundamental aspect of active inference.
Action: Action in active inference encompasses the dynamics, mechanisms, and measurements of behavior. It involves the active states enacted by an agent through policy selection, which are aimed at reducing uncertainty and fulfilling the agent's goals or objectives. Actions are influenced by the agent's internal states, beliefs, and the environment.
Action planning: Action planning is the process in which an agent selects an affordance or course of action based on the inference of expected free energy. It involves considering the potential consequences of different actions and selecting the action that is expected to minimize surprise or free energy. Action planning is a central component of decision-making in active inference.

Agency: Agency refers to the capacity or ability of an agent to engage in action and make goal-driven selections based on its preferences and intentions. It involves the sense of control and autonomy that an agent has over its own actions and behavior.
Behavior: Behavior refers to the sequence of actions that an agent enacts in response to its internal states, environmental cues, and goals. It encompasses the observable actions and responses of an agent, which can be influenced by internal processes, external stimuli, and contextual factors.
Policy: In active inference, a policy is a sequence of actions that an agent follows to achieve its goals or objectives. It reflects a series of active states that guide an agent's behavior and decision-making. A policy can be learned or designed based on the agent's beliefs, preferences, and the minimization of expected free energy.
Policy selection: Policy selection is the process in which an agent engages in action planning by selecting a policy that minimizes expected free energy. It involves evaluating different potential courses of action and selecting the policy that is expected to lead to the least surprise or uncertainty. Policy selection is a key aspect of decision-making and adaptive behavior in active inference.
Preference: Preference refers to a parameter or scoring mechanism that reflects the extent to which an agent values or prioritizes certain sensory inputs, states, or outcomes. Preferences can influence an agent's decision-making and behavior by guiding the selection of actions that align with its preferred outcomes or goals.
Active inference: Active inference is a process theory that is closely related to the free energy principle. It encompasses the interplay between perception, cognition, and action in which an agent actively engages with its environment to minimize surprise or expected free energy. Active inference involves making predictions, updating beliefs, and enacting actions based on the agent's generative model and its goals.
Epistemic value: Epistemic value refers to the value associated with information gain or the reduction of uncertainty about a particular state or variable in relation to a specific policy.

Expected free energy: Expected free energy is a measure used in active inference to evaluate and guide action selection over a given time horizon. It represents the anticipated amount of surprise or unexpectedness an agent expects to encounter based on its generative model and predictions. By minimizing expected free energy, an agent aims to select actions that reduce surprise and bring the observed sensory data in line with its predictions.
Free energy: Free energy is an information-theoretic quantity that serves as an upper bound on surprisal or the amount of unexpectedness in the sensory input. It captures the difference between an agent's predictions or expectations and the observed sensory data. Minimizing free energy is a fundamental principle in active inference and is associated with the process of bringing an agent's internal model and beliefs in line with the external world.
Free energy principle: The free energy principle is a generalization of predictive coding, a theory of neural information processing. It states that organisms, including biological systems and artificial agents, strive to minimize the entropy or disorder in their sensory input by actively engaging with their environment. According to this principle, organisms maintain internal models or generative models that enable them to predict and explain sensory data in order to minimize surprise and maintain a coherent understanding of the world.
Generalized free energy: Generalized free energy is the combination of past variational free energy and future expected free energy. It represents the trade-off between exploiting existing knowledge and exploring new possibilities. By considering both past and future components, generalized free energy captures the balance between the agent's current beliefs and the potential for learning and adaptation.
Pragmatic value: Pragmatic value refers to the benefit or utility that an organism or agent derives from a specific policy or action. It measures how well a particular course of action aligns with an agent's preferences, goals, or objectives. Pragmatic value takes into account the consequences and outcomes associated with a given action and provides a measure of the action's desirability based on its impact on the agent's well-being or performance.
Variational free energy: Variational free energy is a measure that quantifies an upper bound on the surprisal or unexpectedness of sensory data given a generative model and observed data. It is used in the context of Bayesian inference to assess the fit between the model's predictions and the observed data. By minimizing variational free energy, an agent can update its beliefs and refine its internal model to better explain and predict sensory input.

Active states: Active states refer to the outgoing influence of policy selection in the Friston Blanket formalism. They represent the states that an agent enacts or engages in based on its selected policy. Active states are influenced by the agent's internal states, the observed sensory input, and the generative model.
Blanket state: A blanket state is a set of states that makes internal and external states conditionally independent. It serves as an intermediate state that mediates the relationship between the agent's internal states and the external states, including sensory input and actions. The blanket state contains information that allows for the conditional independence of the internal and external states, given its values.
External state: An external state refers to a state with a conditional density that is independent from the agent's internal state, conditioned on the blanket state. It represents aspects of the agent's environment or the external world that are relevant to the agent's generative model and its interaction with the environment. The external state includes sensory input, environmental cues, and other factors that impact the agent's perception and behavior.
Friston Blanket: The Friston Blanket is a concept within the framework of active inference proposed by Karl Friston. It refers to a Markov blanket that includes partitioned active states and the sense state. The active states represent the agent's enacted behaviors and policies, while the sense state represents the incoming sensory input. The Markov blanket separates the agent from its environment or niche, providing a boundary that encapsulates the relevant variables for inference and decision-making.
Internal state: An internal state is a state with a conditional density that is independent from the agent's external state, conditioned on the blanket state. It represents the internal dynamics, beliefs, and variables within the agent that influence its generative model and behavior. Internal states include cognitive processes, memory, beliefs, intentions, and other internal variables that shape the agent's perception and action selection.
Markov blanket: A Markov blanket is a modeling concept that defines a boundary or interface around a system or agent. It encapsulates a set of variables that render the agent conditionally independent from the variables outside the blanket. The Markov blanket includes the internal states, external states, and the blanket state. It represents the set of variables that are directly relevant for the agent's inference and decision-making, ensuring that the agent has access to all necessary information without requiring knowledge of the entire system.
Markov decision process: A Markov decision process (MDP) is a modeling framework that combines Markov models with decision-making. It is used to model sequential decision problems in which an agent interacts with an environment over time. In the context of active inference, an MDP is a Bayesian inference model where the agent's generative model incorporates policy selection. The agent's actions and policy selection are based on its beliefs, expected free energy, and the optimization of future outcomes.
Sense state: The sense state represents the incoming sensory input within the Friston Blanket formalism. It captures the observed sensory data or stimuli that the agent receives from its environment. The sense state is an important component in active inference as it provides the agent with information about the external world, which is used to update beliefs, make predictions, and guide decision-making.

Throughout our discussion, we have explored various concepts related to the framework of active inference and its underlying principles. Here is a summary of the key ideas we have covered:
Active Inference: Active inference is a process theory that encompasses perception, cognition, and action. It is based on the free energy principle, which suggests that organisms minimize the entropy or surprise in sensory input.
Generative Models: Generative models describe the mapping between hidden states and the expected outcomes of actions and sensory inputs. They encode probabilistic relationships and are used to make predictions and infer hidden causes.
Predictive Processing: Predictive processing is a computational framework that emphasizes the role of prediction and prediction error in information processing. It involves hierarchically organized generative models that generate predictions and update them based on error signals.
Free Energy: Free energy is an information-theoretic quantity that represents an upper bound on surprisal or the unexpectedness of sensory data. Minimizing free energy corresponds to explaining away prediction errors and reducing uncertainty.
Markov Blanket: The Markov blanket is a boundary that separates an agent from its environment. It includes internal states, external states, and the blanket state, ensuring that the agent is conditionally independent of variables outside the blanket.
Active States and Policy Selection: Active states refer to the actions and behaviors enacted by an agent based on policy selection. Policy selection involves the minimization of expected free energy and the selection of actions aligned with the agent's preferences.
Inference and Belief Updating: In active inference, inference involves updating beliefs about hidden causes based on sensory input. This is done through Bayesian inference, where prior beliefs are combined with sensory evidence to compute posterior beliefs.
Precision and Uncertainty: Precision is the weighting of prediction error and sensory input in active inference. It determines the confidence or reliability of predictions and influences the agent's attention and belief updating. Uncertainty reflects the measure of unpredictability or expected surprise associated with a random variable.
Hierarchical Models: Hierarchical models consist of estimators operating at different spatiotemporal scales, tracking features at different levels. They allow for the integration of information across multiple levels of abstraction.
Policy and Action Planning: Policy refers to a sequence of actions implemented based on a series of active states. Policy selection involves action planning, where the agent selects actions that minimize expected free energy and align with its preferences.
Epistemic and Pragmatic Value: Epistemic value refers to the value of information gain or reduction in uncertainty about a state with respect to a policy. Pragmatic value represents the benefit to an organism of a given policy or action in terms of alignment with preferences.
These concepts provide a foundation for understanding the principles and mechanisms underlying active inference and its application in cognitive and computational models of perception, cognition, and action.

3.1.5 Context-sensitivity 
Another very important feature is that these systems are biased in order to be context- 
sensitive. As Clark (2013a, p.9) explains: 
[...] the best overall fit between driving signal and expectations will often be 
found by (in effect) inferring noise in the driving signal and thus recognizing a stimulus 
as, for example, the letter m (say, in the context of the word ���mother���) even though the 
same bare stimulus, presented out of context or in most other contexts, would have been 
a better fit with the letter n. A unit normally responsive to the letter m might, under such 
circumstances, be successfully driven by an n-like stimulus. 
66 Or raises its Kalman gain, in his terminology. 
113 
Since hierarchical prediction models work on the basis of probabilistic information they 
can manifest approximate predictions. This enables flexibility to context because although a unit 
might be responsive to the letter ���n��� like in the example, if predictions suggest something related 
to the word ���mother��� should come up next then predictions will bias this unit's normal conditions. 
Recall that information is encoded in probability density functions, which means that what is stored 
is a range of possibilities and not objects, thus, in a given process, token predictions (from other 
areas) are able to bias the system in order to favor a given side of the range of possibilities over the 
other. Since this bias is being emanated by top-down processes then large parts of the brain will 
bias each of its specialized systems with some coherence, tuning them to the appropriate token 
condition. This context sensitivity is achieved because in higher levels of the hierarchy 
communication between specialized areas are commonplace, and ambiguous objects are 
challenged with multimodal hypothesis. However, given that this is based on approximate 
information, it will not be uncommon for these systems to misbehave. In our view, this will be 
related to Type 1 awkward responses. 
3.1.6 Active inference 
One last important concept in predictive processing is ���active inference���. Clark (2016) 
argues that even motor commands can be reduced to the prediction and error regime. Motor areas, 
as areas of proprioceptive perception, are always busy in expecting and predicting the sensory 
stimuli, but in this case the proprioceptive stimuli. Thus, action is treated as an outcome of 
perception of proprioceptive states. In action, the brain is attempting to minimize proprioceptive 
prediction error. A prediction concerning our future trajectory and position is generated and the 
highly weighted error relative to that prediction makes the action come about. Now, it is not that 
this triggers the motor command, motor commands are replaced. These highly weighted errors 
relative to future proprioceptive states already directly cause action. There is a tricky point in this 
proposal because both prediction (the goal) and error (the cause of action) are important and they 
need to be attenuated and increased in different levels of the hierarchy for action to come about. If 
errors relative to our future trajectories were attenuated we would only imagine our action.

Context-sensitivity is a crucial feature of predictive processing systems. It refers to the ability of these systems to adapt their predictions and responses based on the context in which they are operating. In hierarchical prediction models, which work on probabilistic information, approximate predictions can be generated. This flexibility allows units within the system to respond to stimuli that may not perfectly match their typical conditions but are contextually appropriate. For example, a unit that is normally responsive to the letter 'm' might be successfully driven by an 'n-like' stimulus in a particular context, where predictions bias its normal conditions.
The encoding of information in probability density functions enables the storage of a range of possibilities rather than fixed objects. Token predictions from other areas of the hierarchy can bias specialized systems to favor a specific side of the range of possibilities. This context sensitivity is achieved through communication between specialized areas in higher levels of the hierarchy and the challenging of ambiguous objects with multimodal hypotheses. However, due to the approximate nature of this information processing, it is not uncommon for these systems to exhibit misbehavior or produce Type 1 awkward responses.
Another important concept in predictive processing is "active inference." According to Clark, even motor commands can be understood within the prediction and error framework. Motor areas, involved in proprioceptive perception, are constantly engaged in predicting sensory stimuli related to proprioception. Action is treated as an outcome of perceiving proprioceptive states, and the brain seeks to minimize proprioceptive prediction error. Predictions about future trajectory and position are generated, and the error relative to those predictions drives the initiation of action. It is important to note that these errors directly trigger action, replacing the need for explicit motor commands. However, achieving the right balance between attenuating and increasing prediction errors at different levels of the hierarchy is crucial for successful action generation. If errors relative to future trajectories were overly attenuated, action would remain in the realm of imagination rather than being realized in the physical world.
1 / 1
However, errors relative to our current proprioceptive states must be attenuated for actions to come 
about, else we would stand still in checking our own place. Action comes about with highly 
weighted error relative to our future predictions and attenuated error relative to predictions on our 
current place. This treatment of action shows just how dynamical and complex the predictive 
processing account can become. Simply distinguishing between weighing errors or predictions is 
not enough, the level of the hierarchy where weighing occurs and relative to which prediction it is 
poised also determines function. 
3.1.7 Caveats in our use of predictive processing 
The evidence for HBPP does not come in a simple way in which we can satisfactorily 
discuss in two or three examples. Rather it can be pictured after analysis of various findings from 
diverse methods and over diverse range of tasks. Therefore, we will not have space to propose an 
elaborate discussion of evidence for predictive processing here (for some examination see Hohwy, 
2013, Clark, 2013a, and Clark, 2016), but we will mention some of interest. 
Consider Egner���s et al. (2010) work on face recognition. They tested activity on the 
fusiform face area (FFA, known to process a low-level visual face recognition mechanism) over 
stimuli of houses and faces. Researchers induced controlled expectations (by matching colors) of 
house and faces stimuli. They found that although, as known, the FFA shows high activity when 
the subject is presented with face stimuli but not with house stimuli, the FFA had the same 
activation strength with the house stimuli as with the face stimuli when face expectations were 
high, but not when low. This is an interesting evidence and an example of how prior expectations 
influence even low-level systems given tokens of information recognition. 
Hosoya et al. (2005, p.71) studying ganglion cells, which convey visual image to the brain, 
found that such cells signal not the raw visual image, but ���departures from predictable structure, 
under the assumption of spatial and temporal uniformity��� and that ���They generally encode local 
differences in space and changes in time rather than the raw image intensity.��� 
Knill and Pouget (2004) explain how evidence from cue integration function as evidence 
for representations in the form of Bayeasian probability distributions. Psychophysical experiments 
115 
show that integration (measured by the impact of each stimuli) from cues in different distances in 
vision and also in different sensory modalities (Ernst & Banks, 2002) tend to follow the same 
parameters predicted from Bayesian theory. Not only from distance cues but also by understanding 
motion. Weiss et al. (2002, p.598) explain that ���psychophysical experiments show that humans 
also make some puzzling mistakes, misjudging speed or direction of very simple stimuli���. They 
show how such mistakes of human motion perception are predicted by using probability 
distributions and Bayes��� rule. 
Finally, as for details of the predictive processing model, Markov et al. (2014) found that 
brains of macaques are organized in very distinct feed-forward and feed-backwards hierarchies 
with enumerable specific functions which correspond to some of those mentioned in HBPP. Also, 
modelling of electrophysiological data recorded during perceptual tasks has shown that precision 
could supposedly be encoded by a gain of error signaling superficial pyramidal cells (Brown and 
Friston, 2012). This has served as a useful measure of precision in other tasks such as perceptual 
evidence accumulation (for instance FitzGerald et al. 2015). 
It is unlikely that we were able to give a rich enough explanation of the predictive 
processing approach, but we hope this brief summary will enable us to move forward in our goals. 
We also hope that readers will discover more about how we see its merit as we go through other 
topics of this chapter. Of course, mathematical details on how these Bayesian probabilities are encoded and processed in hierarchical models are not the topic for our sort of philosophy (further 
reading is suggested, see Friston, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2010). 
We have no interest in holding a complete defense of a model for perception in this work. 
As far as we can tell, it still could be true that predictions can be only a part of perception and not 
the whole story as the proponents of predictive processing would take it. What matters, for us, is 
that at least a good part of perception involves predictions in the sense just explained and is it such 
part that is related to Type 1 processing in reasoning and judgment.

3.2 How predictive processing can account for Type 1 features 
On the paper about his nobel prize for his works in heuristics and biases, Daniel Kahneman 
(2002, p.450) wrote that ���From its earliest days, the research that Tversky and I conducted was 
guided by the idea that intuitive judgments occupy a position [...] between the automatic operations 
of perception and the deliberate operations of reasoning.��� Kahneman & Frederick (2002, p.50) 
claimed that intuitive thinking is ���perception-like��� and that ���intuitive prediction is an operation of 
System 1���. Further, that ���The boundary between perception and judgment is fuzzy and permeable: 
the perception of a stranger as menacing is inseparable from a prediction of future harm���. 
Kahneman and Tversky (1982) have been speaking of ���intuitive predictions��� for a long 
time. Kahneman and Frederick since 2002 have been explaining how there is a link between 
perception and Type 1 processing. What we hold is that link obtains because Type 1 judgments 
actually are perceptual predictions or hypothesis which work by means of HBPP. These authors 
have been noticing that intuition is somewhat like perception and have used the term prediction as 
what intuition does, but they failed to see how there is a unifying general computational model 
(from the work in predictive processing) of Type 1 processes that stems from the fact that they are 
predictions. They have been scratching the surface but no real application of the expectation- 
prediction mechanism, such as the one developed by the predictive processing approach, has been 
used as general explanatory framework for unifying Type 1 processing. This is what we propose 
to do now. 
We will start with a brief general explanation of what it means that Type 1 processing 
occurs by means of HBPP. Then we will further show how this seems to be true by seeing how 
predictive processing respects and explains Type 1 features but not Type 2 ones. 
Type 1 processes have sometimes been given input functions, say, following the early 
Fodorian model and the influence it has had on DPT. Perception also must have some input 
functions as well and traditionally has been understood as bringing precepts to mind, or as feeding 
input to systems in the brain. However, what really is interesting for DPT of reasoning and decision 
making is that Type 1 processes have an output function, in the sense that they generate an answer 
to problems. The predictive processing approach gives a clear output form to perception, by 
emphasizing its generative character. Thus, our strongest claim is that all Type 1 processing

The predictive processing approach proposes that perception and Type 1 processes involve prediction and hypothesis generation based on hierarchical and bidirectional predictive processing (HBPP). The evidence for HBPP comes from various studies across different domains.
One example is the work of Egner et al. (2010) on face recognition, where they found that prior expectations influenced the activity of the fusiform face area (FFA), a region involved in face processing. The FFA showed similar activation strength for face and house stimuli when face expectations were high, indicating the influence of prior expectations on low-level systems.
Studies on ganglion cells by Hosoya et al. (2005) revealed that these cells encode departures from predictable structure rather than raw image intensity, emphasizing the importance of prediction and deviation from predictions in visual processing.
Research by Knill and Pouget (2004) demonstrated that cue integration in perception follows the parameters predicted by Bayesian probability distributions. This indicates that the brain utilizes Bayesian representations to integrate information from different sensory cues.
Moreover, studies on macaque brains by Markov et al. (2014) showed distinct feed-forward and feed-backward hierarchies with specific functions, aligning with the hierarchical organization proposed by HBPP. Electrophysiological data analysis has also suggested that precision can be encoded by error signaling in superficial pyramidal cells, providing a measure of precision in various perceptual tasks.
It's important to note that predictive processing is a complex and dynamic account of information processing. While it offers a compelling explanation for Type 1 features, it does not claim to provide a complete account of perception or Type 1 processing. The predictive processing approach emphasizes the role of predictions in perception and highlights the computational principles underlying Type 1 processing, specifically the generation of perceptual predictions or hypotheses.
In contrast, Type 2 processes, characterized by classical symbolic processing, involve explicit reasoning and deliberation. The predictive processing approach does not provide a comprehensive explanation for Type 2 processes. By understanding the distinct computational principles underlying Type 1 and Type 2 processes, we can develop a richer understanding of how different types of thinking work.

answers (or its output function) are predictions based on probabilistic representations functioning 
as the HBPP explains. Predictive processing nicely accommodates the duality of Type 1 input and 
output functions. The representational units would be on the output side in the sense they function 
in order to fuel the generative model, while the error units would take the input functions usually 
ascribed to Type 1 processes. In this model then input and output are coupled, that is because input 
is really correction on generative modeling which formulate predictions (Type 1 answers). 
The pivotal role of expectations for determining Type 1 predictions have gone mostly 
unnoticed despite the fact that task construal in the reasoning and judgment paradigm has been 
mostly a task of manipulating subject���s expectations. Our model claims Type 1 processes take 
information over prior occurrences and over the current set of states (likelihood) and yields a 
prediction as fast as possible (posterior). If the time constraint is rigid, these predictions will 
generate actions (inner mental responses or, if too rigid, movements). If the system has time, then 
these predictions will be available for Type 2 evaluation. Thus, even what will be passed over to 
Type 2 processes already comes in the form of predictions. That is why manipulating subject���s 
expectations in a task causes their Type 1 answers to vary accordingly and requires Type 2 effort 
to override them. 
Type 1 processes are probabilistic. Both their computational strategy and the 
representations used are probabilistic. Content is encoded in the form of probability density 
functions, which means there is no symbol and no definite content, but values, means and standard 
deviation. That is why manipulating prior information alters its functionality, since it uses such to 
bias its workings into one or another direction, closer to or further from a certain value. A 
probability density function is a range of possibilities, and prior information will bias these 
possibilities so that those that are related to it will have higher chances of influencing answers. But 
it is not as if these values represent objects directly and discretely, they refer to distinct aspects of 
the input when perceptual systems are dealing with such objects. Not only is information encoded 
probabilistically but calculations, or inferences, follow Bayesian principles, this contrasts with 
following formal logic principles in computation, for instance. Of course all computation at a more 
basic level derive from logical principles but what they apply need not be further logical principle 
into content. 
118 
Finally, the sort of computation where Type 1 processes are executed are sub-personal (see 
Frankish, 2004, 2009) and their predictions are made by the same systems which process 
perception. A clear example is that a judgment (a prediction) about facial expressions is related to 
the FFA. The idea is that perception is not passive but already comes with predictions, and when 
in problem solving such prediction is precisely the Type 1 answer. We do not want to claim that 
Type 1 processes are purely perceptual (if in contrast to cognitive), only that such predictions stem 
from perceptual processes. So when perceiving a face which starts to show characteristics of anger, 
error correction makes the generative models adapt, and such models suggest Type 1 predictions 
which are quite like what we take to be judgments, such as (if put in words): ���this man is angry and 
might become violent���67, 
Kahneman (2003) and Kahneman & Frederick (2002) have argued that the list of features 
of Type 1 processing is shared with perception mechanisms. What we propose to do now is examine 
such list of features68 showing that it is shared because both (or at least part of) perception and 
Type 1 processes work in the manner described by predictive processing.

In summary, the predictive processing approach provides an account of how Type 1 processes, which involve intuitive judgments and predictions, can be understood as perceptual predictions based on hierarchical and probabilistic computations. The key points are as follows:
Type 1 processes involve both input and output functions, where the output functions generate predictions based on prior expectations. Predictive processing accommodates this duality by using representational units for output and error units for input.
Expectations play a pivotal role in Type 1 predictions. The model suggests that Type 1 processes take into account prior occurrences and the current set of states to generate predictions as quickly as possible. Manipulating expectations in tasks can influence Type 1 answers and may require Type 2 effort to override them.
Type 1 processes are probabilistic in nature. They use probabilistic representations, such as probability density functions, to encode information and make predictions. Prior information biases the range of possibilities and influences the predictions. It should be noted that these values do not represent discrete objects but rather aspects of the input.
Type 1 processes follow Bayesian principles in their computations and inferences. This contrasts with formal logic principles commonly associated with Type 2 processes. The computations in Type 1 processes are sub-personal and made by the same systems involved in perception.
The features of Type 1 processing, as described by Kahneman and others, are shared with perception mechanisms. The predictive processing approach suggests that these features are shared because both perception and Type 1 processes operate in a similar manner, with predictions being generated based on hierarchical and probabilistic computations.
Overall, the predictive processing approach offers a framework that explains the computational principles underlying Type 1 processes and their connection to perception. By understanding how predictions play a role in intuitive judgments and predictions, we can gain insights into the nature of Type 1 processing and its relationship to other cognitive processes.

In statistics, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) or Schwarz information criterion (also SIC, SBC, SBIC) is a criterion for model selection among a finite set of models; models with lower BIC are generally preferred. It is based, in part, on the likelihood function and it is closely related to the Akaike information criterion (AIC).

When fitting models, it is possible to increase the maximum likelihood by adding parameters, but doing so may result in overfitting. Both BIC and AIC attempt to resolve this problem by introducing a penalty term for the number of parameters in the model; the penalty term is larger in BIC than in AIC for sample sizes greater than 7.[1]

The BIC was developed by Gideon E. Schwarz and published in a 1978 paper,[2] where he gave a Bayesian argument for adopting it.

In statistics, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), also known as the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC), SBC (Schwarz's Bayesian Criterion), or SBIC (Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criterion), is a criterion used for model selection among a finite set of candidate models. The BIC is derived from a Bayesian perspective and provides a measure to compare models based on their fit to the data and complexity.
The BIC takes into account two key components: the likelihood function and a penalty term for model complexity. The likelihood function quantifies how well a model fits the observed data. Models with higher likelihood values indicate a better fit to the data. However, as models become more complex by adding more parameters, they have a higher chance of overfitting the data, leading to poor generalization to new data.
To address the trade-off between model fit and complexity, the BIC introduces a penalty term that increases with the number of parameters in the model. The penalty term discourages the inclusion of unnecessary parameters and prevents overfitting. The BIC penalty term is more severe compared to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for larger sample sizes, as it is based on a stronger Bayesian argument.
The BIC is calculated as BIC = -2 * log(L) + k * log(n), where L is the likelihood function, k is the number of parameters in the model, and n is the sample size. The BIC aims to find the model with the lowest BIC value, indicating the best balance between model fit and complexity. Models with lower BIC values are generally preferred over models with higher BIC values.
Gideon E. Schwarz introduced the BIC in a 1978 paper, where he presented a Bayesian justification for its use. The BIC has since become a widely used criterion for model selection in various statistical applications, providing a principled approach to balance goodness of fit and model complexity.

In multivariate statistics, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a statistical method used to uncover the underlying structure of a relatively large set of variables. EFA is a technique within factor analysis whose overarching goal is to identify the underlying relationships between measured variables.[1] It is commonly used by researchers when developing a scale (a scale is a collection of questions used to measure a particular research topic) and serves to identify a set of latent constructs underlying a battery of measured variables.[2] It should be used when the researcher has no a priori hypothesis about factors or patterns of measured variables.[3] Measured variables are any one of several attributes of people that may be observed and measured. Examples of measured variables could be the physical height, weight, and pulse rate of a human being.

Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) is a statistical method used in multivariate analysis to uncover the underlying structure or patterns in a large set of variables. Its primary objective is to identify the relationships between observed variables and determine the latent constructs that explain their correlations.
Researchers often employ EFA when they are developing a scale or questionnaire to measure a specific research topic. By conducting EFA, they aim to identify the latent constructs or factors that underlie a battery of observed variables. Latent constructs are unobservable variables that are not directly measured but are inferred from the relationships between the observed variables.
EFA is particularly useful when researchers have no specific prior hypothesis about the factors or patterns within the measured variables. It allows them to explore and discover the underlying structure without preconceived notions.
Measured variables, also known as observed variables, are the attributes or characteristics that researchers observe and measure. These variables can take various forms, such as physical measurements like height, weight, or pulse rate, or other observable attributes like responses to survey questions.
By applying EFA to a set of measured variables, researchers can gain insights into the underlying factors that contribute to the observed patterns. This information can help in developing scales, understanding relationships between variables, and exploring the structure of complex data sets.

Bayesian experimental design provides a general probability-theoretical framework from which other theories on experimental design can be derived. It is based on Bayesian inference to interpret the observations/data acquired during the experiment. This allows accounting for both any prior knowledge on the parameters to be determined as well as uncertainties in observations.

The theory of Bayesian experimental design is to a certain extent based on the theory for making optimal decisions under uncertainty. The aim when designing an experiment is to maximize the expected utility of the experiment outcome. The utility is most commonly defined in terms of a measure of the accuracy of the information provided by the experiment (e.g., the Shannon information or the negative of the variance) but may also involve factors such as the financial cost of performing the experiment. What will be the optimal experiment design depends on the particular utility criterion chosen.

Bayesian experimental design is a framework that utilizes Bayesian inference to guide the design of experiments. It provides a probabilistic approach to experimental design, allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge and uncertainties in the data observed during the experiment.
The core principle of Bayesian experimental design is to maximize the expected utility of the experiment outcome. Utility is typically defined in terms of a measure of information accuracy, such as the Shannon information or the negative of the variance. The goal is to obtain the most informative data possible, considering factors like the precision of parameter estimation or reducing uncertainty.
The choice of optimal experiment design depends on the specific utility criterion selected. Different utility criteria may prioritize different aspects, such as minimizing the variance of parameter estimates, minimizing the overall cost of the experiment, or achieving a desired level of precision.
By applying Bayesian experimental design principles, researchers can systematically plan experiments to gather the most informative data while considering practical constraints. This approach allows for more efficient and effective data collection, leading to improved decision-making and inference based on the experiment's outcomes.

Sequential Bayesian filtering is the extension of the Bayesian estimation for the case when the observed value changes in time. It is a method to estimate the real value of an observed variable that evolves in time.

The method is named:

filtering
when estimating the current value given past and current observations,
smoothing
when estimating past values given past and current observations, and
prediction
when estimating a probable future value given past and current observations.
The notion of Sequential Bayesian filtering is extensively used in control and robotics.

ChatGPT
Sequential Bayesian filtering is a powerful method used to estimate the real value of a variable that evolves over time when observations of the variable are available. It extends the principles of Bayesian estimation to handle dynamic systems with time-varying observations.
The method involves three main components: filtering, smoothing, and prediction. Filtering refers to estimating the current value of the variable based on both past and current observations. This estimation takes into account the probabilistic relationship between the observed data and the underlying variable, incorporating information from previous time steps.
Smoothing, on the other hand, involves estimating past values of the variable given the entire sequence of past and current observations. It takes advantage of the temporal dependency in the data to improve the accuracy of the estimates for earlier time points.
Prediction focuses on estimating the probable future value of the variable based on the available past and current observations. It leverages the knowledge of the system dynamics and the observed data to project the variable's behavior into the future.
Sequential Bayesian filtering finds widespread application in the fields of control and robotics. It enables the estimation of dynamic variables, such as the position or velocity of a moving object, based on noisy or incomplete sensor measurements. By continually updating estimates using new observations, it allows for real-time tracking and decision-making in dynamic systems.

Recursive Bayesian estimation, or Bayes filter, is a fundamental approach in probability theory, statistics, and machine learning for estimating an unknown probability density function (PDF) over time. It is a recursive method that incorporates incoming measurements and a mathematical process model to update and refine the estimate of the PDF.
The method is rooted in Bayesian statistics, which involves the use of prior and posterior probabilities to make probabilistic inferences. In recursive Bayesian estimation, the prior probability represents the initial belief about the unknown PDF, and as new measurements become available, the posterior probability is updated based on the incoming data and the process model.
The estimation process involves two main steps: prediction and update. In the prediction step, the process model is used to project the current PDF estimate forward in time, providing a prediction of the PDF at the next time step. This prediction takes into account the dynamics of the system being modeled.
In the update step, the predicted PDF is adjusted based on the incoming measurements. This is done by incorporating the likelihood of the measurements given the predicted PDF and updating the posterior probability accordingly. The updated posterior then becomes the new prior for the next iteration of the estimation process.
By iteratively repeating the prediction and update steps, the recursive Bayesian estimation continuously refines the estimate of the unknown PDF as new measurements are obtained. This allows for real-time tracking and inference of dynamic processes, making it particularly useful in applications such as target tracking, sensor fusion, and filtering noisy sensor data.
Overall, recursive Bayesian estimation provides a principled and probabilistic framework for dynamically estimating unknown PDFs, making it a powerful tool in various fields where uncertainty and time-varying data need to be effectively modeled and estimated.

Abstract: This research paper presents a novel reframing of the master equations of electromagnetic theory. The expressions for capacitance, inductance, and resistance are reformulated in terms of the index of refraction, dielectric material, vacuum speed of light, and vacuum wave impedance. The concept of "quantities-per-unit-length" is shown to be more in line with the underlying physics than the traditional "lumped-element" concept. The paper demonstrates that the theories of electric circuits, transmission lines, and optics can be unified into a single, coherent opto-electromagnetic theory of TEM Wave Electrodynamics. To achieve this, certain concepts such as electric permittivity, magnetic permeability, electric current, magnetic flux, voltage, and electric charge are dismissed as misdirected characters in a drama about static fields and electric currents that were never actually present.

The Death of Voltage 
�� Forrest Bishop, 
December 3, 2011 

Abstract 
Voltage is shown to be a mathematical confection much like electric current and charge 
were. None of the above entities have ever been measured regardless of the names of the 
instruments. Introduction 
The sacrificial victims must be summoned to fertilize the fields of Gnosis. So many are 
gone yet so many eagerly await. Heaviside [1] and Catt [2, 3] already offered up electric 
charge and its electric current, much to the displeasure of the gods of magical thinking. 
Those icons were shown to be illusory effects more reasonably caused by the propagating 
transverse electromagnetic wave called Energy Current [4]. Now another victim must 
tumble down the steps. 
Those antiquated notions of Electric Current and Electric Charge did not shed much 
light on real physical processes though they were useful for rough engineering work. By 
the same token, although architects understand that the Earth is round, they commonly 
assume a flat Earth for our cities. We speak like shamans of the Sun's rising and setting 
rather than the Earth revolving for similar convenience. All the same, for understanding 
the natural world, these conjuring tricks are more hindrance than help. They have led to 
numerous contradictions and endless confusion. Their desiccated mummies are to be put 
up on the shelf next to the museum exhibits marked Caloric and Phlogiston. 
What is Measured and Known? 
There are distinct limits to human knowledge. We don���t know how big or how old the 
Universe is, all creation myths aside, or even if those are valid questions. We don���t know 
what is inside of the Sun or how life actualizes. Those things are outside the purview of 
science for various reasons. Perfect knowledge of the nature of light and electricity may 
also be beyond our limits but we can at least approach the truth on these phenomena, as 
they are accessible. 
We can count after a fashion, but only by making the usually unstated assumptions that 
the various objects being counted are of the same class and by ignoring all other 
differences between those objects. For one famous example, there is disagreement on 
how many planets orbit the Sun. 
We can presume to measure length, L, angle, ��, time, T, force, F, and energy, W, most 
directly. Which of these overlapping concepts is the more fundamental is the subject of a 
deeper natural philosophy that has not been resolved. Although mass, M, is often used in 
a physical units system, this quantity has not been directly measured, nor has it been 
defined all that well. For example the number of atoms in a volume of PtIr alloy can 
certainly be counted up and the gravity force presented by that number of atoms can be 
measured on a scale, while a different kind of force can be measured by the collection���s 
resistance to acceleration, but neither of these methods is directly measuring mass. The 
mass is mathematically inferred from the measurement of the forces or energies: it is one 
further step away from direct knowledge.

Title: The Death of Voltage
Author: Forrest Bishop
Date: December 3, 2011
Abstract: This paper challenges the notion of voltage as a physical quantity, similar to previous arguments made against electric charge and electric current. The author argues that none of these entities have ever been directly measured, despite the existence of instruments that bear their names. The paper criticizes the use of these concepts in understanding the natural world, asserting that they have led to contradictions and confusion. The author suggests that a deeper understanding of natural philosophy is necessary to approach the truth about phenomena like light and electricity. The limitations of human knowledge are acknowledged, and the measurement of fundamental quantities like length, angle, time, force, and energy is discussed. The concept of mass is explored, highlighting that it is inferred from measurements of other quantities and not directly observed.

Summarize: FIGURE 3. ���Unit Cells��� of the Parallel LOCs. 
�� 2004-2007, Forrest Bishop 
14. For any given LOC, the smallest possible periodic space-tiling unit cell depends on the number of 
matching pairs of opposite faces of the cube. The eight possible LOCs exhaust all possible cases of 0, 1, 
2, or 3 such pairs of matching faces (Figure 3.), also as in Paragraph 18. This minimum-cell-count 
condition carries through to set the minimum size of the various possible MKCAs of the 224 ���TS��� and 
the 192 ���TT��� cells described below. An elaboration of the face-matching condition also sets the number 
of these possible space-tiling motifs to four, as described below. 
15. A second measure of complexity or disorder is seen in the number of fundamental LOC cells 
needed to form the ���unit cell��� of a LOC array. 6I and IOI only need a single cell to tile space, while IUL 
needs four such cells in four different orientations. R-3L and L-3L have to join up, with four of each type 
appearing in different orientations to produce an 8-member ���unit cell���. The movement of this type of 
MKCA is different from, e.g. 6I, in that subsets of the 8-member 3L array can be moved independently, 
but then have to be brought back into a rest configuration in order to make an orthogonal move. 
FIGURE 4. Transforming Between the Parallel LOCs. 
�� 2004- 2007, Forrest Bishop 
16. The 8 LOCs above form a group of sorts under the transformation rule: ���one stripe is rotated about 
local ���Z��� axis���. As shown in Figure 4., there are six ���ways��� out of each node, or LOC, which correspond 
to rotating one of the six stripes on one of the six faces. There are then 48 total ways to transform from 
one LOC to another. 24 of these ways transform into IUL, 10 into U3I, 5 into IOI, 3 into IO-I, and one 
way each into 6I, R-3L, and L-3L. By these statistics, IUL is as likely to form in a random process as all 
the rest of the LOCs combined. The discrepancy between this 0.5 probability and the 0.375 probability 
of Paragraph 9. is due to the path-dependency of the transform. 
Minimal Kinematically-Compatible Arrays (MKCA) 
17. The Cell-Types within each Local Orientation Class (LOC) fall into four fundamental patterns of 
space-tilings, regardless of whether the faces are labeled with two colors, or marked as ���TS��� or as 
���TT��� (described below), and regardless of LOC-type. These four infinite tiling patterns share the property 
of infinite planes which contain face-markings all oriented in the same direction. An embodiment of that 
property, with the markings being the directions of sliding freedom for the cells, results in a crystal-like 
substance that can be divided, such that two adjoining sections of it are capable of moving relative to 
each other, along the axes of the markings, and then serially in the three dimensions. The arrays of cells 
thus formed are therefore called Minimal Kinematically-Compatible Arrays (MKCAs).

Title: Unit Cells and Transformations in Parallel LOCs
Author: Forrest Bishop
Date: 2004-2007
Summary: The paper discusses the concept of unit cells in Parallel LOCs (Local Orientation Classes) and explores the complexity and disorder in different configurations. The number of matching pairs of opposite faces of the cube determines the smallest possible periodic space-tiling unit cell. The paper highlights the minimum-cell-count condition and its influence on the size of various MKCAs (Minimal Kinematically-Compatible Arrays). The complexity or disorder is further measured by the number of fundamental LOC cells needed to form the unit cell of a LOC array. Transformations between different LOCs are examined, revealing a group-like behavior under the transformation rule of rotating one stripe about the local 'Z' axis. The statistics of transformation probabilities are discussed, with a particular emphasis on the likelihood of forming IUL (Infinite Uniform Loc-tiling) in a random process. The concept of Minimal Kinematically-Compatible Arrays (MKCAs) is introduced, describing patterns of space-tilings and the ability of adjoining sections to move relative to each other along specific axes.

FIGURE 2. Proof of Existence of the Eight Parallel LOCs.

7. The number of marked cubes that need to be searched for coincidence can be halved by fixing one 
face relative to the global coordinates. Figure 2. shows the resulting 32 cubes, with the lower face fixed. 
The other 32 cubes are generated by rotating the entire array through 90 degrees about the vertical axis, 
which doesn���t add any new information. The array of 32 cubes was generated by an ordered, binary 
process of marking each face in one of its two possible orientations. For example, the upper layer is 
identical to the lower layer, except that the top faces are rotated 90 degrees. A similar arbitrary, though 
ordered, ���binary adder��� process was used on the other four faces, obvious by inspection of Figure 2. The 
colors used on the stripes here are only for reference to the faces. 
8. The resulting array of 32 cubes was then searched by inspection to determine which cubes are 
similar. The 8 LOCs of Figure 1. are the only ones that appear, as labeled in Figure 2. As the array of 32 
exhausts all possibilities for marking the cubes by the rules set out in paragraphs 4.-6., this completes the 
proof. 
9. The frequency of appearance appears to give a measure of the complexity, or disorder, of the LOC, 
with IUL being the most disordered and 6I the most ordered: IUL appears 12 times in the array, and 6I 
only once. This measure of complexity or disorder loosely governs the sizes of the ���Cell Type��� sets and 
arrays (���MKCAs���) described and enumerated below. 
10. The spatial relationships between the occurrences of each type of LOC show a variety of 
interrelationships between them, such as the mirroring of the IO-I and 2U distributions about a vertical, 
diagonal plane passing through 6I (an almost mirror-symmetry exhibited by the array as a whole), the 
substitution of 6I at one corner of the lower array for the next-most-ordered IOI appearing at the other 
three corners, the checkerboard formed by the 3L LOC-types, and its replacement by IUL in the lower 
array and its displacement of IUL in the upper array. The structure of these relationships is recognizably 
preserved, though elaborated upon, in the ���1024 TT Array��� described below. 
11. All other 3-space, marked polyhedra can be classified and ordered by a similar method. The 
markings can be extended to more than two colors, directions, and other such, in an obvious manner. 
This kind of marking and analysis can be extended to higher-dimension objects in a somewhat less- 
obvious fashion. LOC Tiling Motifs of Space 
12. Each patterned cube, or LOC, can periodically tile 3-space, trivially as the cube does. To produce a 
���kinematically-compatible��� array, a process of matching oriented markings between two adjacent cubes 
is carried out for each of the three dimensions of space. Imposing the condition that oriented lines on 
adjoining faces must match results in an infinite variety of crystal-like structures, or tiling patterns. 
Imposing the additional restriction that stripes on the other four adjacent faces of each of the two marked 
cubes must be oriented, in individual pairings, in the same direction also results in an infinity of possible 
space-tiling patterns. Requiring that the two joined cubes have parallel stripes on their furthest removed 
parallel faces then reduces the possible space tilings of the LOCs to exactly seven (7) (Figure 3.). These 
space-tilings, when decorated with sliding interfaces, are called ���Minimal Kinematically Compatible 
Arrays���, or MKCAs. These are the LOC-tilings of greatest interest for the construction of an X Active 
Cell Aggregate, or a working set of Bishop Cubes(R). 
13. An interesting property, that perhaps isn���t immediately obvious, is that mixing members of different 
LOCs is precluded by the restrictions described in paragraph 12. The kinematically-compatible mixed- 
LOC arrays cannot result in minimal unit cell-sets smaller than the MKCA of their various member 
LOCs, though they can produce workable designs of excessive complexity and questionable utility, 
called ���Non-minimal Kinematically Compatible Arrays��� (NKCAs). An example from the infinite set of 
NKCAs is shown in the hyperlinked Appendix.

Title: Proof of Existence and Patterns in Parallel LOCs
Author: Forrest Bishop
Date: 2006
Summary: The paper presents the proof of the existence of eight parallel LOCs (Local Orientation Classes) using a systematic search process. By fixing one face relative to global coordinates, the number of cubes to be searched for coincidence is halved. The resulting array of 32 cubes is examined to determine which cubes are similar, and the 8 LOCs from Figure 1 are identified. The frequency of appearance is discussed as a measure of complexity or disorder, with IUL being the most disordered and 6I being the most ordered. The spatial relationships between different LOC types are described, including mirror symmetry, substitutions, and checkerboard patterns. The concept of LOC Tiling Motifs of Space is introduced, where each patterned cube can periodically tile 3-space based on matching oriented markings. The imposition of additional restrictions on markings leads to an infinity of possible space-tiling patterns, resulting in seven Minimal Kinematically Compatible Arrays (MKCAs). The paper also mentions the preclusion of mixing members of different LOCs due to the described restrictions, leading to Non-minimal Kinematically Compatible Arrays (NKCAs).

Local Orientation Classes (LOCs) 
4. There exist exactly 8 unique ways to mark a non-oriented cube with stripes such that each of the six 
faces has only one stripe, placed parallel to an edge of the face. Of these 8 ways, two are mirror images 
of each other (R-3L and L-3L). These 8 ways are called the (Parallel) Local Orientation Classes (LOCs) 
(Figure 1.). The designations used in Figure 1. and throughout are based on the visual appearance of each 
LOC. IOI for example refers to the letters I, O, and then I, which are suggested by the patterns of the 
stripes. 
5. The set {x,y,z} refer to the axes of the global, Cartesian coordinate system, also called the world 
system. The set {X,Y,Z} refer to the axes of the local Cartesian coordinate system that can be set up on 
each face of a cube or other parallelepiped. On each such face, ���X��� and ���Y��� lie in the plane of the face, 
with ���Z��� set as the outward surface normal, often called ���n���. This convention (small letters for global, 
capital letters for local) is fairly common in motion control and aerospace. ���Local��� refers to a particular 
face of a particular cell, relative to the edges of the face as well as to the other faces. 
FIGURE 1. The Eight Possible Parallel Local Orientation Classes. 
�� 2004, Forrest Bishop 
6. A proof of the existence of the 8 unique parallel LOCs was constructed by considering all possible 
ways of marking the faces of oriented cubes with stripes parallel to the edges (Figure 2). For each face 
there are two possible, mutually-perpendicular stripes. For the six faces there are then 2^6, or 64, 
possible patterns, without considering the patterns that can be brought into coincidence by rotation or by 
mirroring.

Title: Local Orientation Classes (LOCs) and Their Markings
Author: Forrest Bishop
Date: 2004
Summary: The paper introduces the concept of Local Orientation Classes (LOCs), which are unique ways of marking a non-oriented cube with stripes on each of its six faces. There are exactly 8 LOCs, with two of them being mirror images of each other (R-3L and L-3L). The designations of the LOCs are based on the visual appearance of the stripe patterns. The paper also explains the use of global and local Cartesian coordinate systems, where lowercase letters represent the global system and uppercase letters represent the local system. A proof of the existence of the 8 unique parallel LOCs is presented, considering all possible ways of marking the faces with stripes parallel to the edges, resulting in 64 possible patterns before accounting for rotations or mirroring. The figures in the paper illustrate the different LOCs and their corresponding markings.

Introduction 
1. Although polyhedra with various markings on them are certainly not unknown, the rigorous 
enumeration and codification of these kinds of objects does not appear to have been done before, to the 
best of my knowledge. This electronically-transmitted publication is my first public disclosure, aside 
from various patents applied for or issued, of apparently previously unknown classes and properties of 
some of these geometric objects. 
2. There are several different ways of distinctively marking the faces of any polyhedron: by labeling 
with two or more colors, by drawing one or more oriented stripes, with one or more directed stripes, and 
with combinations of the above. Marking the faces of a cube with undirected lines, or stripes, parallel to 
the edges of the faces, results in 8 distinct geometric objects. Marking the faces of a cube with undirected 
lines, or stripes, of two distinct ���colors��� (���T��� and ���S��� or black and white), parallel to the edges of the 
faces, produces 7 * 32, or 224 distinct geometric objects, while marking the faces with undistinguished, 
though directed, stripes (���T��� and ���T���) results in another 6 * 32, or 192 distinct objects, for a total of 416 
different, though related, objects, called individually and collectively Bishop Cubes (R). These objects 
share various unifying properties partly described by group theory, complexity theory, and space tilings. 
3. A most interesting embodiment of these kinds of geometric objects is found in the construction and 
utilization of a multi-cellular, shape-shifting robot composed of an arbitrary number of similar or 
identical parts, or cells. The individual cells of this entirely kinetic machine need have no moving parts 
themselves, as the geometry of the cell���s interface alone suffices to constrain its motion. That application 
and the already working prototypes of this machine may be described in the companion paper, ������Bishop 
Cubes��� (R) and the ���X Active Cell Aggregate������.

Summary: The paper introduces the enumeration and study of polyhedra with distinct markings on their faces. The author presents various methods of marking, including labeling with colors, oriented stripes, directed stripes, and combinations thereof. Marking the faces of a cube with undirected lines parallel to the edges results in 8 distinct geometric objects, while marking with two distinct colors (black and white) or directed stripes (TT) produces 224 and 192 distinct objects, respectively. These objects, known as Bishop Cubes (R), share unifying properties related to group theory, complexity theory, and space tilings. The paper highlights the application of these geometric objects in the construction and utilization of shape-shifting robots composed of multiple cells. The companion paper, "Bishop Cubes (R) and the X Active Cell Aggregate," provides further details on the working prototypes of such machines. The paper also includes a glossary, references, and an appendix with images, animations, and additional information.

Minimal Kinematically-Compatible Arrays (MKCA) 
17. The Cell-Types within each Local Orientation Class (LOC) fall into four fundamental patterns of 
space-tilings, regardless of whether the faces are labeled with two colors, or marked as ���TS��� or as 
���TT��� (described below), and regardless of LOC-type. These four infinite tiling patterns share the property 
of infinite planes which contain face-markings all oriented in the same direction. An embodiment of that 
property, with the markings being the directions of sliding freedom for the cells, results in a crystal-like 
substance that can be divided, such that two adjoining sections of it are capable of moving relative to 
each other, along the axes of the markings, and then serially in the three dimensions. The arrays of cells 
thus formed are therefore called Minimal Kinematically-Compatible Arrays (MKCAs). 
18. These four fundamental, labeled or marked-parallelepipedal space-tiling matching-conditions are 
named: a) 3M, for ���three pairs of matching, opposed faces��� 
b) 2M, for ���two pairs of matching, opposed faces��� 
c) 1M, for ���one pair of matching, opposed faces��� 
d) 0M, for ���no matching, opposed faces��� 
The ���unit cells��� in Figure 3. show each of these types of tilings, as described in Paragraphs 12-14. A 
tiling is so named if at least one of its Members (and therefore all of them by the Genetrix Property 
described in Paragraph 20.) has the matching (or ���anti-matching���) condition. These four matching- 
conditions result in four distinguishable motifs or three-dimensional tiling patterns. These motifs are 
named: a) for 3M: ���Adjacent 3 x 3���, or ���Whorl��� 
b) for 2M: ���Adjacent 2 x 4��� 
c) for 1M: ���Baseball��� 
d) for 0M, ���Jigsaw��� 
19. Figures 6. and 8. for example show these space-tiling motifs. The Adjacent 3x3, or Whorl, MKCA 
may contain 1, 2, 4, or 8 cells, depending on the properties of the particular LOC as well as the markings. 
The Adjacent 2x4 MKCA may contain 2, 4, or 8 Members, depending on the properties of the particular 
LOC. The Baseball MKCA may contain 4 or 8 Members, and the Jigsaw MKCA is always composed of 
8 Members, which may or may not be unique. Each motif has a more nuanced structure than the 
matching-face condition alone implies, hence the additional nomenclature, intended to evoke some of 
these recurring, three-dimensional features. Figure 8. below shows the simplest possible realization of 
these four structures, as ���one of two possible colors per face��� is less information than ���one of two 
possible local orientations per face���. 
20. MKCA Genetrix Property: 
Any Member of a MKCA can generate all the other Members (i.e. Cell Types, repeated 
or otherwise) of the same MKCA. 
The generation of the other Members of a particular MKCA follow the rules set out in e.g. Paragraph 
12., with the additional constraint of similar face-types. Thus, any Member can be considered the 
Genetrix of the MKCA. There may only be 8, 4, 2, or 1 Cell Types in a Minimal Kinematically- 
Compatible Array. Because of the Genetrix Property, 
a Cell Type that is a Member of one kind of MKCA cannot also be a Member of a 
different kind of MKCA. 
This Exclusion Property, taken together with the Four-Motifs property of Paragraph 18., also provides 
a cross-check on the number of distinct, marked cubes.

Minimal Kinematically-Compatible Arrays (MKCA) are arrays of cells that exhibit crystal-like structures and have the property of sliding freedom along the marked directions. These arrays can be divided into sections that can move relative to each other in three dimensions. There are four fundamental patterns of space-tilings within each Local Orientation Class (LOC), regardless of the face labeling or marking. These patterns are named 3M, 2M, 1M, and 0M, corresponding to the number of matching pairs of opposed faces. The MKCA motifs associated with these patterns are Adjacent 3x3 (Whorl), Adjacent 2x4, Baseball, and Jigsaw.
The Adjacent 3x3 MKCA can have 1, 2, 4, or 8 cells, while the Adjacent 2x4 MKCA can have 2, 4, or 8 Members. The Baseball MKCA can have 4 or 8 Members, and the Jigsaw MKCA is always composed of 8 Members. Each motif has additional structural features beyond the matching-face condition alone. The Genetrix Property states that any Member of an MKCA can generate all other Members of the same MKCA, and this property defines the uniqueness of each MKCA. A Cell Type cannot be a Member of different kinds of MKCAs. This Exclusion Property, along with the Four-Motifs property, provides a check on the number of distinct marked cubes.

Easy-to-Understand Visualization Models of Complete Maps 
Carlo H. S��quin 
CS Division, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA; sequin@berkeley.edu 
Abstract 
A complete map ������������������������������������ ������������������������������������ consists of n disk-like regions, where every ���country��� shares a non-zero-length border-line 
with all the other ������������������������������������ ��� 1 countries. Different methods are described for constructing easy-to-understand 
visualization models of complete maps. One useful representation takes the form of a 2-layered ���pillow-case��� 
forming a disk with a minimum number of tunnels. Results are presented for complete maps with eight to twelve 
countries on symmetrical handle-bodies of genus-2 through genus-6. 
Introduction 
Complete Maps are duals of Complete Graphs, in which every node is connected to all the other nodes. 
Complete Map ������������������������������������ ������������������������������������ consists of n simply connected regions, where every ���country��� shares a non-zero-length 
border-line with all the other n ��� 1 countries. Every country has the topology of a disk. Maps with up to 
four countries can be drawn on a sphere or some other genus-0 surface. Map ������������������������������������ 4 has the connectivity of a 
tetrahedron. Maps with 5 to 7 countries can be embedded on a toroidal body of genus 1. Maps ������������������������������������ 5 and 
������������������������������������ 6 can be drawn with different connectivity, which may be conveyed in several different ways. The most 
abstract way is a rotation system in the form of a small table (Figure 1(a)) that lists for each country in 
cyclical order the other n ��� 1 countries that it touches. Figure 1(a) describes the layout of the complete 
graph ������������������������������������ 6 shown in Figure 1(b). The underlined numbers in Figure 1(a) are the edges that form the unique 
hexagonal region in this graph layout [7]; all other regions are triangular. The complete hexagonal map 
(Figure 1(b)) can be turned into a torus by identifying opposite edges. While this diagram is highly 
symmetrical, it loses this symmetry when it is curled up into a torus, and it is not immediately clear what 
the individual countries on the toroidal surface will look like. 
The complete graph ������������������������������������ 6, and thus ������������������������������������6, can also be drawn on a torus with 3-fold dihedral rotational 
symmetry (Figure 1(c)). Here the torus is formed by gluing together opposite edges in the marked 
rectangular area. A single picture or diagram is typically sufficient to describe the layouts of these maps 
on a genus-1 surface.

Figure 1: M6 on torus: (a) rotation system; (b) K6 with a hexagonal region; (c) D3 symmetrical layout. 
More physical models may be constructed from tubular crochet segments that are stitched together into 
intricate handle-bodies [2], or they may result from joining n regular felt polygons with n ��� 1 sides, which 
are sewn together along their edges. Suitable handle-bodies have even been constructed from dozens of 
specially designed origami tiles by Eve Torrence [10, 11]. All of these physical models are intriguing 
objects to be explored by touch; however, they do not readily reveal the topology of the underlying map. 
My goal is to present views of complete maps on symmetrical handle-bodies that can be recognized readily 
from one or two (front & back) pictures. The challenge starts with 8 countries on a genus-2 handle-body. 
Heawood���s formula [6] specifies the minimal genus required for a map with n countries: 
Genus g = ceiling [ (n ��� 3) (n ��� 4) / 12 ]. 
Handle-bodies of genus g are often represented in the shape of a g-hole torus, i.e., a fat disk with g 
tunnels passing through it from front to back. On such a handle-body, the layout of the map can be shown 
with colored diagrams of the front and back sides of the disk. These two layers are stitched together along 
the outer contour of the disk and along all the g rims of the tunnels, thus forming a kind of flattened ���pillow- 
case,��� which would expand into a nicely rounded g-hole torus when inflated. The front- and back-surfaces 
may also be printed out, glued together, and the holes may be cut out to make it easy to see how countries 
are connected when they extend through holes or around the outer rim of the disk. 
Unfortunately, I don���t know any general algorithm that can construct such models. My search for 
good models has been ad hoc and rather tedious. In this paper, I focus on complete maps with 8 to 12 
countries, and I present the solutions with the highest symmetries that I have found. Sometimes, the chosen 
handle-body can be a g-hole torus, possibly with g-fold rotational symmetry, or with (g���1)-fold symmetry, 
where one hole is placed in the center. However, the symmetry of the complete map will typically be lower 
because the layout of the various countries cannot adhere to the symmetry of the handle-body. To find 
good solutions, I have followed a few different approaches. They will be described, in turn, in the context 
of the maps where they have led to useful results.

The author explores physical models of complete maps using tubular crochet segments, felt polygons, and origami tiles. These models provide tactile exploration but may not reveal the underlying map topology. The goal of the paper is to present views of complete maps on symmetrical handle-bodies that can be easily recognized from pictures. The challenge is to find suitable handle-bodies for different numbers of countries.
The paper focuses on complete maps with 8 to 12 countries and presents solutions with high symmetries. The author discusses various approaches used to find good models, which are described in the context of the maps they have led to useful results. The visualization models aim to provide a clear representation of the map's layout and connections.
Overall, the paper explores different visualization techniques and handle-body structures for representing complete maps with various numbers of countries.

Weak Mixing: In mathematics and dynamical systems theory, weak mixing refers to a property of a system or transformation that ensures a sufficient level of randomness or unpredictability in the mixing of different states or trajectories. It means that over time, the system explores different parts of its state space, leading to a uniform distribution of states and making it difficult to predict the future behavior of the system based on its current state.
Working Memory: Working memory is a cognitive system or mental workspace that temporarily holds and manipulates information in an active state for use in ongoing tasks or processing. It involves the temporary storage of information, such as numbers, words, or images, and the ability to manipulate and use that information to guide behavior, make decisions, solve problems, and engage in complex cognitive tasks.
World States: World states refer to the possible or actual configurations, conditions, or arrangements of the world or a system at a particular point or period in time. It encompasses the overall state of the environment, including various aspects such as physical properties, events, states of objects, and interactions. The concept of world states is often used in modeling and analyzing complex systems, such as in physics, computer simulations, and social sciences, to understand how different factors and variables interact and influence the overall state of the system.

The discovery of von Economo neurons in diverse whale species[3][4] has led to the suggestion that they are "a possible obligatory neuronal adaptation in very large brains, permitting fast information processing and transfer along highly specific projections and that evolved in relation to emerging social behaviors."[4]:���254��� The apparent presence of these specialized neurons only in highly intelligent mammals may be an example of convergent evolution.[11]

Their restriction among the primates to great apes leads to the hypothesis that they developed no earlier than 15���20 million years ago, prior to the divergence of orangutans from the African great apes. Recently, primitive forms of von Economo neurons have also been discovered in macaque monkey brains[12] and raccoons.[7]

Von Economo neurons are specialized neurons that were initially discovered in the brains of humans and great apes. These neurons are characterized by their unique morphology, with a spindle-shaped or "cigar-shaped" soma and long, slender dendrites. They are primarily found in two regions of the brain: the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the frontoinsular cortex (FI). These regions are involved in various cognitive functions, including social cognition, empathy, and self-awareness.
The discovery of von Economo neurons in diverse whale species suggests that they may play a role in fast information processing and transfer along specific neural projections. This has led to the hypothesis that these neurons are a neuronal adaptation in large brains, facilitating efficient communication and processing of social information. The presence of von Economo neurons in highly intelligent mammals, including humans, great apes, and certain whale species, suggests that they may have evolved convergently in response to similar evolutionary pressures.
Among primates, von Economo neurons appear to be restricted to great apes, including humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos. This has led to the hypothesis that these neurons emerged no earlier than 15-20 million years ago, before the divergence of orangutans from the African great apes. However, recent research has discovered primitive forms of von Economo neurons in the brains of macaque monkeys and even raccoons, suggesting that these neurons may have a broader distribution among mammals than previously thought.
The discovery and study of von Economo neurons provide valuable insights into the evolution and functional significance of specialized neurons in the brain. Further research is needed to fully understand the specific roles and contributions of von Economo neurons to cognition and behavior in different species.

Von Economo neurons are characterized by their relatively large size, which may facilitate rapid communication across the brain. While they are rare compared to other types of neurons, they are abundant and comparatively larger in humans. However, they are even more abundant in cetaceans, such as dolphins and whales, with three times the abundance compared to humans.
The larger size of von Economo neurons suggests that they may play a role in facilitating efficient and fast communication within the brain. Their abundance in humans and cetaceans, both of which have large brains, further supports the idea that these neurons are involved in complex cognitive functions.
The specific functions and significance of von Economo neurons are still not fully understood. However, their presence in species with advanced cognitive abilities, such as humans and cetaceans, suggests that they may be involved in processes related to social cognition, self-awareness, and emotional processing. Further research is needed to unravel the precise functions and contributions of von Economo neurons to the cognitive abilities of different species.

A process theory is a system of ideas that explains how an entity changes and develops.[1] Process theories are often contrasted with variance theories, that is, systems of ideas that explain the variance in a dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. While process theories focus on how something happens, variance theories focus on why something happens. Examples of process theories include evolution by natural selection, continental drift and the nitrogen cycle.

That's a correct understanding of process theories. Process theories aim to explain the mechanisms and dynamics of how something changes and develops over time. They focus on the underlying processes, interactions, and causal relationships that drive the observed changes or phenomena.
In contrast, variance theories seek to explain the variation or differences in a dependent variable based on independent variables. They aim to identify factors or variables that account for the observed differences or variations in a particular phenomenon or outcome.
Process theories are often more concerned with understanding the underlying mechanisms, sequences of events, and causal processes that lead to specific outcomes or changes. They provide insights into the dynamic nature of systems and how they evolve or transform over time. On the other hand, variance theories are focused on identifying factors or variables that explain why different outcomes or variations occur in a specific context.
Examples of process theories include evolution by natural selection, which explains the gradual changes and adaptations in species over generations, and the nitrogen cycle, which describes the processes and transformations of nitrogen in ecosystems. Continental drift is another process theory that explains the movement and changing positions of Earth's continents over time.
By understanding both process theories and variance theories, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms and explanations underlying different phenomena and their variations or changes.

Self-organization, a process where some form of overall order arises out of the local interactions between parts of an initially disordered system, was discovered in cybernetics by William Ross Ashby in 1947.[1][2] It states that any deterministic dynamic system automatically evolves towards a state of equilibrium that can be described in terms of an attractor in a basin of surrounding states. Once there, the further evolution of the system is constrained to remain in the attractor. This constraint implies a form of mutual dependency or coordination between its constituent components or subsystems. In Ashby's terms, each subsystem has adapted to the environment formed by all other subsystems.[1]

The cybernetician Heinz von Foerster formulated the principle of "order from noise" in 1960.[3] It notes that self-organization is facilitated by random perturbations ("noise") that let the system explore a variety of states in its state space. This increases the chance that the system will arrive into the basin of a "strong" or "deep" attractor, from which it then quickly enters the attractor itself. The biophysicist Henri Atlan developed such a concept by proposing the principle of "complexity from noise"[4][5] (French: le principe de complexit�� par le bruit)[6] first in the 1972 book L'organisation biologique et la th��orie de l'information[7] and then in the 1979 book Entre le cristal et la fum��e.[8] The thermodynamicist Ilya Prigogine formulated a similar principle as "order through fluctuations"[9] or "order out of chaos".[10] It is applied in the method of simulated annealing for problem solving and machine learning.[11]

Self-organization is a process in which a system spontaneously generates order or organization through the local interactions and behaviors of its individual components or parts. It is a concept that emerged in cybernetics and has been further developed by various researchers.
William Ross Ashby, a pioneer in cybernetics, introduced the idea of self-organization in 1947. He observed that deterministic dynamic systems tend to evolve towards a state of equilibrium, which can be described as an attractor in a basin of surrounding states. Once the system reaches this attractor, its further evolution is constrained to remain within it. This implies a mutual dependency and coordination between the constituent components or subsystems of the system. Each subsystem adapts to the environment formed by all other subsystems.
Heinz von Foerster, another cybernetician, formulated the principle of "order from noise" in 1960. This principle highlights the role of random perturbations or "noise" in facilitating self-organization. The introduction of random perturbations allows the system to explore a variety of states in its state space, increasing the chances of entering a "strong" or "deep" attractor. Once the system enters the attractor, it quickly stabilizes within it.
Henri Atlan, a biophysicist, expanded on this concept with his principle of "complexity from noise." He proposed that complex organizations can arise from the presence of noise or random fluctuations. This idea emphasizes that noise provides the system with the necessary variability to explore and discover new states and patterns.
Ilya Prigogine, a thermodynamicist, formulated a similar principle known as "order through fluctuations" or "order out of chaos." He emphasized the role of fluctuations and non-equilibrium conditions in driving the emergence of order in complex systems. This principle has applications in problem-solving and machine learning algorithms, such as simulated annealing, which leverages random fluctuations to search for optimal solutions.
Overall, the concept of self-organization highlights the inherent capacity of systems to spontaneously organize and adapt through their internal interactions and responses to environmental influences. It demonstrates how order can arise from disorder, and how randomness and variability play crucial roles in shaping complex systems.

Warren McCulloch proposed "Redundancy of Potential Command"[19] as characteristic of the organization of the brain and human nervous system and the necessary condition for self-organization.

Heinz von Foerster proposed Redundancy, R = 1 ��� H/Hmax, where H is entropy.[20][21] In essence this states that unused potential communication bandwidth is a measure of self-organization.

Warren McCulloch, a pioneering neuroscientist, proposed the concept of "Redundancy of Potential Command" as a characteristic of the organization of the brain and the human nervous system. According to McCulloch, self-organization is facilitated by the presence of redundant connections or pathways within the system. This redundancy allows for multiple potential pathways for information transmission and processing, increasing the system's capacity for adaptation and flexibility.
Heinz von Foerster further developed the idea of redundancy in the context of self-organization. He introduced a measure of redundancy, denoted as R, which is calculated as R = 1 - H/Hmax, where H represents the entropy of a system. In simple terms, this measure states that the unused or available communication bandwidth in a system is a reflection of its self-organizational capacity. A higher value of R indicates a higher level of redundancy and potential for self-organization.
The concept of redundancy in self-organization emphasizes the importance of having surplus or excess resources in a system. These unused resources can be utilized when needed, allowing for flexibility, robustness, and adaptability in the face of changing conditions or disturbances. Redundancy provides a form of resilience, ensuring that the system can maintain its organization and function even in the presence of disruptions or failures.
By considering the unused potential in a system, as quantified by the measure of redundancy, researchers can gain insights into the system's capacity for self-organization. This perspective highlights the value of redundancy as a resource that enables the system to respond and adapt effectively to internal and external demands, contributing to its overall organization and functionality.

In the 1970s Stafford Beer considered this condition as necessary for autonomy which identifies self-organization in persisting and living systems. He applied his viable system model to management. It consists of five parts: the monitoring of performance of the survival processes (1), their management by recursive application of regulation (2), homeostatic operational control (3) and development (4) which produce maintenance of identity (5) under environmental perturbation. Focus is prioritized by an alerting "algedonic loop" feedback: a sensitivity to both pain and pleasure produced from under-performance or over-performance relative to a standard capability.[22]

In the 1970s, Stafford Beer expanded on the concept of self-organization and its relationship to autonomy in persisting and living systems. He developed the viable system model, which he applied to the field of management. This model consists of five interconnected parts that work together to enable the system's autonomy and self-organization.
The first part of the viable system model involves monitoring the performance of the system's survival processes. This includes gathering information and feedback about the system's operations and its environment.
The second part is the management of the system through recursive application of regulation. This involves the implementation of control mechanisms and decision-making processes to ensure the system functions effectively and adapts to changes in its environment.
The third part is homeostatic operational control, which focuses on maintaining the stability and balance of the system's internal processes and functions.
The fourth part is development, which involves the system's capacity to learn, evolve, and improve over time. This includes the exploration of new possibilities and the adaptation of the system's structure and processes.
The fifth part is the maintenance of identity, which refers to the system's ability to maintain its distinctive characteristics and purpose even in the face of environmental perturbations.
To prioritize and guide the system's actions, the viable system model incorporates an "algedonic loop" feedback. This feedback mechanism is sensitive to both pain and pleasure, providing signals that indicate when the system is underperforming or overperforming relative to a standard capability. These alerts help the system adjust its behavior and performance to achieve optimal functioning.
By applying the viable system model to management, Stafford Beer aimed to create organizational structures and processes that promote autonomy, resilience, and adaptability. The model emphasizes the importance of self-organization and feedback mechanisms in achieving effective management and sustaining the viability of complex systems.

An algedonic signal is a pre-emptive message concerning pleasure or pain.[1] An arousal mechanism can generate an algedonic signal, and thus provide an important survival mechanism to a living organism by alerting it to a threat. An example of the disastrous consequences of such a system not being in place is that of a moth attracted by the light of an open flame without recognising the danger of fire.

In the human nervous system a variety of algedonic signals are brought together in the midbrain reticular formation from across the whole body.[2] A source of pain, such as touching a burning surface or treading on broken glass, creates such an algedonic signal which interrupts consciousness and provokes a reflex action.[2]

An algedonic signal is a communication or message that conveys information about pleasure or pain. It serves as a pre-emptive warning or alerting mechanism that helps living organisms respond to potential threats or dangers in their environment. By generating an algedonic signal, an arousal mechanism in the organism can trigger a survival response and promote self-preservation.
For example, in the case of a moth attracted to the light of an open flame, the absence of an effective algedonic signal can have disastrous consequences. Without recognizing the danger of fire, the moth may be drawn to the flame and suffer harm or even death.
In the human nervous system, a wide range of algedonic signals from various parts of the body converge in the midbrain reticular formation. This region plays a critical role in processing and integrating these signals. When a source of pain, such as touching a burning surface or stepping on broken glass, triggers an algedonic signal, it interrupts conscious awareness and elicits a reflex action. This reflex action is a rapid, involuntary response aimed at minimizing or removing the source of pain.
The presence of algedonic signals and the ability to respond to them effectively are crucial for the survival and well-being of living organisms. They provide valuable information about potential threats or harmful stimuli, enabling organisms to take appropriate actions to protect themselves and ensure their continued existence.

In the 1990s Gordon Pask pointed out von Foerster's H and Hmax were not independent and interacted via countably infinite recursive concurrent spin processes[23] (he favoured the Bohm interpretation) which he called concepts (liberally defined in any medium, "productive and, incidentally reproductive"). His strict definition of concept "a procedure to bring about a relation"[24] permitted his theorem "Like concepts repel, unlike concepts attract"[25] to state a general spin based principle of self-organization. His edict, an exclusion principle, "There are No Doppelgangers"[26][23] means no two concepts can be the same (all interactions occur with different perspectives making time incommensurable for actors). This means, after sufficient duration as differences assert, all concepts will attract and coalesce as pink noise and entropy increases (and see Big Crunch, self-organized criticality).

In the 1990s, Gordon Pask introduced a novel perspective on Heinz von Foerster's concepts of entropy (H) and maximum entropy (Hmax). Pask proposed that H and Hmax were not independent but instead interacted through countably infinite recursive concurrent spin processes. Pask favored the interpretation of physicist David Bohm, which influenced his understanding of these concepts.
Pask referred to these interacting processes as "concepts." He defined concepts as procedures that bring about relationships and emphasized their productivity and reproductive nature across different mediums. According to his strict definition, no two concepts could be identical, as he stated, "There are No Doppelgangers." This exclusion principle implies that all interactions occur with different perspectives, rendering time incommensurable for actors involved.
Pask's theorem, "Like concepts repel, unlike concepts attract," proposed a general spin-based principle of self-organization. It suggests that similar concepts tend to repel each other, while dissimilar concepts attract. Over time, as differences assert themselves, all concepts will eventually attract and coalesce, leading to an increase in pink noise and entropy. This process is reminiscent of the concept of self-organized criticality and the Big Crunch, where systems tend toward a state of high entropy and complexity.
Pask's ideas contribute to our understanding of self-organization and the dynamics of complex systems. By exploring the interactions and relationships between concepts, he shed light on the mechanisms that drive the emergence of order, patterns, and complexity in various domains.

The theory is applicable to all organizationally closed or homeostatic processes that produce enduring and coherent products (where spins have a fixed average phase relationship and also in the sense of Nicholas Rescher's coherence theory of truth with the proviso that the sets and their members exert repulsive forces at their boundaries) through interactions: evolving, learning and adapting.

Pask's Interactions of Actors "hard carapace" model is reflected in some of the ideas of emergence and coherence. It requires a knot emergence topology that produces radiation during interaction with a unit cell that has a prismatic tensegrity structure. Laughlin's contribution to emergence reflects some of these constraints.[27]

Gordon Pask's theory has broad applicability to organizationally closed or homeostatic processes that generate coherent and enduring outcomes. These processes involve interactions between actors, which can include evolving, learning, and adapting. The theory aligns with Nicholas Rescher's coherence theory of truth, with the caveat that sets and their members exert repulsive forces at their boundaries.
Pask's "hard carapace" model of Interactions of Actors highlights the ideas of emergence and coherence. It proposes a knot emergence topology, wherein interactions with a unit cell having a prismatic tensegrity structure produce radiation. This concept resonates with the constraints described by Robert B. Laughlin in his work on emergence.
Pask's theory provides insights into the emergence of complex phenomena and the coherence exhibited by systems that engage in interactions. By considering the structure and dynamics of these interactions, Pask identified principles that govern the behavior and organization of such systems. These ideas contribute to our understanding of how order, patterns, and coherence arise from the collective interactions of actors within complex systems.
