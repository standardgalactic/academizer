Ugh, greasy grimy gopherguts, cool side
Hope for one I don't forget spoons twice
Slukewarm vultures, mold on his moon pie
Booms in his home to dissipate and the food flies
Suicide lane wide, low ride looting
In the wake of an amicable ruining
My duty gopher moving in packs
Sharing food for the cats
Amats me, I accidentally saw the woman in half
She said, I'll keep you in my prayers
I said, I need to hide my body
She said, okay honey, talk to you on Friday
Apparently we share a common plasma
So the growing disconnection doesn't matter
According to the blood and water chapter
Weird, who wrote the blood and water chapter anyway?
Probably sincerely dead, only child 30 cats
Looking for a way to reconnect with an averted past
Except it doesn't always work like that
Today I pulled three baby snakes out of moss and dirt
With a wild strawberry bond, tors internal
I told him, you would rather be something inventive and electric
You are healthy, you are special, you are present
Then I let him go
Music
You were sitting at the gate of waiting
Spirits and provisions, I was privy to a headache
Over pirouette and innards and a mirror
Sweating pictures, who's there?
Semian or lizard, is it worth or is it disappearing?
Difference and ambition and material
Inequated gentlemen, outlaws
Reduced to a ferocious will of betrayal
Move as a gop, seed in black gums, tooth gone
Bootleg, Yukon, Cornelius, I'm a
That's better, here we go
This is Janet Face printed on a $0 bill
Got a little plot of land where authority isn't recognized
Contribute and keepin' the core beside Jekyllos
Nevermind a missin' throat, buying for affection
To the retro sound of mysticism
Dying it is something he must handle on his own
The wind blow away, when a wind don't play
Today I pulled three green frogs that I leaf and bark
With a great finds, climb a convenient barn
I told him, you would rather be something tenacious
Than exalted, you are mighty, you are gracious
You are lauded, then I let him go
I have been completely unable to maintain
Any semblance of relationship on any level
I have been a bastard to the people
Who have actively attempted to deliver me from peril
I have been acutely undeserving of the ear
That listened up and lived that kissed me on the temple
I have been accustomed to a stubborn disposition
That admits it was its history disassembled
I have been a hypocrite in sermonizing tolerance
While skimming for a ministry to pretzel
I have been unfairly resemble of those I wish it acted different
When the bidding was essential
I have been a terrible communicator
Prone of isolation over sympathy for devils
I have been my own worst enemy
Since the very genesis of rebels
Today I pulled three ghost crabs out of rock and sand
With a low tide showcase a promised land
I told them you were gonna be something dynamic
And impressive, poor patient, you are gallant
You are festive, then I let him go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
