## ABSTRACT
The rise in Africans involvement in cybercrimes globally due to increased access to the internet has prompted some African governments to enact ICT and Cybercrime related Laws. Unfortunately, some provisions of these laws, criminalize some expressions and are likely to stifle and restrict online activities and freedom of expression of Africans. This paper argues that the criminalization of certain expressions by these laws are contrary to the expectations of international and regional instruments on freedom of expression. It recommends the adaptation of the experiences and jurisprudence of the European and Inter-American Courts.

## 1. Introduction
Today, Africans have increased their utilization of the internet in carrying out tasks instead of being restricted to the initial three-way communication system, of in-person meeting, phone interaction, or sending a postal message. With the internet communication has become faster and easier and information has become more accessible. Also, information dissemination is with ease and the speed at which information is shared is with a blink.[Footnote1](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KPWBYNFSGXJTZMAWSDMD/full?target=10.1080/13600834.2024.2406680#) According to the African Union (AU), the African continent has the fastest internet penetration from a global perspective.[Footnote2](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KPWBYNFSGXJTZMAWSDMD/full?target=10.1080/13600834.2024.2406680#) Again, Africa recorded 566.14 Million internet users in 2020, compared to 522.81 million in 2019.[Footnote3](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KPWBYNFSGXJTZMAWSDMD/full?target=10.1080/13600834.2024.2406680#) Despite the immense advantages of cyberspace to Africa, including e-commerce, e-governance, e-learning etc., there is an increase in the involvement of African internet users in cybercrimes, especially internet fraud for financial or commercial gain.[Footnote4](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KPWBYNFSGXJTZMAWSDMD/full?target=10.1080/13600834.2024.2406680#) These cybercriminals use cyberspace to transform traditional crimes into modern crimes like cybercrimes.[Footnote5](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KPWBYNFSGXJTZMAWSDMD/full?target=10.1080/13600834.2024.2406680#) They perpetuate these crimes through the instrumentality of the computer, networks, and ICT infrastructure.[Footnote6](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KPWBYNFSGXJTZMAWSDMD/full?target=10.1080/13600834.2024.2406680#) The African continent is now being seen as a safe haven for the perpetration of cybercrimes.[Footnote7](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KPWBYNFSGXJTZMAWSDMD/full?target=10.1080/13600834.2024.2406680#) This is because there have been several arrests and prosecutions of Africans in other countries especially in the US. Recently, out of 281 cybercriminals arrested in the US and overseas, the majority of them are Africans, with, 167 from Nigeria, 18 from Ghana, and some from Kenya.[Footnote8](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/KPWBYNFSGXJTZMAWSDMD/full?target=10.1080/13600834.2024.2406680#) Consequently, some African governments have enacted Cybercrimes and ICT Laws to curtail the proliferation of cybercrimes in the African sub-region and its perpetuation by Africans domestically and internationally.
Although, the enactment of these laws is a good development, some provisions of the laws tend to curtail and restrict online acts and freedom of expression of Africans contrary to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) 1966, and the African Charter on Human and People’s Right (ACHPR) 1981. The corollary is that truthful and permissible publications in cyberspace are being tagged as ‘false or fake news,’ ‘defamatory,’ ‘offensive,’ ‘insulting,’ or ‘annoying’ and thereby criminalized and punishable with fines or imprisonment. Unfortunately, some African governments are strategically imploring these laws to hush the views of media practitioners and persons in cyberspace who are opposed to the government in power. This has resulted in the arrest and prosecution of persons within this category. In this regard, the paper raises several questions which it seeks to answer: what is the legal implication of criminalizing online expression by African governments? Are criminal sanctions against legitimate users of cyberspace justifiable? Is this necessary in the context of a democratic African society? Allowing African governments to indulge in these acts simply means denying African rights to use cyberspace effectively to facilitate and hold government accountable and promote the protection of human rights in a democratic state against oppressive regimes.
To forestall the anomalies mentioned above, this paper suggests that African governments should adapt what is obtainable and practiced by the European and Inter-American Courts, where it has been established that existing laws that criminalize online information by regarding the same as ‘false or fake news’ ‘defamatory’ ‘offensive’, ‘insulting’, or ‘annoying’ etc. are disproportionately a violation of the right to freedom to conduct online expression. Moreover, such acts have been held not to be necessary for a democratic society. Hence, the use of criminalization should only be resorted to lastly, especially where there is obvious evidence of a significant threat against other cyberspace users’ enjoyment of online rights. Most preferably, the application of civil procedure and not criminal procedure should be undertaken for redress.
This paper examines how the proliferation of internet users in Africa, has led to an increase in the perpetuation of cybercrimes. It provides information on the rising trend of African users in cyberspace, and the way and manner Africans have taken advantage of the access to the cyberspace to perpetrate cybercrimes (internet fraud), especially against foreigners for financial gain. It thereafter examines the reaction of some African governments by the enactment of ICT and Cybercrime Laws. The paper further notes that some of the provisions of these laws are a flagrant breach of international and regional human rights conventions that are applicable in African states. To avoid the violation of Africans rights, it suggests a resort to and adaptation of the experiences and jurisprudence of the European and Inter-American Courts.

Title:
African’s Right to Use Cyberspace and the Imposition of Criminal Sanction: Rethinking Legislative Criminalization of Online Acts in Africa
Abstract Summary:
The internet's growth in Africa has led to both benefits and increased cybercrime.
In response, many African governments have enacted ICT and cybercrime laws.
However, some of these laws criminalize expressions that should fall under freedom of speech.
The paper argues these laws often breach international and regional human rights standards.
It recommends African states draw from the jurisprudence of the European and Inter-American Courts, using civil rather than criminal remedies for regulating online expression.
Key Points from the Introduction:
Digital Growth in Africa:
Rapid internet adoption with over 566 million users by 2020.
Growth has facilitated easier communication, access to information, e-commerce, and e-learning.
Cybercrime Rise:
Increase in fraud and internet-based crimes, often transnational.
African cybercriminals have been prominently prosecuted abroad, especially in the US.
Government Response:
Several African countries have passed cybercrime legislation.
While well-intentioned, some laws criminalize legitimate online speech.
Human Rights Concerns:
These laws conflict with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ICCPR, and the African Charter.
Terms like “fake news,” “defamatory,” or “annoying” are used vaguely to suppress dissent and journalism.
Arrests and prosecutions have targeted media and government critics.
Recommendations:
Use civil remedies, not criminal sanctions, to address harmful content online.
Learn from European and Inter-American legal systems which emphasize proportionality and necessity.
Protect freedom of expression as a democratic imperative.

SEPERATION OF POWERS IN NIGERIA: BALANCING DEMOCRATIC 
ACCOUNTABILITY AND GOVERNANCE COST 
BY 
DIVINE OVIE IMODJE 
Abstract 
The doctrine of separation of powers is a cornerstone of Nigeria’s governance framework, 
designed to prevent the concentration of authority and ensure checks and balances between the 
executive, legislature, and judiciary. This article traces the historical evolution of separation of 
powers in Nigeria, from pre-colonial political structures to modern constitutional provisions 
under the 1999 Constitution. It critically examines its effectiveness in curtailing arbitrary rule 
through judicial review, legislative oversight, and executive accountability. However, while 
separation of powers upholds democratic principles, it has also contributed to the high cost of 
governance, particularly through the maintenance of a bicameral legislature and the extensive 
financial commitments associated with sustaining government institutions. Given the significant 
economic burden, this paper recommends that Nigeria adopt a unicameral legislature as a cost- 
effective alternative, streamlining governance while maintaining essential checks and balances. 
Using legal analysis, historical references, and contemporary case studies, this paper evaluates 
whether Nigeria’s separation of powers achieves its primary objective of preventing tyranny or 
inadvertently leads to excessive government expenditure. 
Keywords: Separation of powers, checks and balances, governance, arbitrariness, cost of 
governance, unicameral legislature, Nigeria, constitutional law, 
Introduction 
The doctrine of separation of powers is a core principle in democratic governance that prevents 
the concentration of power in a single entity. Championed by John Locke, Montesquieu, and James 
Madison, this principle ensures that law-making, execution, and adjudication are handled by 
separate institutions. The Nigerian Constitution of 1999 upholds this doctrine, dividing powers 
among the executive, legislative, and judicial arms of government. 
However, while separation of powers promotes checks and balances, its practical implementation 
in Nigeria has raised concerns about governance costs, particularly due to the maintenance of a 
bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Over the years, 
Nigeria’s National Assembly budget has significantly increased, leading to debates on whether the 
system is sustainable. 
This paper explores the historical evolution of separation of powers in Nigeria, its role in 
preventing arbitrary rule, and the financial burden it imposes. The key question is whether Nigeria 
should continue with a bicameral legislature or adopt a unicameral system to reduce governance 
costs while maintaining legislative effectiveness and accountability. The study ultimately 
recommends a constitutional amendment to transition to a unicameral system, ensuring a more 
efficient and cost-effective governance structure. 
The Evolution of separation of powers in Nigeria: 
Pre colonial governance and Government structure 
. Yoruba traditional system 
Separation of powers in Nigeria date back before the colonial era. In pre-colonial governments 
they had their own system of government and how powers were separated. 
The Yoruba pre-colonial system of separation of powers: 
The doctrine of separation of powers as practiced by the then Oyo- empire was 
premised on the YORUBA Adage which say that:

Here’s a
breakdown of the main arguments
in the article titled:
“Separation of Powers in Nigeria: Balancing Democratic Accountability and Governance Cost” by Divine Ovie Imodje
1. Separation of Powers is Fundamental to Democracy
Nigeria’s governance framework is built on the
doctrine of separation of powers
, dividing authority between the
executive
,
legislature
, and
judiciary
.
Inspired by
Locke
,
Montesquieu
, and
Madison
, this doctrine aims to prevent
tyranny
and promote
accountability
through
checks and balances
.
2. Historical Roots of the Doctrine in Nigeria
The concept existed even in
pre-colonial systems
, such as the
Yoruba Oyo Empire
, where governance was
not centralized
and
power was shared
among different institutions (like the Alaafin, Oyo Mesi, and Ogboni).
Colonialism disrupted indigenous systems but laid the groundwork for Nigeria’s current
constitutional structure
.
3. The 1999 Constitution Formalized the Doctrine
Nigeria’s 1999 Constitution firmly enshrines the separation of powers among the three arms of government.
It empowers the judiciary for
judicial review
, the legislature for
oversight
, and holds the executive
accountable
.
4. Benefits of Separation of Powers
Helps
curb arbitrary rule
and promotes
transparency and accountability
.
Enables
independence of institutions
, thereby protecting
citizens’ rights
and democratic governance.
5. High Cost of Governance is a Major Drawback
Nigeria’s
bicameral legislature
(Senate and House of Representatives) is expensive to maintain.
The
National Assembly budget
continues to grow, raising questions about fiscal responsibility and
economic sustainability
.
There is
duplication of roles
, and high expenditure on salaries, allowances, and bureaucracy.
6. A Call for Reform: Unicameral Legislature
The paper argues that Nigeria should consider a
unicameral legislature
to cut costs.
This would reduce
redundancy
and enhance
efficiency
, while still upholding the
core elements of checks and balances
.
7. Constitutional Amendment as the Way Forward
Recommends a
constitutional amendment
to transition from a bicameral to a
unicameral legislature
.
Proposes a leaner government structure that retains
legislative effectiveness
and
democratic accountability
without the current financial burden.

The Yoruba pre-colonial system of separation of powers: 
The doctrine of separation of powers as practiced by the then Oyo- empire was 
premised on the YORUBA Adage which say that: 
(I) Agbajowo Lafi nsoya, ajeje owo kan ko gberu don. 
(ii) Akil fee mefi Laba Alade — eni fojesu koni mumi. 
(iii) Enikan kiije awade, Igi kan kole da igbo Se. 
Meaning that, no man is an island to himself and cannot be all in all1 
Additionally, the Yorubas had different arms of Government that performed different functions 
Alaafin: he was the political head chosen by the oyomesi then 2 
Oyomesi; the king makers responsible for choosing the Alaafin 
Ogboni society: vested with judicial powers and was involved in policy making 3 
The Osorun or Iba Osorun (Basorun, i.e., the lord that performs the "Oran ") may be regarded as 
the Prime Minister and Chancellor of the kingdom and something more. He is not only the 
president of the council, but his power and influence are immeasurably more significant than those 
of the others put together. His is the chief voice in the election of a King. and although the King

as supreme is vested with absolute power, yet that power must be exercised within the limit of the 
unwritten constitution, but if he is ultra-tyrannical and withal unconstitutional and unacceptable to 
the nation it is the Basorun's prerogative as the mouthpiece of the people to move his rejection as 
a King in which case His Majesty has no alternative but to take poison and die4. 
It is evident from the above that the pre-colonial Yoruba kingdom had a well-defined separation of 
powers, with each organ of government effectively carrying out its respective functions. 
. Urhobo traditional systems 
The Urhobo people are a major ethnic group in Delta State, Nigeria, renowned for their vibrant 
culture and traditions. They speak the Urhobo language, which belongs to the Niger-Congo 
language family. Their traditional occupations include fishing, farming, and trade, with cassava 
and palm produce being staple crops. In this discussion, we will explore the separation of powers 
among the Urhobo people during the pre-colonial era. 
The Ovie-in-Council consists of the King (Ovie), the Otota (Spokesman), and selected Chiefs 
which the King considers to be his confidants, Membership of the Kingdom and the Ruling 
Houses, it is the highest body that takes decision on crucial and major issues: it gives approval 
before anything is done in the Kingdom, in terms of conflict resolution, the Ovie-in-Council is the 
highest arbiter in each kingdom5.

Here’s a structured breakdown of the
pre-colonial Yoruba and Urhobo systems of separation of powers
, highlighting their contributions to the doctrine in Nigeria's traditional governance:
1. Yoruba Pre-Colonial System of Separation of Powers (Oyo Empire)
Foundational Philosophy:
Based on Yoruba proverbs emphasizing
collective governance
and the
limits of individual power
:
“Agbajo owo la fi n soya, ajeje owo kan ko gberu dori”
– Unity is strength; one hand alone cannot lift a heavy burden.
“Akil fi emeji laba Alade”
– Power should not be concentrated in one individual.
“Enikan kii je awade; igi kan ko le da igbo se”
– One tree does not make a forest.
Institutions and Their Roles:
Alaafin (King):
Political head, but not an absolute monarch. Chosen by the
Oyomesi
.
Oyomesi (Council of Kingmakers):
Appointed the Alaafin, had powers to check him, especially if he ruled tyrannically.
Ogboni Society:
Held
judicial and spiritual power
, contributed to policymaking and acted as a balance against executive overreach.
Basorun (Prime Minister):
Head of Oyomesi.
Wielded significant influence; could initiate the
removal of a tyrannical Alaafin
.
If the king was rejected by the people,
he had to commit ritual suicide
, showing a form of constitutional accountability.
Conclusion:
The Oyo Empire demonstrated a
tripartite system
: executive (Alaafin), legislative/advisory (Oyomesi), and judicial/spiritual (Ogboni).
Power was
distributed
and
checked
, preventing tyranny and ensuring governance legitimacy.
2. Urhobo Pre-Colonial System of Separation of Powers
Cultural Context:
The Urhobo people are an ethnic group in
Delta State
, with strong cultural and governance structures tied to
kinship and community
.
Governing Body: Ovie-in-Council
Ovie (King):
Traditional ruler.
Otota (Spokesman):
Served as the king’s principal adviser and communicator.
Selected Chiefs:
Trusted nobles forming a decision-making council.
Functions:
Decision-making:
The Ovie-in-Council approved all major decisions affecting the kingdom.
Conflict Resolution:
Served as the
highest judicial authority
.
Checks on the Ovie:
Although respected, the king did not act alone; the council's consensus was necessary for governance.
Conclusion:
Like the Yoruba system, the Urhobo system exhibited
shared governance
where
executive, advisory, and judicial roles
were distinguished and balanced.
This helped prevent
abuse of power
and ensured community participation in leadership.
General Insight:
Both Yoruba and Urhobo traditional systems reflected a
functional separation of powers
long before colonial influence.
These systems emphasized
collaboration, accountability, and respect for rule-bound authority
, laying early foundations for
democratic principles in Nigeria
.

to the warriors (Inotu) for defense, handling trials as jury and prosecutors, and pronouncing 
verdicts in any judgment through either the senior or junior members6.

for a separate consultation known as Ume7. 
Colonial and post-independence evolution 
After independence, the 1960 and 1963 parliamentary constitution, operated the British concept of 
separation of powers whereby powers were shared between the judiciary on one side and the 
parliament and the executive on the other; The latter being an integral through distinct of the 
former 8.Under the 1979 and 1999 presidential constitutions had similar to that of the United States 
of America. Under this constitution, section legislative powers are vested on the National 
Assembly9. Executive powers are vested on the President and Governors10. Judicial powers vested 
on the courts11. 
Evolution of separation of powers in United Kingdom 
The relationship between the doctrine of separation of powers and that of the 1215 magna carta 
can be likened to that of a descendant and progenitor. The document contained 63 clauses, each 
outlining various rules. Among these provisions, one stated that the king could not impose new 
taxes without the consent of the barons.12 Additionally, a council of 25 barons was established to 
ensure the king adhered to the terms of the charter.13 This clearly demonstrates that the Magna 
Carta’s primary goal was to limit the king’s power, preventing an excessive concentration of 
authority in the monarchy. 
Additionally, the Bill of Rights 1689 was instrumental in advancing the separation of powers in 
the United Kingdom. It introduced the principle of parliamentary supremacy, making Parliament 
the ultimate source of law-making, surpassing the monarch and the courts.14 The Bill also made it 
unlawful to prosecute individuals in the courts for matters unless approved by Parliament.

Contemporary perspectives on separation of powers: scholarly insights and debates 
The concept of separation of powers seems to have originated from John Locke’s analysis of the 
political situation in the seventeenth century England.15 John Locke argued that it would be great 
temptation to vest the powers of law making and execution in the hands of one person. Although 
his view on separation of powers is limited to the concept seen today because separation of powers 
entails law making, execution and interpretation. A French jurist and philosopher, Baron De 
Montesquieu, in explaining the concept of separation of powers opined that: ‘’Political liberty is 
to be found only when there is no abuse of powers to prevent this abuse, it is necessary from the 
nature of things that one powers should check on another. When the legislative executive and 
judicial powers are united in the same person or body There can be no liberty … again there is no 
liberty if the judicial power is not separated from the legislative and executive. There would be an 
end of everything if the same person or body, whether of nobles or of the people. Were to executive 
all three powers16. 
Conceding to the foregoing, Madison posited that There can be no liberty where the legislative and 
executive powers are united in the same person or body of magistrates or if the power of judging 
be not separated from the legislature and executive powers.17 
While emphasizing the significance of the principle of separation of powers ,Nigerian renowned

the hands of one individual is the very definition of dictatorship and absolute power is by its very 
nature arbitrary, capricious and despotic limited government demands therefore, that the 
organization of government should base on some concept of structure, whereby the functions of 
law making, execution and adjudication are vested in separate agencies, operating with separate 
personnel and procedure. We are not prepared, write vile, 'to accept that government can become, 
on the ground of "efficiency", or for any other reason, a single undifferentiated monolithic 
structure, nor can we assume that government can be allowed to become simply an accidental

agglomeration of purely pragmatic relationships. By separating the function of execution from that 
of law making, by insisting that every executive action must, in so far at any rate as it affects an 
individual, have the authority of some law, and by prescribing a different procedure for law making 
the arbitrariness of executive action can be effectively checked.18

court of appeal gives credence to the foregoing the court of appeal held that under the 1979 
constitution the executive has its own constituted duties just as the judiciary has its own duties. 
Therefore, the judiciary cannot interfere with the right of the executive to perform its duties as 
much as the executive cannot interfere with the judiciary its own duties.

Here’s a
breakdown of the main arguments and scholarly perspectives
from the section you provided on
contemporary views of the separation of powers
:
1. Historical Philosophical Foundations
John Locke:
Viewed
separation of powers
as a safeguard against
tyranny
.
Warned against concentrating
law-making and execution
in one person or body.
His model was
less comprehensive
, excluding the
judicial function
as we understand it today.
Baron de Montesquieu:
Provided a
more robust and modern view
of the doctrine.
Argued that
political liberty exists only when powers are separated
.
Believed that combining
legislative, executive, and judicial functions
leads to
oppression and tyranny
.
Famous quote:
“There is no liberty if the judiciary is not separated from the legislative and executive.”
James Madison (Federalist No. 46):
Reinforced Montesquieu’s stance.
Declared that liberty
cannot exist
when
legislative and executive powers are united
, or when
judicial powers are not independent
.
2. Nigerian Scholarly Insight
Prof. Ben Nwabueze (Renowned Nigerian Constitutional Scholar):
Concentration of government powers in one person equals
dictatorship
.
Absolute power
is inherently
arbitrary, despotic, and dangerous
.
Emphasized that a
limited government
requires:
Law-making, execution, and adjudication to be
separately assigned
.
Different institutions, personnel, and procedures
for each function.
Rejected the idea of a
monolithic government
for the sake of "efficiency".
Argued that by
separating executive actions
from law-making and requiring executive actions to be
authorized by law
,
arbitrariness can be prevented
.
3. Judicial Support in Nigerian Case Law
Commissioner for Local Government, Anambra State v. Ezemokwe:
Court of Appeal’s Position:
Under the
1979 Constitution
, each arm of government has
distinct responsibilities
.
The
judiciary cannot interfere
in the domain of the executive.
Likewise, the
executive cannot interfere
with the judiciary’s duties.
This case supports the
principle of institutional independence
and
non-interference
.
Summary of Contemporary Viewpoints:
Thinker/Entity
Main Argument
John Locke
Combining legislative and executive powers is dangerous.
Montesquieu
Full separation (legislative, executive, judicial) is essential for liberty.
James Madison
Liberty requires functional independence of all three powers.
Prof. Nwabueze (Nigeria)
Separation prevents dictatorship; power must be structurally divided.
Nigerian Judiciary (Case Law)
Courts affirm that each branch must operate independently.

The way forward proposing a transition into unicameral legislature 
One of the most effective ways to reduce governance costs while maintaining legislative efficiency 
in Nigeria is to transition from a bicameral to a unicameral legislature. Nigeria’s current bicameral 
system, consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives, was designed to provide broad 
representation and ensure adequate checks and balances. However, in practice, this structure has 
44 Republic of Ghana, Constitution of the Republic of Ghana, 1992, art. 93(1). 
led to excessive government expenditure, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and unnecessary duplication 
of legislative functions. The high cost of maintaining two chambers, including lawmakers’ salaries, 
allowances, and administrative expenses, has raised concerns about the sustainability of this 
system. 
A unicameral legislature, in which only the Senate assumes full legislative responsibilities, 
presents a more cost-effective alternative. By eliminating the House of Representatives, Nigeria 
can significantly reduce the financial burden associated with running the National Assembly. The 
savings from this reform can be redirected to critical sectors such as education, healthcare, 
infrastructure, and poverty alleviation, ultimately improving the quality of life for Nigerians. 
Additionally, a unicameral legislature will streamline the law-making process, reducing 
bureaucratic delays and ensuring faster passage of essential legislation. 
Internationally, several countries have successfully implemented unicameral legislatures without 
compromising democracy or legislative effectiveness. For instance, Ghana has operated a 
unicameral system since its 1992 Constitution, ensuring both efficiency and adequate 
representation. Similarly, China and Sweden maintain unicameral legislatures that function 
effectively while keeping governance costs low. These examples demonstrate that a well- 
structured unicameral system can achieve legislative accountability without the excessive financial 
burden associated with bicameralism. 
Given Nigeria’s economic realities and the urgent need for fiscal responsibility, transitioning to a 
unicameral legislature is a practical solution. It will not only reduce governance costs but also 
enhance legislative efficiency, strengthen accountability, and ensure a more responsive and 
people-oriented government. However, for this transition to take effect, constitutional amendments 
must be enacted to reflect this structural change. 
For Nigeria to successfully transition to a unicameral legislature, a constitutional amendment is 
required to legally redefine the structure of its National Assembly. The 1999 Constitution (as 
amended) currently establishes a bicameral legislature under Section 47, which states that 
legislative powers shall be vested in the Senate and the House of Representatives. To enable the 
shift to a unicameral system, this provision must be amended to recognize a single legislative 
chamber, ensuring that all legislative powers are vested in one house.

in the section titled:
The Way Forward: Proposing a Transition to a Unicameral Legislature in Nigeria
1. Problem with Nigeria’s Bicameral Legislature
Nigeria currently operates a
bicameral system
: Senate + House of Representatives.
Intended to promote
representation
and
checks and balances
.
However, in practice it has:
Led to
high governance costs
.
Caused
bureaucratic inefficiencies
.
Resulted in
duplication of legislative roles
.
Sparked concerns about the
sustainability
of maintaining two chambers.
2. The Case for a Unicameral Legislature
Proposal:
Retain only the
Senate
to assume
full legislative responsibilities
.
Benefits:
Cost reduction
– Salaries, allowances, and administrative expenses of one chamber eliminated.
Streamlined law-making
– Reduces delays in legislative processes.
Reallocation of resources
– Savings can be channeled into education, healthcare, infrastructure, and poverty alleviation.
Enhanced accountability
– Fewer lawmakers may improve focus, transparency, and responsiveness.
3. Global Precedents Supporting Unicameralism
Ghana
: Has successfully operated a unicameral system since its
1992 Constitution (Art. 93(1))
.
Sweden and China
: Both maintain unicameral systems that ensure
legislative efficiency
and
cost control
.
These examples show that
unicameralism doesn’t weaken democracy
, if well-structured.
4. Legal Path to Implementation
Constitutional Amendment Required
:
Section 47 of the
1999 Constitution
currently establishes a bicameral legislature.
It must be
amended
to
vest legislative powers in a single house
(e.g., the Senate).
This change must follow due constitutional processes, including approval by the National Assembly and State Houses of Assembly.
5. Final Argument
Given Nigeria’s
economic challenges
, adopting a
unicameral legislature is both practical and urgent
.
It promises:
Lower governance costs
,
Improved efficiency
,
Greater accountability
, and
A
more people-centered government

Here is the final section from the earlier article on cybercrime: 6. Conclusion 
This paper shows that the increasing level of internet penetration in Africa has accentu- 
ated the perpetuation of cybercrimes by Africans at the domestic and international level. 
Consequently, making Africans notorious and famous for global internet fraud. Attempts 
to curtail the proliferation of the menace resulted in some African governments enacting 
ICT/Cybercrime Laws. Some provisions in the laws examined show restrictions on Africans’ 
right to freedom of expression and access to information in cyberspace despite promi- 
nent and existing regional and international human rights instruments protecting the 
rights to freedom of expression and access to information in cyberspace. This paper ques- 
tions the legitimacy of such provisions and concludes that it breaches regional and inter- 
national human rights standards that discourages the criminalization of defamation and 
online expressions. The laws have persisted despite the human rights Declaration and 
Principles requiring the review, repeal or amendment of such laws, arguably because 
the African governments af f ected are benef i ting from the arrest, harassment, intimida- 
tion, and prosecution of persons, journalists, bloggers and media practitioners who 
make posts in cyberspace that are critical of the government. This is more so as most 
African countries are still young democracies, have weak Judicial system and rule of 
law is at its lowest level. Hence, even when African governments are aware of the pro- 
visions of international and regional instruments, they show preference for criminalizing 
certain expressions. 
The preceding illustrates a deliberate move by African countries to criminalize certain 
actions that ordinarily in a democratic society will at best be civil wrongs. Generally, it is 
expected that victims of abuse of freedom of expression physically or online can fi nd 
remedies in civil torts like defamation. However, with the versatility brought into com- 
munications by ICT, the internet and social media have made it possible to reach billions 
of audiences globally in just a few seconds with the click of a button. African

76 F. E. EBOIBI AND N. U. RICHARDS 
governments, who are often the main targets of social media criticism, had suddenly lost 
their highly treasured power to control the dissemination of information. Unlike before 
the advent of social media, it was easy to censor the traditional media and gag them 
by introducing draconian laws. However, it is dif i cult to censor social media; hence 
there is a preference to impose harsh laws and criminalize online expressions. 
The foregoing, clearly shows that the criminalization of certain online expression by 
African governments under the guise of curtailing cybercrimes are only a ploy to limit 
the right to freedom of expression, gag free speech, arrest, intimidate, harass and 
convict journalist, activist, social critics, members of opposition political parties and citi- 
zens generally in a bid stop public criticisms of government actions and policies. There- 
fore, African governments should use criminalization as a last resort where there is 
evidence of a serious threat to the enjoyment of online rights by other Africans’ or 
where it is intended to incite violence or ethnic rivalry; rather than use it as a tool to sup- 
press free speech and intimidate journalists and political opponents. However, sugges- 
tions are made for the adaptation of the experiences and jurisprudence of the 
European and Inter-American Courts to apply civil remedies instead of criminal sanctions. 
This is pertinent because the criminalization of freedom of expression and access to infor- 
mation in cyberspace has not in any way facilitated the curtailment of Africans involve- 
ment in domestic and international internet fraud.

Here’s a
structured breakdown
of the main points and arguments from the
Conclusion
section of the cybercrime article:
6. Conclusion – Key Arguments
1. Cybercrime and Internet Growth in Africa
Increased internet access in Africa has also
facilitated cybercrime
, especially
internet fraud
at both domestic and international levels.
This has led to
negative global perceptions
of Africans regarding cyber-related offenses.
2. Government Response: ICT/Cybercrime Laws
In response, many African governments have enacted
Cybercrime and ICT laws
.
However, some
provisions in these laws restrict freedom of expression
and
access to information
, violating:
International human rights standards,
African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights,
UN guidelines.
3. Misuse of Laws for Political Control
These laws are being used
not to combat cybercrime
, but rather:
To
target journalists, bloggers, and critics
,
To
suppress dissent
, and
To
shield governments from criticism
.
Many African countries have
weak judicial systems
, making
abuse of these laws easier
.
4. Mislabeling of Legitimate Expression
Ordinary online expressions
, including criticisms and satire, are being criminalized as:
“Fake news,”
“Defamation,” or
“Cybercrime”.
In mature democracies, these would be
civil matters
, not criminal offenses.
5. The Role of Social Media
Social media has disrupted traditional state control over information
.
Governments previously controlled the press through censorship, but
cannot easily censor social media
.
This has triggered
harsh laws and criminal penalties
as new tools to regain control.
6. Call for Reform: Civil Remedies, Not Criminal Sanctions
Criminalization has
not deterred cybercrime
or
internet fraud
.
Instead, it has
undermined free speech and human rights
.
Recommendation:
Criminal sanctions should be
a last resort
—only for expressions that incite violence or pose a clear threat.
Civil remedies
(e.g., defamation lawsuits) should be favored.
African states should adopt the
legal approaches of the European and Inter-American Courts
.
7. Final Thought
The current trend reveals a
deliberate strategy
by some African governments to
use cybercrime laws as political weapons
rather than genuine tools for public safety.
A shift to
protecting digital rights
through proportionate legal mechanisms is essential to uphold democracy and human rights in Africa.

I was trying to demonstrate that it is difficult to know what powers should be separated
ChatGPT dijo:
That's a very compelling angle—and quite a nuanced one. If your objective is to
demonstrate the complexity of determining what powers should be separated
, you're highlighting a fundamental tension in the doctrine itself.
Here's how you could frame or strengthen that argument:
1. Historical and Theoretical Ambiguity
John Locke
only identified
legislative and executive
powers, excluding the judiciary altogether.
Montesquieu
expanded the model to include the
judiciary
, but didn’t clearly define the boundaries between the three arms—especially between executive and legislative powers.
Even
James Madison
, though a champion of the doctrine, conceded in
The Federalist Papers
that
some overlapping is inevitable
.
2. Practical Overlap in Modern Governance
In many parliamentary systems (e.g., the UK), ministers are part of both the
executive and legislature
, blurring the lines.
In presidential systems like Nigeria's or the U.S., while the
separation is clearer on paper
, real-world practices like
executive influence over the legislature
or
judicial appointments by the executive
show significant
interdependence
.
3. Nigerian Context Adds Further Complexity
Traditional systems (Yoruba, Urhobo) didn’t strictly separate powers, but practiced
balance through consensus and consultation
.
The
Nigerian Constitution
separates powers formally (Sections 4–6), but
political realities
(e.g., party dominance, weak institutions) make actual separation difficult.
The
Executive often controls the legislature
via party lines, and
the Judiciary may be undermined
by budgetary dependence or political appointments.
4. The Functional Challenge
Which powers need strict separation?
Should financial appropriation and oversight be strictly legislative?
Should the executive control all policy implementation without interference?
To what extent should courts review legislative or executive decisions?
There’s no universal answer—it’s context-driven.
5. Your Core Argument
The doctrine of separation of powers, though foundational, is not a rigid blueprint. It’s difficult—perhaps impossible—to draw definitive boundaries around legislative, executive, and judicial roles, especially in evolving democracies like Nigeria where political culture, institutional maturity, and historical traditions all shape how power is distributed and exercised.

I just meant there are now governing bodies with global reach
ChatGPT dijo:
Ah, got it! You're pointing out that
in today's interconnected world
, the idea of separation of powers becomes even more complex because
governance isn't confined within national borders anymore
.
Here’s how you might express that insight more clearly in your paper or discussion:
Modern Complexity: Global Governance and the Blurring of Powers
In the contemporary era, it is increasingly difficult to determine which powers should be separated,
not only because of internal constitutional dynamics but also due to the rise of governing bodies with global reach
. Institutions such as the
United Nations
,
World Bank
,
World Trade Organization
,
African Union
, and even
tech giants
like Meta or Google, now influence national policies, legislation, and rights enforcement—often beyond the direct control of any single arm of a national government.
This
global dimension of governance
introduces new layers of authority and influence, challenging the classical notion of separation of powers, which was designed primarily for
nation-states
. For example:
International courts can
overrule national judicial decisions
or
influence domestic legal reforms
.
Trade and financial bodies can
impose policy frameworks
that bind national legislatures.
Digital platforms can
regulate speech
more effectively than local governments, raising questions about
who governs expression
in cyberspace.
In this environment,
power is dispersed
, not just across branches of government, but also across
national and transnational actors
, making the application of the doctrine of separation of powers far more
complex and fluid
than its original form.
