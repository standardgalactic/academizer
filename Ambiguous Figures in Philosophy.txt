It appears you've provided a brief overview and contents of a book named "Mathematics and Explanation: Elements in the Philosophy of Mathematics" by Christopher Pincock. The book seems to tackle some central questions at the intersection of philosophy and mathematics.
However, without specific questions or a detailed context, it's challenging to provide a comprehensive analysis or overview. Nevertheless, here is a brief understanding of the topics presented in the book:
Introduction: This is likely a summary of the book's main objectives and the central questions it will attempt to answer.
The Challenge to Traditional Theories of Scientific Explanation: In this section, the author probably explores how traditional scientific explanations may struggle to incorporate mathematics or mathematical principles effectively.
Counterfactual Accounts of Mathematical Explanation: Here, Pincock may present the idea of how different mathematical realities might affect scientific outcomes or realities - in essence, exploring "what if" scenarios in the context of mathematics.
Explanatory Pluralism: The author might discuss the idea that there may be multiple, valid ways to explain a scientific concept, each potentially relying on different aspects of mathematics.
Autonomy, Indispensability, and Inference to the Best Explanation: This section probably explores the idea that mathematics is both an independent discipline (autonomy) and an essential part of scientific explanation (indispensability). Pincock may discuss the role of mathematics in drawing the best possible conclusion from a set of observations (inference to the best explanation).
Without access to the complete text, this is a speculative outline based on the brief details provided. If you need information on a specific section or question, please provide further details.

1 Introduction 
Some scientif i c explanations involve mathematics. Within mathematics, some 
proofs are said to explain. Do these practices tell us anything about the nature of 
explanationormathematics?InthisElementthisdauntingtopicisdividedintofour 
parts. First, can any traditional theory of scientif i c explanation make sense of the 
place of mathematics in explanation? Each traditional theory that is discussed is 
a monist theory because it supposes that what makes something a legitimate 
explanation is always the same (Section 2). Second, if traditional monist theories 
are inadequate, is there some way to develop a more l exible but still monist 
approach that will clarify how mathematics can help to explain (Section 3)? After 
a consideration of the limitations of some recent l exible monist accounts, the 
options for a pluralist approach are examined. What sort of pluralism about 
explanation is best equipped to clarify how mathematics can help to explain in 
scienceandinmathematicsitself?Whileapluralistcanallowthatdifferentsortsof 
explanations work differently, it still remains important to clarify the value of 
explanations(Section4).Finally,howcanthemathematicalelementsofanexplan- 
ation be integrated into the physical world? Some of the evidence for a novel 
scientif i c posit maybe tracedto the explanatory power that this posit would afford, 
were it to exist. Can a similar kind of explanatory evidence be provided for the 
existence of mathematical objects, and if not, why not? (Section 5). 
In his 2001 paper ���Mathematical Explanation: Problems and Prospects��� 
Paolo Mancosu argues that ���mathematical explanations can be used to test 
theories of scientif i c explanation and that an account of mathematical explan- 
ation might have important consequences for the philosophy of science��� 
(Mancosu 2001, p. 102). This Element builds on this point by considering 
how various approaches to scientif i c explanation can make sense of both (i) 
explanatory proofs in pure mathematics and (ii) scientif i c explanations that turn 
essentially on mathematical resources. In Sections 2���4 I argue that the best 
option for clarifying how these explanations work is pluralism about explan- 
ation. This means that different explanations employ different explanatory 
relevance relations when they indicate why some target is the way that it is. In 
Section 5 I consider the signif i cance of mathematical explanation for the 
interpretation of pure mathematics. I argue that the existence of genuine math- 
ematical explanations does not support the existence of mathematical objects 
through the use of inference to the best explanation. 
My own interest in mathematical explanation can be traced directly to the 
pioneering work of Paolo Mancosu (see especially Mancosu 2000, 2001, 2008, 
2018).1I was lucky enough to have Mancosu as the advisor for my 2002

dissertation on questions related to the applicability of mathematics. This 
Element attempts to follow Mancosu���s call to attend carefully to mathematical

This introduction provides an overview of the topics that Christopher Pincock intends to address in his book "Mathematics and Explanation: Elements in the Philosophy of Mathematics."
Here, Pincock lays out four main questions that guide his exploration:
Can any traditional theory of scientific explanation account for the role of mathematics in explanation? He mentions that traditional theories are monistic, meaning they posit a single underlying structure or principle to all explanation.
If traditional monist theories fall short, can a more flexible monist approach better elucidate how mathematics contributes to explanation?
Pincock then proposes to examine pluralistic approaches to explanation, which accept that different types of explanations may work in fundamentally different ways. He aims to determine which form of pluralism best clarifies the role of mathematics in both science and mathematics itself.
Lastly, he wants to consider how mathematical elements of an explanation can be integrated into the physical world.
Pincock refers to the work of Paolo Mancosu, who has argued for the value of examining mathematical explanations in testing theories of scientific explanation and shaping philosophy of science. Inspired by Mancosu, Pincock defends the pluralistic perspective on explanation, arguing that different explanations employ different relevance relations when explaining why something is the way it is.
However, Pincock distinguishes himself from Mancosu and others who use inference to the best explanation to argue for the existence of mathematical objects. Pincock contends that the existence of mathematical explanations does not necessarily prove the existence of mathematical objects.
Throughout this work, Pincock seeks to adhere to Mancosu's approach of closely examining mathematical and scientific practice in philosophical investigations, aiming to reveal their inner workings and philosophical implications.

2 The Challenge to Traditional Theories of Scientif i c Explanation 
This section starts by introducing i ve principles that are used to test competing 
accounts of explanation, and illustrates how these tests work by developing 
some standard objections to accounts that emphasize derivation and unif i cation 
(Section 2.1). This section also considers three causal accounts of explanation 
and argues that they are unable to make sense of the contrast between explan- 
ations that merely employ mathematics to represent something else and explan- 
ations whose explanatory power is tied more directly to the mathematics 
employed (Section 2.2). 
2.1 Derivation and Unif i cation 
Philosophical investigations of a topic like explanation typically take for 
granted some principles about that topic that make it possible to test competing 
accounts. This Element takes for granted i ve principles. It supposes that an 
account of explanation aims to cover all explanations, including those found in 
science and mathematics. As I will argue, many accounts fail to respect the 
principles articulated in this section.We can thus usethese principles toidentify 
the problems with various accounts of explanation that have been proposed, 
especially when one considers how mathematics i gures into explanations. Of 
course, onemay avoidthese problems by rejecting one ormore ofthe principles 
that are assumed here. 
All participants in these debates agree that a scientif i c explanation provides 
a reason why something is the case. The target of an explanation may be 
something particular, like a specif i c event or state. The target may also be

something general, like a recurring pattern or phenomenon. A legitimate 
explanation of a target indicates why that target is the way it is. This motivates 
our i rst principle for accounts of explanation: 
1. There is an important distinction between a description of some target of 
explanation and an explanation of that target. 
This principle does not def i nitively refute any account, as a defender of any 
account is liable to interpret ���an important distinction��� in their own self-serving 
way. However, I will appeal to this principle to help to clarify my reasons for 
questioning this or that proposal.2 
A closely related principle involves the distinction between the evidence that 
some phenomenon has some character and an explanation of that aspect of the 
phenomenon. For example, careful paleontological investigations may deter- 
mine that the rate of the Earth���s rotation on its axis is decreasing. But additional 
accounts of the gravitational interactions between the Earth and the Moon are 
needed to explain this change. Our second principle is thus: 
2. There is an important distinction between the evidence for some fact and an 
explanation of that fact.

The third principle that I will deploy assumes that there is an order to 
explanation. If one says that B is the case because of A, then A provides 
a reason for B being the way that it is. In some respect, then, A must be more 
basic or fundamental than B. In causal explanation, A is partly responsible for 
theoccurrenceofB,andsointhissenseisalsomore basic.Ifthisisright,thenit 
would be illegitimate to appeal to B when explaining A. One way to summarize 
this point is to say that an explanatory relevance relation is asymmetrical: when 
A stands in that relation to B, then B does not stand in that very relation to 
A. However, the issue is complicated by the fact that an explanation may have 
parts. To allow for explanations with parts, our third principle has the following 
formulation: 
3. (Priority) If A is part of an explanation of B, then B is not part of an 
explanation of A. 
For example, the mass of the Moon is part of the explanation for why the rate of 
rotation of the Earth on its axis is decreasing over time. Our third principle thus 
requires that the decreasing rate of rotation of the Earth on its axis is not part of 
an explanation of the mass of the Moon.

Our fourth and i fth principles help to identify the subject matter of this 
Element. This is the special character of some explanations that involve math- 
ematics. As we will see later in this section, many philosophers maintain that 
some explanations that involve mathematics use the mathematics in a special 
way that renders the explanation genuinely or distinctively mathematical. 
Following Baker and Baron, I will call such explanations ���genuine mathemat- 
ical explanations.���3Of course, not everyone agrees that there are genuine 
mathematical explanations. But our fourth principle takes for granted that 
genuine mathematical explanations exist and requires that an account clarify 
their character: 
4. There is a special way that mathematics may appear in a scientif i c explan- 
ation that makes it a genuine mathematical explanation. 
Our i fth (and i nal) principle relates to pure mathematics. One goal of 
mathematical activity is to obtain a proof of a theorem. Mathematicians some- 
times praise or criticize a proof based on its explanatory power. In certain 
contexts, it is thought valuable to explain why a theorem is the case even after 
it has been given a proof that is otherwise adequate. Our i fth principle assumes 
that this feature of mathematical practice is legitimate: 
5. Some proofs of a theorem explain why that theorem is the case, while other 
proofs do not explain why that theorem is the case.4 
Combining our fourth and i fth principles will turn out to be a powerful tool to 
criticize some proposed accounts of explanation. Many proposals will fail the 
fourth or i fth test because they do not allow for genuine mathematical explan- 
ationsortheyruleoutexplanatoryproofs.Aswiththeotherprinciples,thisdoesnot provide a def i nitive refutation of these proposals, but it does clarify their 
limitations and also why some may reject those proposals. 
Much of our discussion will turn on cases where mathematics appears in an 
explanation. Ourf i rstcaseisananswertothequestion,���Whyistheshadowcast 
by the Ohio Stadium l agpole 49 m in length at 3 p.m.?��� An explanation of this 
state may appeal to the position of the sun at the time and to the height of the 
l agpole. But this information does not seem suff i cient to explain the length of 
the shadow, as there is a deductive gap between the statements that provide this 
information and the statement characterizing the target of the explanation: 
3 See especially Baker (2005), Lange (2013), and Baron (2019). 
4 Contrary to the claims of D���Alessandro (2020), nobody assumes that all explanations in pure 
mathematics are proofs. See especially Mancosu (2001) and Lange (2018b). I restrict my focus 
here to proofs to make the discussion tractable.

1. At 3 p.m., the light rays from the sun hit the top of the l agpole at an angle of 
45��. 
2. The height of the l agpole is 49 m. 
Therefore, the length of the shadow is 49 m. 
To close this deductive gap, we need to add a statement from geometric optics 
that involves trigonometry: 
3. The length x of the shadow cast by any pole of height y m when the light hits 
at an angle of 45�� satisf i es the following equation: tan 45�� �� x m=y m. 
As tan 45�� = 1 and y = 49, it follows that x = 49 (Figure 1). So for this type of 
case, at least, the role for the mathematics in the explanation is to permit the 
deduction of a statement characterizing the explanatory target. 
Although the idea has a long history, Hempel is the philosopher who did the 
most to argue that a necessary condition on an important kind of explanation is 
that the explanation provide a deduction of a statement describing the explana- 
tory target. Hempel called such explanations ���deductive-nomological��� (D-N) 
explanations. The term ���nomological��� indicates an additional necessary condi- 
tion on such deductions: they must deduce their target statement through the 
essential use of a scientif i c law. Our statement 3 would be the law for this 
D-N explanation. This is Hempel���s way of distinguishing an explanation from 
a description.

The introduction and part of the second section of this paper focus on the intricate relationship between scientific explanation and mathematics. The paper examines how mathematics can aid explanation in scientific theories. The research divides the topic into four main sections, discussing traditional theories of scientific explanation and their efficacy in incorporating mathematical elements. It discusses whether monistic theories, which believe a single factor legitimizes all explanations, can successfully accommodate the role of mathematics in scientific explanation. The paper proposes a flexible monistic approach that can explicate how mathematics assists in explaining scientific phenomena. The paper then discusses the limitations of these monistic theories and explores potential pluralistic approaches that can better incorporate mathematical explanation. Lastly, the paper discusses the incorporation of mathematical elements into the physical world.
The author takes inspiration from Paolo Mancosu's work and proposes that pluralism about explanation is the best way to understand how these explanations work. This means that different explanations employ different explanatory relevance relations when they indicate why some target is the way it is. The author argues that the existence of genuine mathematical explanations does not support the existence of mathematical objects through the use of inference to the best explanation.
The second section discusses the principles used to test different accounts of explanation. The paper talks about five main principles: the difference between a description and an explanation, the difference between evidence for a fact and an explanation of that fact, the priority principle, the presence of genuine mathematical explanations, and the presence of explanatory proofs in mathematics. The paper uses these principles to critique various accounts of explanation that have been proposed, especially those that fail to accommodate the role of mathematics.
The section also introduces a case that requires the use of mathematics for its explanation, highlighting the necessity and importance of the integration of mathematics into scientific explanations. Finally, it introduces Hempel's concept of "deductive-nomological" explanations, which considers the essential use of a scientific law in the deduction of an explanation, distinguishing it from mere descriptions.

Hempel offered different motivations for the need for laws in explanations. 
In his famous Aspects of Scientif i c Explanation, for example, Hempel (1965) 
says ���[(i)] the argument shows that, given the particular circumstances and the 
laws in question, the occurrence of the phenomenon was to be expected; and 
[(ii)] it is in this sense that the explanation enables us to understand why the 
phenomenon occurred.��� But in addition ���[(iii)] it is in virtue of such laws that 
the particular facts cited in the explanans possess explanatory relevance to the 
explanandum phenomenon��� (p. 337).5The relationship between (i), (ii), and 
(iii) is far from clear. One interpretation of Hempel is that what makes 
something explanatorily relevant is that this fact could have been used to 
lawfully predict that state in advance. It is this that constitutes our understand- 
ing of that state. 
The most inf l uential objection to Hempel���s D-N account takes for granted 
that some laws permit deductions with a troubling sort of symmetry. Our 
l agpole case was in fact introduced into these debates to illustrate one such 
troubling case.6For in addition to the presumably acceptable explanation just 
given, the following deductive argument also seems to meet all of Hempel���s 
necessary conditions on D-N explanations: 
1. At3p.m.,thelightraysfromthesunhitthetopofthef l agpoleatanangleof 
45��. 
2���. The length of the shadow is 49 m. 
3���. Theheightyofanypolethatcastsashadowoflengthxmwhenthelighthits 
at an angle of 45�� satisf i es the equation: tan 45�� �� x m=y m. 
Therefore, the height of the l agpole is 49 m. 
If (3) is a law, then (3���) is also a law. As both arguments are deductively valid, 
Hempel seems to lack any principled reason to exclude this explanation. But if 
bothexplanationsaregranted,thenweviolateourthirdprincipleconcerningthe 
order of explanatory priority. This principle says that if A is part of an explan- 
ation for B, then B cannot be part of an explanation for A. But here we have the 
height of the l agpole being part of an explanation of the length of the shadow, 
and also the length of the shadow being part of an explanation of the height of 
the l agpole. Thus we face a choice between agreeing with Hempel and main- 
taining an order of explanatory priority. Applying our third principle requires 
rejecting Hempel���s approach to explanation. 
Most philosophers of science have accepted explanatory priority and thus 
rejected Hempel���s D-N account as inadequate. By far the most popular 
5 The explanandum is the target of the explanation or what is being explained. The explanans is the 
explanation itself or what provides the explanation. 
6 See Salmon (1989) for extensive discussion of this and other objections to Hempel.

approach adds a causal condition on explanation, which we consider in 
Section 2.2. However, Kitcher offered a different diagnosis of the failings of 
Hempel���s approach. He argued that Hempel failed because he tried to assess 
explanations individually. The alternative approach that Kitcher pursued is to 
evaluate explanations globally based on how well they help to unify or system- 
atize a collection of accepted statements: ���Science advances our understanding 
of nature by showing us how to derive descriptions of many phenomena, using 
the same derivation again and again, and, in demonstrating this, it teaches us 
how to reduce the number of types of facts we have to accept as ultimate (or 
brute)��� (Kitcher 1989, p. 432). At any given time in the history of science, there 
will be some set of accepted statements K. The ���explanatory store��� over K will 
specify a set of argument patterns that permit some members of K to be derived 
from other members of K. An explanation (with respect to this K) will then be

a chain of derivations that uses only patterns in the explanatory store to derive a member of K. This store then represents the unity of scientific knowledge.
To compare different stores with respect to a given K, Kitcher introduces two measures: the stringency of a store is a measure of its generality, the less stringent the more general; the fertility of a store is a measure of its productivity, the more fertile the more productive. The best store for a given K is then the store that strikes the best balance between stringency and fertility.
Kitcher���s account of scientific explanation, known as the "unification account," respects our third principle of explanatory priority. In the l agpole case, for example, there is a temporal asymmetry that distinguishes between the height of the l agpole and the length of its shadow. The l agpole exists before the shadow, and it does not change when the shadow does. So, the unification approach would allow the height of the l agpole to explain the length of the shadow, but not vice versa.
However, Kitcher���s account faces other challenges when it comes to genuine mathematical explanations and explanatory proofs. In both cases, it seems that Kitcher���s approach makes it difficult to accommodate our fourth and fifth principles.
Take the case of genuine mathematical explanations first. Many examples of such explanations do not fit easily within Kitcher���s unification framework. As an example, let's consider the so-called ���number of planets��� case, a well-known example of a genuine mathematical explanation. This case involves a mathematical fact, namely that the number 5 is prime, that explains a physical fact, namely that there are no stable solar systems with five celestial bodies following the same orbit. According to Kitcher, an explanation involves deriving a fact from other facts using the patterns in the explanatory store. But in this case, the fact that 5 is prime is not derived from any other facts. Instead, it is the explanatory fact that helps us to derive the physical fact about the solar systems.
Similar problems arise when we consider explanatory proofs. Many proofs in mathematics are considered explanatory not because they derive a mathematical result from other results in a systematic way, but because they reveal some insight or deep connection that was previously hidden. For instance, a proof of Fermat���s Last Theorem might be considered explanatory if it reveals a deep connection between the theorem and some other areas of mathematics, such as elliptic curves or modular forms. Such a proof would not fit within Kitcher���s unification framework, which focuses on the derivation of facts from other facts in a systematic way.
In sum, while Kitcher���s unification account of scientific explanation provides an interesting alternative to Hempel���s D-N account, it still faces challenges when it comes to accommodating genuine mathematical explanations and explanatory proofs. These challenges suggest that a different approach may be needed to fully understand the nature of explanation in science and mathematics.

cases where the mathematics is present in a legitimate explanation but the 
mathematics itself is not explanatory. One way to parse such cases is that the 
mathematics is there functioning merely to represent something else that is 
doingtheexplaining. Butthere might stillbe othercases wherethemathematics 
is doing the explaining. In ���Mathematical Explanation by Law��� Baron calls this 
the ���genuineness problem���: ���to uphold a meaningful distinction between 
explanatory and non-explanatory uses of mathematics in science��� (Baron 
2019).14This is our fourth principle for an account of explanation. Baron���s 
plan (in this paper) for how to solve the genuineness problem involves building 
on Hempel���s and Kitcher���s emphasis on deduction. But, unlike Hempel and 
Kitcher, Baron considers the different ways that mathematics can afford deriv- 
ations. In one kind of case, the information that the mathematics contributes 
concerning the explanatory target is exhausted by how the mathematics is 
representing the target. Consider, for example, a case where a mathematical 
claim conveys information about a physical system by i rst picking out an 
abstract mathematical structure and then relating it to the target by some kind 
of structural mapping. Our l agpole case is like this, where different geometric 
lines are interpreted in terms of light rays, physical heights of objects, and 
lengths of shadows. For such cases, it looks like we have only a mathematical 
representation of some nonmathematical explanation. Baron summarizes this 
kind of descriptive information this way: ���M contains descriptive physical 
information relevant to [target] P when M contains information about an aspect 
of some mathematical structure that is mapped into the physical structure 
corresponding to P��� (Baron 2019, p. 709, emphasis added). But Baron argues 
that in other cases the mathematical claims provide information about the target 
over and above what is represented via these mappings: in such cases 
M provides information about P ���in virtue of carrying information about an 
aspect of a mathematical structure and yet that aspect is not a relatum in 
a mapping relation between the mathematical and physical structures at 
issue��� (Baron 2019, p. 710). 
My worry about Baron���s approach is that information can be provided in this 
way, and so not be descriptive in Baron���s sense, and yet still fail to be explana- 
tory. To help readers appreciate this worry, I will i rst summarize a case where it 
looks as if Baron���s test works. Consider the seven bridges that at one time 
connected four areas of the city of K��nigsberg (Figure 5). 
It turns out that it is impossible to make a tour of these bridges that crosses 
each bridge exactly once. One explanation of this impossibility relates the 
bridges to an abstract mathematical graph (Figure 6).
1 / 1

ChatGPT
In this case, the city of K��nigsberg is represented by the vertices of the graph and the bridges are represented by the edges. In graph theory, it is a known fact that such a tour, called an Eulerian path, is possible if and only if exactly zero or two vertices have an odd degree (degree refers to the number of edges incident to a vertex). However, in the K��nigsberg graph, all four vertices have an odd degree, which makes an Eulerian path impossible.
In Baron's view, the mathematical fact about Eulerian paths is providing information that goes beyond what is represented in the graph. Specifically, the fact that an Eulerian path is impossible is not just a feature of the mathematical structure that represents the K��nigsberg bridges, but rather an independent mathematical fact that applies to this structure. So, according to Baron, the mathematics is not merely representing the physical situation, but is also contributing to the explanation of why an Eulerian path is impossible.
However, there might be cases where the mathematical representation provides additional information about a physical situation, yet this information is not explanatory in the relevant sense. Suppose, for example, we have a physical system that can be accurately modeled by a mathematical structure, and suppose this structure has some feature that is not reflected in the physical system. According to Baron's criteria, the mathematics is providing additional information about the system. Yet this information might not be explanatory, if it doesn't illuminate why the physical system behaves as it does.
To illustrate, consider a situation where we use complex numbers to model a physical system, such as the behavior of an electrical circuit. Complex numbers have a feature, namely their "imaginary" part, that does not correspond to any feature of the physical system. In this case, the mathematical representation is providing additional information (about imaginary parts of complex numbers) that is not mirrored in the physical system. But this information is not explanatory, as it doesn't help us understand why the circuit behaves as it does. This is the worry raised about Baron's approach.
Thus, while Baron's account offers an interesting way to distinguish between explanatory and non-explanatory uses of mathematics in science, it might not be sufficient to address all cases. The genuineness problem, as Baron calls it, might require a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between mathematics and physical systems, as well as a deeper exploration of what counts as genuinely explanatory information.

In this section I have considered six strict monist accounts of explanation that 
include mathematics. Hempel, Kitcher, and Baron had diff i culties with our i rst 
threeprinciplestiedtodescription,evidence,orexplanatory priority.Thecausal 
monist views of the new mechanists, Lewis and Woodward made all uses of 
mathematics in explanation representational. So, if we insist on our fourth 
principle that some mathematical explanations are not representational, then 
we must adopt a different approach to explanation. 
3 Counterfactual Accounts of Mathematical Explanation 
A monist about explanation who wants to include both causal explanations and 
genuine mathematical explanations must somehow generalize their explanatory 
relevance relation so that it covers both sorts of cases. One approach involves 
treating a mathematical claim like a causal law: we consider variations to the 
actual world and use the mathematical claim, like we would use a causal law, to 
indicate what else would change. This is the core idea of Reutlinger���s general- 
ization of a causal counterfactual approach to explanation (Section 3.1). 
Another approach treats a mathematical fact as more like a cause: we should 
consider variations in the mathematical fact itself and what results from this 
variation. This is just like how, in the causal case, we consider what would

explained.22Finally, Dependency requires that the nomic generalization sup- 
port a counterfactual with a special form: ���if the initial conditions ... had been 
different than they actually are (in at least one specif i c way deemed possible in 
the light of the nomic generalizations), then E [the target of the explanation] ... 
would have been different as well��� (Reutlinger 2018, p. 79). A nomic general- 
ization supports a counterfactual when the procedure for evaluating the coun- 
terfactual leads to the counterfactual being true, on the assumption that the 
nomic generalization is true. Reutlinger helpfully illustrates how this works for 
a number of examples, including the bridges case we discussed in Section 2.1. 
The nomic generalization in this case is the mathematical theorem that a graph 
Ghas the right sort of path just in case ���(i) all the nodes in Gare connected to an 
even number of edges, or (ii) exactly two nodes in G (one of which we take as 
our starting point) are connected to an odd number of edges��� (Reutlinger 2018, 
p. 84). One counterfactual that is supported by this theorem is ���if all parts of 
K��nigsberg had been connected to an even number of bridges, then people 
would not have failed to cross all of the bridges exactly once��� (Reutlinger 2018, 
p. 84). The truth of this counterfactual means that Dependency is satisf i ed. As 
the other three conditions that Reutlinger imposes are also satisf i ed, the bridges 
case counts as an explanation.

Alexander Reutlinger proposes a counterfactual theory of explanation, which attempts to define a single "explanatory relevance relation" that can account for both causal and mathematical explanations. This monistic theory consists of four conditions: Structure, Veridicality, Inference, and Dependency.
Structure: The explanation must include a nomic generalization (i.e., a law-like statement, which can be a physical law in the case of causal explanations, or a mathematical theorem in the case of mathematical explanations) and some additional statements relating to initial or boundary conditions.
Veridicality: These statements must be true, or at least approximately so.
Inference: The statements in the explanation must entail the statement to be explained.
Dependency: The nomic generalization must support a counterfactual statement of a special form. Specifically, if the initial conditions had been different in some specific way, then the outcome to be explained would also have been different.
Reutlinger illustrates this approach with the bridges of K��nigsberg case. The nomic generalization is a mathematical theorem about Eulerian paths, and one counterfactual supported by this theorem is "if all parts of K��nigsberg had been connected to an even number of bridges, then people would not have failed to cross all of the bridges exactly once." Since all four conditions are satisfied, the explanation counts as an explanation according to Reutlinger's theory.
However, while this approach can accommodate many cases of mathematical explanation, it's not clear that it can handle all such cases. Some mathematical explanations might not involve counterfactuals in the way that Reutlinger's theory requires. This suggests that a pluralistic approach, which allows for different kinds of explanation in different contexts, might be needed. In particular, we might need to acknowledge that mathematical explanations can sometimes be fundamentally different from causal explanations, and that these differences require different explanatory frameworks.

3.2 Counterfactuals Involving Impossible Worlds 
Asecondstrategyforgeneralizingacounterfactualanalysisofcausalexplanationis 
to suppose that mathematical facts stand in the same relation to their targets that 
a cause stands to its effect. With this analogy in mind, we should consider 
counterfactuals where that very mathematical fact is altered just as we consider 
counterfactuals where the actual cause is altered. This requires counterfactuals that 
alter the truth of some mathematical claims. As most assume that these truths are 
necessary truths, there will be no possible world as usually conceived to consider. 
The three proposals we discuss in this section avoid this by invoking ���impossible 
worlds��� so that these mathematical counterfactuals have nontrivial truth-values. 
3.2.1 Baron, Colyvan, and Ripley���s Counterfactual Approach 
A generalization of Lewis��� counterfactual account of causal explanation has 
been pursued along these lines by Baron, Colyvan, and Ripley (BCR) in two 
papers, ���How Mathematics Can Make a Difference��� (Baron et al. 2017) and ���A 
Counterfactual Approach to Explanation in Mathematics��� (Baron et al. 2020). 
The same counterfactual approach is pursued in both articles, but the 2017 
article focuses on mathematical explanations of physical phenomena, while the 
2020 article discusses mathematical explanations that are internal to mathemat- 
ics. I will develop their proposal using two examples that we have discussed so 
far: the bridges case and the angle bisection case (Section 2.1). For the bridges, 
onekeymathematicalclaimis(M1)thatifagraphhasfournodesandeachnode 
has three or i ve edges, then there will not be a sequence of edges that connects 
nodes and that includes each edge exactly once. In the angle bisection case, 
a central mathematical claim is (M2) that an equilateral triangle can be con- 
structed on any line segment. Baron, Colyvan, and Ripley���s proposal is that 
these mathematical claims are part of the explanation of their respective targets 
just in case a counterfactual with a special character comes out true. The 
counterfactual says that were this mathematical claim not to be true, then the 
target phenomenon would not occur. That is, were M1 to fail for graphs, then 
there would be a circuit of the bridges, and were M2 to fail for line segments, 
then there would not be a bisection construction. 
These counterfactuals for mathematics raise a number of puzzles concerning 
their interpretation and how to evaluate them. Baron, Colyvan, and Ripley 
generally follow Lewis in providing a recipe for how to isolate the situation

The second strategy for generalizing a counterfactual analysis of causal explanation involves considering mathematical facts in the same way as causal relations. This would involve imagining counterfactual scenarios where mathematical truths are altered, just as we consider counterfactuals where the cause is altered. However, this approach runs into a significant problem: mathematical truths are typically considered to be necessary truths, meaning that they hold in all possible worlds. This means there's no possible world where these truths could be altered.
To get around this issue, some philosophers propose considering "impossible worlds" ��� hypothetical situations that violate our usual understanding of logical or mathematical truths. This allows us to give nontrivial truth-values to mathematical counterfactuals.
Baron, Colyvan, and Ripley (BCR) adopt this approach in their counterfactual account of mathematical explanation. They suggest that a mathematical claim contributes to an explanation if and only if a certain counterfactual is true: if the mathematical claim were not true, then the phenomenon to be explained would not occur.
However, this approach introduces various puzzles. For example, it's not obvious how to interpret counterfactuals that involve mathematical impossibilities, or how to evaluate their truth. According to BCR, we should compare the actual world to the impossible world by holding fixed the mapping between the mathematical structure and the physical phenomenon, and then altering the mathematical structure in the least disruptive way possible. But even with these guidelines, it's not clear how to proceed in many cases. The concept of an "impossible world" is also quite controversial, and not all philosophers accept its validity.

privileged mathematical ontology ��� not just anything goes��� 
(Povich 2021, p. 537). It does seem right to insist that genuine mathematical 
explanations will rely on some privileged mathematical ontology.35However, 
Povich���s account mandates ruling out mathematical properties like being near 
even simply because they are part of mathematical theorems that have 
a biconditional form. By contrast, mathematical practice often takes these prop- 
ertiestobesignif i cant,inpart because theydoexplain.Totakea simpleexample, 
Euclidean triangles are just those plane i gures whose interior angles sum to 180 
degrees. We cannot exclude either of these properties from our mathematical 
ontology simply because, if we adopt Povich���s account, it leads to violations of 
directionality. Given the ontology that we i nd in mathematical practice, if we 
accept directionality, then we must reject Povich���s account. 
One could preserve a monist counterfactual account and standard mathemat- 
ical ontology by giving up directionality. This is consistent with explanatory 
priority, but would involve awkward combinations of explanations that differed 
only in the objects involved, as with K��nigsberg and city L discussed 
previously.36 3.3 Conclusion 
This chapter has considered four different l exible monist proposals that gener- 
alized counterfactual analyses of causal explanation to include some noncausal 
cases. The counterfactual theory developed by Reutlinger made do with pos- 
sible worlds, but as a result allows for too many noncausal explanations that 
violate our principles concerning description, evidence, and priority. Baron, 
Colyvan, and Ripley (Baron et al. 2017, 2020; Baron 2020) and Povich (2021) 
went further and invoked impossible worlds where some mathematical truths

non-ontic approach to topological explanation.

come out false. Here I objected that the accounts either failed to meet our four 
principles or, in the case of Povich, failed Povich���s own directionality con- 
straint. The upshot of the limitations of these proposals is the rejection of 
monism, even in its more l exible form. While some explanations will turn on 
the truth of some sort of counterfactual, other explanations will involve 
a different explanatory relevance relation. I consider the prospects for this 
kind of pluralism in the next section. 
4 Explanatory Pluralism 
A pluralist about explanation supposes that the best way to make sense of the 
variety of explanations in science and mathematics is to posit two or more 
explanatory relevance relations. As noted in Section 2, I take these relations to 
connect facts in the world when one fact explains another. The views we will 
consider in this section accept a notion of causal explanatory relevance. But

4.1 Explanatory Proofs in Mathematics 4.1.1 Steiner on Explanatory Proofs 
If we examine mathematical practice, then we i nd that mathematicians value 
some proofs because those proofs not only show that a theorem is true, but also 
explain why the theorem is true. This is our i fth principle from Section 2.1. 
Steiner offered a pioneering analysis of these explanatory proofs.37As we will 
seeinSection 4.2.1,Steineralso usedthisanalysis toclarifywhatwe arecalling 
genuine mathematical explanations in science. The basic assumption of 
Steiner���s approach to explanatory proof is that ���to explain the behavior of an 
entity, one deduces the behavior from the essence or nature of the entity��� 
37 Another analysis of explanatory proof was offered by Kitcher and considered in Section 2.1 
(Kitcher 1989). See Hafner and Mancosu (2008) for a critical examination of Kitcher���s analysis. 
See also Mancosu (2001), Pincock (2015b), D���Alessandro (2021), and Ryan (2021) for add- 
itional proposals and cases that are too involved to develop here. One attempt to analyze 
explanatory proofs in terms of counterfactuals was brief l y considered in Section 3.2.1. 
34The Philosophy of Mathematics 

(Steiner 1978a, p. 143). However, Steiner claims that these essences are not 
available for mathematical objects. The next best thing is a ���characterizing 
property��� of that object: ���a property unique to a given entity or structure within 
a family or domain of such entities or structures��� (Steiner 1978a, p. 143), where 
the notion offamily istakenas basic. We can illustrate characterizing properties 
by returning to Euclid���s proof that any angle can be bisected (Section 2.1). As 
we saw, this proof can be extended into a family of proofs that any angle can be 
divided into n equal parts if, for some m, n = 2m= 2, 4, 8, 16, ���. If we are 
considering a family of angles divided into equal parts, then a characterizing 
property of the objects in this family is how many parts the division has. Then, 
one of our proofs shows how a bisected angle is available using a particular 
construction, while an angle divided into four equal parts is available using 
a closely related construction. 
Steiner���s proposal is that an explanatory proof invokes a characterizing 
property in a way that allows one to vary that characterizing property to arrive 
at other proofs concerning other objects in the domain: ���an explanatory proof 
depends on a characterizing property of something mentioned in the theorem: if 
we ���deform��� the proof, substituting the characterizing property of a related 
entity, we get a related theorem��� (Steiner 1978a, p. 147). Deforming a proof 
may involve a kind of mechanical manipulation, or it could be something more 
creative that preserves the original ���proof-idea��� (Steiner 1978a, p. 147). Our 
collection of angle division proofs satisfy Steiner���s criteria. For we can see how 
shifting from a bisected angle to an angle with four equal parts requires an 
extended construction. So we have a family of proofs, where appropriate shifts 
in the characterizing properties go along with new, successful constructions. 
One objection to Steiner���s proposal is that there are nonexplanatory proofs 
that meet his tests. The case I will focus on is the classif i cation of i nite simple 
groups. A group is a type of object from abstract algebra that has found 
application throughout mathematics and physics. The i nite simple groups are 
(in a sense) the building blocks of all the other i nite groups, just as the prime 
numbers are the building blocks of all the other natural numbers. After a great 
deal of effort, an exhaustive classif i cation of the i nite simple groups was 
achieved in the 1980s. The resulting proof of the ���Classif i cation Theorem��� 
showed how every i nite simple group was one of 29 identif i able types.38Three 
of these types were expected, but the remaining 26 types are called ���sporadic��� 
as they fail to exhibit any clear connections to one another or to the three 
expected types. This has led some practitioners to conclude that even though

This section considers a pluralistic approach to explanations, arguing that making sense of the range of explanations in science and mathematics requires positing multiple explanatory relevance relations. Pluralism proposes that different kinds of explanations are relevant for different kinds of phenomena.
One example of this approach is found in mathematical practice, where mathematicians often value proofs not only for their logical correctness, but also for their explanatory power - they not only show that a theorem is true, but also explain why it is true.
Steiner offers a significant analysis of these explanatory proofs. His basic assumption is that to explain the behavior of an entity, one deduces the behavior from the essence or nature of the entity. However, he acknowledges that these essences are not easily available for mathematical objects. Instead, Steiner uses the concept of a "characterizing property," a property unique to an entity or structure within a family or domain of such entities or structures.
According to Steiner, an explanatory proof depends on a characterizing property of something mentioned in the theorem. If we adjust the proof by substituting the characterizing property of a related entity, we get a related theorem. This idea can be illustrated using angle division proofs.
However, an objection to Steiner's proposal is that there are nonexplanatory proofs that meet his criteria. An example is the classification of finite simple groups. Although the Classification Theorem categorizes all finite simple groups into 29 identifiable types, the grouping doesn't clearly explain why these groups fall into these categories, particularly for the 26 "sporadic" types that don't exhibit clear connections to each other or to the expected types. As such, even though the Classification Theorem categorizes these groups, it doesn't seem to explain them in a satisfying way.

This section discusses Mark Steiner's work on explanatory proofs in mathematics. Steiner (1978a) presented a pioneering analysis of explanatory proofs, claiming that the explanatory power of a proof lies in the deduction of the behavior of an entity from its essence or nature. However, Steiner posits that essences are not available for mathematical objects. Instead, he suggests the use of a ���characterizing property��� - a unique property that a given entity or structure within a domain possesses.
Steiner���s proposal suggests that an explanatory proof hinges on a characterizing property of something mentioned in the theorem, allowing for variations of that characterizing property to derive other proofs concerning other objects in the domain. The "deformation" of a proof by substituting the characterizing property of a related entity may produce a related theorem.
However, the text raises an objection to Steiner's proposal by presenting a counterexample: the classification of finite simple groups, which was achieved in the 1980s. The exhaustive proof for the classification showed how every finite simple group belonged to one of 29 identifiable types, with 26 of them being sporadic, meaning they don't exhibit any clear connections to one another or to the three expected types. Despite this classification, some mathematicians believe that an explanation for the occurrence and structure of these groups is still lacking. This suggests that there may be non-explanatory proofs that still meet Steiner's criteria, thus posing a potential problem for his proposal.

4.2 Pluralist Accounts of Genuine Mathematical Explanations 
4.2.1 Steiner on Genuine Mathematical Explanations 
In a companion paper to the one discussed in Section 4.1.1, Steiner extends his 
account of explanatory proofs to an account of what we are calling genuine 
mathematical explanations (Steiner 1978b). Recall from Section 2.1 that these 
were initially identif i ed as scientif i c explanations that involve mathematics, but 
where the mathematics is not functioning merely to represent some nonmathe- 
matical explainers like causes. Steiner proposes a simple test for genuine 
mathematical explanation: ���when we remove the physics, we remain with 
a mathematical explanation ��� of a mathematical truth!��� (Steiner 1978b, 
p. 19). This can be seen as an ancestor of Baron���s 2019 thought that we should 
consider the mathematics that is not used to represent causes or other physical 
explainers (see again Section 2.1): we have explanatory information and yet 
���thataspectisnotarelatuminamappingrelationbetweenthemathematicaland 
physical structures at issue��� (Baron 2019, p. 710). Then that explanatory

information may extend to associated physical structures, but not simply 
because the mathematics is representing causes. 
In his 2012 article ���Science-Driven Mathematical Explanation,��� Baker con- 
vincingly argues that Steiner���s account of genuine mathematical explanations 
does not work (Baker 2012). Baker invokes genuine mathematical explanations 
where no proof is judged to explain the relevant theorem. Baker���s main case 
here is the fact that bees use hexagons to build their honeycombs. This is 
explained using the theorem that hexagons are the most eff i cient way to tile 
a two-dimensional plane while minimizing the tiling materials. While this 
explanation seems to be a good one, and also one that qualif i es as a genuine 
mathematical explanation, there are no explanatory proofs of the theorem 
employed. The same point can made with our example of the bridges of 
K��nigsberg: we showed how this amounted to a genuine explanation of the 
impossibility of the bridge crossings, and yet no reference was made to the kind 
of proof that the mathematical theorem has. 
One could also object to Steiner based on nonexplanations that satisfy all of 
his conditions. Consider an uncontroversial case of an explanatory proof from 
pure mathematics like the proof of Varignon���s theorem sketched in 
Section 4.1.2. The theorem says that for any quadrilateral, if the midpoints of 
adjacent sides are connected, then a parallelogram results. Consider any 
explanatory target that has the same form as the theorem such as that all metal 
wires, when connected to a battery, conduct electricity. Then we can interpret 
���quadrilateral��� as standing for being a metal wire, ���connecting adjacent mid- 
points��� as standing for being connected to a battery, and ���resulting in 
a parallelogram��� as standing for conducting electricity. This interpretation of 
the mathematical theorem then transforms the proof of the theorem into 
a derivation of the claim that all metal wires, when connected to a battery, 
conduct electricity. But nobody would count this as an explanation. Still, 
Steiner���s test is met: ���when we remove the physics, we remain with 
a mathematical explanation ��� of a mathematical truth.��� So it should be clear

This section continues the discussion on the philosophy of mathematical explanations, moving onto pluralist accounts of genuine mathematical explanations and revisiting Steiner's theories.
Steiner, in a follow-up to his previous work, proposes a test for genuine mathematical explanation: if you can remove the physical aspects and still be left with a mathematical explanation of a mathematical truth, then it qualifies as a genuine mathematical explanation. This concept is seen as a precursor to Baron's 2019 idea, which focuses on mathematical aspects that do not function merely to represent physical phenomena.
However, Baker (2012) contests Steiner's account, pointing out cases where genuine mathematical explanations exist without explanatory proofs for the related theorem. Baker's main example is the honeycomb structure of bees, which uses hexagonal tiling due to its efficiency. This mathematical explanation doesn't rely on a specific proof of the theorem employed.
The text also points out possible objections to Steiner's proposal, illustrating them with Varignon's theorem, a case from pure mathematics, and its relation to the electrical conductivity of metal wires. Even when Steiner's test is applied and physics is removed, the result doesn't count as a true explanation.
This shows that Steiner's test may not be a sufficient criterion for a genuine mathematical explanation. Responding to this criticism could require more stringent criteria for the embedding of mathematics within physical phenomena, but characterizing these in explanatory terms poses a challenge.

5 Autonomy, Indispensability, and Inference to the Best 
Explanation 
Clarifying how mathematical explanations work is an important part of clarify- 
ing how the subject matter of mathematics relates to the subject matter of 
sciences like physics, psychology, and economics. In this section I consider 
how the relationship between mathematics and physics is both similar to and 
different from the relationship between psychology and physics. To start, I will 
argue that mathematics is autonomous from physics by comparing mathemat- 
ical explanation to psychological explanation (Section 5.1). This is followed by 
an examination of some inf l uential arguments for a platonist interpretation of 
mathematics (Section 5.2). A platonist claims that mathematics is about 
a special domain of abstract objects. An ���indispensability��� argument for pla- 
tonism relies on mathematical explanations having a certain character. I will try 
to identify what this character is and then turn to a brief consideration of how an 
appeal to inference to the best explanation (IBE) argument could deliver 
a platonist interpretation (Section 5.3). 
5.1 Putnam on the Autonomy of the Special Sciences 
What sort of autonomy should we claim for pure mathematics? One classic 
discussion was offered by Putnam. His ���Philosophy and Our Mental Life��� 
argues for a signif i cant analogy between how psychology relates to physics 
and how mathematics relates to physics. In the case of both psychology and 
mathematics, unlike physics, what is important is that a theory provide 
a description of a range of systems that are related by a ���functional isomorph- 
ism��� (Putnam 1975, p. 292). A functional isomorphism obtains when there is 
a function that maps the objects, properties, and relations of one system to the 
objects, properties, and relations of the other system in such a way that the 
structure of the i rst system is preserved in the second system. Putnam develops 
this point for mathematics using the example of a cubical peg and a board with 
two holes where ���the peg passes through the square hole, and it does not pass 
through the round hole��� (Putnam 1975, p. 295, emphasis removed). Putnam 
argues that an explanation of this fact involves the geometrical features of the 
peg andthe hole:thecubical peg hasa height of15/16���,the circular holeis 1���in 
diameter, and the square has sides that are 1��� long. For Putnam, ���The explan- 
ation is that the board is rigid, the peg is rigid, and as a matter of geometrical 
fact, the round hole is smaller than the peg, the square hole is bigger than the 
cross-section of the peg��� (Putnam 1975, p. 296). For the peg to i t through the 
round hole, the diagonal line connecting two corners of some side of the peg 
must be less than the diameter of the hole. But each of these diagonal lines is 
about 1.33��� in length (via the Pythagorean theorem). So this is why the peg fails 
to go through the round hole. But the square hole is larger than this side of the 
square peg, and so it may pass through. 
Putnam calls the geometrical explanation of this fact ���autonomous���: ���The 
same explanation will go in any world (whatever the microstructure) in which 
those higher-level structural features are present. In that sense this explanation

In this section, the relationship between mathematics and other fields of science such as physics, psychology, and economics is explored. More specifically, it examines the autonomy of mathematics from these sciences and the arguments for a Platonist interpretation of mathematics.
The autonomy of pure mathematics is compared to the autonomy of psychology in relation to physics, based on a classic discussion by Putnam. In his argument, both psychology and mathematics provide descriptions of systems related by a "functional isomorphism". He illustrates this using the example of a cubical peg and a board with two differently shaped holes, demonstrating that a geometrical explanation of why the peg can pass through one hole and not the other is "autonomous". This explanation remains valid in any world where these higher-level structural features are present, regardless of the microstructure of the world.
This line of thought introduces the discussion about Platonist interpretations of mathematics, the idea that mathematics is about a special domain of abstract objects. Such a belief often relies on the indispensability argument, which argues that certain mathematical theories are indispensable to our best scientific theories and hence must be true. It then moves towards an evaluation of the appeal to the Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE) argument in order to deliver a Platonist interpretation.

5.2 Explanatory Indispensability Arguments for Mathematical 
Platonism 
Many recent discussions of mathematical explanation are motivated by what are 
called ���enhanced��� or explanatory indispensability arguments for platonism. 
A platonist says that mathematics is about a special domain of abstract objects. 
These objects are outside of space and time and so are causally isolated from 
concrete,physicalobjects.ColyvanandBakercanbecreditedwithadvancingthese 
newindispensabilityargumentsintheirstrongestform(Colyvan2001,2002,2010, 
2012; Baker 2005, 2009b, 2012, 2021). In his 2001 book The Indispensability of 
Mathematics,Colyvanpresentedageneralindispensabilityargumentthathetraced 
back to Quine and Putnam (Colyvan 2001, p. 11). This argument was then ref i ned 
by Baker to focus more directly on explanatory considerations: 
1. We ought rationally to believe in the existence of any entity that plays an 
indispensable explanatory role in our best scientif i c theories. 
64 There is a vast literature on these arguments that tends to focus on psychology. See Lyon (2012) 
for an approach to mathematical explanations that uses Jackson and Pettit (1990) to develop an 
account of mathematical explanations in these terms. 
2. Mathematical objects play an indispensable explanatory role in science. 
3. Hence, we ought rationally to believe in the existence of mathematical 
objects (Baker 2009b, p. 613). 
The entities that an agent ought to believe in are sometimes termed their 
���ontological commitments.��� In Quine���s inf l uential formulation, encoded in 
premise 1, the entities that one takes to exist should be identif i ed through 
a regimentation of our best scientif i c theories. In the course of this regimenta- 
tion, many apparent ontological commitments will be shown to be not genuine, 
as with the average household or shadows. But the remaining ontological 
commitments that cannot be eliminated or dispensed with are the ones the 
agent is stuck with. Otherwise, in Putnam���s apt formulation, one is embracing 
���the intellectual dishonesty of denying the existence of what one daily presup- 
poses��� (Putnam 2010, p. 57).65 
Baker adds a new emphasis on mathematical explanation to this traditional 
account of ontological commitment. He can allow the existence of nonmathe- 
matical versions of our best scientif i c theories. To show that premise 2 is true, 
one need only argue that these nonmathematical versions afford either no 
explanation of what the mathematized theory can explain, or else only worse 
explanations of what the mathematized theory can explain. Either way, we have 
suff i cient reason to include mathematical entities in our ontological commit- 
ments. The debate has thus been conducted by focusing on alleged cases of 
mathematical explanations of physical phenomena and the potential for non- 
mathematical explanations of those phenomena. 
Our discussion so far has suggested two different ways of motivating the 
explanatory indispensability of mathematical entities. In Section 5.1 I sketched 
the argument that mathematics is weakly autonomous with respect to physics. 
The weak autonomy of mathematics requires the existence of mathematical 
explanations that are better in some respects than any explanation afforded by 
physics, for example in terms of generality or robustness. The other approach, 
surveyed in Sections 2���4, is to identify a special class of genuine mathematical

The section starts with an exploration of explanatory indispensability arguments for mathematical Platonism, which is the philosophical view that there exist such things as abstract mathematical objects and these mathematical truths exist independently of humans. Mark Colyvan and Alan Baker have been key figures in promoting this argument.
Colyvan's work traced back to Quine and Putnam's indispensability argument, which claims that if a mathematical theory is indispensable to a best scientific theory, then we should believe in the mathematical entities postulated by the theory.
Baker refined this argument to center more directly on explanatory considerations, proposing that if mathematical objects play an indispensable explanatory role in our best scientific theories, then we should rationally believe in the existence of these objects.
In other words, if we cannot provide a sufficient explanation of the physical world without referencing abstract mathematical objects, then we ought to accept their existence, as they become part of our ontological commitments.
The discussion thus far presents two ways of motivating the explanatory indispensability of mathematical entities. One is the weak autonomy of mathematics with respect to physics, which argues that mathematical explanations have advantages over physical explanations in terms of generality or robustness. The other approach is to identify a unique class of genuine mathematical explanations.

ThecontrastsbetweenBaron���sPythagoreanaccountandLange���sAristotelian 
realism are instructive. Lange argues that the mappings prized by the platonist 
are inadequate to make sense of how the features of abstract mathematical 
objects could explain the features of concrete physical objects. So, Lange 
concludes that the physical objects must possess special mathematical proper- 
ties. At this point, the core difference between these explanatory mathematical 
properties and ordinary physical properties is that the mathematical properties 
standinnecessaryrelations ofa sortthatisabsentforphysicalproperties.Baron 
proceeds in a different direction. He supposes that the mappings prized by the 
platonist do involve shared properties between the abstract mathematical 
objects and the concrete physical objects. So Baron concludes that at least 
some mathematical properties are shared between the abstract and the concrete. 
Still,likeLange,forBarontherelationsbetweenthepropertiesarethekeytothe 
explanatory power of the mathematics. But Baron claims that the properties are 
intrinsic properties of abstract objects, and so they serve to settle the existence 
and much of the character of the abstract mathematical objects. 

What happens if we combine Baron���s Pythagorean proposal with our super- 
venienceprinciple?Baronclaimsthathisaccountisconsistentwithsupervenience: 
���It could be that the mathematical properties supervene on physical ones, but it 
could also be that some physical properties supervene on mathematical ones. Or 
theremaybenosuperveniencerelationatall���(Baronforthcoming,p.11).Thepoint 
seems to be that so long as the mathematical properties are distinct from the 
physical properties, the existence of genuine mathematical explanations is suff i- 
cient for the platonist conclusion. However, Baron is also aware that if super- 
venience obtains, ���an incompatibility between mathematical properties will 
generallycorrespondtoanincompatibilitybetweensubvenientphysicalproperties��� 
(Baron forthcoming, p. 11) and, we might assume, the same correspondence 
obtains for entailments between properties. This seems to undermine the inference

is consistent with supervenience, supervenience undermines the explanatory indis- 
pensability argument that Baron seems to want to defend. 
Of course, with Lange���s Aristotelian realist proposal in mind, another obvi- 
ous question to ask Baron is why one should posit the existence of abstract 
mathematical objects in addition to these intrinsic mathematical properties? 
Baron (forthcoming) does not cite Lange (2021b), but Baron does see clearly 
how hard it would be for the platonist to use Lange���s analysis of mathematical 
explanations as explanations by constraint in a defense of platonism: ���how, 
exactly, do mathematical objects exert this kind of inf l uence?��� (Baron forth- 
coming, p. 6). Notice that if we drop the abstract mathematical objects from 
Baron���s Pythagorean proposal, we are left with the Aristotelian realist proper- 
ties that Lange claims are the subject matter of mathematics. Baron���s response 
to this position is direct: ���Structural properties on my account make indispens- 
able reference to abstract objects��� (Baron forthcoming, p. 25). Baron backs up 
this assertion by noting some of the diff i culties with developing a nominalist 
account of structural properties without in some way or other quantifying over 
abstract objects. At this point, though, the debate has shifted away from 
questions about genuine mathematical explanation to questions about the non- 
explanatory indispensability of mathematics to our best science. If Baron���s

This section continues the discussion around mathematical Platonism by comparing Baron's Pythagorean account and Lange's Aristotelian realism.
Lange's argument asserts that abstract mathematical features cannot directly explain concrete physical features. He proposes that physical objects must possess certain special mathematical properties. These mathematical properties are said to stand in necessary relations, a concept absent for physical properties.
Baron, on the other hand, argues that the abstract mathematical objects and concrete physical objects share certain properties. He contends that these shared properties are intrinsic to the abstract objects, thus determining the existence and character of these abstract mathematical entities.
There is an exploration of what would happen if Baron���s Pythagorean proposal were combined with the supervenience principle - the idea that some properties are dependent on or determined by others. Baron maintains that mathematical properties could either supervene on physical properties or vice versa, or there may be no supervenience relation at all. However, Baron acknowledges that if supervenience does obtain, it might pose a challenge to the argument for Platonism as there might be physical properties that mimic the explanatory power of the mathematical properties.
The discussion moves to question why one would posit the existence of abstract mathematical objects in addition to these intrinsic mathematical properties. Lange's Aristotelian realism proposes that we should not posit the existence of abstract mathematical objects. However, Baron claims that structural properties in his account make indispensable reference to abstract objects, hinting at the difficulty in developing a nominalist account of structural properties without quantifying over abstract objects. This, however, shifts the debate away from mathematical explanations and more towards the non-explanatory indispensability of mathematics to our best science.

5.3 Inference to the Best Mathematical Explanation 
Colyvan and Baker have often emphasized that an explanatory indispensability 
argument is directed at scientif i c realists. Scientif i c realists typically defend 
their realism about unobservable entities like atoms and electrons through the 
use of inference to the best explanation (IBE). So, it is claimed, the scientif i c 
realist should also accept the existence of platonic mathematical objects using 
theverysamesortofIBEargument.AsBakerputsthepoint,���Acrucialplankof 
the scientif i c realist position involves inference to the best explanation (IBE) to 
justify the postulation in particular cases of unobservable theoretical entities ... 
the indispensability debate only gets off the ground if both sides take IBE 
seriously, which suggests that explanation is of key importance in this debate��� 
(Baker 2005, p. 225). On this reading, premise 1 ref l ects an endorsement of an 
appropriate form of IBE. Then the existence of the genuine mathematical 
explanations required for premise 2 gets us the existence of abstract mathemat- 
ical objects. For the very same explanatory considerations that speak in favor of 
atoms and electrons also speak in favor of numbers and groups. 
It turns out to be diff i cult to articulate and defend a form of IBE that supports 
a plausible form of scientif i c realism as well as mathematical platonism. To 
appreciate the challenges, consider a classic explanatory argument for the 
existence of God popular from the beginning of the nineteenth century. What 
explains the existence of the universe and the apparent design that we i nd in 
some natural objects like living things? The best available explanation of these 
facts in 1800 was that God created the universe and is directly responsible for 
these features of living things through various acts of special creation. So, if we 
accept IBE, then it looks like we should also accept the existence of God. In 
schematic form, IBE is a form of inference that can be boiled down to premise 
(A) and conclusion (B):

The goodness of the potential explanations is established by considering how

The section discusses Colyvan and Baker's explanatory indispensability argument, which is directed at scientific realists. Scientific realists often argue for the existence of unobservable entities like atoms and electrons through inference to the best explanation (IBE), a logical reasoning principle used to decide between competing explanations for a phenomenon. Colyvan and Baker argue that the same kind of IBE argument can be used to accept the existence of platonic mathematical objects. This idea suggests that the same reasoning that supports the existence of physical entities like atoms and electrons also supports the existence of mathematical entities like numbers and groups.
However, the text also points out the challenges in developing a version of IBE that supports both scientific realism and mathematical Platonism. It presents the classical argument for the existence of God as an example: what explains the existence of the universe and the apparent design found in natural phenomena? In the early 19th century, the best explanation was that God created the universe. This argument represents a form of IBE, but further developments in science challenged this conclusion.
This discussion emphasizes the importance of applying IBE carefully and understanding the virtues that contribute to determining the best explanation, such as simplicity, generality, and depth. Theories that explain the origin of the universe (the Big Bang theory) and the apparent design in many living things (Darwin���s theory of evolution by natural selection) serve as contemporary examples of these explanatory virtues.

explain the existence of the universe. But for person A, who does not believe in 
abstract mathematical objects, the situation isquite different. There isno way to 
rationally persuade them to endorse the genuine mathematical explanation 
because this explanation will fall below the threshold required by conservative- 
ness and modesty. First, in proposing a new sort of object, the mathematical 
explanation will be less conservative than its physical competitor. Second, it is 
hard to see how the genuine mathematical explanation will satisfy modesty. 
Compared at least to the physical explanation, the character of the abstract 
objects will not be i xed by what is needed to explain the target physical 
phenomena. This is easy to see for a proposed explanation that involves the 
natural numbers. It is very unlikely to involve more than a few of the natural 
numbers. So the genuine mathematical explanation will not draw on or require 
inf i nitely manynumbers. Forthis reason, a competing physical explanation will 
be able to get by using only surrogates that simulate whatever i nite structure is 
needed to explain the target phenomena. Unlike in the Big Bang case, then, we 
get violations of conservativeness and modesty when we try to use IBE to 
justify a new belief in the existence of abstract mathematical objects. The 
challenge to the platonist is to try to i nd a defensible version of IBE that is 
central to a defense of scientif i c realism, while also powerful enough to license 
the use of IBE needed to add platonic entities to person A���s ontology. This 
challenge has arguably not been met, and this is a way to diagnose why 
explanatory indispensability arguments remain unpersuasive. 
5.4 Conclusion 
Much of the current interest in mathematical explanation is tied to the hope that 
a satisfactory account of genuine mathematical explanation would help to settle 
the right interpretation of pure mathematics. Our examination of these argu- 
ments has been divided into three parts. First, I considered the argument from 
Putnam that the special sciences like psychology afford a special kind of 
explanation that is not available in physics. I endorsed this argument for what 
I called the weak autonomy of mathematics: some mathematical explanations 
exhibit explanatory virtues that are absent from their nonmathematical alterna- 
tives. Then I turned to explanatory indispensability arguments that try to usethe 
special character of genuine mathematical explanations to persuade nonplato- 
nists to become platonists. I argued that these arguments do not work. Weak 
autonomy is not enough to motivate such a platonist interpretation. The attempt 
to supplement weak autonomy with a more detailed account of how mathemat- 
ical explanations work also turned out to be insuff i cient for the platonist 
conclusion, as becomes clear in Lange (2021b) and Baron (forthcoming).

Finally, we brief l y considered an appeal to IBE in support of platonism. Here 
I suggested that a defensible form of IBE should privilege virtues like conser- 
vativeness and modesty that restrict when IBE can be used. If the scientif i c 
realist only endorses this restricted form of IBE, then they have no reason to 
accept the platonist interpretation of mathematical explanations of physical 
phenomena.

The section provides a critical discussion of the use of Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE) to justify belief in abstract mathematical entities.
It outlines a hypothetical scenario where a person 'A', who does not believe in abstract mathematical objects, cannot be rationally persuaded to endorse a mathematical explanation that introduces a new class of objects. This is due to the fact that such an explanation would violate the principles of conservatism and modesty.
Conservatism is the principle that an explanation should be as parsimonious as possible, introducing only as many new entities as necessary. Introducing a new category of abstract objects would be less conservative than its physical counterpart.
Modesty is the principle that an explanation should not go beyond what is required to account for the phenomena. If a mathematical explanation introduces a new class of infinite entities when only a few are required to explain a phenomenon, it would violate this principle.
As such, the text argues that explanatory indispensability arguments, which aim to convince non-platonists to become platonists using the special nature of mathematical explanations, are not successful.
The section concludes that the challenge for the platonist is to find a defensible version of IBE that supports scientific realism while also permitting the addition of platonic entities. The text suggests that current attempts to meet this challenge have been unsuccessful.
Overall, while it is acknowledged that mathematical explanations have a degree of autonomy and can exhibit certain explanatory virtues not found in non-mathematical explanations, the arguments supporting a platonist interpretation of mathematical explanations are found to be unconvincing. The scientific realist, it is argued, has no reason to accept the platonist interpretation of mathematical explanations of physical phenomena.

I'm sorry, but I don't have the complete text of the article, which means I can't provide a summary of the entire piece. However, based on the sections you've provided, I can summarize as follows:
The article discusses different perspectives on the role and significance of mathematical explanation in the philosophical debates between Platonism and Nominalism. The text focuses on two primary viewpoints - Baron���s Pythagorean account and Lange���s Aristotelian realism.
Baron, a Platonist, argues for the existence of shared properties between abstract mathematical objects and concrete physical objects. He posits that these shared properties are intrinsic to the abstract mathematical objects, explaining their existence and character. Baron contends that his approach aligns with supervenience, but acknowledges the risk of it undermining the explanatory indispensability argument he seeks to uphold.
In contrast, Lange's Aristotelian realism asserts that the physical objects must possess special mathematical properties. He suggests that the existence of these special mathematical properties distinguishes them from ordinary physical properties.
The text also explores the Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE) argument put forth by Colyvan and Baker. They propose that if scientific realists accept the existence of unobservable entities like atoms and electrons via IBE, they should also accept the existence of Platonic mathematical objects. The article, however, argues that it's challenging to defend an IBE that supports both scientific realism and mathematical Platonism.
The text concludes by suggesting that explanatory indispensability arguments, aimed at converting non-platonists to platonists, aren't compelling. A defensible form of IBE should adhere to virtues like conservatism and modesty, which restrict when IBE can be used. Therefore, the scientific realist has no reason to accept the Platonist interpretation of mathematical explanations.

The text you provided seems to suggest that, at least from certain perspectives in philosophy of mathematics and science, there is no compelling reason to postulate an ideal world of forms, as Platonists would. The argument being that the explanatory indispensability arguments and the inference to the best explanation (IBE) are not sufficient to justify the existence of an abstract world of mathematical objects.
It's important to note, however, that this doesn't represent a universal consensus. The existence or non-existence of an ideal world of forms is a central topic of debate in philosophy, with various arguments put forward in favor of different positions. Platonists would argue that abstract mathematical objects do exist in a realm of their own, independent of the physical world.
The article you've provided seems to adopt a more nominalist or Aristotelian realist perspective, which maintains that abstract concepts (like numbers) don't exist as independent entities in some ideal realm but are instead either mere names (in the case of nominalism) or intrinsic properties of physical objects (in Aristotelian realism).
In the end, the question of whether there's reason to postulate an ideal world of forms is still a matter of ongoing debate and depends on the philosophical perspective one takes.

Based on this abstract, the full text aims to answer four central questions regarding the role of mathematics in scientific explanation and the possible existence of mathematical objects:
The Adequacy of Traditional Theories:
The paper assesses whether traditional theories of scientific explanation can adequately account for the role of mathematics in explanation. Traditional theories usually posit a singular, unified framework for explanation, and the paper questions whether such an approach can accurately capture the role of mathematics.
Possibility of a Monist Approach:
If traditional monist theories (which posit a single kind of explanation) are found inadequate, the text explores if a more flexible monist approach can make sense of how mathematics contributes to explanations.
Best Pluralistic Approach:
The text also considers the type of pluralism (the idea that there are multiple kinds of valid explanations) that would best illuminate how mathematics can help explain phenomena in both science and mathematics itself.
Integration of Mathematical Elements into the Physical World:
The paper examines how the mathematical elements of an explanation can be integrated into the physical world. This is a significant issue in philosophy of mathematics and science, as it pertains to the relationship between abstract mathematical concepts and the concrete physical reality.
Finally, the abstract suggests that the paper will discuss the issue of explanatory evidence for the existence of mathematical objects. Just as scientific posits (like atoms or particles) might be supported by the explanatory power they offer, the paper will discuss whether a similar kind of evidence could be provided for mathematical objects, and if not, why such evidence is lacking. This relates to the ongoing philosophical debate about the ontological status of mathematical entities - do they "exist" in some abstract realm (as per Platonism), or are they simply useful fictions, conceptual tools, or intrinsic properties of physical entities (as per various other philosophical views)?

Similarities with quantum Bayesianism and active inference theories.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Quantum Bayesianism (QBism) and active inference theories are concepts that have emerged from different fields, with QBism being a reinterpretation of quantum mechanics, and active inference being a framework in neuroscience and psychology.
QBism treats the wave function subjectively. It posits that the probabilities in quantum mechanics don't reflect the state of the world, but rather reflect an observer's subjective beliefs about what they can expect from the world. In other words, QBism provides a Bayesian interpretation of quantum mechanics, hence the term "Quantum Bayesianism."
Active inference, on the other hand, is a theory from neuroscience that suggests that organisms (including humans) continuously infer the state of the world around them and act upon those inferences to minimize surprise and error in their predictions.
There are a few potential points of overlap or resonance between these theories and the role of mathematics in scientific explanation as discussed in the article you've provided:
Subjectivity and Objectivity:
QBism brings a sense of subjectivity into quantum mechanics, similarly, the role of mathematics in scientific explanations, as discussed in the article, often straddles the boundary between the subjective (mathematics as a language or tool devised by humans) and the objective (mathematics as potentially describing fundamental truths about the universe).
Inference and Explanation:
Active inference theories posit that organisms are continuously predicting and updating their understanding of the world. This parallels some of the ideas in the article about how explanations work: we use models (which can be mathematical) to predict and explain phenomena.
Pluralism:
The article mentions the possibility of pluralistic approaches to explanation, and both QBism and active inference could be seen as pluralistic in nature. QBism posits a subjective view of quantum mechanics, which could coexist with more objective interpretations. Active inference suggests a view of cognition and behavior that goes beyond simpler stimulus-response models, thus adding another layer to the understanding of brain function.
These are, however, very broad and somewhat speculative connections. The specific similarities or implications would depend on the details of the argument presented in the original article, which has not been fully disclosed in this discussion. Also, it's important to keep in mind that QBism and active inference theories, while fascinating, remain topics of active debate and research within their respective fields.

Autangle: A case of Quantum Narcissism?
Rong Zhou, Ryan Orson Behunin, Shih-Yuin Lin, Bei-lok Hu
Download PDF
In this paper we ask a common psychological question and provide a physics answer: "Looking into a mirror can one get entangled with one's image?" This is not a frivolous question; rather, it bears on the effect of boundaries on the behavior of quantum entanglement between a harmonic oscillator and a quantum field, a basic problem of interest in proposed mirror-field superposition and related experiments in macroscopic quantum phenomena, as well as atomic fluctuation forces near a conducting surface.
The object's internal degree of freedom is modeled by a harmonic oscillator and the presence of a perfectly reflecting mirror enforces the Dirichlet boundary conditions on the quantum field, restricting the latter to a half space. By assuming a bilinear oscillator-field interaction, we derive a coupled set of equations for the oscillator's and the field's Heisenberg operators. The former can be cast in the form of a quantum Langevin equation, where the dissipation and noise kernels respectively correspond to the retarded and Hadamard functions of the free quantum field in half space.
We use the linear entropy as measures of entanglement between the oscillator and the quantum field under mirror reflection, then solve the early-time oscillator-field entanglement dynamics and compare it with that between two inertial oscillators in free space. At late times when the combined system is in a stationary state, we obtain exact expressions for the oscillator's covariance matrix and show that the oscillator-field entanglement decreases as the oscillator moves closer to the mirror. We explain this behavior qualitatively with the help of a mirror image and provide an answer to the question raised above. We also compare this situation with the case of two real oscillators and explain the differences.

The paper you're referencing ("Autangle: A case of Quantum Narcissism?") explores the intriguing question of whether a system can become entangled with its own reflection in a quantum mirror. This research could potentially relate to the discussion on the role of mathematics in scientific explanations in the following ways:
Mathematics as a Descriptive Language
: Quantum mechanics, which the Autangle paper is based on, is a fundamentally mathematical theory. The mathematics not only describes the expected outcomes of quantum systems but also enables counterintuitive phenomena like quantum entanglement. Therefore, the discussion in the Autangle paper is an excellent example of how mathematics is indispensable in providing scientific explanations, especially in complex and abstract domains such as quantum mechanics.
Pluralistic Approach to Explanation
: The Autangle paper, like the philosophical text on mathematical explanation, employs a form of pluralism - by exploring different scenarios (oscillator-field interaction vs. two real oscillators) and comparing their outcomes, it offers a richer understanding of quantum entanglement.
Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE)
: The Autangle paper uses IBE to arrive at the best explanation for the behavior of an oscillator near a mirror. The mathematical modeling and subsequent comparison of the oscillator's covariance matrix in different scenarios provide an evidence-based explanation of the system's behavior.
Remember that while these connections can provide a basis for conversation and further research, the fields of quantum mechanics, philosophy of mathematics, and mathematical explanation are complex and nuanced, so there is much more to each than what can be covered in a short discussion.

I.INTRODUCTION 
In this note we ask a common psychological question and provide a physics answer: ���Looking into a 
mirror can one get entangled with one���s image"? According to storybooks the answer for the evil queen 
Q seems to be yes, a case of typical royal narcissism.We want to i nd out the answer from physical 
considerations: here entanglement refers to quantum entanglement, and autangle means self-entanglement 
1 , here referring to the entanglement of a real physical object Q with its mirror image. We hasten to 
add that since the image is not a physical object one cannot def i ne, let alone calculate, the entanglement 
between a physical object and an unphysical construct. However, there exists entanglement between an 
oscillator and a quantum i eld, and we can ask how this is altered if a mirror is present.A perfectly 
ref l ecting mirror imposes Dirichlet boundary conditions on the i eld along the mirror surface, restricting its 
existence to a half space. These are well-def i ned problems, belonging to the broader inquiry into the ef f ects 
of boundaries and topology on the quantum i eld and on quantum entanglement of objects, oscillators and 
mirrors, coexisting with and/or mediated by the quantum i eld. In fact, they bear on issues of importance to 
quantum information and macroscopic quantum phenomena. Amongst research problems of current interest, 
we mention: 1) Entanglement between two two-level (2LA) atoms via a common quantum i eld already shows 
diverse quantum entanglement dynamics behavior [2], ranging from sudden death, touch of death, revival 
to staying always alive, and features such as dynamical generation, protection, and transfer of entanglement 
between subsystems. Model studies of oscillator-f i eld entanglement with experimental ventures have been 
carried out [3] as well as oscillator-f i eld entanglement in conjunction with measurements in LIGO detectors 
[4], the latter also serving as preparatory studies for mirror-f i eld superposition [5] in macroscopic quantum 
phenomena. 2) Entanglement not only changes in time but it also depends on spatial separation as shown in 
model studies for 2LAs [6���8] and harmonic oscillators [9] interacting with a common quantum i eld. These 
results are of both theoretical interest in understanding what quantum nonlocality means, and practical 
value, such as for the design of quantum gates and applications to quantum teleportation. Extending these 
i ndings to two and three dimensional systems would enable one to def i ne quantum entanglement domains 
[12, 13] and geometric ef f ects of entanglement [14, 15]. The former refers to the ef f ective domain on a surface 
or body where entanglement is induced by the presence of an oscillator, not unlike the induced surface charge 
density on a conductor or dielectric plate. The latter refers to specif i c geometric patterns in the arrangements 
of oscillators where their entanglement strength can be maximized. 
Now, returning to the problem under study, one may wonder, is it really necessary to carry out such a 
serious calculation in order to answer a simple query posed at the beginning: Is there entanglement between 
the queen and her image? The answer is yes, both to the query and to the necessity of a bona i de calculation. 
As we cautioned ab initio, an image is not a physical object. Thus we try to avoid invoking an image in 
this calculation so that no unphysical assumptions or intuition are brought in unnecessarily or unknowingly 
in the derivations. However, at the end, by inspecting the results from the oscillator-f i eld (under mirror 
ref l ection) entanglement we see that one can use the notion of an image to describe the process, in fact, come 
up with a simple qualitative explanation of how it depends on distance. 
The paper is organized as follows: In Section. II we set up the problem and derive a formal set of equations 
for the Heisenberg operators of the oscillator���s internal degrees of freedom and the quantum i eld. We impose 
the boundary conditions introduced by the presence of the mirror and explain how the commutation relations 
are altered. Next we calculate the retarded and Hadamard Green functions of the altered i eld conf i gurations 
and derive a quantum Langevin equation for Q(t) including the back-reaction of the altered i eld. We seek 
solutions to this equation at late times and calculate the covariance matrix of the oscillator���s canonical 
variables at late times when the combined system is in a stationary state. Details are contained in Appendix 
A. In Sec.III we introduce the linear entropy and the von-Neumann entropy as measures of quantum 
entanglement and calculate the early-time dynamics of entanglement between the oscillator and the i eld in 
the oscillator-mirror setup described above. We obtain plots of how the entanglement between the oscillator 
and i eld in the half space with the mirror ref l ection evolves with time, depending on the distance between 
the oscillator and the mirror. Finally in the discussions section we explain in what sense can one describe 
this situation in terms of entanglement of the oscillator with its mirror image and why it decreases as the 
oscillator moves closer to the mirror, a somewhat counterintuitive i nding. We also compare this situation 
1 We coin this term from two sources of inspiration: new words like 3-tangle and old ones like autism. A more learned word 
���ipso-tangle��� was suggested by Prof. Brill.

with the case of two inertial oscillators in free space (calculations placed in Appendix B) and explain their 
physical dif f erences.

This paper explores the question, "Can one become entangled with one's reflection in a mirror?" from a quantum physics perspective. This inquiry considers entanglement in terms of quantum entanglement, referring to a hypothetical self-entanglement between a real physical object and its mirror image.
However, since the image isn't a physical object, defining or calculating entanglement between a physical object and a non-physical construct isn't straightforward. Therefore, the paper instead focuses on the entanglement between an oscillator and a quantum field, and how the presence of a mirror impacts this.
The study pertains to broader investigations into the effects of boundaries and topology on quantum fields and quantum entanglement. The outcomes have implications for quantum information and macroscopic quantum phenomena, including entanglement dynamics, oscillator-field entanglement in experiments like LIGO, and the impact of spatial separation on entanglement.
In this context, the paper introduces the concept of "quantum entanglement domains" which refers to areas where entanglement is induced by the presence of an oscillator, analogous to the induced surface charge density on a conductor.
To answer the initial question regarding the queen and her mirror image, the paper outlines a detailed computation process, avoiding the direct involvement of the "image" to prevent any unphysical assumptions.
The paper then presents calculations of the linear entropy and von Neumann entropy as measures of quantum entanglement, and discusses the dynamics of entanglement between the oscillator and field in the presence of the mirror. The findings suggest a counterintuitive outcome: entanglement decreases as the oscillator moves closer to the mirror. This situation is compared with the case of two inertial oscillators in free space to explain their differences.

This study investigates an unusual question from quantum physics perspective: "Can one get entangled with one's own reflection in a mirror?". Here, entanglement is understood as a quantum entanglement. However, because an image in the mirror is not a physical entity, the paper focuses on understanding entanglement between a physical object (an oscillator) and a quantum field in the presence of a mirror.
This work falls under larger explorations into how boundaries, such as the mirror in this case, affect quantum fields and the entanglement of objects within those fields. The results of these inquiries could have significant implications for quantum information science and larger-scale quantum phenomena.
The research calculates measures of quantum entanglement - the linear entropy and von Neumann entropy - and investigates how entanglement changes over time and with varying distances between the oscillator and the mirror. Interestingly, the findings suggest that entanglement decreases as the oscillator gets closer to the mirror.

With regard to the discussion on mathematical explanation in science, this study is an example of how mathematical and physical concepts (in this case, quantum entanglement and boundary conditions) are used to explain and predict physical phenomena.
As for Quantum Bayesianism and Active Inference theories, these are frameworks that interpret quantum mechanics and cognitive processes respectively. This study on mirror entanglement is in line with Quantum Bayesianism in terms of how it uses probabilistic reasoning (entropy measures of entanglement) to describe quantum states.
It can also be related to Active Inference theory, as it is another example of how systems (in this case, an oscillator and a quantum field) interact with their environment (influenced by a mirror) and adapt based on those interactions (change in quantum entanglement).

II.OSCILLATOR INTERACTING WITH FIELD UNDER MIRROR BOUNDARY CONDITION 
A.Dynamics of Oscillator-Field System with Mirror 
As described in the Introduction, the gist of the matter for this problem is to quantify the change in 
some entanglement measure between the oscillator and the i eld with and without the presence of a mirror. 
Technically our calculation involves two parts: 1) i nd the back-reaction of the i eld conf i guration altered by 
the mirror on the oscillator. 2) i nd the correlation functions of the resultant oscillator���s canonical variables 
including the i eld���s inf l uences. Thus our target is the covariance matrix for the oscillator which incorporates 
all back reactions from the quantum i eld. We work with the Heisenberg equations of motion which ef i ciently 
provides the oscillator���s i eld-inf l uenced dynamics. We can then i nd the oscillator���s late time behavior and 
quantify it���s entanglement with the modif i ed i eld. 
Consider an oscillator located at position xQat a vertical distance of L/2 from the mirror plane at x3= 0. 
The total action of the system describing this oscillator with internal degree of freedom Q interacting linearly 
with a massless scalar i eld conf i ned to the half space def i ned by x3> 0 is given by: 
S[Q, �� 
Q;��,�������] =

+

2 Z 
dt Z 
x3>0 
d3x �������������� + ��Q Z 
dt Q(t)��(xQ,t).(2.1) 
Due to the linearity of our system the equations of motion for Heisenberg operators (carrying hats) have the 
same form as the equations for the corresponding classical variables: 
MQ

�� 
Q(t) + MQ���2��Q(t) =��Q Z

?����(x,t) =��Q��3(x ��� xQ)��Q(t),and 
�� 
��(xk,x3= 0,t) = 0.(2.3) 
Equation (2.3) specif i es the Dirichlet boundary (DBC) conditions imposed on the i eld where the mirror 
surface is located, namely, in the x3= 0 plane and xk= (x1,x2). To obtain the back-reaction of the i eld on 
the oscillator we i rst solve (2.3) and then plug the solution into (2.2). The solution for �� 
��(x,t) is given by 
�� 
��(x,t) = ��

where �� 
��0(x,t) is the homogeneous solution to equation (2.3) which describes the dynamics of the source-free 
i eld (without Q) in the presence of the mirror and G�� 
ret(x,t;y,t���) is the retarded Green���s function for the 
i eld. Plugging the solution for the i eld operator into the equation of motion for the oscillator we obtain the 
following equation governing the dynamics of the oscillator with the ef f ects of the i eld already incorporated. 
This is what we mean by the ���f i eld-inf l uenced��� dynamics of the oscillator

ret(t,xQ;t ���,x Q) �� 
Q(t���) = ��Q����0(xQ,t).(2.5) 
As will be explained in further detail later the term containing the retarded Green���s function describes 
how the oscillator transfers energy to the i eld and the right hand side acts similarly to a Langevin forcing 
term describing how quantum i eld l uctuations drive the oscillator. 
B.Field Modif i ed by Mirror and Propagators in Half-space 
In order to solve the equation of motion for the oscillator (2.5) we need to know the i eld operators def i ned 
in the half space. Following this procedure we i rst write down the free i eld operator �� 
��0which satisf i es the 
Klein-Gordon equation and vanishes in the x3= 0 plane, 
�� 
��0(x,t) = Z

e���i��t+ikk��xksink3x3��bk+ H.c.(2.6)

where �� = |k|. 
Notice that the normalization factor is dif f erent for i eld in half space. 
Writing (����0(x���,t) = �� 
�� 
��0(x���,t)) and demanding that the equal-time commutation relations are satisf i ed, 
that is, [����0(x,t),����0(x���,t)] = i��(3)(x ��� x���) ��� i��(2)(xk��� x���k)��(x3+ x���3),(2.7) 
we can infer that the mode expansion coef i cients can be identif i ed with the creation and annihilation oper- 
ators [��bk,��b��� k] = ��k,k���, [��bk,��bk] = 0,[��b��� k,�� 
b��� k] = 0. (2.8) 
Note that the commutation relation above (2.7) is not in the form normally encountered. For the case of 
a i eld satisfying the Dirichlet boundary conditions on the x3= 0 plane it is necessary to add the "image 
term" to the right hand side such that for points restricted to the x3< 0 half space where the image term 
has no support the relation (2.7) reduces to the standard form. 
With the expression for the free i eld operator in hand we now calculate the retarded and Hadamard 
propagators. The retarded propagator quantif i es the i eld sourced by the oscillator and describes how energy 
is dissipated from the oscillator into the i eld

This section of the paper describes the technical details of how the mirror affects the entanglement between an oscillator and a quantum field. The oscillator here can be thought of as a physical object, such as an atom, while the quantum field can represent the environment in which this atom exists.
To analyze this, the authors first look at how the presence of the mirror changes the configuration of the quantum field, which they call the "back-reaction". Then they explore the correlation functions of the oscillator's canonical variables, influenced by the field's modifications. In essence, they're investigating how the field affects the oscillator and vice versa.
The authors make use of the Heisenberg equations of motion to efficiently track the dynamics of the oscillator influenced by the field and the presence of the mirror.
The equations of motion for the system are defined for both the oscillator and the quantum field. The equations describe how the oscillator and field interact with each other, and how the field reacts to the presence of the mirror (specified by a Dirichlet boundary condition).
To find how the field affects the oscillator, they solve the equation for the quantum field under the influence of the mirror and then input the solution into the oscillator's equation of motion. The solution to the quantum field's equation of motion introduces the "retarded Green's function". This function describes how the oscillator releases energy into the field.
Next, the paper describes the modification of the field by the mirror and defines field operators for the half-space where the mirror resides. They also derive the "free field operator" that describes the dynamics of the quantum field in the absence of the oscillator but in the presence of the mirror.
After setting the foundation for the free field operator, they establish the commutation relations between the field and its conjugate momentum, leading to the definition of creation and annihilation operators that respect these relations. These operators are essential quantum mechanical tools for describing particle dynamics in a field.
The authors then derive expressions for the "retarded propagator" and the "Hadamard function". The former describes how energy dissipates from the oscillator into the field, while the latter gives information about the quantum fluctuations in the field. These concepts are important in understanding how entanglement evolves in this system.
In the context of our previous discussions:
Mathematical Explanation in Science: This section provides a good example of how mathematical frameworks (in this case, the equations of motion, propagators, and Green's functions) are utilized to explain physical phenomena (here, entanglement changes in the presence of a mirror).
Quantum Bayesianism: This part showcases the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, which Quantum Bayesianism highlights. The correlation functions, the Green's functions, and the commutation relations are all elements of a probabilistic representation of quantum systems.
Active Inference: While this theory was originally used for cognitive and neural processes, we can draw an analogy with this research. The oscillator interacting with the field and the mirror can be viewed as a system interacting with its environment and altering its state in response to these interactions. The equations of motion and the evolution of the quantum state can be thought of as embodying the principles of active inference at a quantum level.

A novel conceptual framework for theoretical psychology is presented and illustrated for the example of bistable perception. A basic formal feature of this framework is the non-commutativity of operations acting on mental states. A corresponding model for the bistable perception of ambiguous stimuli, the Necker���Zeno model, is sketched and some empirical evidence for it so far is described. It is discussed how a temporal non-locality of mental states, predicted by the model, can be understood and tested.

1. Introduction
This contribution presents a novel perspective on a class of long known phenomena in psychology and psychophysics: the bistable perception of ambiguous stimuli. Our approach leads to empirical predictions and observations beyond those of previous work, but we see its chief significance in a conceptual and formal framework differing from much of traditional psychology. This framework consists of a conception of mental states and operations acting on them which is both more sophisticated and, we argue, more plausible and insightful than many traditional accounts.

Operations on states
In a general sense, any change in the state �� of a system (physical or mental) can be described by an operation acting on this state. In physical systems, such operations are often observables, for instance, position, momentum, energy, and others. An important case for the action of an observable on a state is the measurement of an observable. Measurement results for observables A and B are typically quantified by real-valued numbers a, b,���

A physical standard example for this terminology is a material measurement apparatus M recording particular properties of a material system S in state �� (with some probability urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0001). In basic physics, observables occur in canonically conjugate pairs, such as position and momentum, exhibiting particular well-defined invariance principles and conservation laws.

In psychology, we are concerned with a mental system S, usually of an individual subject being in a state ��. In contrast to physics, there are no canonically conjugate pairs of observables. For instance, a questionnaire as a measuring device M can contain any questions one may want to choose as observables to be measured in terms of answers as measurement results.

If the interaction of M with S is weak, then it leaves no significant effect on S, whereas���conversely���the effect of S on M is of course the registration of the measurement result. In case of strong interactions, this registration is always accompanied by a non-negligible influence of M on the state �� of S.

In physics, the distinction of weak and strong interactions is one major criterion for delineating classical systems from quantum systems. In addition, quantum measurements���in contrast to classical measurements���are not simply registrations of pre-existing facts, but they also ���establish��� the fact which is registered. The key feature of this classical-quantum distinction distinction is mathematically codified in terms of the commutativity or non-commutativity, respectively, of observables. Referring to actions of an observable on a state, A(��) or B(��), these actions either leave the state as it was, or they change it.

As a consequence, the successive action of two operations on a state can be commutative, A(B(��)) = B(A(��)), or non-commutative, A(B(��))���B(A(��)). In physics, the behavior of a system is called classical in the former case, whereas the latter case refers to quantum behavior. From this perspective, quantum theory can be viewed as a general systems theory of both commuting and non-commuting operations, and classical physics is restricted to the special case of commuting operations alone (cf. Primas, 1990).

Whenever the sequence of operations on the state �� of a system S makes a difference for the final result, measurements are non-commutative. Many complex systems must be expected to exhibit non-commutative properties in this sense. In psychology, where virtually every interaction with a mental state changes that state uncontrollably, and where mental states are often literally established by measurements, it is highly plausible to argue that non-commutativity should be the ubiquitous rule.

There are additional important quantum concepts for mental systems besides the non-commutativity of observables. Among them are the dispersiveness of mental states, non-local correlations, violations of Bell-type inequalities, interference effects, non-Boolean logic, and alternatives to standard rules of probability theory. They are explained and related to one another in the introduction to this issue (Wang, Busemeyer, Atmanspacher, & Pothos, 2013; see also Atmanspacher & R��mer, 2012).

This abstract discusses a novel theoretical framework for psychology, which relies on the principle of non-commutativity of operations that act on mental states, drawing an analogy from quantum mechanics. Non-commutativity implies that the sequence of operations or measurements can impact the final result, a concept that is inherent in quantum theory but not in classical physics. The abstract posits that such non-commutative behavior could be the norm in psychology, given that any interaction with a mental state is likely to cause an uncontrollable change in that state, often creating the state itself.
The framework is applied to bistable perception, a well-known phenomenon in psychology where an ambiguous stimulus can be perceived in two different ways. This work results in empirical predictions and findings that go beyond previous studies, proposing a more sophisticated understanding of mental states and their transformations.
The abstract also mentions additional quantum concepts that might be applicable to mental systems, including non-local correlations (connections between distant parts of a system), violations of Bell-type inequalities (a rule from quantum physics that challenges classical notions of reality), interference effects (the combination of multiple mental 'waves' to give a resultant 'wave'), non-Boolean logic (a system of logic where truth values are not simply true or false), and alternatives to standard probability theory.
The connection to the earlier discussion about an oscillator interacting with a field under mirror boundary conditions is mainly through the shared use of quantum mechanics concepts. Both discussions deal with non-commutative operations, and the impact this has on the systems under consideration. However, while the earlier discussion uses these principles to understand the interaction of an oscillator with a quantum field, this abstract applies the principles to the realm of psychology and mental states. This comparison underscores the potential for quantum mechanics principles to be used across a range of disciplines and applications, beyond their original context in the physical sciences.

Non-commuting operations in psychology
Traditionally, psychology has not considered effects of non-commutative operations throughout its history. But there are quite a number of psychological phenomena showing clear features of such an approach. Some of them, which have been worked out in recent years, are decision (or judgment) processes, semantic associations, bistable perception, learning, and order effects in questionnaires. For some more details and references see the review by Atmanspacher (2011), which highlights this line of thinking in Sec. 4.7. Ideas to understand consciousness in terms of actual quantum processes in the brain, also reviewed in the same article, are at variance with the approach applied here.

It should be noted at this point that the models developed in the mentioned areas are not all explicitly based on non-commuting operations. They feature various related concepts such as incompatibility, complementarity, entanglement, partial Boolean logic, dispersive states, quantum probability, uncertainty relations, etc. However, these concepts bear close formal relationships with the property of non-commutativity and its ramifications (cf. Atmanspacher, R��mer, & Walach, 2002; Atmanspacher, Filk, & R��mer, 2006, Filk & R��mer, 2011; more technically: R��dei, 1996, R��dei & Summers, 2007).

Bistable perception is a widely known and intensely studied phenomenon for a long time (for reviews, see Blake & Logothetis, 2002; Long & Toppino, 2004; Kornmeier & Bach, 2012). In the present contribution, we give an overview of the Necker���Zeno model of bistable perception developed on the basis of non-commuting operations, which we tested in recent years (Atmanspacher, Filk, & R��mer, 2004; Atmanspacher, Bach, Filk, Kornmeier, & R��mer, 2008; Atmanspacher, Filk, & R��mer, 2009; Atmanspacher & Filk, 2010, 2012).1

The subsequent Section 2.1. sketches some formal basics of the Necker���Zeno model which are inspired by the quantum Zeno effect (Misra & Sudarshan, 1977), essentially predicting the deceleration of the decay of an unstable state under observation. In Section 2.2., we present a number of empirical tests of predictions of the model using the Necker cube (Necker, 1832) as an experimental paradigm with low semantic content.

Section 3. recapitulates the arguments that Bell (1966) and others introduced in the 1960s to distinguish the classical concept of local, independent elements of reality from the quantum notion of non-local correlations between entangled subsystems. This section focuses on physical quantum systems and prepares the reader to the idea of studying whether mental states can be temporally non-local.

In Section 4.1., we introduce a so-called temporal Bell inequality, first formulated by Leggett and Garg (1985) for physical systems, and we show how it may relate to mental states in bistable perception. Section 4.2. demonstrates how such a temporal Bell inequality is violated in the Necker���Zeno model. Such violations would imply temporally non-local mental states, and we address some options of how to test this empirically.

2. The Necker���Zeno model
Basic formal elements
The mathematical framework of the Necker���Zeno model is inspired by the mathematics of a two-state quantum Zeno effect (Misra & Sudarshan, 1977). However, we emphasize that we do not consider a phenomenon in the sense of quantum physics to be responsible for the switching dynamics. Our formal description exclusively refers to mental states and mental observables and their dynamics. It does not even remotely address potential candidates for underlying brain activity.2

The details of the Necker���Zeno model have been described in previous publications (Atmanspacher et al., 2004, 2008, 2009; Atmanspacher & Filk, 2010, 2012). Here, we restrict ourselves to a brief review of those features of the model that are relevant for (1) a number of empirical observations and (2) the basic issue of temporally non-local states, expressed by violations of a temporal Bell inequality. We first summarize the ingredients of the quantum Zeno model and then transform the concepts to the Necker���Zeno model.

The quantum Zeno model describes a two-state system which is coupled to an environment. In the original model of Misra and Sudarshan (1977), the ���environment��� constitutes a measuring device and the corresponding process may be interpreted as an observation. More generally, however, this coupling describes a particular interaction with an environment such that the state of the system becomes stabilized. Note that ���environment��� can refer to any other degrees of freedom to which the two-state system is coupled and for which we do not take into account its dynamics.

Two complementary processes characterize the quantum Zeno model:
(D1)A continuous ���rotation��� in a two-dimensional state space generated by a Hamiltonian urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0002, where
urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0003
and g is a coupling parameter determining the timescale of the rotation. The corresponding time evolution generated by this Hamiltonian describes the dynamics of the system for the case that the coupling to the environment is switched off. Essentially, it corresponds to a ���rotation��� in the space of states, where the continuous transitions between the two possible states are realized by superpositions of the two possibilities.
(D2)A discontinuous ���projection��� onto one of the two ���eigenstates��� urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0004 or urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0005 of the operator
urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0006
as the result of an ���observation.���
The eigenstates of urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0007 are stable under the ���observation��� (or, more generally, the coupling to the environment), but they are unstable under the dynamics according to urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0008. The corresponding two processes in (D1) and (D2) are complementary because the two matrices urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0009 and urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0010 do not commute:
urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0011
(1)
Now we are interested in three different timescales:
The temporal duration urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0012 refers to the undisturbed evolution ���without observation��� of the system (decoupled from the environment) and corresponds to the average time interval between two ���switches��� of the decoupled system. This temporal scale is approximately given by urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0013.
The average dwell time ���T��� is the interval between two switches of the system while it is ���under observation.��� This requires a scale for the strength of the interaction of the system with the measuring device (or, more generally, to its environment).
The strength of this interaction can be expressed in terms of a third timescale ��T. This timescale has the intuitive meaning of an ���observational update��� interval, that is, successive observations of the state of the system are separated by ��T.

In this study, a new conceptual framework for theoretical psychology is introduced, employing the principles of non-commutative operations and using the example of bistable perception. Mental states and operations acting on them are proposed to be non-commutative, differing from traditional psychology. Non-commutative operations suggest that the order of these operations can significantly affect the final state of a system. This concept has been applied to create a model for bistable perception of ambiguous stimuli, the Necker���Zeno model.
Two key concepts for understanding this model are that of observables, or operations, and states. In physics, observables can describe changes in the state of a system. In psychology, observables might take the form of questions on a questionnaire, with the state being the mental system of an individual. Whether these observables significantly affect the state of the system depends on the strength of their interaction.
Classical physics differentiates between weak and strong interactions, the latter of which results in a significant influence on the state of a system. In the context of psychology, it is argued that interactions with a mental state are often strong and uncontrollable, leading to the conclusion that non-commutativity should be the rule.
The Necker-Zeno model is an implementation of these concepts. It is inspired by the quantum Zeno effect and models a two-state system. Two complementary processes describe the model: a continuous "rotation" in a two-dimensional state space and a discontinuous "projection" onto one of the two possible states as the result of an observation. The application of these principles to psychology and further tests and predictions for this model are discussed.

Abstract
A novel conceptual framework for theoretical psychology is presented and illustrated for the example of bistable perception. A basic formal feature of this framework is the non-commutativity of operations acting on mental states. A corresponding model for the bistable perception of ambiguous stimuli, the Necker���Zeno model, is sketched and some empirical evidence for it so far is described. It is discussed how a temporal non-locality of mental states, predicted by the model, can be understood and tested.

1. Introduction
This contribution presents a novel perspective on a class of long known phenomena in psychology and psychophysics: the bistable perception of ambiguous stimuli. Our approach leads to empirical predictions and observations beyond those of previous work, but we see its chief significance in a conceptual and formal framework differing from much of traditional psychology. This framework consists of a conception of mental states and operations acting on them which is both more sophisticated and, we argue, more plausible and insightful than many traditional accounts.

Operations on states
In a general sense, any change in the state �� of a system (physical or mental) can be described by an operation acting on this state. In physical systems, such operations are often observables, for instance, position, momentum, energy, and others. An important case for the action of an observable on a state is the measurement of an observable. Measurement results for observables A and B are typically quantified by real-valued numbers a, b,���

A physical standard example for this terminology is a material measurement apparatus M recording particular properties of a material system S in state �� (with some probability urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0001). In basic physics, observables occur in canonically conjugate pairs, such as position and momentum, exhibiting particular well-defined invariance principles and conservation laws.

In psychology, we are concerned with a mental system S, usually of an individual subject being in a state ��. In contrast to physics, there are no canonically conjugate pairs of observables. For instance, a questionnaire as a measuring device M can contain any questions one may want to choose as observables to be measured in terms of answers as measurement results.

If the interaction of M with S is weak, then it leaves no significant effect on S, whereas���conversely���the effect of S on M is of course the registration of the measurement result. In case of strong interactions, this registration is always accompanied by a non-negligible influence of M on the state �� of S.

In physics, the distinction of weak and strong interactions is one major criterion for delineating classical systems from quantum systems. In addition, quantum measurements���in contrast to classical measurements���are not simply registrations of pre-existing facts, but they also ���establish��� the fact which is registered. The key feature of this classical-quantum distinction distinction is mathematically codified in terms of the commutativity or non-commutativity, respectively, of observables. Referring to actions of an observable on a state, A(��) or B(��), these actions either leave the state as it was, or they change it.

As a consequence, the successive action of two operations on a state can be commutative, A(B(��)) = B(A(��)), or non-commutative, A(B(��))���B(A(��)). In physics, the behavior of a system is called classical in the former case, whereas the latter case refers to quantum behavior. From this perspective, quantum theory can be viewed as a general systems theory of both commuting and non-commuting operations, and classical physics is restricted to the special case of commuting operations alone (cf. Primas, 1990).

Whenever the sequence of operations on the state �� of a system S makes a difference for the final result, measurements are non-commutative. Many complex systems must be expected to exhibit non-commutative properties in this sense. In psychology, where virtually every interaction with a mental state changes that state uncontrollably, and where mental states are often literally established by measurements, it is highly plausible to argue that non-commutativity should be the ubiquitous rule.

There are additional important quantum concepts for mental systems besides the non-commutativity of observables. Among them are the dispersiveness of mental states, non-local correlations, violations of Bell-type inequalities, interference effects, non-Boolean logic, and alternatives to standard rules of probability theory. They are explained and related to one another in the introduction to this issue (Wang, Busemeyer, Atmanspacher, & Pothos, 2013; see also Atmanspacher & R��mer, 2012).

Non-commuting operations in psychology
Traditionally, psychology has not considered effects of non-commutative operations throughout its history. But there are quite a number of psychological phenomena showing clear features of such an approach. Some of them, which have been worked out in recent years, are decision (or judgment) processes, semantic associations, bistable perception, learning, and order effects in questionnaires. For some more details and references see the review by Atmanspacher (2011), which highlights this line of thinking in Sec. 4.7. Ideas to understand consciousness in terms of actual quantum processes in the brain, also reviewed in the same article, are at variance with the approach applied here.

It should be noted at this point that the models developed in the mentioned areas are not all explicitly based on non-commuting operations. They feature various related concepts such as incompatibility, complementarity, entanglement, partial Boolean logic, dispersive states, quantum probability, uncertainty relations, etc. However, these concepts bear close formal relationships with the property of non-commutativity and its ramifications (cf. Atmanspacher, R��mer, & Walach, 2002; Atmanspacher, Filk, & R��mer, 2006, Filk & R��mer, 2011; more technically: R��dei, 1996, R��dei & Summers, 2007).

Bistable perception is a widely known and intensely studied phenomenon for a long time (for reviews, see Blake & Logothetis, 2002; Long & Toppino, 2004; Kornmeier & Bach, 2012). In the present contribution, we give an overview of the Necker���Zeno model of bistable perception developed on the basis of non-commuting operations, which we tested in recent years (Atmanspacher, Filk, & R��mer, 2004; Atmanspacher, Bach, Filk, Kornmeier, & R��mer, 2008; Atmanspacher, Filk, & R��mer, 2009; Atmanspacher & Filk, 2010, 2012).1

The subsequent Section 2.1. sketches some formal basics of the Necker���Zeno model which are inspired by the quantum Zeno effect (Misra & Sudarshan, 1977), essentially predicting the deceleration of the decay of an unstable state under observation. In Section 2.2., we present a number of empirical tests of predictions of the model using the Necker cube (Necker, 1832) as an experimental paradigm with low semantic content.

Section 3. recapitulates the arguments that Bell (1966) and others introduced in the 1960s to distinguish the classical concept of local, independent elements of reality from the quantum notion of non-local correlations between entangled subsystems. This section focuses on physical quantum systems and prepares the reader to the idea of studying whether mental states can be temporally non-local.

In Section 4.1., we introduce a so-called temporal Bell inequality, first formulated by Leggett and Garg (1985) for physical systems, and we show how it may relate to mental states in bistable perception. Section 4.2. demonstrates how such a temporal Bell inequality is violated in the Necker���Zeno model. Such violations would imply temporally non-local mental states, and we address some options of how to test this empirically.

2. The Necker���Zeno model
Basic formal elements
The mathematical framework of the Necker���Zeno model is inspired by the mathematics of a two-state quantum Zeno effect (Misra & Sudarshan, 1977). However, we emphasize that we do not consider a phenomenon in the sense of quantum physics to be responsible for the switching dynamics. Our formal description exclusively refers to mental states and mental observables and their dynamics. It does not even remotely address potential candidates for underlying brain activity.2

The details of the Necker���Zeno model have been described in previous publications (Atmanspacher et al., 2004, 2008, 2009; Atmanspacher & Filk, 2010, 2012). Here, we restrict ourselves to a brief review of those features of the model that are relevant for (1) a number of empirical observations and (2) the basic issue of temporally non-local states, expressed by violations of a temporal Bell inequality. We first summarize the ingredients of the quantum Zeno model and then transform the concepts to the Necker���Zeno model.

The quantum Zeno model describes a two-state system which is coupled to an environment. In the original model of Misra and Sudarshan (1977), the ���environment��� constitutes a measuring device and the corresponding process may be interpreted as an observation. More generally, however, this coupling describes a particular interaction with an environment such that the state of the system becomes stabilized. Note that ���environment��� can refer to any other degrees of freedom to which the two-state system is coupled and for which we do not take into account its dynamics.

Two complementary processes characterize the quantum Zeno model:
(D1)A continuous ���rotation��� in a two-dimensional state space generated by a Hamiltonian urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0002, where
urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0003
and g is a coupling parameter determining the timescale of the rotation. The corresponding time evolution generated by this Hamiltonian describes the dynamics of the system for the case that the coupling to the environment is switched off. Essentially, it corresponds to a ���rotation��� in the space of states, where the continuous transitions between the two possible states are realized by superpositions of the two possibilities.
(D2)A discontinuous ���projection��� onto one of the two ���eigenstates��� urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0004 or urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0005 of the operator
urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0006
as the result of an ���observation.���
The eigenstates of urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0007 are stable under the ���observation��� (or, more generally, the coupling to the environment), but they are unstable under the dynamics according to urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0008. The corresponding two processes in (D1) and (D2) are complementary because the two matrices urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0009 and urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0010 do not commute:
urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0011
(1)
Now we are interested in three different timescales:
The temporal duration urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0012 refers to the undisturbed evolution ���without observation��� of the system (decoupled from the environment) and corresponds to the average time interval between two ���switches��� of the decoupled system. This temporal scale is approximately given by urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0013.
The average dwell time ���T��� is the interval between two switches of the system while it is ���under observation.��� This requires a scale for the strength of the interaction of the system with the measuring device (or, more generally, to its environment).
The strength of this interaction can be expressed in terms of a third timescale ��T. This timescale has the intuitive meaning of an ���observational update��� interval, that is, successive observations of the state of the system are separated by ��T.
One can derive (Atmanspacher et al., 2004) the following relation between these three timescales
urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0014
(2)
that is, urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0015 is the geometric mean of the other two timescales. The intuitive interpretation is that the stronger the coupling to the environment (i.e., the smaller ��T), the longer the dwell time until the system experiences a switch.
Application to bistable perception
We now associate the formalism of the Zeno effect to bistable perception. First, we interpret the two dynamical processes of the Zeno model in terms of mental processes:
(D1')   If a subject does not observe the ambiguous stimulus, that is, if the stimulus is turned off, the preceding perceptual state ���decays.��� The rapidity of this decay is related to the time constant urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0016 and is assumed to be of the order of 300 ms, in accordance with the electrophysiological P300 component in event-related potentials. (For more details of this interpretation, see Atmanspacher et al., 2004; see also Dehaene & Changeux, 2011.)
(D2')   Whenever a subject actually watches the stimulus, this is accompanied by a mental ���update��� process. The mental state with its perspective of the cube is not stationary during the observation period, but it is updated after a time interval ��T. This update interval can be associated with the timescale at which the sequence of successive stimuli can be mentally resolved, ��T���30 ms. (See again Atmanspacher et al., 2004 for further details, see also P��ppel, 1997.)3
With this mental interpretation of the Zeno effect in terms of the dynamics and timescales relevant for the perception of ambiguous stimuli, we can now interpret Eq. 2 with respect to bistable perception. Equation 2 then turns into a relation between the average dwell time ���T��� of a perceived perspective (of the order of some seconds) and the timescales urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0017 and ��T as introduced above.

Equation 2 is clearly satisfied for these three mental timescales. Moreover, the predictive power of the model can be convincingly demonstrated if it is possible to vary one of the timescales (urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0018) as an independent variable and measure another one (���T���) as a function of urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0019. Assuming that ��T remains constant, Eq. 2 predicts a quadratic dependence of ���T��� on urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0020.

Such an experimental set-up is possible with discontinuous stimulus presentation. Under certain conditions, the timescale urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0021 can be approximated by the off-time in discontinuous presentation. As long as this off-time exceeds urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0022 ms, the corresponding scenario induces an ���effective Hamiltonian��� with altered period. This way, dwell times T (and their means ���T���) can be recorded as a function of off-time as an independent variable, which makes it possible to test Eq. 2 experimentally.

A comparison of observations by Kornmeier and Bach (2004); Kornmeier, Ehm, Bigalke, and Bach (2007); and Orbach, Zucker, and Olson (1966) with the predictions of the Necker���Zeno model is shown in Fig. 1. The plotted symbols show observed values of ���T��� as a function of off-times. For off-times urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0023 ms, Fig. 1 clearly shows the dependence that the model predicts (Eq. 2). The best polynomial fit to the data (solid line) is quadratic and yields ��T���70 ms.

The paper proposes a new theoretical framework for psychology, based on the concept of non-commutativity of operations acting on mental states, using bistable perception as an example. Bistable perception is a phenomenon where an ambiguous stimulus can be perceived in two different ways, which can switch back and forth over time.
The authors define operations as any changes in the mental state of a system, and argue that these operations can be commutative, where the order of operations does not change the result, or non-commutative, where the order does change the result. They note that in psychology, virtually every interaction with a mental state changes that state in some way, and suggest that non-commutativity should therefore be the rule rather than the exception.
The authors present the Necker-Zeno model of bistable perception, which is based on the concept of non-commutativity. They also discuss temporal non-locality of mental states, which is a prediction of the model, and suggest ways that this could be tested empirically.
In conclusion, the authors argue that their novel perspective offers a more sophisticated and plausible account of mental states and their operations, and that it leads to empirical predictions and observations beyond those of previous work.

For instance, one might speculate that recent evidence (van Ee, 2005; Meng & Tong, 2004) for voluntary control over dwell times in the perception of ambiguous figures���as opposed to binocular rivalry���would imply a significant contribution of top-down processing���as opposed to bottom-up processing. The timescales involved should thus be longer for bistability in ambiguous perception. Moreover, Reisberg and O'Shaughnessy (1984) found that dwell times increase if attention is distracted, and Vickers (1972) found that dwell times are reduced by increasing vigilance. Further experimental investigations of the relation between volitional attention, vigilance, and dwell times are necessary to understand the contributing mechanisms in detail.

3. Non-locality in quantum physics
When Bell (1966) derived an inequality that was later coined the Bell inequality, this was���at least in part���conceived as an attempt to show an alleged incompleteness of quantum theory. Bell's inequality (and many reformulations of it) is based on the assumption of an objective realism with local hidden variables and can be violated for a non-local conception of reality that quantum theory predicts.

When the first experimental data indeed violated the inequality, Bell himself was among the first to accept that quantum theory provides a correct picture of reality. After the precise and convincing measurements of Aspect, Dalibard, and Roger (1982), only few most skeptic physicists maintained doubts. It is now widely accepted that the non-locality (or holism) of states with causal correlations is one of the crucial features of quantum theory.

In detail, Bell-type inequalities essentially rely on three fundamental assumptions (compare, e.g., d'Espagnat, 1979).
Objective Realism: For any system and any possible measurement which can be performed on this system, it is assumed that the result which this measurement would yield has a fixed albeit unknown value at any moment. (An ���omniscient��� being could predict which result any measurement on the system would yield.) In other words, the ontic state5 of a system, unknown to us, carries the information about the sharp value resulting from any measurement which in principle could be performed on this system.
Locality (Separability): A measurement performed at a particular spatial location cannot have any influence whatsoever on the results of another measurement performed at a different location if the second measurement is carried out within the causal complement (as defined by the relativistic light cone) of the first measurement.
Experimental Induction: Whenever particular measurements of systems repeatedly prepared in the same state yield particular results, these results characterize the system state even if the measurements are not actually performed.
The first assumption is violated by the experimental results of Aspect et al. (1982) and many other groups, which are correctly described by quantum theory. The other two assumptions are necessary to test the violation of Bell-type inequalities in quantum systems. As most forms of these inequalities make statements about the correlations of two measurements, it must be excluded that one of the measurements has an influence on the result of the other measurement. (This is the so-called ���non-invasiveness��� of a measurement.) In most cases one performs measurements on a pair of entangled particles in an Einstein���Podolsky���Rosen (EPR) or Bell state. Locality is needed to guarantee that these two measurements do not influence each other.

The third assumption (induction) is needed to ensure that the result of one measurement performed at one of the particles allows us to make a statement about the result of a hypothetical (but not actually performed) measurement on the other particle. (In an EPR state, the results of two measurements of the same observable on the two particles usually would be anticorrelated. This is assumed to hold true even if different measurements are performed.)

In all cases with violations of Bell-type inequalities, the measurements performed at the two particles refer to non-commuting observables, for example, spins in different directions. It can be shown that the correlation functions for measurements, which occur in Bell's inequalities, will always satisfy Bell's inequalities as long as all measured observables commute.

Even though the Necker���Zeno model involves the non-commuting operators urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0039 and urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0040, a well-defined measurement prescription only exists for urn:x-wiley:17568757:media:tops12044:tops12044-math-0041. For this reason, it is not possible to test a violation of standard Bell-type inequalities in an experiment which uses only this observable. Furthermore, Bell's inequalities are usually tested for entangled quantum systems, and at present we have no idea of how to prepare entangled mental states in the usual sense of entanglement. However, there is a viable alternative: temporal non-locality (see Atmanspacher & Filk, 2003).

Temporal non-locality, sometimes referred to as retrocausality or time-symmetry in physics, is a concept that describes a phenomenon where the effect precedes its cause. This is contrary to the familiar causality we experience in everyday life, where the cause always comes before the effect. Temporal non-locality is a viable concept within the framework of quantum physics, although it remains controversial.
The argument for temporal non-locality is based on the time-symmetric nature of most physical laws, which don't favor a direction of time. Some interpretations of quantum mechanics suggest that quantum events can be influenced not only by past events (as in classical physics), but also by future events. This could lead to effects being observed before their causes have taken place, hence the term "retrocausality".
Atmanspacher and Filk (2003) suggested that temporal non-locality might be a possible alternative to spatial non-locality (which relates to the violation of Bell's inequality) in understanding the nature of quantum systems and their behavior.
Temporal non-locality could play a role in entangled states where, rather than having two or more particles becoming entangled in space, events become entangled in time. It's important to note, however, that as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there isn't a consensus within the scientific community about the validity or implications of temporal non-locality, as it challenges some fundamental notions about causality and the nature of time.

5. Conclusions
A proper understanding of holism and causation is the key to an appropriate interpretation of systems which violate Bell inequalities. This also applies to their temporal variant, although in a slightly different way. While the effects of non-locality (�� la Bell, 1966; Aspect et al., 1982) are mostly discussed in terms of spatial relations between spatial subsystems, a temporal Bell inequality refers to relations between temporal segments of the history of a system.

Violating a temporal Bell inequality entails that a state of a system is non-locally distributed along the time axis. System states are improperly described if they are sharply localized at definite instances of time. They are ���stretched��� over an extended time interval that may depend on the specific system considered. Within this interval, relations such as ���earlier��� or ���later��� are illegitimate designators of the system state. This is just another way of saying that it is impossible to define causal relationships within such a time interval (Filk & von M��ller, 2009).

In the Necker���Zeno model, this could be interpreted due to a ���superposition��� state, actualizing neither one nor the other perspective, but residing somehow ���in between,��� offering the potential to actualize either one or the other perspectival state. Needless to say, this resembles the idea of a ���reduction��� in a quantum superposition state very closely. As mentioned in footnote 1, a similar scenario of mental temporal non-locality was recently proposed as characteristic of processes of cognitive decision making (Busemeyer et al., 2006).

It is tempting to relate this temporal non-locality to a ���window of temporal nowness,��� a concept that transcends a sharp boundary of presence between past and future (Filk & von M��ller, 2009; P��ppel, 1997). This idea dates back at least to James's notion of the ���specious present,��� a present mental state extending over a time interval rather than fixed to an instant of vanishing duration. Acategorial states as discussed by Atmanspacher and Fach (2005) might be interesting candidates for temporal non-locality as a mental feature.

An interesting remark by Sudarshan (1983), one of the discoverers of the quantum Zeno effect, illustrates how the phenomenal experience of a temporally holistic state could be imagined. Sudarshan speculates about a mode of awareness in which ���sensations, feelings, and insights are not neatly categorized into chains of thoughts, nor is there a step-by-step development of a logical-legal argument-to-conclusion. Instead, patterns appear, interweave, coexist; and sequencing is made inoperative. Conclusion, premises, feelings, and insights coexist in a manner defying temporal order.���

It is a necessary condition for temporally non-local correlations that the dynamics of the system considered is governed by operators that do not commute. This is the case in the Necker���Zeno model, so that bistable perception may indeed exhibit non-classical behavior although the corresponding cognitive mechanisms are not treated on the basis of a genuine quantum physical system. On a more general basis, we argued previously (Atmanspacher & Filk, 2003) that non-commuting time operators might be generic features of systems with temporal non-locality. It is known that such time operators bear an intimate connection with both inconsistent histories and temporal non-locality (Atmanspacher & Amann, 1998).

Your concluding statement nicely summarizes the main arguments and implications of the ideas you've discussed.
You've suggested that the concept of holism and the understanding of causality are pivotal in interpreting systems that violate Bell inequalities, including the temporal variant of the Bell inequalities. This is a compelling idea, since violation of the Bell inequalities suggests that reality has a holistic quality, in which the whole is more than the sum of its parts, and this seems to extend to temporal as well as spatial relations.
You've also connected this to the Necker-Zeno model, where the non-commutation of operators results in a "superposition" state that resembles the quantum superposition states. This is a very interesting proposition, as it suggests that certain features of quantum physics could possibly be extended to explain complex perceptual phenomena.
Your discussion about the "window of temporal nowness" also echoes some concepts in psychology and philosophy, such as the "specious present" described by William James, where a present mental state extends over a time interval rather than being confined to a single instant. This could be potentially linked to the idea of temporal non-locality in the context of cognitive decision making.
Lastly, you've suggested that non-commuting time operators could be a common feature of systems with temporal non-locality, an idea that has profound implications for the understanding of time and its role in various systems, including perceptual and cognitive systems.
In summary, your conclusion provides a compelling synthesis of ideas from quantum physics, perception, and cognition. While these ideas are very complex and may seem abstract, they hold the potential for leading to new insights and advancements in these fields.

Abstract
A simulation of the dynamic perception of the Necker cube in terms of a two-level quantum system, e.g. that of the hydrogen tunneling states of the ammonia molecules associated with the 24 GHz maser frequency, indicates that the neuro-physiological transformation leading, through a symmetry reduction, to perceptual reversal is controlled by the principles of quantum mechanics. An elementary neuro-physiological action similar to the Planck constant at a mesoscopic level is introduced

The conference paper by Giorgio Benedek and Giuseppe Caglioti, presented at the 18th International Conference on Geometry and Graphics in 2018, provides an interesting connection to the topics we discussed.
In the paper, Benedek and Caglioti simulate the dynamic perception of the Necker cube, an ambiguous figure that can be perceived in two distinct ways. This, they argue, can be likened to a two-level quantum system, such as the hydrogen tunneling states of the ammonia molecules associated with the 24 GHz maser frequency. In essence, they propose that the perceptual reversal witnessed in observing the Necker cube, which is a result of symmetry reduction, is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics.
This idea relates strongly to the Necker���Zeno model you mentioned previously, where a "superposition" state is proposed to account for bistable perception. Benedek and Caglioti take this idea further by suggesting that the principles of quantum mechanics control the transformation process leading to perceptual reversal. They even introduce the concept of an "elementary neuro-physiological action" at a mesoscopic level, which is somewhat analogous to the Planck constant in quantum physics.
This work is in line with the growing trend of using concepts and principles from quantum mechanics to understand complex cognitive phenomena. It represents an intriguing interdisciplinary approach, bridging the gap between physics and cognitive science. These types of ideas are at the cutting edge of research and could potentially lead to significant advancements in our understanding of perception and cognition.

Sure, here's a summary of the topics we've discussed:
Bistability and Perception:
We began our conversation with the topic of bistability in perception, particularly in relation to ambiguous figures. This involves figures or images that can be perceived in two different ways. An example is the Necker cube, which can be seen from two distinct perspectives.
Cognitive Processes and Bistability:
We delved into the top-down and bottom-up processing involved in the perception of ambiguous figures, as well as the role of attention and vigilance in manipulating dwell times (the length of time one interpretation is held before switching to another).
Non-locality in Quantum Physics:
We then transitioned into a discussion on the non-locality concept in quantum physics, particularly the Bell's inequalities derived by John Bell in 1966. We talked about how these inequalities can be violated, indicating the existence of quantum entanglement and challenging traditional notions of causality and locality.
Temporal Non-locality and the Necker-Zeno Model:
Next, we discussed temporal non-locality and the Necker-Zeno model as an application of quantum principles in cognitive science. We explored the idea that mental states could be extended over a time interval, leading to a "superposition" state that actualizes neither one perspective nor the other but exists in a potential state to actualize either.
Graphics and Quantum Mechanics:
Lastly, we discussed a conference paper presented by Giorgio Benedek and Giuseppe Caglioti at the 18th International Conference on Geometry and Graphics. The paper posited that the dynamic perception of the Necker cube can be simulated as a two-level quantum system, suggesting that perceptual reversal and the transformation process are controlled by quantum mechanics principles.

Bistability and Perception - Temporal Non-locality and the Necker-Zeno Model
: These topics apply quantum principles to the study of cognitive science. Bistability, or the ability to perceive two different states, is akin to quantum superposition. Temporal non-locality, a feature seen in quantum mechanics, is discussed in the context of perception and cognition. The Necker-Zeno model is a direct application of quantum mechanics principles to model the perception of ambiguous figures.
Graphics and Quantum Mechanics - The Necker Cube as a Quantum-like Two-Level System
: This research applies quantum mechanics principles to model the perception of the Necker cube, an ambiguous figure. This demonstrates the potential overlap between cognitive sciences and quantum mechanics, creating a bridge between the physical sciences and cognitive sciences.
In summary, these topics cover a wide array of concepts from the principles of quantum mechanics to their potential applications in cognitive sciences and perception. Although these are diverse fields, there are key overlapping concepts such as the indeterminacy of perception (akin to quantum superposition), and the probabilistic nature of decision-making processes, which can be modeled using Bayesian inference. This intersection of ideas has spurred research into the intriguing possibility of quantum cognition, a field that applies quantum principles to model cognitive processes.

So maybe we might be able to use psychological states that we are familiar with to help understand complex aspects of quantum mechanics.

Absolutely, and that's a key idea in the emerging field of quantum cognition. By drawing parallels between quantum mechanics and cognitive phenomena, researchers hope to gain a deeper understanding of both. Let's take a look at how this works.
Superposition
: In quantum mechanics, a particle can be in a state of superposition, where it simultaneously exists in multiple states until a measurement is made. This is somewhat akin to a person being undecided ��� existing in a superposition of "yes" and "no" until a decision is made. By comparing these, we can get a better grasp on the idea of superposition.
Entanglement
: In quantum mechanics, two particles can be entangled, such that the state of one instantly affects the state of the other, no matter how far apart they are. This concept can be used to explain complex psychological phenomena like empathy or the deep, instantaneous connections that can form between individuals.
Wave-Particle Duality
: In quantum mechanics, entities like light and particles exhibit properties of both particles and waves. This duality could provide an interesting perspective on the dual nature of human perception and cognition, such as the ability to perceive things concretely but also abstractly.
Observer Effect
: In quantum mechanics, the act of measurement can affect the system being measured. This has parallels in psychology. For instance, the mere act of observing a person can alter their behavior, a phenomenon known as the Hawthorne effect.
By using these and other psychological parallels, we might be able to form a more intuitive understanding of complex quantum concepts. Moreover, exploring these parallels might also lead to novel insights in cognitive science, by providing new models and perspectives to explain complex cognitive phenomena.

These are complex and interrelated questions that require unpacking several ideas, so I'll break them down and address them individually:
Quantum Erasure and Objective Reality:
The quantum eraser experiment is a variation of the double-slit experiment that introduces a mechanism to "erase" the information about which slit a particle goes through. This effectively transforms the "particle-like" behavior of the system (where individual trajectories can be identified) back into "wave-like" behavior (interference pattern). The odd part is that this choice to erase or not erase the "which path" information can be made after the particle has already passed the slits, which seems to retrospectively affect the particle's prior behavior. This poses a challenge to the notion of an objective reality, because it suggests that the behavior of particles can depend on whether or not information about them is observed or erased, even after the fact.
Deleuze and Quantum Entanglement:
Gilles Deleuze's philosophy is complex and multifaceted, but one of its key components is the idea of difference and repetition. For Deleuze, reality is composed of countless differential relations that constantly unfold and create novel experiences and entities. This can be linked to quantum entanglement, where entangled particles cannot be described independently of each other's state - they are inherently relational. When one particle's state changes, the other's does too, instantaneously, regardless of distance.
Quantum Erasure and Causality:
The delayed-choice quantum eraser experiment raises questions about the nature of causality. The choice to observe or erase "which path" information appears to retroactively influence the outcome of the experiment, suggesting that future actions might influence past events, a kind of 'retro-causality'. This is counterintuitive from a classical perspective, and has spurred debates about the interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Deleuze's Virtual and Quantum Erasure:
Deleuze's concept of the virtual refers to the realm of potentialities that are real but not actual, that is, they have a reality without being actualized in the present. Quantum superposition, where particles exist in all possible states until measured, could be likened to Deleuze's virtual. Quantum erasure then might be viewed as a return to the virtual, where the potentialities are once again open and the "which path" information becomes unactualized.
Quantum Erasure and Kant's Idealism:
Kant posited that our experience of reality is shaped by our perceptions and cognitive structures, not necessarily the "thing-in-itself" (noumenon). In the context of quantum erasure, the choice of whether or not to observe "which path" information can be seen as a choice about what aspects of reality to bring into the realm of phenomena (observable reality), which could be seen as reflecting Kant's distinction between noumena and phenomena.
These are all fascinating questions at the intersection of philosophy and quantum physics. It's important to note, though, that making connections between these different fields can be speculative and the interpretations can vary widely. The interface of quantum mechanics and philosophy is a rich area of study, but it's also one where it's easy to draw misleading or oversimplified parallels, so these ideas should be approached with careful thought and skepticism.

ChatGPT
Each of the concepts we have discussed has potential connections to the ideas about quantum erasure, Deleuze's philosophy, and Kant's idealism that you just brought up.
1. Mathematical Explanation in Science:
The phenomenon of quantum erasure, like many aspects of quantum mechanics, relies heavily on mathematical formalism for its description and explanation. The wave function collapse that seems to occur with measurement, and its apparent reversal in the case of quantum erasure, is a mathematical process described by the Schr��dinger equation and its associated principles.
2. Quantum Bayesianism (QBism):
Quantum Bayesianism or QBism is a particular interpretation of quantum mechanics that suggests that the wave function and its collapse are subjective to each observer. In the context of quantum erasure, QBism would suggest that the observer's knowledge is what is crucial, and that the act of erasure changes the observer's state of knowledge about the system.
3. Active Inference:
The concept of active inference, which comes from theories of cognition, involves the idea that organisms act in ways that minimize the discrepancy between their predictions and their sensory inputs. From a certain perspective, one could draw parallels between this and the way that the act of observation in the quantum erasure experiment seems to "choose" a particular state for the quantum system out of the multiple possibilities that existed beforehand.
4. Quantum Entanglement in the Presence of a Mirror:
Quantum erasure and quantum entanglement are both phenomena that arise from the superposition principle in quantum mechanics. They both defy classical intuitions about how objects should behave, and can seem deeply strange as a result. The idea of quantum entanglement occurring in the presence of a mirror adds another layer of complexity to these quantum behaviors.
5. Equations of Motion for Heisenberg Operators & Related Topics:
All these topics involving quantum field theory and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle are deeply connected to the behaviors of quantum systems like those we see in quantum erasure. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, in particular, is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics that is closely tied to the behavior of quantum systems during measurement processes.
6. Necker-Zeno model:
The Necker-Zeno model discusses the perception of ambiguous figures like the Necker cube in terms of quantum processes, similarly, the concept of quantum erasure involves the concept of superposition and the collapse of this superposition upon measurement. This parallels with the perception of an ambiguous figure "collapsing" into one perception or the other.
In general, all these connections highlight how the different principles and behaviors we see in quantum mechanics can have analogs in other systems, including in cognitive and philosophical contexts. They also highlight the fundamentally strange and counterintuitive aspects of quantum behavior, and the difficulty of translating these behaviors into our everyday experiences and understandings.
