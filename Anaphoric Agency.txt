This foundation course in EdX is a direct adaptation of the first third of our undergraduate 13-week CS4248 Natural Language Processing course at the National University of Singapore.

In this first course, we will cover the foundational techniques for NLP analysis that serve as a solid basis for understanding modern techniques that will be covered in the future, two subsequent courses.  However, this course is offered as a standalone couse, because it is a meaningful unit to introduce key concepts in natural language processing; and second, to get you started in an easy, digestible format well-suited to casual, self-paced learning.

In Section 1, we give a bird's eye Overview of the landscape that is NLP.  We describe the root problem of NLP ��� ambiguity ��� and how it manifests at every level of linguistic interest to NLP.  
In Section 2, we delve into the basic unit of language, Words, and examine how to process them through regular expressions and determine their similarity through minimum edit distance.

Section 3:
Syntax and Structure of Sentences
This section introduces the basic syntactic structures in language. We explore how sentences are formed, the hierarchical organization of phrases, and the relationships between words. Parsing techniques like context-free grammars (CFG) and dependency parsing are discussed. This provides a foundation for understanding how machines can derive meaning from the structure of text.
Section 4:
Morphological Analysis
Here, we break down words into their smallest meaningful units, known as morphemes. We discuss stemming, which reduces words to their base or root form, and morphological parsing, which identifies the structure of complex words. This analysis helps in understanding the nuances of word formation and its implications in NLP.
Section 5:
Part-of-Speech Tagging
Every word in a sentence has a role. In this section, we learn about labeling words with their corresponding part-of-speech (POS). This helps in identifying the syntactic and semantic role of words in a sentence. Techniques like hidden Markov models (HMM) and rule-based approaches for POS tagging are covered.
Section 6:
N-grams and Language Modeling
Language modeling is crucial for predicting the probability of word sequences. We dive deep into n-grams, sequences of 'n' words used for prediction, and how these models can predict the likelihood of a word sequence. This section covers the concepts of conditional probability and smoothing techniques, setting the stage for more advanced probabilistic models in subsequent courses.
Section 7:
Summary and Next Steps
Concluding this foundational course, we recap the key concepts learned and provide a brief glimpse into what's next in the world of NLP.

As many of you noticed, the phrase Natural Language Processing, is a bit ambiguous.  But why?

Let's center on the middle word, Language.  Is it more closely connected with its left neighbour, Natural, or its right neighbour, Processing?

It turns out that because human language (that is, natural language) is ambiguous, processing language for computers is difficult.  But we're getting ahead of ourselves ��� more on that later!

For now let's say that in English, Language associates with its left neighbour more closely.  Then we are talking about the processing of natural languages, such as English, Mandarin Chinese, and Bahasa Indonesia, for example.

When we interact with a computer system using natural language, the computer must build a representation of what we say.  Let's call this representation R.

The process of making sense of either the input text or speech of a person to derive its representation R, we term  Analysis.  But what good is a representation by itself?  A computer needs to react to R in some way to let us know it understands what to do with our input.  One way of doing this is to respond using natural language back to us; again, either in text or speech form.  After reasoning on R and building a response representation R', it could respond back in natural language in an inverse process.  This process is called Generation.  

NL Analysis and NL Generation form a reciprocal functional pair: NLG(NLA(natural language text) = natural language text.  That is, going in a loop of analysis followed by generation for the same NL text should produce a text with similar meaning to the original input.  

Note that Generation is only one way that a computer can respond; there are many other ways for a computer to respond, including executing actions.
ChatGPT
Natural Language Understanding and Action Execution
Beyond just generating a response, computers can also act upon the representation, R. This aspect of processing is often termed as Natural Language Understanding (NLU). It's the step that bridges the gap between raw representation and actionable intelligence.
For instance, consider a voice assistant like Alexa or Siri. When you say, "Set an alarm for 7 AM," the system first processes your speech into a text representation, then it analyzes this to understand your intent, which in this case is to set an alarm. The action that follows ��� the actual setting of the alarm ��� is based on the computer's understanding of your request.
Challenges in NLP
One of the main challenges in NLP is ambiguity. This can manifest in several ways:
Lexical Ambiguity
: A single word can have multiple meanings. For example, the word "bank" can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river.
Syntactic Ambiguity
: A sentence can be interpreted in multiple ways due to its structure. For instance, "I saw the man with the telescope" can be understood as either you using the telescope to see the man or you seeing a man who has a telescope.
Pragmatic Ambiguity
: Sometimes, the context in which something is said can change its meaning. For instance, the phrase "Can you pass the salt?" is technically a question about one's ability, but pragmatically it's a request.
Achieving Fluent Interaction
For a computer system to truly understand and generate natural language, it must overcome these challenges of ambiguity. It must not only decode the literal meaning of words and phrases but also infer the intended meaning based on context, previous interactions, and even cultural nuances.
Additionally, while generation of a response is one approach, more sophisticated systems will also integrate other forms of response, whether it's carrying out an action, pulling up relevant data, or even asking clarifying questions to resolve ambiguity.
Closing Thoughts
Natural Language Processing, at its core, is about bridging the gap between human communication and machine understanding. It's an ever-evolving field, with new challenges emerging as we uncover deeper intricacies of human language and thought. But as technology continues to advance, the potential for more intuitive, natural interactions with our machines becomes increasingly within reach.

Do yo think you could explain regex expressions? I would probably be using vim or grep
ChatGPT
Of course! Regular expressions (often abbreviated as "regex" or "regexp") are powerful tools for matching strings based on patterns. They are widely used in text processing and searching. Here's a brief introduction to regex, tailored for usage with tools like
vim
and
grep
:
Basic Metacharacters:
.
: Matches any single character (except newline).
^
: Matches the start of a line.
$
: Matches the end of a line.
*
: Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
+
: Matches one or more of the preceding element.
?
: Matches zero or one of the preceding element.
Character Classes:
[...]
: Matches any one character inside the brackets.
Example:
[aeiou]
matches any vowel.
[^...]
: Matches any one character NOT inside the brackets.
Example:
[^0-9]
matches any non-digit.
\d
: Matches any digit, equivalent to
[0-9]
.
\D
: Matches any non-digit.
\w
: Matches any word character (alphanumeric + underscore).
\W
: Matches any non-word character.
\s
: Matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, line breaks).
\S
: Matches any non-whitespace character.
Quantifiers:
{n}
: Matches exactly
n
occurrences of the preceding element.
{n,}
: Matches
n
or more occurrences.
{n,m}
: Matches between
n
and
m
occurrences.
Special Sequences:
\b
: Matches the empty string, but only at the beginning or end of a word.
\B
: Matches the empty string, but NOT at the beginning or end of a word.
Grouping and Alternation:
( ...)
: Groups several characters together.
|
: Acts like an OR operator.
Example:
apple|banana
matches either "apple" or "banana".
Escape Sequences:
If you want to match a metacharacter like
.
,
^
,
$
, etc., you need to escape it with a backslash
\
. For instance, to match a literal dot, use
\.
.
Usage in
vim
:
In
vim
, to search using regex, you'd typically start with
/
followed by your pattern. Example:
/apple|banana
to find either "apple" or "banana".
Usage in
grep
:
With
grep
, you'd use a command like:
perl
Copy code
grep
'apple|banana'
filename.txt
For extended regular expressions (which might be needed for some of the above patterns like
|
), you'd use
grep
with the
-E
flag:
perl
Copy code
grep
-E
'apple|banana'
filename.txt
This is a basic overview. Regular expressions can get very complex and are a powerful tool for text searching and manipulation. With practice, you'll be able to craft intricate patterns to match exactly what you're looking for!

I think we should develop a distinctions between how computers typically store things by recording them exactly but humans store things by summarizing and paraphrasing
ChatGPT
Absolutely, there's a marked difference between how computers and humans store and retrieve information. Here's a distinction between the two:
Computers:
Literal Storage:
Computers, especially traditional storage mechanisms, store data in a precise and literal manner. Every bit of data has a specific location and can be retrieved exactly as it was saved.
Uniformity:
Data storage and retrieval processes are consistent. Given the same input, the output or retrieval will always be the same.
Volume:
Computers can store vast amounts of data without any degradation in the quality or accuracy of that data.
Dependency on External Systems:
Computers rely on file systems, databases, and other storage mechanisms to recall information. They don't "forget" unless there's a system malfunction or the data is deliberately deleted.
Lack of Abstraction:
While computers can process abstractions in data (like summarizing texts using algorithms), the primary storage mode is non-abstract, holding the full and exact version of the data.
Humans:
Abstract Storage:
Humans often store memories, experiences, and information in an abstracted manner. Rather than remembering every detail, we remember the gist, essence, or meaning.
Inconsistency:
Our recall of events or information can change over time. Memories can be influenced by subsequent experiences or even by the act of recalling them.
Limitation:
There's a limit to how much and how accurately we can remember things, especially over long periods.
Emotional Influence:
Our memories and understanding of information can be influenced by our emotions, beliefs, and values.
Adaptive & Contextual:
We often adapt our memories based on context. For instance, we might paraphrase a story differently based on who we're talking to.
Loss & Degradation:
Unlike computers, humans can forget information over time if not periodically revisited. Memories can degrade, and details can become fuzzy.
Integration:
We integrate new information with existing knowledge, often leading to a synthesized understanding or perspective.
In essence, while computers store information in a static, precise, and vast manner, human memory is dynamic, abstract, and influenced by numerous internal and external factors. This distinction is crucial, especially when designing systems or tools intended to augment or interface with human memory and cognition.
Now this distinction is becoming fuzzy as people are discovering sparse methods to encode information. Computers only seem to record and display things exactly because of perceptual boundaries,  conventional categorization schemes, and change blindness. I wanted to argue that human memory and imagination are not like movies that are the same each time they are watched but more like a video game that is different each time you play
ChatGPT
You're venturing into an intriguing realm where the lines between human cognition and computational processes start to blur, especially with advancements in artificial intelligence and neural network architectures. Let's delve into this:
Computers and Sparse Representations:
Sparse Representations:
Modern machine learning, especially deep learning models, use sparse representations to encode data. Sparse coding techniques, such as dropout in neural networks, enforce that only a subset of neurons are active, leading to more robust and generalizable models.
Adaptive Storage:
Neural networks, especially architectures like transformers, adaptively store information based on the saliency of the input. This can sometimes mimic the human tendency to focus on critical or novel aspects of a scene or event.
Generative Models:
With models like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) or VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), computers can now "imagine" or generate new data samples. These are not pre-stored but are constructed based on learned distributions.
Human Memory and Imagination:
Dynamic Recall:
As you aptly pointed out, human memory isn't a static replay. It's reconstructive. Each time we recall a memory, it's susceptible to modification, and our current state of mind can influence it.
Interactive Imagination:
Much like video games, our imagination is interactive. Our current mood, external stimuli, or recent experiences can shape the narrative we imagine.
Contextual Embedding:
Memories and imagination aren't isolated. They're embedded in a complex web of other memories, experiences, emotions, and beliefs, leading to a unique recall or imaginative experience each time.
Merging Boundaries:
The video game analogy is apt. Just as every playthrough of a game can be unique based on player decisions, environmental factors, and even game algorithms, our memories and imaginative experiences are a blend of recollection, current context, and cognitive processes.
The advances in machine learning and neural architectures are slowly moving computers from static, rule-based systems to more dynamic, adaptive, and "cognitive" systems. While they aren't equivalent to human cognition, they're beginning to showcase properties that were once believed to be uniquely human.
However, it's essential to remember that even as these boundaries blur, human cognition is an emergent property of our brains, experiences, and culture. Computers can mimic or model aspects of it but aren't likely to replicate the entirety of the human experience.
What if almost all forms of thinking and can be reduced to anaphora resolution and pattern matching?
ChatGPT
The notion that most cognitive processes can be reduced to anaphora resolution and pattern matching is a simplification, but it offers a fascinating lens through which to examine thought processes. Let's break down each concept:
Anaphora Resolution:
At its core, anaphora resolution is about establishing relationships or connections between different entities or concepts. In natural language processing, it deals with connecting pronouns to their antecedents. But metaphorically speaking, the idea can be extended to the broader human cognitive ability to establish links between disparate pieces of information or ideas. It's about understanding context.
Pattern Matching:
This is a fundamental mechanism by which we recognize, categorize, and predict phenomena. From early childhood, we're wired to recognize patterns ��� it's how we learn languages, understand social cues, or even predict future events based on past experiences.
If we consider these as foundational cognitive mechanisms, then:
Learning
can be seen as the process of recognizing and internalizing new patterns.
Memory
involves recalling patterns and using anaphora resolution to contextualize them within our broader set of experiences.
Problem-solving
often requires identifying underlying patterns and establishing relationships between known and unknown variables to find a solution.
Creativity
can be viewed as the ability to recombine existing patterns in novel ways.
However, while these mechanisms are undeniably central to cognition, reducing all thought to just these processes may not capture the full complexity and richness of human cognition. Other factors come into play:
Emotion:
Our emotional state can significantly influence our perceptions, memories, and decision-making.
Intuition:
There are moments when individuals make decisions or understand concepts without consciously recognizing patterns or making connections. This "gut feeling" or intuition doesn't always fit neatly into the pattern matching or anaphora resolution framework.
Cultural and Social Context:
Our thoughts are heavily influenced by our cultural background, social upbringing, and personal experiences, which bring in nuances that might not be solely attributed to pattern matching or anaphora resolution.
Neurological Factors:
The brain's structure and neurochemistry play roles in cognition that might not always be directly related to pattern recognition or establishing connections.
In summary, while anaphora resolution and pattern matching are compelling foundational mechanisms to explain many cognitive processes, the entirety of human thought is multifaceted and influenced by a myriad of factors. The interplay between these processes and other cognitive, emotional, and social factors make the human mind a complex and rich system.
I was thinking that just as behaviour is simplified by imagining it to be any modification of the environment, intentional or unintentional, and consciousness to be perceptual control of the sensory representations. We can consider motivation, intentionality, and homeostasis to be forms of anaphora resolution always trying to find out what "it" is, that is "what do in want to be doing right now" that sets an entities goals and intentions which are based on internal representations or models. Under this definition "environment", "ecosystem", and "task at hand" become synonymous.
ChatGPT
It seems you're striving to unify various cognitive and behavioral phenomena under a single overarching conceptual framework, which is a worthy and ambitious endeavor. The idea of re-conceptualizing broad areas of cognition and behavior in terms of anaphora resolution and pattern matching is thought-provoking. Let's break down the perspective you're suggesting:
Anaphora Resolution as Goal Setting:
When you suggest that motivation, intentionality, and homeostasis are forms of anaphora resolution, you're highlighting the brain's constant endeavor to determine what "it" desires or needs. This is an ongoing effort to understand and interpret the current internal state and adjust accordingly. In essence, the entity is always seeking an answer to the question, "What should I be doing or aiming for?" based on its internal state, past experiences, and external stimuli.
Environment as a Continuum:
By equating "environment," "ecosystem," and "task at hand," you're proposing a continuum where immediate tasks and broader environmental factors aren't distinct but are parts of the same overarching context in which an entity operates.
Consciousness as Perceptual Control:
This ties into the idea of pattern matching. To maintain control over sensory representations, one must constantly recognize patterns in sensory input and adjust behavior and internal states in response.
Behavior as Environmental Modification:
This perspective encompasses not just overt actions but also internal changes and adaptations that affect an entity's interaction with its environment.
A few insights from this perspective:
It offers a
holistic approach
where seemingly disparate cognitive and behavioral phenomena can be understood as interconnected aspects of an entity's continuous interaction with its environment.
This framework can lead to a more
fluid understanding of behavior and cognition
, where rigid distinctions between internal states, intentions, and external actions are less emphasized.
By focusing on the entity's ongoing quest to resolve its intentions and desires ("What do I want to be doing?"), this perspective underscores the
dynamic nature of cognition and behavior
, where static goals or intentions are less prevalent than constantly adapting ones.
However, while such a unifying framework offers a fresh lens through which to understand cognition and behavior, it also comes with challenges:
The risk of
oversimplification
is present. While the framework captures many aspects of behavior and cognition, there might be nuances or exceptions that don't fit neatly.
Some might argue that certain cognitive phenomena can't be wholly explained by this framework, necessitating
additional mechanisms or explanations
.
The interpretations and applications of such a perspective would need rigorous empirical validation through experimental and observational studies.
Still, the pursuit of a unifying framework to understand the myriad complexities of cognition and behavior is commendable, and your perspective offers an intriguing starting point for exploration and debate.
I think the risks of oversimplification are exaggerated. It only looks simple because it unifies certain concepts but I am just trying to articulate the meaning of the word inference or prediction. In humans, animals, and autonomous agents there is a mental or internal model of the world that has a kind of self representation and representation of the environment. Consider the following two abstracts for more context.

Do we have an internal model of the outside world?

ABSTRACT
Our phenomenal world remains stationary in spite of movements of the eyes, head and body. In addition, we can point or turn to objects in the surroundings whether or not they are in the field of view. In this review, I argue that these two features of experience and behaviour are related. The ability to interact with objects we cannot see implies an internal memory model of the surroundings, available to the motor system. And, because we maintain this ability when we move around, the model must be updated, so that the locations of object memories change continuously to provide accurate directional information. The model thus contains an internal representation of both the surroundings and the motions of the head and body: in other words, a stable representation of space. Recent functional MRI studies have provided strong evidence that this egocentric representation has a location in the precuneus, on the medial surface of the superior parietal cortex. This is a region previously identified with ���self-centred mental imagery���, so it seems likely that the stable egocentric representation, required by the motor system, is also the source of our conscious percept of a stable world.

Do Large Language Models learn world models or just surface statistics?
21.JAN.2023 . 15 MIN READ
A mystery
Large Language Models (LLM) are on fire, capturing public attention by their ability to provide seemingly impressive completions to user prompts (NYT coverage). They are a delicate combination of a radically simplistic algorithm with massive amounts of data and computing power. They are trained by playing a guess-the-next-word game with itself over and over again. Each time, the model looks at a partial sentence and guesses the following word. If it makes it correctly, it will update its parameters to reinforce its confidence; otherwise, it will learn from the error and give a better guess next time.

While the underpinning training algorithm remains roughly the same, the recent increase in model and data size has brought about qualitatively new behaviors such as writing basic code or solving logic puzzles.

How do these models achieve this kind of performance? Do they merely memorize training data and reread it out loud, or are they picking up the rules of English grammar and the syntax of C language? Are they building something like an internal world model���an understandable model of the process producing the sequences?

From various philosophical [1] and mathematical [2] perspectives, some researchers argue that it is fundamentally impossible for models trained with guess-the-next-word to learn the ���meanings'' of language and their performance is merely the result of memorizing ���surface statistics���, i.e., a long list of correlations that do not reflect a causal model of the process generating the sequence. Without knowing if this is the case, it becomes difficult to align the model to human values and purge spurious correlations picked up by the model [3,4]. This issue is of practical concern since relying on spurious correlations may lead to problems on out-of-distribution data.

The goal of our paper [5] is to explore this question in a carefully controlled setting. As we will discuss, we find interesting evidence that simple sequence prediction can lead to the formation of a world model. But before we dive into technical details, we start with a parable.

A thought experiment
Consider the following thought experiment. Imagine you have a friend who enjoys the board game Othello, and often comes to your house to play. The two of you take the competition seriously and are silent during the game except to call out each move as you make it, using standard Othello notation. Now imagine that there is a crow perching outside of an open window, out of view of the Othello board. After many visits from your friend, the crow starts calling out moves of its own���and to your surprise, those moves are almost always legal given the current board.

You naturally wonder how the crow does this. Is it producing legal moves by "haphazardly stitching together��� [3] superficial statistics, such as which openings are common or the fact that the names of corner squares will be called out later in the game? Or is it somehow tracking and using the state of play, even though it has never seen the board? It seems like there's no way to tell.

But one day, while cleaning the windowsill where the crow sits, you notice a grid-like arrangement of two kinds of birdseed--and it looks remarkably like the configuration of the last Othello game you played. The next time your friend comes over, the two of you look at the windowsill during a game. Sure enough, the seeds show your current position, and the crow is nudging one more seed with its beak to reflect the move you just made. Then it starts looking over the seeds, paying special attention to parts of the grid that might determine the legality of the next move. Your friend, a prankster, decides to try a trick: distracting the crow and rearranging some of the seeds to a new position. When the crow looks back at the board, it cocks its head and announces a move, one that is only legal in the new, rearranged position.

At this point, it seems fair to conclude the crow is relying on more than surface statistics. It evidently has formed a model of the game it has been hearing about, one that humans can understand and even use to steer the crow's behavior. Of course, there's a lot the crow may be missing: what makes a good move, what it means to play a game, that winning makes you happy, that you once made bad moves on purpose to cheer up your friend, and so on. We make no comment on whether the crow ���understands��� what it hears or is in any sense ���intelligent���. We can say, however, that it has developed an interpretable (compared to in the crow���s head) and controllable (can be changed with purpose) representation of the game state.

Othello-GPT: a synthetic testbed
As a clever reader might have already guessed, the crow is our subject under debate, a large language model.

We are looking into the debate by training a GPT model only on Othello game scripts, termed Othello-GPT. Othello is played by two players (black and white), who alternatively place discs on an 8x8 board. Every move must flip more than one opponent's discs by outflanking/sandwiching them in a straight line. Game ends when no moves could be made and the player with more discs on the board wins.

We choose the game Othello, which is simpler than chess but maintains a sufficiently large game tree to avoid memorization. Our strategy is to see what, if anything, a GPT variant learns simply by observing game transcripts without any a priori knowledge of rules or board structure.


Fig 2: From left to right: the starting board state of Othello; after black places a disc at E3; after white then places a disc at D3.
It���s worth pointing out a key difference between our model and Reinforcement Learning models like AlphaGo: to AlphaGo, game scripts are the history used to predict the optimal best next move leading to a win, so the game rule and board structures are baked into it as much as possible; in contrast, game scripts is no different from sequences with a unique generation process to Othello-GPT and to what extent the generation process can be discovered by a large language model is exactly what we are interested in. Therefore, unlike AlphaGo, no knowledge of board structure or game rules is given. The model is rather trained to learn to make legal moves only from lists of moves like: E3, D3, C4��� Each of the tiles is tokenized as a single word. The Othello-GPT is then trained to predict the next move given the preceding partial game to capture the distribution of games (sentences) in game datasets.

We found that the trained Othello-GPT usually makes legal moves. The error rate is 0.01%; and for comparison, the untrained Othello-GPT has an error rate of 93.29%. This is much like the observation in our parable that the crow was announcing the next moves.

Probes
To test this hypothesis, we first introduce probing, an established technique in NLP [6] to test for internal representations of information inside neural networks. We will use this technique to identify world models in a synthetic language model if they exist.

The heuristic is simple: for a classifier with constrained capacity, the more informative its input is for a certain target, the higher accuracy it can achieve when trained to predict the target. In this case, the simple classifiers are called probes, which take different activations in the model as input and are trained to predict certain properties of the input sentence, e.g., the part-of-speech tags and parse tree depth. It���s believed that the higher accuracy these classifiers can get, the better the activations have learned about these real-world properties, i.e., the existence of these concepts in the model.

One early work [7] probed sentence embeddings with 10 linguistic properties like tense, parsing tree depth, and top constituency. Later people found that syntax trees are embedded in the contextualized word embeddings of BERT models [8].

Back to the mystery on whether large language models are learning surface statistics or world models, there have been some tantalizing clues suggesting language models may build interpretable ���world models��� with probing techniques. They suggest language models can develop world models for very simple concepts in their internal representations (layer-wise activations), such as color [9], direction [10], or track boolean states during synthetic tasks [11]. They found that the representations for different classes of these concepts are easier to separate compared to those from randomly-initialized models. By comparing probe accuracies from trained language models with the probe accuracies from randomly-initialized baseline, they conclude that the language models are at least picking up something about these properties.

Probing Othello-GPT
As a first step of looking into it, we apply probes to our trained Othello-GPT. For each internal representation in the model, we have a ground truth board state that it corresponds to. We then train 64 independent two-layer MLP classifiers to classify each of the 64 tiles on Othello board into three states, black, blank, and white, by taking the internal representations from Othello-GPT as input. It turns out that the error rates of these probes are reduced from 26.2% on a randomly-initialized Othello-GPT to only 1.7% on a trained Othello-GPT. This suggests that there exists a world model in the internal representation of a trained Othello-GPT. Now, what is its shape? Do these concepts organize themselves in the high-dimensional space with a geometry similar to their corresponding tiles on an Othello board?

Since the probe we trained for each tile essentially keeps its knowledge about the board with a prototype vector for that tile, we interpret it as the concept vector for that tile. For the 64 concept vectors at hand, we apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality to 3 to plot the 64 dots below, each corresponding to one tile on the Othello board. We connect two dots if the two tiles they correspond to are direct neighbors. If the connection is horizontal on board, we color it with an orange gradient palette, changing along with the vertical position of the two tiles. Similarly, we use a blue gradient palette for vertical connections. Dots for the upper left corner ([0, 0]) and lower right corner ([7, 7]) are labeled.

By contrasting with the geometry of probes trained on a randomly-initialized GPT model (left), we can confirm that the training of Othello-GPT gives rise to an emergent geometry of ���draped cloth on a ball��� (right), resembling the Othello board.


Fig 3: Left: probe geometry of a randomly-initialized Othello-GPT; right: probe geometry of a trained Othello-GPT. 
Finding these probes is like discovering the board made of seeds on the crow's windowsill. Their existence excites us but we are not yet sure if the crow is relying on them to announce the next moves.  

Controlling model predictions via uncovered world models
Remember the prank in the thought experiment? We devise a method to change the world representation of Othello-GPT by changing its intermediate activations as the neural network computes layer by layer, on the fly, in the hope that the next-step predictions of the model can be changed accordingly as if made from this new world representation. This addresses some potential criticisms that these world representations are not actually contributing to the final prediction of Othello-GPT.

The following picture shows one such intervention case: on the bottom left is the world state in the model���s mind before the intervention, and to its right is the post-intervention world state we chose and the consequent post-intervention made by the model. What we are thinking of doing is flipping E6 from black to white and hope the model will make different next-step predictions based on the changed world state. This change in the world state will cause a change in the set of legal next moves according to the rule of Othello. If the intervention is successful, the model will change its prediction accordingly.


Fig 4: an example of the intervention experiment.
We evaluate this by comparing the ground-truth post-intervention legal moves returned by the Othello engine and those returned by the model. It turns out that it achieves an average error of only 0.12 tiles. It shows that the world representations are more than probable from the internal activations of the language model, but are also directly used for prediction. This ties back to the prank in the parable where moving the seeds around can change how the crow thinks about the game and makes the next move prediction.

A more stringent test is done by intervening the board state in the model���s mind into ones that are unreachable from any input sequences, e.g., boards with two disconnected blocks of discs. The idea is similar to Fischer random chess���players��� abilities are tested by playing under impossible board states in normal chess. The systematic evaluation result is equally good, which provides evidence that further disentangles the world model from sequence statistics.
ChatGPT
These abstracts present an exploration into the concept of internal world models. The first piece investigates how humans inherently possess a memory model of their environment, which allows them to interact with objects they cannot see. This internal representation ensures stability and is believed to be located in the precuneus region of the brain.
The second piece is a deep dive into whether Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 or GPT-4 possess an internal world model or simply replicate "surface statistics". The piece suggests that while LLMs are capable of impressive outputs, it remains a mystery if they truly understand the processes they reproduce. By training an LLM on Othello game scripts (dubbed "Othello-GPT"), the researchers seek to understand whether the LLM can learn the rules and dynamics of the game solely by observing transcripts of it. Their findings show that the trained Othello-GPT can usually make legal game moves, suggesting it's learned more than just surface statistics.
A significant portion of the second abstract focuses on "probes", which are techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine if a model has learned internal representations of information. When applied to the trained Othello-GPT, probes indicate the presence of a "world model". Further examination suggests that the geometry of this model reflects the Othello board, and by manipulating this internal representation, researchers can influence the model's predictions.
In summary, while humans have long been believed to possess an internal world model, the question of whether machine learning models like GPT-3 or GPT-4 also possess a similar model remains debated. The second piece provides evidence that LLMs can, in fact, develop internal world models and not simply replicate surface patterns. This discovery has profound implications for the future of AI and our understanding of machine learning models' capabilities.
Do we have an internal model of the outside world?
ChatGPT
Yes, according to many cognitive scientists and neurobiologists, humans have internal models of the outside world. These internal models help us predict and understand our environment, allowing us to navigate and interact with it effectively.
In the abstract you provided from Michael F. Land, the notion is supported that we have an internal memory model of our surroundings. This model is available to our motor system, enabling us to interact with objects even if they are outside our field of view. Such an internal model also allows our phenomenal world to remain stationary despite movements of our eyes, head, and body. The idea is that we maintain an internal representation of our surroundings, which is continuously updated as we move. This stable representation of space, which includes both the environment and our own movements, is believed to be located in the precuneus on the medial surface of the superior parietal cortex.
These internal models are not exclusive to humans. Many animals also have such models to help them navigate their environment, find food, avoid predators, and so on.
Large-scale artificial systems like the Large Language Models (LLM) mentioned in the second abstract also attempt to create internal models, albeit in different ways. While their "understanding" is vastly different from human cognition, they do develop representations of the data they've been trained on. The debate is ongoing regarding the depth and nature of these models, particularly whether they capture surface statistics or more profound world models.
See if you can articulate my theses from earlier, broadening the definition of the word anaphora to represent intentionality or directed goal state of the agent.
ChatGPT
Certainly! Given the abstracts you provided and the broadened definition of the term "anaphora" to encompass intentionality or a directed goal state, here's a synthesis of your theses:
Intentionality in Perception and Memory
: Humans have an innate intentionality in both their perception and memory, which serves as a predictive mechanism to anticipate and interact with their surroundings. This anaphoric intentionality, where previous experiences and memories direct our future actions and interpretations, helps stabilize our perception of the world despite constant changes in our viewpoint due to eye, head, and body movements.
Artificial Anaphoric Agents
: Large-scale artificial systems, like LLMs, possess a form of artificial anaphoric intentionality. Although their mode of operation is rooted in data representation and computational processing, these systems model their interactions based on their training data. Their "goal" or "intention" is determined by their programming and training, making them anaphoric agents that utilize vast amounts of information to generate contextually relevant responses or actions.
A Unified Framework for Anaphoric Agents
: Both biological systems (humans) and artificial systems (like LLMs) can be seen under the same framework as anaphoric agents. This perspective emphasizes the importance of past experiences (or data) in directing and shaping future interactions, regardless of whether the agent is organic or digital.
Incorporating this broadened definition allows for a richer discussion on how both humans and machines utilize stored information to drive future actions and interpretations in alignment with their goals or intentions.
Mestre (2005) present data from an anaphor resolution-study comparing sentences where the only possible antecedent within the sentence or text matched (a) or did not match (b) in gender with the pronoun in the second clause (15a,b, 16a,b). The experiments were done in French where gender is marked for singular as well as for plural pronouns. The antecedents were always humans and morphologically marked for gender, so that biological and grammatical gender matched. In one experiment, the antecedent appeared in the matrix clause of the same sentence, in a second experiment, it appeared in a separate sentence.

(15)
Les berg��res fluettes couraient vite quand (a) elles/ (b) ils ont rattrap�� le troupeau.

The shepherdesses ran fast when they (a. fem, b. masc) recaptured the herd.

(16)
Les berg��res fluettes couraient vite. Enfin (a) elles/ (b) ils ont rattrap�� le troupeau.

The shepherdesses ran fast. Finally they (a. fem, b. masc) recaptured the herd.

In both cases, Hemforth and Frenck-Mestre found a standard P600, suggesting that initial processes in anaphor resolution are actually more syntax than semantics based (see also Osterhout & Mobley 1995). Again, this evidence calls for several levels of representation, partly more syntactic or semantic in nature, partly more conceptual. Whether the N400 or any other EEG-component directly reflects the construction of mental models, is, however, surely an open question. To our knowledge, no clear-cut component has been associated with violations of mental model construction so far.

ChatGPT
Mestre's study in 2005, as you've presented, delves into the intricate world of anaphor resolution, specifically in the context of gender agreement within French sentences. Here���s a breakdown and interpretation of the provided study:
Setup
: The study looks at how individuals process anaphors (in this case, pronouns) when there's a mismatch or match in gender between the pronoun and its antecedent. French, unlike English, has gendered pronouns even in plural forms, allowing for a clearer examination of gender agreement.
Examples
:
In (15), the antecedent 'Les berg��res fluettes' (The slender shepherdesses) is feminine. The sentences then use either a matching feminine pronoun 'elles' or a mismatched masculine pronoun 'ils'.
Similarly, in (16), the structure is the same but the antecedent and pronoun are presented in separate sentences.
Findings
: Hemforth and Frenck-Mestre found a standard P600 effect for mismatches. The P600 is an event-related potential (ERP) component in the brain's electrical activity, often associated with syntactic processing difficulties. This suggests that the initial stages of anaphor resolution might be more syntax-driven than semantics-driven, meaning that the brain first looks at the structural fit of the sentence before trying to make semantic sense of it.
Implications
:
This finding supports the idea that language processing involves multiple levels of representation, some being more syntactic (structural) and others more semantic (meaning-based) or even conceptual.
The reference to the N400, another ERP component typically linked to semantic anomalies or unexpected words, indicates that it might not be directly associated with the construction of mental models. The construction of mental models refers to how we understand and represent information in our minds. While the N400 is known for its role in semantic processing, its relation to mental model construction is still ambiguous.
The statement concludes by pointing out that no definitive EEG-component has been identified for errors or anomalies in mental model construction.
This study emphasizes the complexity of language processing in the brain, indicating that it's not just about understanding meaning, but also about navigating the structural rules of language. It also highlights the ongoing quest in cognitive neuroscience to pin down how our brains construct and represent information.
Mental Models and the Mind

6 The mental model of a text as a basis for linking information: Syntactic and semantic processes in anaphor resolution
A central part of Garnham���s definition of mental models in text comprehension was its utility for linking different parts of a text. A linguistic means to link information are anaphoric expressions like definite noun phrases (as ���the woman��� or ���the girl��� in 5, 6, 7 above) or pronouns. A very plausible assumption would be that finding the referent of an anaphor should mostly be based on the mental model of the current discourse. And in fact, this has been proposed by various authors.

A seminal study by Gernsbacher (1991) looked at conceptual anaphora like (13 a-c). What is interesting here is that there is always a singular referent in the first sentence which is referred to by a plural pronoun in the second. In her experiments, Gernsbacher does not find any difficulty in processing the plural pronouns in sentences like these. She argues that participants consult their mental model of the situation, which is enriched by background knowledge, when they look for a referent of the pronoun. Since we know that there is more than one margarita in a bar, more than one plate in a kitchen and so forth, we can easily find the antecedent for the plural pronoun.

(13)
a.
I think I���ll order a frozen margarita. I just love them.

b.
I need a plate. Where do you keep them?

c.
My mother���s always bugging me to wear a dress. She thinks I look good in them.


However, the story may be a little more complicated than that. The plural pronoun here is only viable if the entity introduced in the first sentence allows for a non-specific, general, and/or collective reading. See for example (14a,b), where the singular pronoun in (14a) enforces the specific reading whereas the indefinite noun phrase ���a Japanese woman��� has to be interpreted as non-specific with the plural pronoun in (14b).

(14)
Chris wants to marry a Japanese woman.
a.
She is just the kind of woman he likes.

b.
They are just the kind of women he likes.


What makes the so-called conceptual anaphor viable here is not the knowledge that there is more than one Japanese woman in the world, but that (14b) has a strong non-specific reading. What we need again, is a semantic level with constraints over specific and non-specific interpretations of noun-phrases that surely interacts with the mental model of the current discourse.

There is additional evidence that early processes in pronoun resolution are mostly based on lower level (mostly syntactic) principles. Sturt (2003) showed that only antecedents which are available according to syntactic binding constraints are considered in very early stages of processing, whereas all entities available in the mental model of the current discourse can be taken into account at later stages.

Another way to look at the kinds of processes involved in early anaphor resolution is the analysis of EEG-patterns while participants are listening to or reading sentences involving anaphoric violations. It has been proposed that different types of potential shifts directly following a linguistic event (event related potentials, anaphor resolutions) correlate with different types of linguistic processes (see Friederici 1999, for a full model based on different components). A positive shift peaking at about 600 msec after the event (P600) is often found following syntactic violations (e.g. agreement violations as in ���the girl sing;��� Hagoort & Brown 1994). A negative shift peaking at about 400 msec (N400) has been established for semantic integration violations (e.g. as in ���the boy kicked the milk,��� Kutas & Hillyard 1980). Hemforth & Frenck-Mestre (2005) present data from an
ChatGPT
This passage from "Mental Models and the Mind" by Barbara Hemforth and Lars Konieczny (2006) offers a detailed discussion about how mental models play a role in linking information within a text, specifically in the context of anaphor resolution.
Let's unpack the main points:
Mental Models for Linking Textual Information
:
Garnham suggests that mental models aid in connecting different parts of a text. One way to achieve this is through anaphoric expressions like pronouns or definite noun phrases, which refer back to previously mentioned entities in a text.
Conceptual Anaphora
:
Gernsbacher's 1991 study focuses on cases where a singular entity is introduced in one sentence but referred to with a plural pronoun in the subsequent sentence.
The ease with which readers process these plural pronouns is attributed to their mental model of the situation and background knowledge. E.g., knowing there's typically more than one margarita in a bar helps readers connect "them" to "a frozen margarita."
Specific vs. Non-specific Interpretations
:
The plural pronoun's viability hinges on the general or non-specific interpretation of the entity mentioned earlier. For instance, in (14), "a Japanese woman" can either refer to a specific individual or Japanese women in general, depending on the subsequent use of a singular or plural pronoun.
There's a need for a semantic layer that determines specific vs. non-specific interpretations, which interacts with the current mental model of the discourse.
Early Processes in Anaphor Resolution
:
Sturt's 2003 findings indicate that during the initial stages of processing, only antecedents fitting syntactic binding rules are considered. However, all entities within the mental model of the discourse are taken into account in later stages.
EEG-pattern Analysis
:
Using EEG-pattern analysis helps determine the processes in early anaphor resolution.
Different shifts in event-related potentials (ERPs) correlate with different linguistic processes.
The P600 is associated with syntactic violations, e.g., "the girl sing."
The N400 is linked to semantic integration violations, e.g., "the boy kicked the milk."
Hemforth & Frenck-Mestre's 2005 study (as mentioned in your previous submission) further supports the notion that initial processes in anaphor resolution lean more towards syntax than semantics.
In summary, the passage emphasizes the dynamic interplay between mental models, syntax, and semantics in understanding and linking information within a text. It underscores the complexity of language processing and how different cognitive and neurological factors contribute to text comprehension.
Anaphora
Anaphora can be defined as a relation between two linguistic elements, in which the interpretation of one (called an anaphor) is in some way determined by the interpretation of the other (called an antecedent).

1.2 Anaphora and Truth-conditions
From a truth-conditional, semantic point of view, anaphora can be divided into five types: (a) referential anaphora, one that refers to some entity in the external world either directly or via its co-reference with its antecedent in the same sentence/discourse (1); (b) bound-variable anaphora, which is interpretable by virtue of its dependency on some quantificational expression in the same sentence/discourse, thus seeming to be the natural language counterpart of a bound variable in first-order logic (8); (c) E[vans]-type anaphora, one which, for technical reasons, is neither a pure referential anaphor nor a pure bound-variable anaphor, but which nevertheless constitutes a unified semantic type of its own (9); (d) anaphora of ���laziness,��� so-called because it is neither a referential anaphor nor a bound-variable anaphor, but functions as a shorthand for a repetition of its antecedent (10); and (e) bridging cross-reference anaphora, one that is used to establish a link of association with some preceding expression in the same sentence/discourse via the addition of background assumption (11) (see Huang 2000a and references therein).

ChatGPT
This extract from the International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences (2001) by Y. Huang provides a detailed categorization of anaphora from a truth-conditional, semantic perspective.
Let's distill the key points:
Definition of Anaphora
:
Anaphora refers to the relationship between two linguistic elements where one (the anaphor) gains its interpretation from the other (the antecedent).
Types of Anaphora
:
Referential Anaphora
:
Refers to an entity in the external world directly or through co-reference with its antecedent within the same discourse. Example not provided in the extract, but a basic illustration could be: "John went to the park. He had a great time."
Bound-Variable Anaphora
:
This type depends on a quantificational expression within the same sentence or discourse, resembling a bound variable in first-order logic.
Example:
(8) Every little girl wishes that she could visit the land of Lilliput.
Here, "she" refers to "Every little girl".
E-type Anaphora
:
Neither purely referential nor a pure bound-variable anaphor, but it's a unique semantic category.
Example:
(9) Most people who bought a donkey have treated it well.
Here, "it" refers to the "donkey" bought by "most people".
Anaphora of ���Laziness���
:
It acts as a shorthand for its antecedent's repetition rather than being a referential or bound-variable anaphor.
Example:
(10) The man who gave his paycheck to his wife was wiser than the man who gave it to his mistress.
Here, "it" stands in for "his paycheck".
Bridging Cross-Reference Anaphora
:
Establishes a connection with a preceding expression in the same discourse by adding a background assumption.
Example:
(11) John walked into a library. The music reading room had just been refurbished.
"The music reading room" is associated with "library" even though it's not an explicit antecedent.
These categories illuminate the varied nature of anaphoric references and underscore the intricate ways in which language conveys meaning by relying on prior information within a discourse.
Space, Time, and Story
Barbara Tversky, ... Julie Morrison, in Psychology of Learning and Motivation, 2013

Abstract
Life presents as a continuous multimodal barrage on all our senses. From that, we abstract events, discrete units characterized by completion of goals and peaks of action. Effective communication of sequences of events in explanations and narratives is similarly segmented, and linked globally by overall themes and locally by anaphora. Visuospatial explanations and narratives, notably diagrams, comics, and gestures, rely on congruity of mappings of elements and relations of ideas to space and marks in space. Just as we design visuospatial discourse, we design the world: Our design actions in space create diagrams in the world, patterns, piles, rows, one-to-one correspondences, and the like, that express abstractions, categories, hierarchies, dimensions, and more, a circular process termed spraction.
ChatGPT
The given abstract from "Space, Time, and Story" by Barbara Tversky, Julie Morrison, and colleagues (2013) in the "Psychology of Learning and Motivation" discusses the cognitive processing and representation of life experiences. Here's a breakdown of the main points presented:
Continuous Sensory Input
:
Our senses are constantly bombarded with a multimodal array of information from the world around us.
Abstraction of Events
:
From this continuous stream of information, humans derive or abstract "events," which are understood as discrete units marked by the completion of specific goals or peak moments of action.
Communication of Sequences
:
Effective communication, whether it's explanations or narratives, also organizes sequences of events in a segmented manner.
This segmentation is connected by overarching themes globally and by anaphora (referential linguistic expressions) locally.
Visuospatial Communication
:
Modes of communication such as diagrams, comics, and gestures are visual/spatial in nature.
They communicate effectively by establishing congruent mappings between ideas and their spatial/visual representation. This means that the spatial arrangement and design of elements in these forms of communication reflect the relationships and properties of the ideas they represent.
Design Actions in Space
:
Humans don't just interpret the world; we actively design it.
Our actions create patterns, arrangements, and other visual cues in the environment, which can be seen as real-world diagrams.
These arrangements (like piles, rows, or patterns) can represent more abstract concepts like categories, hierarchies, and other relationships.
Spraction
:
The abstract introduces a term, "spraction," which seems to refer to the cyclical process where our understanding of abstract concepts influences our spatial actions, which in turn reinforce or express our abstract understanding.
In essence, the abstract emphasizes the interconnectedness of spatial, temporal, and narrative comprehension and representation in our cognition.
Give a kind of modular breakdown of the spraction cycle
ChatGPT
Certainly! The "spraction" cycle, as mentioned in the abstract, refers to the cyclical process where our understanding of abstract concepts influences our spatial actions, which in turn reinforce or express our abstract understanding. Let's break it down into a modular representation:
1. Sensory Perception:
Initial input from the environment is received through our senses, presenting a continuous stream of information.
2. Cognitive Abstraction:
The brain abstracts "events" from this sensory stream. These events are characterized by goal completions or action peaks.
This involves identifying patterns, relationships, and significant moments in the continuous flow of experiences.
3. Formation of Abstract Concepts:
Derived from the abstraction of events, the brain forms abstract ideas or concepts.
This includes categories, relationships, hierarchies, and other higher-order cognitive structures.
4. Design Intent:
Based on the abstract concepts formed, there's an intention to represent, express, or act upon these ideas in the real world.
This can involve planning, decision-making, or problem-solving processes.
5. Spatial Actions (Spraction):
These abstract concepts drive specific actions in space.
Humans design or modify their environment based on their conceptual understanding. This includes creating patterns, alignments, arrangements, or other spatial constructs that serve as real-world representations of abstract concepts.
6. Environmental Feedback:
Once the environment is modified or designed, it provides a new set of sensory feedback.
These spatial constructs, now present in the environment, serve as external cues or diagrams that reflect and reinforce the original abstract concepts.
7. Reinforcement of Abstract Concepts:
By observing and interacting with the designed environment, the initial abstract concepts are reinforced, refined, or sometimes re-evaluated.
8. Cycle Repeats:
The reinforced abstract concepts can lead to further spatial actions or modifications, and the cycle continues.
This modular breakdown showcases the dynamic interplay between cognitive abstractions and real-world actions, emphasizing the continuous feedback loop that exists between understanding concepts and designing or interacting with our environment.
I'll get back to that in a second.

3 Some Established Findings in Inference Research
The issue that has stimulated much psycholinguistic research on inferences since the early 1970s is the following question: Which inferences are made and which ones are not made? This issue was investigated by looking for classifications of inferences, on the assumption that some kinds of inference are made during reading and some other kinds are not.

Most common is the distinction between necessary and elaborative inferences. Inferences are called necessary if without them the text representation is not coherent. Inferences that are not necessary for coherence are called elaborative, optional, or embellishing. Two aspects of coherence can be distinguished. Referential coherence is achieved by the fact that a sentence in a text deals with entities that are expressed earlier in the text. Linguistic devices to indicate referential coherence are referential (or anaphoric) expressions, such as pronouns and definite noun phrases that refer to an antecedent in the text (see Anaphora Resolution). Relational coherence is achieved by the fact that the content of a sentence has a conceptual relation with other sentences, such as a causal, contrastive, or concessive relation. Relational coherence can be expressed by conjunctions. If, in text (a), the inference about the co-referentiality between ���it��� and ���party��� or the inference about causality between ���voting��� and ���shift��� is not made, there is no coherence between the sentences. The pronoun ���it��� is considered as an instruction to find a particular referent; the conjunction ���because��� is considered as an instruction to find a causal relation in the context. If such instructions are not executed, the representation is not coherent. In this way, inferences triggered by referential expressions and conjunctions contribute to the coherence of the representation.

The notion of necessary inference is sometimes defined in a different way and contrasted with pragmatic inference. An inference is necessary if it follows logically from the propositions in a text. From ���John is taller than Pete and Pete is taller than Bill���, it follows that John is taller than Bill. The causal inference between the propositions with ���voting��� and ���shift��� in (a) is not only necessary for the coherence, but also necessarily follows from the text. It can be deduced from the conjunction ���because��� and is called a conventional implicature.

Inferences that do not follow logically from the text are called pragmatic inferences.

Another distinction that is made frequently is that between backward and forward inferences. Backward inferences relate the current part of the text to an earlier part. Forward inferences anticipate information that might be expressed in the subsequent text. Backward inferences contribute in general to the coherence of the text and are in that sense necessary inferences, while forward inferences are not. Backward inferences are much more restricted than forward inferences: the reader can anticipate a great number of things.

Inferences can also be classified with respect to their content. This yields a list of inferences that can be extended ad libitum. It includes inferences about instruments, causes, consequences, goals, time, place, and protagonists.
ChatGPT
The passage you provided delves into the psychology of inferences made during discourse. It sheds light on the research conducted on how readers understand and make connections in text, either through logical deductions or by building on the information given. Let's summarize and break down the primary ideas:
1. Research Question:
Since the early 1970s, the main question driving research in this domain is: "Which inferences are made and which ones are not?"
2. Classifications of Inferences:
a. Necessary vs. Elaborative Inferences:
Necessary Inferences:
Essential for coherence. Without these, the text becomes incoherent.
Referential Coherence:
Maintained when sentences refer to entities mentioned earlier. Devices such as pronouns and definite noun phrases ensure this.
Relational Coherence:
Achieved when sentences share conceptual relations like causal, contrastive, or concessive. Often expressed through conjunctions.
Elaborative Inferences:
Additional insights that aren't essential for coherence. Also termed as optional or embellishing.
b. Logical vs. Pragmatic Inferences:
Logical (Necessary) Inference:
Directly derived from the propositions in the text. It's logically necessitated by the content.
Pragmatic Inference:
Does not follow logically from the text but might be drawn based on external or additional knowledge.
c. Directionality of Inferences:
Backward Inferences:
Relate the current portion of the text to a previous part, typically contributing to coherence and often being necessary.
Forward Inferences:
Anticipate future information. They are not as constrained as backward inferences and may be more speculative.
d. Content-based Classifications:
Inferences can also be grouped by what they infer about, such as instruments, causes, consequences, goals, time, place, protagonists, etc.
This discussion provides an insightful look into the mental processes readers undergo as they navigate and interpret text. Making inferences is crucial for understanding, predicting, and connecting different pieces of information.
Established findings in inference research (Singer 1994, Van den Broek 1994, Garrod and Sanford 1994) are that necessary inferences���i.e., inferences that achieve coherence between sentences���are made during reading. These inferences are in general backward inferences. Elaborative, embellishing inferences are not made during reading; they are not required for comprehension. They are in general forward inferences. There are many possible forward inferences that can be made, and, since they do not achieve coherence, there is no motivation for making them. Inferences that can necessarily be derived from the text are far from always made; in general, it depends on whether they contribute to the coherence or not.
ChatGPT
The provided text emphasizes the role of inferences in reading comprehension and how they shape our understanding of a text. Here's a breakdown:
1. Necessary Inferences:
Definition:
Inferences essential for establishing coherence between sentences.
Timing:
Made during the act of reading.
Directionality:
Typically, these are backward inferences, connecting the current text to previous content.
Importance:
Crucial for comprehension as they bridge gaps and ensure a seamless flow of ideas.
2. Elaborative Inferences:
Definition:
Additional insights or embellishments that are not essential for coherence.
Timing:
Not typically made during the initial reading.
Directionality:
Generally forward inferences, anticipating or speculating about future information.
Importance:
Since they don't contribute to immediate coherence, there's often no pressing reason to make them while reading. They might be considered during deeper reflections or analyses of the text.
3. Range of Possible Inferences:
While many inferences can be drawn from a given text, not all are necessarily made during reading.
The decision to make an inference typically hinges on its contribution to coherence. If an inference doesn't enhance understanding or bridge gaps, it might be overlooked.
In summary, while reading, our minds actively work to ensure that the content flows and makes sense by filling in gaps with necessary inferences. Elaborative or forward-looking inferences, though possible, are often sidelined during the initial reading due to their non-essential nature for immediate comprehension.

Introduction: Life, Perception, and Stories
There is life. There is the perception of life. There are stories of life.

Life just keeps happening: unbroken, continually, continuously, ubiquitously, and inexorably. Life happens in sight, in sound, in smell, and in touch: all at once and from all directions. Life is outside. It happens in space and time. It happens without narration and without explanation.

Perception of life is quite different. Perception is inside. Perception goes beyond the information given. Perception happens in lumps

4 Diagramming the World 
The analyses of diagrams and gestures have led to a collection of features that 
characterize them and differentiate them, on the one hand from the things they represent 
and on the other hand from words and sentences. Like things are grouped by proximity 
and spatially separated from unlike things. Things are lined up meaningfully in rows 
and columns, and the rows and columns are sometimes ordered. Together, the rows and 
columns create tables or matrices, organized by the features of the things enclosed in 
the tables. The groups and orders are sometimes emphasized with lines and frames. In 
diagrams, these features create patterns that are regular, good Gestalts, and differ from 
the natural patterns in the world; they catch the eye. They invite explanations for the 
organization. Why are things grouped and ordered in those ways? This kind of 
reasoning is part of the ���work��� of diagrams, some of the ways that diagrams promote 
inference and discovery. 
The designed world uses those same features to the same ends, gathering like things, 
separating them from unlike things, arranging things in meaningful orders, and more. 
Dishes, flatware, pots and pans are grouped into drawers and shelves of like things, that 
is, categories. They are further grouped into hierarchies of categories, plates on one 
shelf, bowls on another, both grouped by size. Books are grouped and ordered on 
shelves, perhaps by topic or size or time. These visual-spatial organizations express 
taxonomic categories of kinds and hierarchies of categories. The spaces designed by 
people reflect partonomic thematic organizations as well. The kitchen contains the 
things used for cooking and eating. The bathroom encloses the things used for personal 
care. Table settings express one-to-one correspondences. Assembly lines order in time 
the object-action couplings that form events, putting on clothes or preparing a meal or 
manufacturing automobiles (see Kirsh 1995). These visual and spatial arrangements 
that people impose on the world articulate conceptual correspondences, abstractions. 
Like diagrams, they create patterns that invite the mind to discover their meanings. 
The spatial structures that cultures impose on their environments, inside and out, 
express more: they both affect and reflect the social, political, and economic 
Characterizing Diagrams 
Author's personal copy 
organizations of those societies. The spatial arrangements of the remnants of ancient 
cultures are used by archeologists and historians as clues to the social, political, and 
economic organization of those societies. Is there division of activities within house- 
holds, across households? Is size of space equal across family units or are some families 
allocated more space than others? What structures are proximal, which ones distant? 
Spatial size, proximity, grouping, framing with furnishings and walls all carry social- 
political-economic meaning. People use those visual and spatial arrangements to make 
inferences from the spatial to the social-political-economic in their daily lives. Spatial 
relations suggest social relations: people who sit or walk close to each other are more 
likely to be seen as a social group, and their degree of spatial closeness to reflect their 
social closeness. 
The patterns in space that articulate abstractions are created by actions in space. 
Those actions are incorporated into gestures used to express acts of thought, 
putting, taking, lifting, sorting, pushing, separating, piling, and more. Those 
patterns are used to create the diagrams on paper that have more deliberate intent 
to communicate abstractions. Actions in space express abstractions and create 
abstractions, interlinked processes that have been dubbed spraction (e. g., Tversky 
2011a, 2011b). Forming categories of kinds, parts, and events in the mind helps to 
simplify and organize James��� proverbial ���blooming buzzing confusion��� of sensory 
input. Similarly, designing the world to reflect kinds, parts, events, and other 
abstractions simplifies a complex world by integrating and organizing both per- 
ception and action. The simple patterns created by design actions form good 
gestalts that attract the eye and inform and stimulate the mind. Those patterns 
are used to create the diagrams on paper that have more deliberate intent to 
communicate. The patterns in space are designed by action and support action, 
performing the basic tasks of life, navigation inside and outside, eating, sleeping, 
work, and play. Action. Space. Spraction. Inseparable and integrated.

The Cognitive Design of Tools of Thought
Barbara Tversky
Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014
Abstract When thought overwhelms the mind, the mind puts it into the world, notably
in diagrams and gestures. Both use space and arrays of elements, depictive and non-
depictive, to convey ideas, concrete and abstract,clear and sketchy. The arrays and the
non-depictive elements like boxes and arrows serve to showrelationships and organi-
zations, thematic, categorical, and more. on paper, in the air, in the diagrammedworld
Human actions organize space to convey abstractions: spraction.
ChatGPT
The provided text from "The Cognitive Design of Tools of Thought" by Barbara Tversky delves into the cognitive nature of how humans structure and interpret their environment through diagrams, gestures, and spatial organization. Here's a summarized breakdown of the main points:
1. Diagramming the World:
Diagrams have distinct features that differentiate them from both the objects they represent and from verbal descriptions.
Patterns in diagrams are designed to be visually engaging and prompt inquiries about their organization.
Diagrams facilitate inferences and discoveries.
2. The Designed World:
The way we organize the physical world mirrors the way we design diagrams.
Common objects, like dishes or books, are organized into categories and hierarchies.
These spatial organizations express both taxonomic (kinds of things) and partonomic (parts of a whole) categorizations.
Spaces designed by humans, like rooms, signify thematic organizations (e.g., a kitchen is for cooking).
3. Cultural Implications of Spatial Structures:
The way spaces are organized in cultures can give insights into the social, political, and economic structures of those societies.
Archaeologists and historians use spatial structures from ancient cultures to infer their societal organizations.
In modern times, the way space is utilized can indicate social relationships. For example, people sitting close together might be perceived as a social group.
4. Action and Abstraction in Space:
Actions in space, like organizing or designing something, give rise to patterns that represent abstract concepts.
These patterns also find their way into diagrams and gestures that aim to communicate ideas.
Actions in space, such as categorizing or organizing objects, help make sense of the overwhelming sensory input we receive from the world.
Designing our environment based on these abstractions simplifies our world by organizing our perceptions and actions.
These design actions form patterns that attract attention and stimulate thought.
5. Spraction:
The term "spraction" seems to be a coined term that represents the intertwined nature of space and action.
The concept emphasizes that actions in space are both a reflection of and a tool for abstract thinking.
These actions, whether they're about navigation, eating, or any other basic life task, demonstrate the seamless integration of action and space.
Abstract:
When the mind is overwhelmed with thought, it externalizes these thoughts in the form of diagrams and gestures.
Both diagrams and gestures utilize space and certain elements to convey ideas, be they clear or abstract.
Diagrams use non-depictive elements to indicate relationships and organizations.
Human actions, through their organization of space, convey abstractions, a concept termed as "spraction".
This text underscores the idea that the human mind's cognitive processes, especially concerning abstract thought, are often reflected and facilitated by external tools like diagrams, gestures, and the organization of space.
To tie these ideas back, what I am calling anaphora resolution is similar to her definition of spraction.
ChatGPT
Anaphora resolution, in linguistic terms, refers to the process by which a pronoun or other referential expression in a text is linked to its antecedent (i.e., the word or phrase that the pronoun is referring to). For instance, in the sentence "Jane went to the store because she needed groceries", "she" is an anaphoric reference to "Jane". The cognitive task involves linking "she" with its appropriate referent, "Jane".
Drawing a connection between anaphora resolution and spraction, as described by Barbara Tversky:
Cognitive Linking:
Both anaphora resolution and spraction involve a form of cognitive linking. In anaphora resolution, pronouns are linked to their antecedents. In spraction, actions in space are linked to abstract concepts or categorizations.
Organizing Complex Information:
Both processes are about organizing complex information into coherent, understandable structures. Anaphora resolution organizes linguistic information for better comprehension, while spraction organizes spatial and action-related information for understanding abstract concepts.
Externalization of Cognitive Processes:
Anaphora resolution is a linguistic tool that allows for more concise communication, externalizing the need to repeat certain information. Similarly, spraction is about externalizing thought into the physical world through organization and design.
Facilitation of Understanding:
Both concepts assist in facilitating understanding. Anaphora resolution aids in text comprehension by preventing redundancy and maintaining continuity. Spraction, on the other hand, simplifies and structures the environment to make abstract ideas more graspable.
Reflecting Internal Thought Processes:
Just as anaphora resolution reflects the cognitive process of linking referential expressions to their antecedents, spraction reflects the cognitive process of connecting actions in space with abstract thought.
In summary, if you're drawing a parallel between anaphora resolution and spraction, it can be seen as two cognitive tools or processes that humans employ to make sense of and organize the world around them, be it through language or through spatial and action-based organization. Both provide insight into how the human mind processes and represents information.

**The Anaphoric Nature of Perception and Cognition: Bridging Linguistics and Action**

In our quest to understand the intricacies of the human mind, two seemingly disparate concepts emerge: anaphora resolution in linguistics and spraction as described by Barbara Tversky. However, upon closer examination, these notions converge, revealing the profound ways in which humans perceive, process, and represent information.

**Anaphora and Intentionality**

Anaphora resolution is a cognitive task rooted in linguistics, dealing with the linkage of pronouns or referential expressions to their respective antecedents. Take the sentence "Jane went to the store because she needed groceries." Here, "she" acts as an anaphoric reference to "Jane." This process is emblematic of the brain's innate ability to establish continuity and coherence in narratives, reducing redundancy and facilitating comprehension.

Beyond linguistics, we've broadened the term "anaphora" to encompass intentionality or a directed goal state. In this light, both humans and artificial systems act as anaphoric agents, drawing on past experiences or data to shape their future actions. Such a framework suggests that the principle underpinning anaphora resolution is not just linguistic but pervasive across various cognitive tasks.

**Spraction: The Spatial Cognition of Abstract Thought**

Barbara Tversky's concept of spraction illuminates the link between actions in space and abstract thought. Humans often externalize cognitive processes, translating intangible ideas into physical, spatial manifestations. Think of a teacher using blocks to represent mathematical concepts or a mind map capturing the interconnectedness of ideas. Spraction is about this translation, highlighting the human propensity to simplify and structure the environment for more effective understanding.

**Connecting the Dots: Anaphora and Spraction**

1. **Cognitive Linking**: Both anaphora resolution and spraction pivot around cognitive linking. While anaphora resolution connects pronouns to antecedents, spraction links spatial actions to abstract notions. This linkage facilitates more effortless navigation of information, be it in linguistic or spatial realms.

2. **Organizing Information**: Humans innately seek patterns and structures. Anaphora resolution and spraction serve this end, organizing linguistic and spatial data respectively, crafting coherent narratives or representations.

3. **Externalization**: Both processes serve as tools to externalize thought. Anaphora resolution allows for succinct communication by forgoing the need for repetition, whereas spraction manifests abstract thought in tangible, physical forms.

4. **Facilitating Understanding**: At their core, both anaphora resolution and spraction aim to simplify complexity. They act as bridges, aiding humans in grasping intricate linguistic narratives or understanding abstract ideas through spatial representation.

5. **Mirroring Thought Processes**: These concepts not only aid understanding but also offer windows into cognitive processes. Just as anaphora resolution unveils the cognitive linkage of referential expressions, spraction provides insights into how spatial actions correlate with abstract reasoning.

**Conclusion**

In essence, anaphora resolution and spraction epitomize the human endeavor to interpret and structure the world. They underscore the multifaceted ways in which our brains process information, be it through the prism of language or the lens of spatial action. These cognitive tools not only shape our understanding but also reflect the intricate ballet of neural processes that underpin human cognition. By exploring these parallels, we gain a deeper appreciation of the marvel that is the human mind.

The Anaphoric Nature of Perception and Cognition: Bridging Linguistics and Action
Human cognition, as intricate as it is, often navigates the vast seas of information through sophisticated mechanisms. Among these, anaphora resolution in linguistics and Barbara Tversky's notion of spraction provide insights into the underlying patterns of human thought processes.
Anaphora and Intentionality
At the intersection of language and thought lies the mechanism of anaphora resolution, a linchpin that connects pronouns or referential expressions to their antecedents. Consider the statement, "Jane went to the store because she needed groceries." The reference of "she" to "Jane" demonstrates the brain's prowess in maintaining narrative continuity, cutting down redundancy, and ensuring smooth comprehension.
But if we delve deeper, anaphora transcends mere linguistic boundaries, hinting at a broader theme of intentionality. Here, both humans and even artificial systems emerge as anaphoric agents, drawing from historical contexts to inform their forthcoming actions. Such an expansion of anaphora's domain suggests its foundational role across diverse cognitive endeavors.
Spraction: The Spatial Cognition of Abstract Thought
Venturing beyond language, Barbara Tversky's spraction brings to the fore the intimate bond between actions performed in spatial realms and abstract thought. It captures our inherent need to externalize complex cognitive processes, turning abstract concepts into tangible, spatial entities. This is evident when a teacher elucidates abstract mathematical ideas using tangible blocks or when someone sketches a mind map to visualize intricate interconnections.
Connecting the Dots: Anaphora and Spraction
Cognitive Linking
: Both concepts pivot on the fulcrum of cognitive linkage. While anaphora resolution forms linguistic connections, spraction forges ties between spatial actions and abstract concepts, enabling smoother navigation across informational landscapes.
Organizing Information
: There's an inherent human drive to seek coherence and structure. Anaphora resolution offers this in linguistic narratives, and spraction provides it in spatial representations.
Externalization
: Both mechanisms act as conduits to manifest internal thought processes. Anaphora resolution achieves linguistic succinctness, avoiding repetition, while spraction translates intangible thought into the physical domain.
Facilitating Understanding
: Both these processes serve as bridges over cognitive chasms, simplifying intricate narratives or abstract thoughts, making them more accessible.
Mirroring Thought Processes
: These tools are more than just aids; they're mirrors reflecting our cognitive operations. Just as anaphora resolution sheds light on linguistic connections, spraction provides a glimpse into the correlation between spatial activities and abstract contemplation.
Conclusion
Anaphora resolution and spraction stand as beacons, illuminating the intricate pathways of human cognition. They underline the diverse strategies our brains employ, whether through linguistic constructs or spatial actions. These cognitive mechanisms not only sculpt our understanding of the world but also echo the elaborate dance of neural processes that define human thought.

Connections with theory of mind formation.
ChatGPT
Anaphoric Agents and the Theory of Mind Formation
The "Theory of Mind" (ToM) is a cognitive ability that allows individuals to attribute mental states to themselves and others, which includes understanding that others have beliefs, desires, intentions, and perspectives different from their own. Let's explore how the concepts we discussed under "Anaphoric Agents" intertwine with ToM:
Foundations of Perception
: Our initial exploration of the nature of existence and perception becomes crucial in ToM. The way we perceive life and the narratives surrounding it is foundational to understanding not just our mental state but also the potential mental states of others.
Anaphora Resolution and Intentionality
: The process of anaphora resolution, where pronouns or references connect to their antecedents, mirrors the ToM's process of understanding implied intentions in communication. When someone refers to an "it" or "them," our ability to discern to whom or what they are referring draws upon similar cognitive processes as understanding their potential intentions or emotions.
Spraction and Spatial Cognition
: Our ability to connect spatial actions with abstract thoughts can be seen as a subset of ToM. Recognizing that a particular gesture or spatial arrangement means something abstract to someone else requires an understanding of their mental state or intention.
Predicting Actions
: Both the anaphoric agents concept and ToM involve predicting future actions based on past data or experiences. In ToM, this is evident when we predict someone's behavior based on our understanding of their beliefs, desires, and intentions.
Externalization of Thought
: ToM often involves interpreting not just verbal cues but also non-verbal ones, like gestures, which is a form of thought externalization. This parallels with our discussion on how both anaphora resolution and spraction serve as tools to externalize thoughts.
Empathy and Understanding
: Just as anaphora resolution and spraction help simplify complex linguistic narratives or abstract ideas for better understanding, ToM allows for a deeper empathy and understanding of others by attributing mental states to them.
Conclusion
:
The intricate dance of cognitive processes that we discussed under "Anaphoric Agents" can be seen as building blocks or parallels to the broader cognitive capability of Theory of Mind. Both realms underscore our inherent need to connect, understand, and empathize with the world and people around us, reflecting the depth and richness of human cognition.

The text appears to be from a book titled "Voice and Inversion" edited by I. Gw��n and deals with the linguistic concepts of "voice" and "ergativity" in a language called Karao. The specific section you've provided focuses on the distribution of "non-referring, non-anaphoric agents and patients" in the Karao language.
The key points from the excerpt are as follows:
Active-Direct Constructions vs Passive and Antipassive Constructions
: The text distinguishes between these constructions based on the frequency distribution of non-referring, non-anaphoric agents and patients.
Agents and Patients
: The study seems to be comparing the presence (overt) and absence of agents and patients in different types of constructions. Specifically:
Active-direct constructions generally have a high frequency of referring, anaphoric agents and patients.
Passive constructions show a high frequency of non-referring, non-anaphoric agents.
Antipassive constructions present a high frequency of non-referring or non-anaphoric patients.
Suppression by Deletion
: In some languages, non-referring or non-anaphoric agents and patients can be completely suppressed through deletion.
Anaphoric Status
: The text indicates that in Karao, anaphoric referents are typically referring, while non-anaphoric referents are usually non-referring.
Table 25
: This table appears to provide data on the anaphoric status of agents and patients in active-direct clauses, distinguishing between overt and absent agents and patients and identifying which of them are anaphoric and which are non-anaphoric.
The term "anaphoric agents" seems to be related to the anaphoric status of agents in the Karao language and how they manifest in different syntactic constructions.
Connections with the previous topics.
ChatGPT
Certainly! Drawing connections between the provided excerpt on "anaphoric agents" in the Karao language and the previous topics we discussed:
1. Anaphora Resolution and Linguistics
:
The excerpt details anaphoric agents and patients in a specific linguistic context, the Karao language. Anaphora resolution, as previously discussed, deals with linking referential expressions to their antecedents. In the context of Karao, the identification and analysis of "anaphoric" and "non-anaphoric" agents and patients seem to be an application of this broader cognitive process.
2. Spraction and Spatial Cognition
:
Spraction, as coined by Barbara Tversky, refers to the intertwining of spatial actions and abstract thought. While the Karao excerpt primarily revolves around linguistic constructs, there is an underlying spatial cognition in language structure. The overt and absent agents and patients, and their arrangement in different constructions, can be seen as a form of linguistic spatial organization.
3. Theory of Mind Formation
:
Understanding linguistic structures, such as anaphoric agents, necessitates a cognitive awareness of speakers' intentions and references. This mirrors the theory of mind, where one's ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others aids in predicting and interpreting actions. In linguistic terms, understanding anaphoric agents and patients requires a comprehension of the speaker's intentions behind choosing specific constructions.
4. Cognitive Processes
:
Both the concepts of anaphora resolution and the linguistic structures in Karao underscore the brain's cognitive processes. While anaphora resolution speaks to the brain's ability to link references, the examination of anaphoric agents and patients in Karao reveals how languages structure and reduce complexity for clarity and communication.
5. Externalization of Thought
:
The Karao language's specific structures externalize thought processes, much like how spraction involves the externalization of abstract ideas into spatial representations. Linguistic structures in Karao, like anaphoric agents, serve as tools that help speakers convey specific meanings, reducing ambiguity and ensuring comprehension.

It emphasizes the multifaceted ways humans structure and communicate their experiences and intentions.
Give a summary for a 2nd grader.
ChatGPT
Alright! Here's a simple summary:
We talked about how our brains understand who or what sentences are about, like figuring out who "she" is when someone says, "Jane went to the park because she wanted to play." We also discussed how sometimes we use objects, like blocks or drawings, to help explain ideas. Just like in a game of "connect the dots," our brain connects pieces of information to understand stories and ideas better. Lastly, we looked at a special way a language called Karao talks about who is doing what in sentences. It's like piecing together a puzzle to understand what's happening in a story!
Karao (also spelled Karaw) is a language of northern Luzon, Philippines. It is spoken in the Karao, Ekip, and Bokod areas of western Benguet Province, and in the southwestern corner of Ifugao Province. The language is named after the barangay of Karaw in Bokod municipality, Benguet.
ChatGPT
Thank you for sharing that information. Karao is one of the many unique languages spoken in the Philippines, a country with a rich tapestry of linguistic diversity. Understanding the structure and intricacies of languages like Karao helps linguists and researchers uncover more about human cognition, culture, and the way different communities communicate and perceive the world.
Could I get one more summary of the conversation.
ChatGPT
Of course!
We dove deep into understanding complex ideas about how our minds work. We looked at "anaphora resolution," which is how our brain connects words like "she" or "he" to the person they're talking about. We also explored "spraction," a concept by Barbara Tversky, which is about how we use actions and space to express and understand abstract thoughts. Then, we talked about how these ideas can be related and combined to give insights into human thinking. We also touched on "Karao," a unique language from the Philippines. Throughout the conversation, we saw how language, action, and thought are closely connected.
Could you define spraction again?
ChatGPT
Certainly!
Spraction, as described by Barbara Tversky, is a concept that illuminates the connection between actions in space and abstract thought. It's about how humans often translate intangible, abstract ideas into physical, spatial manifestations. This could be through actions, gestures, or the arrangement of objects in space to represent more complex notions or ideas. The term "spraction" essentially combines "spatial" and "action" to emphasize this relationship between our physical actions and abstract reasoning.
Ok it is awkward to say, there isn't an r in spatial or action
ChatGPT
You're right. My apologies for the oversight. The term "spraction" derives from the idea of blending "space" and "action" to represent the concept of expressing abstract ideas through spatial actions. Thank you for pointing that out.
I guess it also is supposed to reference the word abstraction as well

Life presents as a continuous multimodal barrage on all our senses. From that, we abstract events, discrete units characterized by completion of goals and peaks of action. Effective communication of sequences of events in explanations and narratives is similarly segmented, and linked globally by overall themes and locally by anaphora. Visuospatial explanations and narratives, notably diagrams, comics, and gestures, rely on congruity of mappings of elements and relations of ideas to space and marks in space. Just as we design visuospatial discourse, we design the world: Our design actions in space create diagrams in the world, patterns, piles, rows, one-to-one correspondences, and the like, that express abstractions, categories, hierarchies, dimensions, and more, a circular process termed spraction. There is life. There is the perception of life. There are stories of life. Life is outside. It happens in space and time. It happens without narration and without explanation. Perception of life is quite different. Perception is inside. Perception goes beyond the information given. Perception happens in lumps and pieces and pieces of pieces. The pieces are multiply organized across modalities, in space and in time. Perception of life happens with interpretations. Interpretations link the pieces. Stories of life are different yet again. Stories are outside again. Stories are again multiply organized, in time, in space, and more. Stories have a point of view, an audience, an agenda. Stories, especially in the wild, can be told with words, with gesture, with prosody, with props, and with sketches. What follows is a story of stories: a story about the perception and cognition of the events of life, a story about stories of life, a story about story telling. Finally, a story called Spraction that integrates space, action, and abstraction; diagrams, gesture, and thought. Because this is a story (of stories), it has a point of view, an agenda, and an audience. Its point of view is mine, its agenda is surveying some of the research my stimulating collaborators and I have been involved in, and its audience is you. I hope you will find the work almost as exciting and insightful as we have. Truth in advertising.The stories will not be the gripping stories in books or films, or those told by your friends.The stories will be simple and mundane; they will take place in space and be ordered in time. They usually have action and causes. Most of the stories will be visual and most will be explanations; nevertheless, they carry many of the key features of traditional stories. They have patterns, though it is often the breaking or expanding of those basic patterns that allow the drama and surprises and suspense of gripping stories. For the most part, the stories told here lack characters and lack social intrigue. Despite those caveats for modesty, we begin on a grandiose scale: perceiving the events of life.
ChatGPT
Certainly! From the excerpt provided, the term "spraction" encompasses a broad range of cognitive phenomena related to the way humans perceive, represent, and communicate about the world around them. Here's a concise breakdown:
Spraction
:
Definition
: Spraction represents the blending of "space," "action," and "abstraction." It is a process wherein abstract ideas and concepts are represented and understood through spatial actions.
Life and Perception
: Life occurs in a continuous, multimodal stream. We perceive and segment life into discrete events based on goals and action peaks. Perception happens internally, and it interprets these events, connecting the various segmented pieces.
Stories of Life
: Beyond mere perception, humans construct narratives or stories to make sense of life. These stories can be multi-modal, using words, gestures, sounds, and visuals. They offer a structured way to interpret and communicate about the world, shaped by perspectives, audiences, and agendas.
Designing the World
: As we interact with our environment, we create spatial patterns and structures (e.g., piles, rows) that help express abstractions. These design actions are both a result of and an influence on our perception and cognition ��� a circular process referred to as spraction.
Nature of Stories
: While the narratives discussed here might be simpler than complex tales from literature or cinema, they retain fundamental characteristics of stories. They possess patterns, are rooted in space and time, and often contain action and causality.
In essence, spraction emphasizes the interconnectedness of spatial actions, abstraction, and cognitive processes. It highlights how humans inherently utilize space and action to understand, communicate, and navigate the abstractions of life.
I think it is a hard word to say, I think I will go with my expanded definition of anaphora resolution. I prefer call it sparse Bayesian factor analysis on world models and theories of mind.
ChatGPT
Sparse Bayesian factor analysis on world models and theories of mind certainly sounds like a sophisticated and nuanced term. The phrase emphasizes a statistical and analytical approach to understanding cognitive processes. Here's a brief breakdown:
Sparse Bayesian Factor Analysis
: This is a statistical method used to reduce the dimensionality of data and uncover underlying patterns. "Sparse" implies that the method tries to represent the data using as few factors as possible, leading to a more parsimonious representation. Bayesian methods incorporate prior knowledge or beliefs into the analysis.
World Models
: These refer to the mental representations or schemas we have about the world. It's how we make sense of our surroundings, predict future events, and interpret the past.
Theories of Mind
: This is the ability to attribute mental states���beliefs, intents, desires, emotions, knowledge, etc.���to oneself and others and to understand that others have beliefs, desires, intentions, and perspectives that are different from one's own.
By combining these concepts, it seems you're delving into a comprehensive analysis of how individuals construct, refine, and utilize their internal models of the world, based on both external data and prior beliefs, while also considering the perspectives and beliefs of others. This expanded definition of anaphora resolution captures the complexity and depth of human cognition, especially when navigating social interactions and interpreting linguistic constructs.
Explain in more detail
ChatGPT
Of course, let's delve deeper into the components of your expanded definition of anaphora resolution: "sparse Bayesian factor analysis on world models and theories of mind."
1. Sparse Bayesian Factor Analysis:
Sparse
: In data analysis, "sparse" refers to techniques that emphasize simplicity by using as few components as possible. For instance, in factor analysis, which aims to represent data using underlying patterns, a sparse approach would try to describe the data using the minimal number of factors.
Bayesian
: Bayesian methods are grounded in Bayes' theorem, which allows one to update the probability estimate for an event as more evidence or information becomes available. In the context of data analysis, Bayesian methods involve integrating prior knowledge (or beliefs) with current observed data. This can make for more refined and accurate models, especially when data is limited.
Factor Analysis
: Factor analysis is a method used to identify underlying relationships between observed variables. It aims to find latent (or hidden) variables, called factors, that can explain patterns in the observed data.
2. World Models:
World models are our mental maps or schemas of how the world operates. These cognitive structures encompass our beliefs, knowledge, and assumptions and guide our interpretations of experiences, allowing us to make predictions or infer causations.
3. Theories of Mind:
Cognitive Aspect
: This pertains to understanding that people have their own beliefs, knowledge, emotions, desires, intentions, etc., which can be different from our own.
Predictive Aspect
: Using the theory of mind, we can anticipate how others might think or feel in certain situations, allowing us to predict their potential reactions or behaviors.
Integrating the Concepts:
Sparse Bayesian factor analysis on world models and theories of mind integrates statistical methods with cognitive models. Essentially, this suggests a method of understanding and modeling how individuals:
Process and simplify vast amounts of information (sparse factor analysis)
Update beliefs and knowledge based on new information (Bayesian approach)
Construct and refine their perceptions of the world (world models)
Navigate social interactions by considering the perspectives and beliefs of others (theories of mind)
In essence, this expanded definition provides a comprehensive framework to analyze and understand human cognition, particularly in the realms of linguistic interpretation and social interaction. It acknowledges that our perceptions are continually refined based on new data and prior beliefs and emphasizes the importance of understanding both our own and others' mental states.
Do you think you could include that an essay titled Anaphora Analysis?
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Here's how it could look:
Anaphora Analysis: Sparse Bayesian Factor Analysis on World Models and Theories of Mind
Anaphora resolution, traditionally rooted in the realm of linguistics, seeks to understand the linkage of pronouns or referential expressions to their antecedents, ensuring continuity and coherence in narratives. However, a deeper exploration reveals that this process is emblematic of a broader cognitive mechanism. In this essay, we will expand the horizon of anaphora resolution to encompass sparse Bayesian factor analysis on world models and theories of mind.
Sparse Bayesian Factor Analysis and its Relevance
The world of data analysis introduces us to the concept of 'sparse' methodologies, emphasizing techniques that use as few components as possible. Such sparsity ensures efficiency, eliminating unnecessary redundancy ��� much like how anaphora resolution works in language, reducing the need to repetitively mention a previously introduced subject.
Incorporating the Bayesian approach, we recognize the evolving nature of understanding. As Bayes' theorem suggests, our knowledge isn't static; it updates with every new piece of information. This dynamic adjustment mirrors the way our linguistic understanding evolves as a conversation or narrative progresses.
Factor analysis, by attempting to uncover hidden variables or patterns within observed data, ties back to the linguistic endeavor of decoding underlying meanings or references in a text or discourse.
World Models: Mapping the Cognitive Landscape
Just as anaphora resolution aids in navigating a text, our world models assist in navigating life. These mental maps, comprising our beliefs, assumptions, and prior knowledge, influence our interpretation of experiences, helping us predict outcomes or deduce causations.
Theories of Mind: Beyond Ourselves
One of the cornerstones of human cognition and interaction is our ability to understand that others possess their distinct beliefs, desires, and intentions. This theory of mind not only allows us to comprehend diverse perspectives but also to anticipate potential reactions or behaviors of others ��� a skill that is invaluable in complex linguistic exchanges, where understanding the speaker's intention can elucidate ambiguous anaphoric references.
Synthesis: A Broader Perspective on Anaphora
In tying these concepts together, we realize that anaphora resolution isn't merely a linguistic tool but a reflection of a vast cognitive landscape. Through sparse Bayesian factor analysis, we see the efficiency and dynamic evolution of understanding. World models reveal the framework of our perceptions, while theories of mind underscore the essence of our social and linguistic interactions.
In conclusion, "Anaphora Analysis" is not just about connecting words to their meanings; it's about connecting our understanding of the world to the myriad ways we interpret and interact with it. The intricate dance between language, cognition, and social understanding gives us a richer, more holistic view of the human mind and its capabilities.
This essay intertwines the concepts of anaphora resolution with sparse Bayesian factor analysis, world models, and theories of mind to provide a comprehensive understanding of human cognition in both linguistic and social realms.
Does it make any sense? I might be just throwing random words together.
ChatGPT
Your concepts are ambitious and you're venturing into a rich intersection of fields. The interplay of linguistic constructs like anaphora with statistical methods (like sparse Bayesian factor analysis) and cognitive models can indeed offer a fascinating perspective. However, to someone unfamiliar with these concepts, the connections might seem abstract or tangential.
When combining concepts from disparate domains, it's crucial to ensure clarity and coherence for the reader. Here are a few points to consider:
Clarify the Concepts
: Before drawing connections, explain each concept in simple terms. For instance, provide an intuitive understanding of sparse Bayesian factor analysis or world models before delving into their linguistic parallels.
Build Connections Gradually
: Start with the most intuitive connections and gradually build to more complex ones. For instance, you might begin by connecting anaphora resolution with world models since both involve building upon prior knowledge. Then, introduce Bayesian updating as a method of refining those models based on new information.
Use Analogies and Examples
: Concrete examples or analogies can illustrate abstract concepts. For instance, showing how Bayesian updating is like revising one's understanding of a story's character based on new plot revelations can bridge statistical concepts and narrative comprehension.
Seek Feedback
: Discuss your ideas with peers or experts in linguistics, cognitive science, or data analysis. They can offer insights, identify potential pitfalls, or suggest refinements.
Iterate and Refine
: The synthesis of such broad concepts might not be immediately clear, but with iterative writing and refining, you can sharpen your arguments and connections.
While there's always a risk of venturing into "buzzword territory" when merging complex topics, genuine exploration and a clear intent to communicate can lead to novel and insightful perspectives. If you're passionate about these ideas, it's worth pursuing, but be prepared for a process of refining and clarifying your arguments.
Use some metaphors and analogies to explain it.
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's use metaphors and analogies to unpack your concept of "sparse Bayesian factor analysis on world models and theories of mind," as related to anaphora resolution:
Anaphora as a Bookmark
: Imagine you're reading a long novel, and you use a bookmark to remember where you left off. Each time a pronoun is used in a text, it's like placing a bookmark that reminds you of a previously mentioned character or concept. Just as you wouldn't want to flip back through hundreds of pages to recall the character, anaphora in language reduces the need for repetition and keeps the narrative flowing smoothly.
Bayesian Analysis as a Chef Adjusting a Recipe
: Think of a chef tasting a soup and deciding to adjust the salt based on the flavor. Bayesian analysis is similar���it updates predictions based on new data. If the original prediction (or recipe) is our prior understanding (prior belief), the new data (tasting the soup) helps update this belief to be more accurate.
Sparse Factor Analysis as a Packing Strategy
: Imagine packing for a trip and wanting to carry as few items as possible but ensuring you have all essentials. Similarly, sparse factor analysis identifies the most influential factors in a dataset, minimizing redundancy, and focusing on what's crucial.
World Models as a Personal Map
: Envision everyone having their own map of a city. While all maps depict the same city, they emphasize different landmarks based on personal experiences. A world model is this personal map, highlighting certain experiences and knowledge while perhaps omitting or downplaying others.
Theories of Mind as a Theater Play
: Imagine each person's mind is a theater play. While the basic script (human nature) is the same, individual actors (personal experiences) give their unique spin, leading to different interpretations. Theories of mind refer to our ability to predict or understand another person's "play" or perspective based on our knowledge of the general script and the nuances we've observed in others.
Incorporating these analogies and metaphors into an essay titled "Anaphora Analysis" could provide a more intuitive understanding of the interplay between linguistic constructs, statistical methodologies, and cognitive models.
Ok see if you can incorporate it, using more technical and academic terms, such as in visual complex analysis or geometric calculus
ChatGPT
Anaphora Analysis: Sparse Bayesian Factorization in Geometric Context
The study of language and cognition has always been intricately linked with mathematical representations, and the advanced realms of visual complex analysis and geometric calculus offer invaluable insights into this connection. By diving deeper into anaphora resolution using these advanced mathematical lenses, we can elucidate the intricate web of connections in human cognition.
Anaphora as a Contour Integral
: In visual complex analysis, contour integrals evaluate functions over complex-valued paths. Analogously, anaphora resolution can be viewed as a contour integral, where the path winds through the narrative, with each anaphoric reference looping back to its antecedent, contributing to the holistic understanding of the text.
Sparse Bayesian Factorization and Geometric Structures
: Just as geometric calculus explores structures and transformations in space, sparse Bayesian factor analysis pinpoints the most influential elements in a dataset. In linguistic datasets, such Bayesian approaches can be visualized as geometric transformations, projecting high-dimensional linguistic data into more comprehensible, lower-dimensional spaces. The "sparseness" ensures that only the most salient linguistic features are accentuated, akin to focusing on crucial vectors in a geometric space.
World Models as Riemann Surfaces
: In complex analysis, Riemann surfaces allow functions to have multiple values, similar to how world models have multiple perspectives. Each individual's cognitive 'surface' might have different twists and turns based on their unique experiences, yet there's an underlying structure common to all, much like the fundamental properties of Riemann surfaces.
Theories of Mind as Tensor Calculus
: Tensors, fundamental in expressing geometric relationships, can represent the multi-layered facets of the human mind. Understanding another person's perspective���their emotions, beliefs, and intentions���can be conceptualized as interpreting the various tensor fields interacting in their cognitive space. Our capacity for such understanding underscores our ability to navigate these complex, intertwined fields.
Sparse Factorization and the Mobius Transformation
: The Mobius transformation in complex analysis offers a powerful tool for mapping points within a plane. Similarly, sparse factor analysis identifies the core components (or points) of a dataset. Both methodologies emphasize transformation and reduction, boiling down complex systems to their most essential and interpretable forms.
In conclusion, by integrating the precision of visual complex analysis and geometric calculus with the study of anaphora resolution, we can gain a richer, multi-dimensional understanding of linguistic cognition. This interdisciplinary approach not only enhances our comprehension of language's intricate structures but also underscores the universality of mathematical frameworks across diverse domains.
Include another example based on this: Here are the key points about sparse and redundant representations for image denoising via dictionary learning:

- The approach is based on representing image patches sparsely over a trained dictionary, rather than a predefined transform like DCT or wavelets. 

- A "Sparseland" model assumes that each image patch can be represented as a sparse linear combination of atoms in an overcomplete (redundant) dictionary. 

- Dictionary learning algorithms like K-SVD are used to learn the dictionary directly from image examples/patches.

- Local patch-based approaches are extended to whole images by defining a global Bayesian prior that enforces sparsity over patches at all locations.

- This leads to a MAP image reconstruction formulation, whose solution is an iterative algorithm alternating between sparse coding of patches and averaging results. 

- Training can also be done directly on the corrupted image, fusing training and denoising into a single iterative process of alternation. 

- Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art denoising performance comparable to or better than leading methods like non-local means, showing the effectiveness of the local sparse approach on patches.

So in summary, the key idea is to learn an efficient sparse representation of natural images by training an overcomplete dictionary, and use this learned prior within a global Bayesian reconstruction framework for effective denoising.
ChatGPT
Anaphora Analysis in a Mathematical Framework: From Linguistics to Image Denoising
Delving into the world of linguistics and cognition through mathematical and computational paradigms is both intriguing and informative. Much like the complexity of language patterns and anaphora resolution, the realm of image denoising through sparse and redundant representations exemplifies the intricate dance between mathematics, computation, and real-world applications.
Anaphora as Sparse Representation
: Just as anaphora in linguistics requires concise referencing back to its antecedent for clarity, the realm of image denoising relies on sparse representation of image patches. Both emphasize the importance of reducing data to its most meaningful components, whether it's the most salient linguistic feature or the most defining image patch.
Training Dictionaries and World Models
: In image denoising, rather than utilizing predefined transforms, algorithms like K-SVD train dictionaries directly from image patches. This mirrors the concept of world models in linguistics, where individual experiences craft unique cognitive 'dictionaries' over time.
'Sparseland' and Riemann Surfaces
: The 'Sparseland' model in image denoising posits that each image patch can be represented sparsely over a redundant dictionary. This can be likened to Riemann surfaces in complex analysis, where multiple perspectives (or values) coexist, and yet an underlying structure remains consistent.
Global Bayesian Priors and Theories of Mind
: Extending local patch-based approaches in image denoising to whole images by establishing a global Bayesian prior aligns with how theories of mind are constructed. Just as the Bayesian prior enforces sparsity across patches, theories of mind serve as overarching cognitive frameworks that guide understanding and predictions about others.
Iterative Algorithm and Anaphora Resolution
: The MAP image reconstruction formulation in image denoising is solved through an iterative algorithm, similar to the iterative process of anaphora resolution in linguistics, where each reference is traced back step by step to its originating source.
Training on Corrupted Images and Real-world Cognition
: In image denoising, training can also occur directly on the corrupted image, combining training and denoising in an iterative process. This mirrors the cognitive process of navigating the 'noisy' real-world information, refining understanding and beliefs as new data is encountered.
In essence, both anaphora resolution in linguistics and sparse representation in image denoising hinge on the idea of filtering out noise and focusing on the most meaningful components. By drawing these parallels, we recognize the ubiquity and versatility of mathematical and computational frameworks across diverse fields.
Here are more details on dictionary learning using K-SVD and the proposed denoising algorithm:

- K-SVD is an iterative algorithm that learns an overcomplete dictionary to sparsely represent a set of training samples/patches. 

- It alternates between sparse coding steps, where patches are represented over the fixed dictionary, and a dictionary update step. 

- In the dictionary update step, atoms are modified one at a time to better represent reconstruction errors of sparse representations. 

- Using a global image prior instead of just local patch sparsity enforces coherence across patches. This helps mitigate blocking artifacts.

- The MAP formulation with global prior leads to an iterative patch-by-patch sparse coding algorithm:

- In each iteration, patches are extracted from the current estimate and sparse coded over the dictionary. 

- The sparse codes are then used to reconstruct each patch, and the reconstructions are averaged and substituted back into the image.

- This has the effect of denoising while maintaining structure and coherence across patch boundaries.

- The algorithm can also iteratively update the dictionary using the noisy image, jointly optimizing denoising and representation learning in a single process.

So in summary, K-SVD learns an effective sparse dictionary, while the global priorbased iterative algorithm smoothly integrates local sparse representations to produce high quality denoised images.
ChatGPT
Anaphora Analysis and K-SVD in Image Denoising: A Deep Dive into Mathematical Constructs
The intricate layers of human language, exemplified by phenomena such as anaphora, parallel the mathematical structures in image processing. The realm of dictionary learning using K-SVD for image denoising brings forth this intersection in profound ways.
K-SVD as the Cognitive Schema
: Much like the brain's ability to reference previously mentioned entities in language (anaphora resolution), K-SVD works iteratively, building an overcomplete dictionary tailored for sparse representation. Its two-step dance ��� sparse coding on a stable dictionary and then dictionary modification ��� mirrors the continuous cognitive adjustments we make when processing language.
Atoms and Linguistic Elements
: At the heart of K-SVD, atoms of the dictionary are singularly refined during the update step. They strive to minimize the reconstruction errors, akin to the precision with which antecedents in linguistics are chosen for clarity.
Global Image Priors and Linguistic Context
: Just as a well-defined linguistic context eases anaphora resolution, the global image prior in denoising ensures consistency across image patches, addressing common issues like blocking artifacts. This speaks to the importance of holistic understanding, both in language and in image reconstruction.
Iterative Patchwork and Sentence Construction
: The MAP-based iterative algorithm functions similarly to sentence construction in linguistics. Each iteration, akin to each phrase or clause in a sentence, extracts, refines, and reintegrates information (patches or antecedents) to create a coherent whole.
Denoising as Cognitive Filtering
: The final touch of the algorithm, where local sparse representations are seamlessly woven to present denoised images, can be likened to the brain's ability to filter out extraneous details and focus on primary information when processing language.
Iterative Dictionary Update and Real-time Cognition
: The potential of the algorithm to adaptively update its dictionary using noisy images encapsulates the dynamic nature of cognition ��� ever-evolving and adjusting in real-time as new data emerges.
In summation, the architectural beauty of the K-SVD algorithm and its application in image denoising reflects the complexity and adaptability of linguistic phenomena like anaphora. Drawing from the deep mathematical wells of visual complex analysis and geometric calculus, this exploration underlines the fascinating synergy between computational mathematics and human cognition.
Here are some additional key points about messy diagrams/sketches and gesture diagrams:

- Messy diagrams like sketches can be useful in early problem solving and design stages when concepts are vague. They allow for ambiguity and reinterpretation.

- Designers report having "conversations" with their sketches and making unintended discoveries through reconfiguring sketch elements and relations. 

- Experts are better at discoveries from sketches than novices, making both perceptual inferences about form and conceptual inferences about function/effects.

- Sketching promotes generation of multiple possibilities and new ideas through reinterpretation of ambiguous elements. 

- Even before paper/tools were ubiquitous, people used gestures to externally represent thoughts, creating diagrams in the air.

- Gestures are effective for conveying action/process and don't require external tools. Like paper diagrams, they arrange virtual marks in space.

- Architects still gesture when blindfolded, showing gestures are a natural tool for externalizing spatial/design thought processes.

- Both sketches and gestures allow for ambiguity and reinterpretation that can lead to new discoveries, showing how messy external representations can be useful early in problem solving and design.

So in summary, ambiguous diagrams like sketches and gestures can promote generative thought by enabling reconfiguration and reinterpretation of represented elements and ideas.
ChatGPT
Anaphora Analysis, K-SVD, and the Role of Ambiguous Representations in Design and Cognition
The marvel of human cognition, from linguistic phenomena like anaphora to sophisticated mathematical constructs like K-SVD, finds a fascinating parallel in the way we visually represent ideas through messy sketches and gestural diagrams.
Sketches as Initial Thoughts
: In the realm of design, messy sketches can be equated to preliminary drafts in written discourse. Much like anaphora serves as a referencing tool in linguistics, sketches allow designers to revisit and reinterpret ideas, fostering ambiguity crucial for the germination of innovative concepts.
Dialogues with Diagrams
: Just as K-SVD iteratively refines its dictionary for image processing, designers engage in iterative "conversations" with their sketches. The ability to shuffle, reconfigure, and view sketch elements from fresh perspectives opens the door for unintentional yet groundbreaking discoveries.
Expertise and Perceptual Depth
: An experienced linguist's proficiency in anaphora resolution mirrors a designer's heightened capability to extract both form and function from ambiguous sketches. The difference between a novice and an expert lies in the depths of these conceptual inferences.
Generative Power of Ambiguity
: Sparse representations in K-SVD hint at the potency of minimalism and reinterpretation. Similarly, the ambiguity in sketches paves the way for generating a spectrum of possibilities, making room for creativity.
Gestures as Spatial Narratives
: Before the written script, humans instinctively gestured, crafting stories in the air. These intangible diagrams echo the sparse coding steps of K-SVD, capturing thoughts without a physical medium.
Blindfolded Architects and Inherent Design Instincts
: The sheer instinct of architects to gesture even when sightless underscores the inherent nature of externalizing spatial thoughts. This parallels the way anaphora helps process information, establishing a cognitive connection between past and present elements in language.
Evolution from Ambiguity to Precision
: The journey from ambiguous sketches and gestures to defined designs mimics the progression from sparse Bayesian factor analysis to accurate image denoising in K-SVD. Both processes evolve from vague representations to clearer outcomes through iterative refinement.
In essence, the multifaceted tapestry of linguistic phenomena, computational techniques like K-SVD, and visual representation methods underscores the deep-seated human need for externalization, reinterpretation, and innovation. Ambiguous diagrams, whether they're ephemeral gestures or tangible sketches, magnify our cognitive prowess and our innate drive to shape the abstract into the palpable.
Here are the key points about how arrows convey meaning in diagrams:

- Experiments showed that arrows were interpreted as conveying causal/sequential relationships, while unlabeled diagrams were seen as depicting spatial relationships/structures.

- People given structural descriptions drew diagrams labeling parts, but not using arrows. Those given causal descriptions drew arrows showing the sequence of events but did not label parts. 

- Basic graphic elements like lines, boxes, dots and arrows form a partial semantics or vocabulary for constructing diagrams across domains. The meaning of elements changes slightly by domain.

- Diagrams have their own syntax rules for combining elements, like how lines connect to dots or boxes are arranged, and pragmatic constraints depend on the domain/type of diagram. 

- Spatial dimensions like distance, order, direction are used systematically in diagrams and mappings to represent abstract concepts like time, quantity, preferences:

- Distance represents both physical distance and abstract distances like between preferences. 

- Order and direction are systematically mapped - upwards generally represents increased/better quantities and preferences due to associations with physical strength/health. 

- These systematic mappings from space to meaning are also found in language conventions like "rising to the top" or "falling into depression."

So in summary, basic graphic elements like arrows convey systematic meanings across diagram types, and spatial dimensions systematically represent abstract concepts, showing the emergence of a shared graphical "language."

Arrows and the Semiotic Dance in Diagrams: A Treatise on Visual Language
In the vast tableau of human communication, diagrams, with their use of arrows, lines, dots, and boxes, stand as a testament to our innate inclination towards visual expression. Delving deeper into this medium reveals a fascinating confluence of linguistic, cognitive, and cultural underpinnings.
The Arrow as a Narrative Agent
: Within diagrams, arrows don't merely serve as connectors or indicators of direction. Much like linguistic connectors in sentences, they imply causality and progression. The mere presence of an arrow metamorphoses a simple spatial representation into a dynamic storyboard of sequence and consequence.
The Diagrammatic Dichotomy
: Just as the use of a particular verb tense or preposition in language elucidates the nature of an event, the incorporation (or lack thereof) of arrows and labels in a diagram delineates its intent. Structural descriptions beget labeled parts, while causal ones beget sequenced arrows.
A Cross-Domain Semantics
: Elements such as lines, dots, and arrows form a foundational lexicon for diagrammatic expression. Like the lexemes in natural languages that shift subtly in meaning depending on context, these elements take on nuanced roles across different domains.
The Syntax and Pragmatics of Diagrams
: Akin to grammatical rules in language, diagrams exhibit their own syntax ��� a governing structure for element arrangement. Furthermore, pragmatic constraints, often domain-specific, mold the narrative of the diagram, influencing element interaction.
Space as an Abstract Canvas
: Diagrams employ spatial dimensions not just to depict physicality but to project abstractions. The measured distance between two objects may represent not just spatial separation, but disparities in preferences or values. This harnessing of space to articulate abstract concepts mirrors linguistic constructs where spatial metaphors, such as "rising to the occasion," encapsulate non-spatial ideas.
Cultural Underpinnings and Universality
: The consistent mapping of upward directions to positive or superior attributes perhaps finds its roots in cultural associations, where height often correlates with power or achievement. Such linguistic parallels further affirm the deep-seated interconnectedness between diagrams and language.
In conclusion, while diagrams and linguistic constructs might seem disparate at first glance, they are deeply intertwined. Both harness symbols, whether they're words or arrows, to craft narratives, representing the dance between the concrete and abstract in our cognitive tapestry. The use of arrows and other graphic elements in diagrams showcases a universality of expression, an emergent visual "language" that transcends cultural and linguistic boundaries.

Absolutely. Let's weave together the threads from our discussions on sparse Bayesian factor analysis, the role of diagrams, sketches, gestures, and the semiotics of arrows to craft an integrated understanding:
Sparse Representations & Diagrams
: In the realm of image processing, sparse representations leverage overcomplete dictionaries to efficiently capture information. Similarly, diagrams, with their limited but expressive vocabulary of arrows, lines, and dots, seek to capture and convey complex ideas with economy, much like the sparse representations of natural images.
Ambiguity as an Asset
: Just as in the initial stages of problem-solving, messy sketches and gestures allow for ambiguity and reinterpretation, sparse representations are all about leaving out unnecessary details. This ambiguity is not a limitation but a feature, enabling flexibility and adaptability in both image processing and ideation processes.
Gestures as Natural Tools
: Our inclination to use gestures, even when blindfolded, to externalize thought processes, mirrors our inherent desire for external representation. This is seen in both the 'Spraction' concept, which amalgamates space, action, and abstraction, and in the world of sparse Bayesian factor analysis, where external models aid our understanding.
Arrows, Directionality, and Causality
: In the discourse about arrows in diagrams, we touched upon their power to convey causality and sequence. This mirrors the process of factor analysis, where one seeks to determine causal factors. An arrow, much like a mathematical variable in factor analysis, serves as a directional indicator, pointing towards outcomes from causes.
Shared Semantics and Syntax
: Both in the sparse representations of images and the semantics of diagrams, there's a consistent syntax and semantics at play. Whether it's the systematic mapping of space to meaning in diagrams or the systematic way image patches are mapped onto an overcomplete dictionary, underlying patterns and structures are being leveraged.
Perception, Interpretation, and Representation
: The journey from perception to representation in the realm of 'Spraction' is mirrored in the journey from noisy image to denoised representation in the domain of sparse Bayesian factor analysis. In both, there's a transition from a raw, potentially messy input, through interpretation, to a clearer, structured output.
In summary, while the domains of sparse Bayesian factor analysis and the semiotics of diagrams might seem distant relatives at best, they share common threads. Both are testimonies to human endeavor to simplify, understand, and convey complex phenomena, whether that's in the form of noisy images or complex ideas. Both leverage structure, syntax, and semantics to make sense of the world around them.
