Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge is a 1975 book by Austrian-born philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend. The central thesis of the book is that science should become an anarchic enterprise.[1] In the context of the work, the term "anarchy" refers to epistemological anarchy, which does not remain within one single prescriptive scientific method on the grounds that any such method would restrict scientific progress. The work is notable in the history and philosophy of science partially due to its detailed case study of Galileo's hypothesis that the earth rotates on its axis and has since become a staple reading in introduction to philosophy of science courses at undergraduate and graduate levels.[2]1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT"Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge" is a 1975 book by Paul Feyerabend, an Austrian-born philosopher of science. The main thesis of the book proposes that science should be an anarchic enterprise, meaning it should not be bound by a single prescriptive scientific method. Feyerabend argues that following one specific method could limit scientific progress. The book is renowned in the history and philosophy of science fields, particularly for its detailed case study of Galileo's theory that the Earth rotates on its axis. It has become a standard text in introductory philosophy of science courses at undergraduate and graduate levels.1 / 1Epistemological anarchism
Edit
The primary thesis of Against Method is that there no such thing as the scientific method and we should not impose a single methodological rule upon scientific practices.[10] Rather, 'anything goes' meaning that scientists are free to pursue whatever research seems interesting to them. The primary target of Against Method is 'rationalism', or the view that there are rational rules that should guide scientific practices.[11] The German title of Against Method, Wider den Methodenzwang translates more directly to "Against the Forced Constraint of Method" emphasizing that it is the imposition of methodological rules that is rejected rather that the uses of methods altogether.[12] Feyerabend offers two parallel arguments for this position, one conceptual and another is historical. The conceptual argument aims to establish that it always legitimate to violate established forms of scientific practice with the hopes of establishing a new form of scientific rationality.[13] The historical argument provides examples of scientists profitably violating the rules. Against Method contains dozens of case studies, though the majority of them are relegated to a footnote or passing remarks.[14] The primary case study in Against Method is Galileo's hypothesis that the earth rotates on its axis.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT"Epistemological anarchism" is the central philosophy of Paul Feyerabend's "Against Method". The book's primary thesis is that no definitive 'scientific method' exists and that scientists should not be constrained by a single methodological rule. Instead, Feyerabend advocates for an 'anything goes' approach, allowing scientists the freedom to pursue their research interests unrestrictedly.Feyerabend's main critique is against 'rationalism', the belief that rational rules should guide scientific practices. The book's German title, "Wider den Methodenzwang", translates directly to "Against the Forced Constraint of Method", emphasizing his rejection of imposed methodological rules, rather than the use of methods themselves.The philosopher presents two parallel arguments for his position: a conceptual argument and a historical one. The conceptual argument posits that it's always legitimate to violate established scientific practices with the hope of creating a new form of scientific rationality. The historical argument, on the other hand, provides examples of scientists benefitting from breaking these rules.Despite containing numerous case studies, many are briefly mentioned or consigned to footnotes. The primary case study in "Against Method" is Galileo's hypothesis that the earth rotates on its axis.1 / 1Scholars have disputed the precise meaning of epistemological anarchism. John Preston claims that 'anything goes' signals Feyerabend's abandonment of normative philosophy.[15] In other words, while Feyerabend defended pluralism in his works in the 1950s and 60s, Against Method represents a development in Feyerabend's thought where he abandons pluralism as well as normative theorizing altogether. A more common interpretation is that 'anything goes' does not represent a positive conviction of Feyerabend's but is the conclusion of a reductio ad absurdum. 'Anything goes' is therefore not a methodological prescription but "the terrified exclamation of the rationalist who takes a closer look at history".[16] More recently, it has been argued that epistemological anarchism is a positive methodological proposal but comes in two inconsistent guises.[17] On the one hand, epistemological anarchism means that scientists should be opportunists who adapt their methods to the situation at hand while, on the other hand, anarchism also signifies an unrestricted pluralism and therefore constitutes a radical generalization of his earlier arguments for pluralism.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe precise interpretation of 'epistemological anarchism', as proposed by Paul Feyerabend, has been subject to scholarly debate. John Preston, for instance, argues that Feyerabend's mantra of 'anything goes' signifies his departure from normative philosophy. According to Preston, "Against Method" represents a shift in Feyerabend's thought, where he not only abandons pluralism but also normative theorizing as a whole.A more common interpretation posits that 'anything goes' isn't a firm conviction of Feyerabend's but rather the result of a reductio ad absurdum argument. Under this view, 'anything goes' is not a methodological prescription, but rather a shocked expression of the rationalist when confronted with the realities of history.More recent arguments suggest that 'epistemological anarchism' is a positive methodological proposal that exists in two inconsistent forms. On one hand, it implies that scientists should be opportunistic, adjusting their methods to the situation at hand. On the other, it stands for unrestricted pluralism, signifying a radical expansion of Feyerabend's earlier arguments in favor of pluralism.1 / 1Counterinduction
Edit
Feyerabend contends that for every methodological rule, there is a 'counter rule' â namely, a methodological rule that recommends the opposite of its counter â which also has value.[18] As an example of this general hypothesis, Feyerabend defends 'counterinduction' as the counter rule to inductivism and "induction by falsification"[19] as a valuable methodological rule. Counterinduction involves developing theories that are inconsistent with currently accepted empirical evidence, which is the opposite of the (then) commonly accepted rule that theories should be developed that are consistent with known facts.[20] Feyerabend argues for counterinduction by showing that theories that conflict with known facts are useful for revealing 'natural interpretations' which must be made explicit so that they can be examined.[21] Natural interpretations are interpretations of experience, expressed in language, that follow automatically and unconsciously from describing observations. After a theory has been accepted for a long period of time, it becomes habit to describe events or processes using certain concepts. Because, Feyerabend argues, observation underdetermines the ways we describe what we observe, theories that redescribe experience in new ways force us to make comparisons between old natural interpretations and new ones.[22] This is the first step to evaluating the plausibility of either and so counterinduction aids in providing a thorough critical assessment of our acceptance of particular theories.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTPaul Feyerabend puts forth the idea that every methodological rule has a 'counter rule' â a methodological guideline advocating the opposite action â which also holds value. One key example of this idea is the concept of 'counterinduction', which Feyerabend presents as an alternative to the principle of inductivism and "induction by falsification".Counterinduction, in contrast to the traditional rule that theories should align with known facts, involves developing theories that directly contradict current empirical evidence. Feyerabend defends this approach by arguing that theories which conflict with known facts can be instrumental in unveiling 'natural interpretations'. These interpretations are unconscious, automatic descriptions of experience and observations, expressed in language.Feyerabend asserts that when a theory has been accepted for a long period, it becomes a habit to describe certain events or processes using the concepts of that theory. However, since our observations don't fully determine how we describe what we see, theories that propose new ways of interpreting experience force us to compare these new interpretations with old ones.By this logic, counterinduction facilitates a comprehensive critical assessment of our acceptance of certain theories. It aids in evaluating the plausibility of either the old or new interpretation, thus playing a vital role in the evolution of our understanding.1 / 1and his followers acted "irrationally" from the perspective of inductivism and falsificationism, but that it was reasonable that they did so. This is because Galileo's conjecture was able to reveal the natural interpretations that followed from the Aristotelian worldview.[30] Natural interpretations, defined by Feyerabend, are interpretations of phenomena which happen naturally and automatically in our perception and the ways we attach language to what we observe.[31] After accepting a theory for a long period of time, natural interpretations become implicit and forgotten and, therefore, difficult to test. By contrasting natural interpretations with other interpretations, they are made explicit and can be tested. Therefore, to fully scrutinize the Aristotelian worldview, Feyerabend suggests that Galileo was right to conjecture a new theory that revealed its natural interpretations.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAccording to Paul Feyerabend, Galileo and his followers appeared to act "irrationally" when viewed from the perspectives of inductivism and falsificationism. However, Feyerabend argues that their actions were reasonable because Galileo's hypothesis was able to uncover the 'natural interpretations' inherent in the Aristotelian worldview.Feyerabend defines 'natural interpretations' as automatic and instinctive interpretations of phenomena, which are linked to our perceptions and the language we use to describe our observations. After a theory has been accepted for an extended period, these natural interpretations become ingrained and forgotten, making them difficult to test.By proposing alternative interpretations, these natural interpretations can be made explicit and thus, open to testing. Feyerabend asserts that Galileo was correct in proposing a new theory that opposed the Aristotelian worldview, as it helped reveal and scrutinize its natural interpretations. Thus, Galileo's counterintuitive approach to science, while appearing irrational under conventional scientific methods, played a crucial role in advancing scientific understanding.1 / 1Galileo case study
Edit
The primary case study in Against Method is Galileo's hypothesis that the earth rotates on its axis. According to Feyerabend's reconstruction, Galileo did not justify this hypothesis by reference to known facts nor did he offer an unfalsified conjecture that had more empirical content than its predecessor. Rather, Galileo's hypothesis would rationally have been considered to be false by the existing evidence at the time and it is lower in empirical content than Aristotelian theory of motion. Moreover, Galileo did not provide arguments to justify his contention but instead used propaganda.[23]

According to the existing evidence in the early 17th century, the position that the earth rotates on its axis would have rightly been regarded as false. For example, Galileo's theory of the tides suggested by the motion of the earth was inaccurate and the differences "were big enough to be known even to the most bleary-eyed sailor."[24] In addition, the motion of the earth on its axis leads to the wrong predictions of the relative brightness of Mars and Venus when measured with the naked eye.[25] To correct for these mistakes, Galileo introduces new evidence through his telescope. However, the telescope was not theoretically understood at the time. The best theory of optics was Kepler's, which Galileo didn't understand personally, which says nothing about how light reflects off convex lenses.[26] Moreover, there were well-confirmed reasons to think â as the Aristotelians thought â that light behaves differently outside of the sublunar sphere and so telescopic vision would not have any justification for being veridical. In addition, when Galileo tested the telescope with many observational astronomers in Padua on terrestrial objects, it produced indeterminate and double images, optical illusions about the placement and magnification of celestial bodies, and after images even when tested on terrestrial objects.[27] Because of this, Galileo had no new evidence to support his conjecture that the earth completes a diurnal rotation on its axis and the existing evidence suggested that it was false1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe central case study in Paul Feyerabend's "Against Method" is Galileo's hypothesis that the Earth rotates on its axis. Feyerabend suggests that Galileo didn't substantiate this hypothesis through known facts or by providing an unfalsified conjecture that contained more empirical content than previous theories. Instead, by the evidence available at the time, Galileo's hypothesis could have been reasonably considered false and lacking in empirical content compared to the Aristotelian theory of motion. Feyerabend further suggests that Galileo didn't provide reasoned arguments to support his contention, but rather resorted to propaganda.In the early 17th century, based on available evidence, the theory that the Earth rotates on its axis could be easily dismissed as false. Galileo's theory of tides, implied by Earth's motion, was inaccurate, with discrepancies large enough to be noticeable even to untrained observers. Additionally, Earth's rotation led to incorrect predictions regarding the relative brightness of Mars and Venus when observed with the naked eye.To correct these mistakes, Galileo introduced new evidence through his telescope. However, the telescope was not well-understood theoretically at the time. The most accepted theory of optics was Kepler's, which Galileo didn't fully comprehend, and which didn't explain how light reflected off convex lenses. There were also well-substantiated reasons, held by Aristotelians, to believe that light behaved differently outside the sublunar sphere, and therefore, telescopic vision wouldn't have been justifiably accurate. Furthermore, when Galileo tested the telescope with observational astronomers in Padua on terrestrial objects, it produced ambiguous and double images, optical illusions, and afterimages, even when tested on earthly objects.As a result, Galileo lacked new evidence to support his conjecture that the Earth completes a diurnal rotation on its axis, and the existing evidence suggested that it was false.1 / 1However, Galileo did not present his work in this vein. If he did, Feyerabend conjectures that his new theory would have received little attention and would not have stimulated further inquiry into the Copernican system.[36] Because of this, Galileo uses propaganda to make it seem as if his theories are implicit in the Aristotelian worldview. Specifically, Galileo makes it seem as if his conception of relative motion is embedded in Aristotelian common sense when it isn't (Aristotelian relative motion involves many moving bodies with dynamic effects noticeable in perception).[23] According to Feyerabend, Galileo uses the technique of anamnÄsis where he invites readers to "remember" that they already believed in relation motion in Galileo's sense. Using this method, he disguises how radical of a break his new theory is from then common sense1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTDespite the lack of empirical support for his hypothesis, Galileo did not present his work as a mere conjecture. According to Feyerabend, if Galileo had done so, his novel theory would likely have been largely ignored and would not have spurred further investigation into the Copernican system. Instead, Galileo employed persuasive tactics to make his theories appear compatible with the established Aristotelian worldview.Specifically, Galileo presented his conception of relative motion as if it were rooted in Aristotelian common sense, even though it wasn't. The Aristotelian notion of relative motion involved multiple moving bodies with perceptibly dynamic effects.Feyerabend asserts that Galileo utilized a technique called anamnÄsis, where he encouraged readers to "remember" that they already subscribed to relative motion in Galileo's sense. In doing so, Galileo effectively masked the radical departure his new theory made from the common sense of the time.1 / 1Discovery/justification distinction
Edit
Herbert Feigl criticizes Feyerabend's earlier work, including the paper edition of Against Method, for conflating the distinction between the context of discovery and the context of justification.[37] According to this distinction, formulated by Hans Reichenbach and Karl Popper, there is no logic about how scientists develop scientific theories but there should be a logic of confirming or disconfirming scientific theories. Once this distinction is accepted, then Feyerabend's claim that 'anything goes' would be a truism and would not run against logical empiricism. Feyerabend's response in Against Method is to reject the validity of the discovery/justification distinction. He argues that while the distinction can be maintained abstractly, it does not find a "point of attack" in scientific practice.[38] This is because the two contexts are not separated in different phases of scientific research, but are always comingled. Discounting evidence, for example, is often necessary for discovery is disbarred for the sake of justification. Justifying scientific theories has implications for what research is conducted and, therefore, questions about what is justified also affects the paths open to discovery.

Criticism of Lakatos
Edit
The first edition of Against Method contains a chapter devoted to critically discussing Lakatos' methodological of research programs, although this chapter was removed in subsequent editions. Feyerabend offers several criticisms. Lakatos claims that research programs should be permitted 'breathing space' where research programs are allowed to be pursued regardless of their lack of empirical content, internal inconsistency, or conflicts with experimental results. Feyerabend agrees with this claim[39] but argues that applying it consistently entails that we cannot cease the pursuit of research programs after they have been degenerating (i.e., becoming increasingly ad hoc) (regardless of how long they've been degenerating for).[40] Feyerabend uses the example of Boltzmann's atomism as a theory that was degenerating in the 19th century as a result of the Zermelo-PoincarÃ© recurrence objection and Loschmidtâs reversibility objection but was then vindicated in the early 20th century with Einstein's development of statistical mechanics to illustrate this point. Because of this, Feyerabend claims that although Lakatos insists that he has provided rational rules for the elimination of research programs, these rules are empty because they do not forbid any kind of behavior.[41] Therefore, Lakatos is an 'anarchist in disguise' since it provides methodological rules that do not need to be followed.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTHerbert Feigl criticized Paul Feyerabend's work, including the early editions of "Against Method," for conflating the concepts of discovery and justification. This distinction, as formulated by Hans Reichenbach and Karl Popper, asserts that there is no specific methodology for how scientists develop theories, but there should be a logical process for confirming or rejecting them. If accepted, this distinction would make Feyerabend's claim that 'anything goes' a truism, and not in conflict with logical empiricism. However, Feyerabend rejects this distinction in "Against Method," arguing that, although it can be theoretically maintained, it doesn't find a practical application in scientific practice. He contends that the contexts of discovery and justification are always intertwined, not segregated into separate phases of scientific research. Thus, decisions about what is justified also affect the paths open to discovery.In the first edition of "Against Method," Feyerabend dedicates a chapter to critiquing Imre Lakatos' methodology of research programs, although this chapter was removed in later editions. Lakatos posits that research programs should be allowed a 'breathing space,' meaning they should be pursued despite their lack of empirical content, internal inconsistencies, or conflicts with experimental results. While Feyerabend agrees with this claim, he counters that consistently applying it means that we can't stop pursuing research programs, even if they are degenerating or becoming increasingly ad hoc. To illustrate, he uses the example of Boltzmann's atomism, a theory considered degenerating in the 19th century but vindicated in the early 20th century with Einstein's development of statistical mechanics. As a result, Feyerabend concludes that Lakatos, despite his insistence on providing rational rules for eliminating research programs, is actually an 'anarchist in disguise.' His methodological rules are void because they do not prohibit any kind of behavior.1 / 1Feyerabend provides a second criticism that ends with the same conclusion. According to Lakatos, his theory of scientific rationality only contains heuristics for its implementation rather than direct advise. Because of this, Lakatos' theory on its own provides no advice and the specific advise follows from considerations of concrete research practices.[42] His third criticism concerns Lakatos' argument that theories of rationality should be tested against the value judgments of the 'scientific elite' in specific historical episodes. First, Feyerabend claims that the value judgments of the scientific elite are rarely uniform and so they will not unquely choose a particular theory of scientific rationality.[43] Second, the value judgments of scientific elites are often made on the basis of ignorance. Therefore, there seem to be strong reasons to not accept those value judgments.[44] Third, Lakatos assumes that the standards of the scientific elite are superior to other value judgments (e.g., of witches) and therefore does not provide an argument against relativism.[45] Finally, Feyerabend provides a 'cosmological' criticism of Lakatos' theory of rationality. Lakatos claims that theories of scientific rationality reconstruct the 'internal' growth of knowledge and ignore the 'external' (e.g., sociological, psychological, political) features of scienfic practice. However, without knowledge of the external features of scientific practice, Feyerabend claims that we cannot know whether a theory of scientific rationality will actually succeed in practice.[46]

Scientific education
Edit
Feyerabend provides numerous criticisms of scientific education in his time. He claims that the primary role of education was to stunt individual creativity by forcing them to accept and research on topics that students did not choose for themselves. He also claims that education is responsible for what he calls "intellectual pollution" where "illiterate and incompetent books flood the market, empty verbiage full of strange and esoteric terms claims to express profound insights, 'experts' without brains, without character, and without even a modicum of intellectual, stylistic, emotional temperament tell us about our 'condition' and the means of improving it."[47] He distinguishes between a general education, which is focused on the development of free individuals, and professionalization where one learns the ideology of a specific trade.[48] In a general education, pupils are introduced to many intellectual and cultural traditions which they then engage with critically to make free choices about how they want to live their lives. Professionalization, by contrast, introduces pupils to a single tradition and often involves teaching this tradition as epistemically superior to its rivals. Feyerabend claims that increasing pushes for professionalization were coming at the expense of a general education. Feyerabend criticizes this on ethical grounds, as it reduces students to intellectual slaves, and on the grounds that a general education is more conductive to the development of knowledge.[49]1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTFeyerabend continues his critique of Imre Lakatos with several other points. Lakatos claims his theory of scientific rationality only contains heuristics for its implementation rather than direct advice. Thus, according to Feyerabend, Lakatos' theory on its own offers no guidance and any specific advice derives from considerations of actual research practices. Feyerabend also critiques Lakatos' argument that theories of rationality should be tested against the value judgments of the 'scientific elite' in particular historical contexts. Feyerabend counters that the value judgments of the scientific elite are often diverse and thus won't uniquely select a specific theory of scientific rationality. Moreover, these value judgments are frequently based on ignorance, so there appear to be strong reasons not to accept them. Feyerabend adds that Lakatos assumes the standards of the scientific elite are superior to other value judgments (e.g., of witches) and thus fails to provide an argument against relativism.Feyerabend offers a 'cosmological' criticism as well. Lakatos claims that theories of scientific rationality reconstruct the 'internal' growth of knowledge and dismiss the 'external' aspects of scientific practice, such as sociological, psychological, and political factors. Feyerabend contends that without understanding these external features, we cannot know whether a theory of scientific rationality will actually be successful in practice.Feyerabend also criticizes scientific education in his era. He argues that education primarily stifles individual creativity by compelling students to accept and research topics not of their choosing. He describes a phenomenon of "intellectual pollution" where the market is flooded with illiterate and incompetent books and empty jargon, and "experts" with little competence dictate our 'condition' and the means of improving it. Feyerabend distinguishes between a general education, focused on developing free individuals, and professionalization, where one learns the ideology of a specific trade. A general education introduces students to a variety of intellectual and cultural traditions and encourages critical engagement to make free choices about how they want to live their lives. Professionalization, on the other hand, introduces students to a single tradition, often presented as superior to its rivals. Feyerabend argues that increasing emphasis on professionalization comes at the expense of a general education. He criticizes this trend both on ethical grounds, as it reduces students to intellectual slaves, and on the grounds that a general education is more conducive to the development of knowledge.1 / 1In the immediate reaction to Against Method was largely negative amongst philosophers of science with a few notable exceptions.[50] Most of the commentary focused on Feyerabend's philosophical arguments rather than the Galileo case study. The primary criticisms were that epistemological anarchism is nothing but a repetition of Pyrrhonian skepticism or relativism, that Feyerabend is inconsistent with himself by arguing against method while arguing for methods (like counterinduction), and that he criticizes a strawman.[51] One positive review came from Arne Naess, who had sympathies for epistemological anarchism.[52]

Despite this, Against Method has remained one of the classic texts of 20th century philosophy of science and has been influential on subsequent philosophers of science (especially the Stanford School)1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe initial response to "Against Method" was predominantly negative among philosophers of science, with a few exceptions. Much of the commentary concentrated on Feyerabend's philosophical arguments rather than his case study on Galileo. The main criticisms leveled against Feyerabend's work were that his notion of epistemological anarchism is simply a reiteration of Pyrrhonian skepticism or relativism, that he contradicts himself by advocating against a method while arguing for specific methods (such as counterinduction), and that he is arguing against a strawman. A positive review came from Arne Naess, who had sympathies for epistemological anarchism.Despite this initial reception, "Against Method" has endured as one of the classic texts in 20th-century philosophy of science. It has had a significant impact on subsequent philosophers of science, particularly those of the Stanford School.1 / 1Feyerabend responded to these criticisms in several follow-up publications, many of which he collected in Science in a Free Society. He was extremely frustrated by the quality of the reviews of Against Method, leading him to accuse them of illiteracy and a lack of competence. In his autobiography, he writes that he sometimes wishes that "he had never written that fucking book."[54]This response led to Feyerabend's gradual removal from the academic community which also corresponded to changes of research topics in his work in the 1980s.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTPaul Feyerabend responded to the criticisms of his work in several follow-up publications, many of which were compiled in "Science in a Free Society". He expressed considerable frustration over the quality of the reviews "Against Method" received, accusing them of illiteracy and incompetence. In his autobiography, he expressed regret over writing the book, at one point stating he sometimes wished that "he had never written that fucking book."This combative response contributed to Feyerabend's gradual distancing from the academic community. This also coincided with shifts in his research topics during the 1980s, suggesting that the reception of "Against Method" may have had an impact on the trajectory of his career and the evolution of his philosophical interests.1 / 1Beyond method: The diatribe between Feyerabend and Popper

Abstract 
Karl Popper and Paul Feyerabend have been among the most influential philosophers of science of the twentieth 
century. Extensive studies have been dedicated to the development of their controversial relationship, which saw 
Feyerabend turning from a student and supporter of Popper to one of his harshest critics. Yet, it is not as well 
known that the rift between Popper and Feyerabend generated mainly in the context of their studies on the 
foundation of quantum mechanics, which has been the main subject of their discussions for about two decades. 
This paper reconstructs in detail their diatribe over the foundations of quantum mechanics, emphasizing also the 
major role that their personal relationship played in their distancing. 
1. Introduction 
Both born and raised in Vienna in the aftermath of its intellectual golden age, Karl R. Popper (1902- 
1994) and Paul K. Feyerabend (1924-1994) have gone down in history as two of the most preeminent 
philosophers of science of the twentieth century. While Popper is famous for his solution to the problem 
of induction and demarcation based on falsifiability of scientific theories (see Popper 1934), Feyerabend 
âdespite being a former pupil of Popperâsâ became renowned as one of the harshest and more 
distinguished critics of Popperâs ideas, proposing instead methodological pluralism (called 
epistemological anarchism and later Dadaism; see Feyerabend 1975). 
A vast literature has analyzed the intellectual relationship between these two preeminent philosophers 
of science (see, e.g., Preston 1997, Watkins 2000, Oberheim 2006, Collodel 2016) which led to 
identifying an âearly Feyerabendâ, the staunch Popperian, and a âlate Feyerabendâ, the sworn enemy 
of Popperism (see the comprehensive and excellent work Collodel 2016, and references therein). Yet, 
little attention âand only very recentlyâ has been devoted to the dispute that involved Popper and 
Feyerabend over the foundation of quantum mechanics (FQM). However, as we shall see, FQM was 
the main subject of their interaction and it is in that context that the rift in their relationship developed 
(a first historiographical work in this direction was Del Santo 2019a). In fact, for almost two decades, 
from the early 1950s until the late 1960s, Feyerabend was foremost known as a philosopher of quantum 
physics, mostly building on positions of Popper and eventually turning against him. Despite a few 
earlier incidents, it is only at the end of the 1960s that Feyerabend firmly rejected Popperâs viewpoint 
on quantum theory, fully embracing the Copenhagen interpretation, while dismissing Popperâs criticism 
thereof as âsurprisingly naive and uninformedâ (Feyerabend 1968). This shift in Feyerabendâs 
perspective is of great theoretical and historiographical interest because, as already hinted in (Del Santo 
2019a), and further developed in (Kuby 2018) and (van Strien 2020), it is possible to claim that the 
2 
recognition of the methodological validity of the development of Bohrâs complementarity, on the one 
hand, and of Bohmâs realist alternative interpretation on the other, provided the spark that led to the 
development of his methodological pluralism against Popperâs philosophy of falsificationism. 
However, by analyzing in detail the Popper-Feyerabend correspondence, now published in a 
commented collection (Collodel and Oberheim 2020), it is possible to identify a strong personal 
component of which the impact on the rift between the two should not be underestimated. As we shall 
see, it was hand in hand with their discussions about FQM that this personal development took place, 
and it is the aim of the present paper to reconstruct this side of the story. It should be remarked that the 
nature of the interaction between Popper and Feyerabend transcended that of a standard mentor-pupil 
relationship, reaching the level of a relationship that resembles that of an (authoritarian) father and a 
(rebellious) son. Thus, despite some reasonable explanations for Feyerabendâs distancing from Popperâs 
positions both in the philosophy of quantum theory and on matters of scientific method, this paper will 
show that Feyerabendâs criticisms towards his former mentor stemmed from personal resentment too.11 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this research paper, Flavio Del Santo explores the complex and evolving relationship between two of the most influential philosophers of science of the 20th century, Karl R. Popper and Paul K. Feyerabend. The paper aims to focus specifically on the contentious debates that arose between the two philosophers regarding the foundations of quantum mechanics.Popper and Feyerabend, both born and raised in Vienna, had profound influences on the philosophy of science. Popper is renowned for his solution to the problem of induction and demarcation based on the falsifiability of scientific theories. Feyerabend, initially a student of Popper's, later emerged as one of his most prominent critics, promoting methodological pluralism (also referred to as epistemological anarchism and later Dadaism).The intellectual relationship between Popper and Feyerabend has been extensively studied, with some scholars distinguishing between an "early Feyerabend," who supported Popper's ideas, and a "late Feyerabend," who was adamantly opposed to Popper's views.Del Santo asserts that the primary focus of their interaction was on the foundation of quantum mechanics (FQM), and it was in this context that the rift between them developed. The transition in Feyerabend's perspective - from supporting Popper's view on quantum theory to fully embracing the Copenhagen interpretation and dismissing Popper's criticism of it - played a significant role in the development of Feyerabend's methodological pluralism against Popper's falsificationism.Del Santo also highlights the significant personal component in their relationship. He claims that the nature of the interaction between Popper and Feyerabend went beyond a typical mentor-student dynamic, resembling more of an authoritarian father and a rebellious son. Therefore, the research argues that Feyerabend's criticisms of Popper weren't just rooted in philosophical disagreements but also stemmed from personal resentment.1 / 1returning in a roundabout manner to the ideas I had originally gotten from 
you, but without knowing any longer that this was the case (this, I think, is 
what happened in the case of my short note on the Neumann proof).â 
(Feyerabend to Popper 27.12.1965 N. 4; in Collodel and Oberheim 2020) 
Finally, coming back to the harsh criticism of (Popper 1967), Feyerabend confessed to John W. Watkins 
âanother prominent exponent of the Popperian schoolâ that behind his paper there were not only 
scientific reasons but personal resentment too: 
one of the reasons why I was mad at Popper was that his paper [(Popper, 
1967)] did not pay any attention to my criticism of 1962 [(Feyerabend 1962)]. 
Maybe he had not read my paper (which I sent him); maybe he did not like 
it.â (Feyerabend to Watkins on 17.12.1967, quoted in Collodel 2016). 
The relationship between Popper and Feyerabend was at that point irremediably undermined. Popper 
did not even read Feyerabend papers against his views on FQM (Feyerabend 1968; Feyerabend 1969). 
In answering to LandÃ©âs request for a rebuttal (see section 2), Popper showed with a certain resignation 
that he had given up fighting with Feyerabend: 
I heard about it. I do not want to read it because why should I get angry? 
(Feyerabend is of course one of my former students for whom I did more than 
any teacher can be expected to do and has behaved to me in return simply 
disgustingly.) I should be most grateful for your defense if you would defend 
me. [â¦] I do not wish to defend myself because this would mean reading this 
silly stuff. (Popper to LandÃ©; published in Del Santo 2019a) 
He also replied to Margenau, offering an explanation for Feyerabendâs ingratitude, which leaves us with 
a somewhat sour taste, for the end of a relationship that, through thick or thin, has changed the concep- 
tion of philosophy of science in the last century: 
Feyerabend was once a student of mine, and I treated him extremely well. He 
never got over it: there are people who can never forget a benefit received, 
and other who cannot forgive it. Moreover, Feyerabend has no original ideas, 
but he poses as an original thinker: he is a compulsive plagiarist. He has stolen 
many of my ideas and although sometimes admitted this, he continues to crit- 
icise me, using my own ideas in his criticisms (emphasis are mine; Popper to 
Margenau on 21.02.1969; published in Del Santo 2019a) . 
4. Conclusions 
John Preston has commented that âthere is something obsessive about the way in which Popper became 
Feyerabend's favourite whipping-postâ (Preston 1997). In this paper, I have reconstructed how the rift 
between Popper and Feyerabend came about, for what concerns the main topic of their discussions for 
17 
about two decades: the foundations of quantum mechanics. I have also shown that the personal compo- 
nent of a peculiarly strong relationship between them played a substantial role in this process. Indeed, 
indulging in some amateur psychology, it seems that Feyerabend âwhich was treated by Popper as his 
(academic) âsonââ âdisliked Popperâs growing tendency to preach authoritativelyâ (Oberheim 2006; 
taken from Collodel 2016) and deeply suffered from his âunwanted indebtedness to Popperâ (Watkins 
2000). This led him to assume more and more the role of a rebellious âsonâ, and when the time was 
ripe he entered his (academic) âadolescenceâ, in which he violently rejected his âfatherâsâ idea(l)s at 
any cost. 
Perhaps philosophy of science would have lost something without such a conflict.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this part of the paper, Del Santo suggests that personal resentments played a significant role in the deteriorating relationship between Popper and Feyerabend. Despite having learned a great deal from Popper early in his career, Feyerabend felt a sense of resentment towards his mentor, which became apparent when Popper failed to acknowledge or respond to Feyerabend's criticisms of his work. Feyerabend even confessed to John W. Watkins, a prominent member of the Popperian school, that personal resentment played a part in his harsh critique of Popper's work.Feyerabend felt deeply slighted that Popper didn't seem to pay attention to or read his work, and this feeling of being disregarded compounded his resentment. This led to an irreversible breakdown in their relationship, with Popper choosing not to engage with Feyerabend's work, viewing it as "silly stuff."Popper's response to another contemporary, LandÃ©, gives us a glimpse into his own perspective on the matter. Popper saw Feyerabend's criticism and ingratitude as a personal affront, especially given that he had done more for Feyerabend than what he believed a teacher could be expected to do.Popper was disappointed, claiming that Feyerabend was "compulsive plagiarist" who had stolen many of his ideas. He suggested that Feyerabend's criticisms were steeped in hypocrisy, as they often involved using Popper's own ideas.Del Santo argues that the personal dynamics between Popper and Feyerabend significantly shaped their philosophical disagreements. Feyerabend, who was treated as an academic "son" by Popper, felt stifled by Popper's authoritative tendencies and his perceived indebtedness to him. As Feyerabend matured in his academic career, he rebelled against his mentor, vehemently rejecting Popper's ideas.The author concludes by suggesting that the philosophical realm may have been poorer without such a conflict, indicating that the strife between Popper and Feyerabend may have ultimately contributed to the growth and diversity of ideas in the philosophy of science.1 / 1Do you think that the invention of decentralized packet switching networks like the internet and peer to peer, and distributed microservice architecture, and using like to learn grammar emergently are vindictions of Feyerabend's original thesis?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTFeyerabend's philosophy, notably his concept of "epistemological anarchism" as expressed in his work "Against Method", is an argument against methodological monism and for methodological pluralism in scientific inquiry. His central idea is that there are no over-arching, universally applicable rules or methods that govern all scientific progress or knowledge generation, and that the adherence to any such purported rules can in fact stifle scientific creativity and progress.When we consider the development of decentralized technologies like packet-switching networks (such as the internet), peer-to-peer systems, and distributed microservice architectures, we can see a certain resonance with Feyerabend's philosophy. These technologies embody a sort of "anarchy" in their operation: there is no single, central authority that governs the flow of data or services, but rather a network of peers, each with equivalent authority and autonomy, working together to achieve the overall functionality.In the same vein, machine learning algorithms, like those used for grammar emergence, work by learning from vast amounts of data without the imposition of rigid, pre-specified rules or structures. They adapt based on the data they are fed, creating their own 'rules' in a manner analogous to Feyerabend's idea of methodological anarchism, where rules emerge from practice rather than being imposed on it.However, it is essential to note that these are not direct vindications of Feyerabend's philosophy. While they resonate with certain aspects of his arguments, they are not outcomes of his philosophical position. It's important to remember that Feyerabend's work is directed at the philosophy of science, which is a distinct field from technology development or AI research. While these fields can and often do inform each other, the philosophical underpinnings of scientific inquiry don't map directly onto the development and use of technologies or AI algorithms.Moreover, while these technologies may embody certain anarchic principles in their design, their development and refinement often involve methodical, systematic, and even rigid processes that may seem at odds with Feyerabend's celebration of 'anarchy'.So, while we can draw intriguing parallels between Feyerabend's ideas and the operation of these technologies, we should be cautious about claiming them as vindications of his philosophy.1 / 1Well I think maybe his definition of anarchy might be different. I mean because people were hostile to his ideas. The fact that his ideas are taught in universities is a bit of a vindication, but these new technologies do lend some support to his thesis of epistemological anarchism, which was that scientific achievements need to be analyzed in their historical context, and recognized the high level of contingency in scientific progress.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYou're absolutely right, and I appreciate the nuance you're bringing into the discussion. Feyerabend's "epistemological anarchism" wasn't a call for a chaotic free-for-all, but rather a plea for an open, flexible, and context-sensitive approach to scientific inquiry. In his view, dogmatic adherence to a set of universal methodological rules could inhibit scientific creativity and progress, a perspective that becomes even more relevant when considered in light of the innovative and dynamic nature of technological advances.Indeed, the rise of decentralized technologies and the importance of context in machine learning can be seen as aligning with Feyerabend's thesis. Technologies like the Internet, peer-to-peer networks, and distributed systems epitomize a decentralized approach to problem-solving and knowledge creation, which aligns well with Feyerabend's advocacy for a multiplicity of methods and perspectives in scientific inquiry.Similarly, the importance of historical context and contingency in machine learning -- where the outcome of the learning process is highly dependent on the specific training data used, and where different datasets can lead to radically different outcomes -- resonates with Feyerabend's emphasis on the historical and contextual nature of scientific achievements.The fact that these principles have become more widely recognized and adopted, in both the academic and technological worlds, can indeed be seen as a vindication of Feyerabend's ideas. However, it's important to note that these are parallels and resonances rather than direct causal connections: while Feyerabend's philosophy may align with these developments, it didn't necessarily lead to them. Nonetheless, these developments do provide intriguing real-world illustrations of the kind of flexible, context-sensitive approach to knowledge creation that Feyerabend advocated.1 / 1A list of all of the topics we've discussed.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTSure, here's a summary of the key topics we've discussed:Paul Feyerabend's philosophy and his book "Against Method": We discussed Feyerabend's ideas of epistemological anarchism, as well as the reactions of the academic community towards his work and his responses to criticisms.The relationship between Feyerabend and Karl Popper: We touched on the complex dynamics between Feyerabend and Popper, two significant philosophers of science. This included their discussions around the foundation of quantum mechanics and how it influenced their professional relationship.Flavio Del Santo's research: We reviewed an abstract from a paper by Flavio Del Santo which provides a deep analysis of the relationship between Popper and Feyerabend and its influence on the philosophy of science.The relevance of Feyerabend's philosophy in modern technology: We discussed how decentralized technologies like the Internet, peer-to-peer networks, and machine learning technologies resonate with Feyerabend's philosophy of science.Each of these topics provided a rich and insightful discussion about Feyerabend's philosophy of science, its reception and influence, and its possible implications in the context of contemporary technology.1 / 1A final summary.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn our discussion, we delved deep into the philosophy of science, focusing on the theories of Paul Feyerabend and his famous book, "Against Method." Feyerabend, a controversial figure in the field of philosophy of science, proposed the idea of "epistemological anarchism," suggesting there should be no overarching methodology governing scientific progress. Despite initial resistance from the academic community, his work has remained influential.We discussed Feyerabend's complex relationship with another preeminent philosopher of science, Karl Popper. The pair initially had a mentor-student relationship, with Feyerabend initially being an ardent Popperian. However, as their philosophies evolved, Feyerabend became one of Popper's most prominent critics. Their disagreements, notably around the foundation of quantum mechanics, further exacerbated their rift.Research by Flavio Del Santo revealed the depth of their diatribe and personal feelings that intertwined with their professional disagreements, hinting at how personal dynamics can influence academic discourse.Lastly, we explored the possible relevance of Feyerabend's philosophy to modern technology. It was posited that the decentralized nature of technologies such as the Internet, peer-to-peer networks, and machine learning technologies reflect Feyerabend's anarchistic view of knowledge and progress. These modern phenomena might indeed be seen as vindications of Feyerabend's original thesis, suggesting the multifaceted, unpredictable, and anarchistic nature of progress and knowledge accumulation.Overall, the discussion was an enriching exploration of the philosophy of science, its personal and academic dynamics, and its potential implications for understanding our rapidly evolving technological landscape.1 / 1ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.
