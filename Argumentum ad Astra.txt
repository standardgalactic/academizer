ABSTRACT
Diffusion or flow-based models are powerful generative paradigms that are no-
toriously hard to sample as samples are defined as solutions to high-dimensional
Ordinary or Stochastic Differential Equations (ODEs/SDEs) which require a large
Number of Function Evaluations (NFE) to approximate well. Existing methods
to alleviate the costly sampling process include model distillation and designing
dedicated ODE solvers. However, distillation is costly to train and sometimes can
deteriorate quality, while dedicated solvers still require relatively large NFE to
produce high quality samples. In this paper we introduce "Bespoke solvers
a novel framework for constructing custom ODE solvers tailored to the ODE
of a given pre-trained flow model. Our approach optimizes an order cons��stent
and parameter-efficient solver (e.g., with 80 learnable parameters), is trained for
roughly 1% of the GPU time required for training the pre-trained model, and sig-
nificantly improves approximation and generation quality compared to dedicated
solvers. For example, a Bespoke solver for a CIFAR10 model produces samples
with Fr��chet Inception Distance (FID) of 2.73 with 10 NFE, and gets to 1% of
the Ground Truth (GT) FID (2.59) for this model with only 20 NFE. On the more
challenging ImageNet-64x64, Bespoke samples at 2.2 FID with 10 NFE, and gets
within 2% of GT FID (1.71) with 20 NFE.

This paper introduces "Bespoke solvers," a new method for creating custom ODE solvers that are specifically tailored to pre-trained flow models used in generating images. Traditional methods, such as model distillation and existing ODE solvers, either require extensive resources or still need a large number of function evaluations (NFE) to produce high-quality samples. The Bespoke solvers are both order-consistent and parameter-efficient, requiring significantly less GPU time to train compared to the pre-trained model itself. The results show remarkable improvements in the quality of generated samples with fewer NFEs. For instance, on CIFAR10, the Bespoke solver achieves an FID of 2.73 with just 10 NFEs and comes close to the ground truth FID with only 20 NFEs. Similarly, for ImageNet 64x64, the Bespoke solver reaches an FID of 2.2 with 10 NFEs and is within 2% of the ground truth FID with 20 NFEs.
TeacherLM: Teaching to Fish Rather Than Giving the Fish, Language Modeling Likewise

ChatGPT
The paper mentioned outlines a novel approach where a "Teacher Language Model" (TeacherLM) is trained to generate supplemental information such as chain-of-thought reasoning, potential misconceptions, etc., which is then incorporated into a dataset. This enriched dataset is used to train a "Student Model," with the aim of providing the student model with a more robust understanding and the ability to generate more informed and accurate responses. Essentially, the TeacherLM serves to enhance the learning materials that form the basis of the Student Model's education, rather than simply providing direct answers, embodying the principle of "teaching to fish" in the context of language modeling.
Abstract 
Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impres- 
sive reasoning and data augmentation capabilities 
in various NLP tasks. However, what about small 
models? In this work, we propose TeacherLM- 
7.1B, capable of annotating relevant fundamen- 
tals, chain of thought, and common mistakes 
for most NLP samples, which makes annotation 
more than just an answer, thus allowing other 
models to learn ���why��� instead of just ���what���. 
The TeacherLM-7.1B model achieved a zero-shot 
score of 52.3 on MMLU, surpassing most models 
with over 100B parameters. Even more remark- 
able is its data augmentation ability. Based on 
TeacherLM-7.1B, we augmented 58 NLP datasets 
and taught various student models with differ- 
ent parameters from OPT and BLOOM series 
in a multi-task setting. The experimental results 
indicate that the data augmentation provided by 
TeacherLM has brought signif i cant benef i ts. We 
will release the TeacherLM series of models and 
augmented datasets as open-source. 
1. Introduction 
Large Language Models have recently revolutionized the 
NLP landscape (Brown et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021; Chowd- 
hery et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Zeng et al., 2022; 
Black et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022a; Taylor et al., 2022).

ple input-output formats, inconsistent with the data seen dur- 
ing the pre-training of language models. As a result, directly 
i netuning such data is insuff i cient for the model to fully 
understand the comprehensive content of samples, inducing 
diff i culty in fully utilizing its learning capabilities. Thus, 
two leading data augmentation strategies have emerged to 
address this issue, including task-level and instance-level 
approaches. 
In task-level data augmentation, the aim is to map any natu- 
ral language task into multiple human-readable prompted 
forms with diverse wording (Wei et al., 2021; Bach et al., 
2022; Wang et al., 2022b). Furthermore, combining task- 
level augmentation with multi-task training leads to a more 
comprehensive ability. Finetuning a pre-trained model on 
this multi-task mixture covering various tasks (Sanh et al., 
2021; Chung et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2022; Iyer 
et al., 2022) induces the language model a more substantial 
zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. 
Though task-level augmentation has pushed the language 
model���s generalizability to a new height, each sample repre- 
sents an individual entity, limiting the augmentation, which 
treats the entire dataset using a unif i ed data augmentation 
method. Hence a more effective approach is to augment 
each sample individually based on its unique characteristics, 
with a new stage l ourishing in instance-level data augmenta- 
tion. For this approach, retrieval-based pre-trained language 
models (Borgeaud et al., 2021; Izacard et al., 2022) utilize 
small models in conjunction with a massive database to 
introduce more relevant knowledge for each sample. Mean- 
while, LLMs can use their solid zero-shot ability to augment 
each sample based on different prompts (Wang et al., 2021; 
Ho et al., 2022). Nevertheless, these two methods bring 
huge usage costs, and some of the current best-performing 
models are not open-source. 
Inordertoreducethecostofdataaugmentation, inthiswork, 
we propose to open-source a series of small TeacherLM 
models, which rival human annotation and LLMs. As an 
adage goes, ���It is better to teach someone how to i sh than 
to give them the i sh,��� which also applies to language mod- 
els. To achieve this purpose, our approach has two primary

The abstract describes a new approach in natural language processing (NLP) using a model called TeacherLM-7.1B. This model is designed to enhance small models by providing annotations that explain the reasoning behind answers, thus teaching the "why" in addition to the "what." TeacherLM-7.1B shows impressive zero-shot performance, scoring 52.3 on the MMLU benchmark, which is competitive with much larger models. It also excels in data augmentation, having been used to augment 58 NLP datasets. These augmented datasets are then used to train various student models from the OPT and BLOOM series in a multi-task setting, leading to significant improvements. The TeacherLM series and the augmented datasets will be released as open-source, providing a new tool for more effective data utilization in NLP by focusing on instance-level data augmentation that imparts comprehensive understanding and enhances language models' learning capabilities.
ASPEST: BRIDGINGTHEGAPBETWEENACTIVE 
LEARNING ANDSELECTIVEPREDICTION 
Anonymous authors 
Paper under double-blind review ABSTRACT 
Selective prediction aims to learn a reliable model that abstains from making pre- 
dictions when uncertain. These predictions can then be deferred to a humans for 
further evaluation. As an everlasting challenge for machine learning, in many real- 
world scenarios, the distribution of test data is different from the training data. 
This results in more inaccurate predictions, and often increased dependence on 
humans, which can be diff i cult and expensive. Active learning aims to lower the 
overall labeling effort, and hence human dependence, by querying the most infor- 
mative examples. Selective prediction and active learning have been approached 
from different angles, with the connection between them missing. In this work, 
we introduce a new learning paradigm, active selective prediction, which aims to 
query more informative samples from the shifted target domain while increasing 
accuracy and coverage. For this new paradigm, we propose a simple yet effective 
approach, ASPEST, that utilizes ensembles of model snapshots with self-training 
with their aggregated outputs as pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on numer- 
ous image, text and structured datasets, which suffer from domain shifts, demon- 
strate that ASPEST can signif i cantly outperform prior work on selective predic- 
tion and active learning (e.g. on the MNIST���SVHN benchmark with the labeling 
budget of 100, ASPEST improves the AUACC metric from 79.36% to 88.84%) 
and achieves more optimal utilization of humans in the loop.

Figure 1: Illustration of active selective predic- 
tion, where active learning is used to improve se- 
lective prediction under distribution shift. In this 
setting, active learning selects a small subset of 
data for labeling which are used to improve se- 
lective prediction on the remaining unlabeled test 
data. This yields more reliable predictions and 
more optimized use of humans in the loop. 
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown no- 
table success in many applications that require 
complex understanding of input data (He et al., 
2016a; Devlin et al., 2018; Hannun et al., 2014), 
including the ones that involve high-stakes deci- 
sion making (Yang, 2020). For safe deployment 
of DNNs in high-stakes applications, it is typi- 
cally required to allow them to abstain from their 
predictions that are likely to be wrong, and ask 
humans for assistance (a task known as selec- 
tive prediction) (El-Yaniv et al., 2010; Geifman 
& El-Yaniv, 2017). Although selective predic- 
tion can render the predictions more reliable, it 
does so at the cost of human interventions. For 
example, if a model achieves 80% accuracy on 
the test data, an ideal selective prediction algo-

Distribution shift can signif i cantly exacerbate 
the need for such human intervention. The suc- 
cess of DNNs often relies on the assumption that 
both training and test data are sampled indepen- 
dently and identically from the same distribu- 
tion. In practice, this assumption may not hold 1

Table 1: Comparing different machine learning paradigms. With distribution shift and a small la- 
beling budget, active learning can achieve 100% coverage (predictions on all test data), but it fails 
to achieve the target accuracy. Selective prediction can achieve the target accuracy, but the coverage 
is low, which results in signif i cant human intervention. Active selective prediction achieves the tar-

and can degrade the performance on the test domain (Barbu et al., 2019; Koh et al., 2021). For 
example, for satellite imaging applications, images taken in different years can vary drastically due 
to weather, light, and climate conditions (Koh et al., 2021). Existing selective prediction methods 
usually rely on model conf i dence to reject inputs (Geifman & El-Yaniv, 2017). However, it has been 
observed that model conf i dence can be poorly calibrated, especially with distribution shifts (Ovadia 
et al., 2019). The selective classif i er might end up accepting many mis-classif i ed test inputs, mak- 
ing the predictions unreliable. Thus, selective prediction might yield an accuracy below the desired 
target performance, or obtain a low coverage, necessitating signif i cant human intervention. 
To improve the performance of selective prediction, one idea is to rely on active learning and to 
have humans label a small subset of selected test data. The correct labels provided by humans can 
then be used to improve the accuracy and coverage (see Sec. 3.2) of selective prediction on the 
remaining unlabeled test data, thus reducing the need for subsequent human labeling efforts. In 
separate forms, selective prediction (Geifman & El-Yaniv, 2017; 2019) and active learning (Settles, 
2009) have been studied extensively, however, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is i rst to 
propose performing active learning to improve selective prediction jointly, with the focus on the 
major real-world challenge of distribution shifts. Active domain adaptation (Su et al., 2020; Fu et al., 
2021; Prabhu et al., 2021) is one area close to this setting, however, it does not consider selective 
prediction. In selective prediction, not only does a classif i er need to be learned, but a selection 
scoring function also needs to be constructed for rejecting misclassif i ed inputs. Thus, going beyond 
conventional active learning methods that focus on selecting examples for labeling to improve the 
accuracy, we propose to also use those selected labeled examples to improve the selection scoring 
function. The optimal acquisition function (used to select examples for labeling) for this new setting 
is different compared to those in traditional active learning ��� e.g. if a conf i dence-based selection 
scoring function is employed, the selected labeled samples should have the goal of improving the estimation of that conf i dence score.

In this paper, we introduce a new machine learning paradigm: active selective prediction under 
distribution shift (see Fig. 1), which combines selective prediction and active learning to improve 
accuracy and coverage, and hence use human labeling in a more eff i cient way. Table 1 shows 
the differences among selective prediction, active learning and active selective prediction. Active 
selective prediction is highly important for most real-world deployment scenarios (e.g., the batch 
prediction scenario where users give a batch of test inputs potentially with distribution shifts, and 
request predictions from a deployed pre-trained model). To the best of our knowledge, we are the 
i rst to formulate and investigate this problem, along with the judiciously chosen evaluation metrics 
for it (Sec. 3). We also introduce a novel and simple yet effective method, ASPEST, for this active 
selective prediction problem (Sec. 4). The key components of ASPEST, checkpoint ensembling and 
self-training, are designed to address the key challenge (i.e., the overconf i dence issue) in the active 
selective prediction problem. On numerous real-world datasets, we show that ASPEST consistently 
outperforms other baselines proposed for active learning and selective prediction (Sec. 5).

Selective prediction (also known as prediction with rejection/deferral options) constitutes a common 
deployment scenario for DNNs, especially in high-stakes decision making scenarios. In selective 
prediction, models abstain from yielding outputs if their conf i dence on the likelihood of correctness 
is not suff i ciently high. Such abstinence usually incurs deferrals to humans and results in additional 
cost (Mozannar & Sontag, 2020). Increasing the coverage ��� the ratio of the samples for which 
2

the DNN outputs can be reliable ��� is the fundamental goal (El-Yaniv et al., 2010; Fumera & Roli, 
2002; Hellman, 1970; Geifman & El-Yaniv, 2019). (Geifman & El-Yaniv, 2017) considers selec- 
tive prediction for DNNs with the ���Softmax Response��� method, which applies a carefully selected 
threshold on the maximal response of the softmax layer to construct the selective classif i er. (Lak- 
shminarayanan et al., 2017) shows that using deep ensembles can improve predictive uncertainty 
estimates and thus improve selective prediction. (Rabanser et al., 2022) proposes a novel method, 
NNTD, for selective prediction that utilizes DNN training dynamics by using checkpoints during 
training. Our proposed method ASPEST also uses checkpoints to construct ensembles for selective 
prediction. In contrast to NNTD and other aforementioned methods, we combine selective predic- 
tion with active learning to improve its data eff i ciency while considering a holistic perspective of 
having humans in the loop. This new active selective prediction setup warrants new methods for 
selective prediction along with active learning. 
Active learning employs acquisition functions to select unlabeled examples for labeling, and uses 
these labeled examples to train models to utilize the human labeling budget more effectively while 
training DNNs (Settles, 2009; Dasgupta, 2011). Commonly-used active learning methods employ 
acquisition functions by considering uncertainty (Gal et al., 2017; Ducoffe & Precioso, 2018; Beluch 
et al., 2018) or diversity (Sener & Savarese, 2017; Sinha et al., 2019), or their combination (Ash 
et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2010). One core challenge for active learning is the ���cold start��� problem: 
often the improved obtained from active learning is less signif i cant when the amount of labeled data 
is signif i cantly smaller (Yuan et al., 2020; Hacohen et al., 2022). Moreover, active learning can be 
particularly challenging under distribution shift (Kirsch et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2021). Recently, 
active domain adaptation has been studied, where domain adaptation is combined with active learn- 
ing (Su et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2021; Prabhu et al., 2021). Different from traditional active learning, 
active domain adaptation typically adapts a model pre-trained on the labeled source domain to the 
unlabeled target domain. In our work, we also try to adapt a source trained model to the unlabeled 
target test set using active learning, while focusing on building a selective classif i cation model and 
reducing the human labeling effort. More related work are discussed in Appendix B.

g. In contrast to conventional active learning, which only aims to improve the accuracy of f, active 
selective prediction also aims to improve g so that it can accept those examples where f predicts 
correctly and reject those where f predicts incorrectly. Especially with distribution shift and a small 
labeling budget M, it can be challenging to train f for high accuracy. Therefore, g is critical in 
achieving high coverage and accuracy of fs, for which we consider the conf i dence of f (i.e., the 
maximum softmax score of f) and train f such that its conf i dence can be used to distinguish cor- 
rect and incorrect predictions. This might not be achieved easily since it has been observed that f 
can have overconf i dent predictions especially under distribution shift (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Hein 
et al., 2019). Besides, for active learning, typically we select samples for labeling based on uncer- 
tainty or diversity. However, in active selective prediction, sample selection based on uncertainty 
may lead to overconf i dence and sample selection based on diversity may lead to low accuracy of 
f, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Our experiments in Appendix G.2 show that these issues indeed exist ��� 
the methods based on uncertainty sampling (e.g., SR+Margin) achieve relatively high accuracy, but 
suffer from the overconf i dence issue, while the methods based on diversity sampling (e.g. SR+kCG) 
don���t have the overconf i dence issue, but suffer from low accuracy of f. Moreover, the hybrid meth- 
ods based on uncertainty and diversity sampling (SR+CLUE and SR+BADGE) still suffer from the 
overconf i dence issue. To tackle these, we propose a novel method, ASPEST, described next. 
4PROPOSEDMETHOD: ASPEST 
We propose a novel method Active Selective Prediction using Ensembles and Self-training (AS- 
PEST), which utilizes two key techniques, checkpoint ensembles and self-training, to solve the 
active selective prediction problem. The key constituents, checkpoint ensembles and self-training, 
are designed to tackle the fundamental challenges in active selective prediction, with the ideas of 
selecting samples for labeling based on uncertainty to achieve high accuracy and using checkpoint 
ensembles and self-training to alleviate overconf i dence. We empirically analyze why they can tackle 
the challenges in Section 5.3. In Appendix E, we analyze the complexity of the ASPEST algorithm. 
We i rst describe how the weights from the intermediate checkpoints during training are used to 
construct the checkpoint ensemble. Since we have all the test inputs, we don���t need to save the 
checkpoints during training, but just record their outputs on the test set UX. Specif i cally, we use a 
n �� K matrix P (recall that n = |UX| and K is the number of classes) to record the average of 
the softmax outputs of the checkpoint ensemble and use Neto record the number of checkpoints in 
the current checkpoint ensemble. During training, we get a stream of checkpoints (assuming no two 
5 
Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 
checkpoints arrive at the same time), and for each incoming checkpoint f, we update P and Neas: 
Pi,k��� 
1 
Ne+ 1(Pi,k �� Ne+ f(xi| k))for 1 ��� i ��� n and 1 ��� k ��� K,Ne��� Ne+ 1.(6) 
Since it has been observed that an ensemble of DNNs (known as ���deep ensembles���) usually pro- 
duces a conf i dence score that is better calibrated compared to a single DNN (Lakshminarayanan 
et al., 2017), we consider f to be in the form of deep ensembles and g to be the conf i dence of the 
ensemble. Specif i cally, we continue i ne-tuning N models independently via Stochastic Gradient 
Descent (SGD) with different random seeds (e.g., the randomness can come from different random 
orders of training batches). At the beginning, we set each model fj 
0 = �� 
f (j = 1,...,N), and set 
Ne= 0 and P = 0n��K. Here, we initialize each model fj 
0 with the source-trained classif i er �� 
f in- 
stead of random initialization, to minimize the computational cost. We i ne-tune each model fj 
0 on 
Dtrfor nssteps via SGD using the following training objective: min��jE(x,y)���Dtr���CE(x,y;��j), 
where ���CEis the cross-entropy loss and ��jis the model parameters of fj 0. For every cssteps when 
training each fj 0, we update P and Neusing Eq (6) with the checkpoint model f 
j 0. 
After constructing the initial checkpoint ensemble, we perform a T-round active learning process. 
In each round of active learning, we i rst select samples for labeling based on the margin of the 
checkpoint ensemble, then i ne-tune the models on the selected labeled test data, and i nally perform 
self-training. We describe the procedure below: 
Sample selection. In the t-th round, we select a batch Btwith a size of m = [M 
T ] from UXvia: 
Bt= argmax 
B���UX\(���t���1 
l=0Bl),|B|=m ��� X 
xi���B 
S(xi)(7) 
where B0= ���, S(xi) 
= Pi,�� y��� maxk���Y\{�� y}Pi,kand �� y = argmaxk���YPi,k. We use an oracle 
to assign ground-truth labels to the examples in Btto get �� 
Bt. Here, we select the test samples 
for labeling based on the margin of the checkpoint ensemble. The test samples with lower margin 
should be closer to the decision boundary and they are data points where the ensemble is uncertain 
about its predictions. Training on those data points can either make the predictions of the ensemble 
more accurate or make the ensemble have higher conf i dence on its correct predictions. 
Fine-tuning.After the sample selection, we reset Neand P as Ne= 0 and P = 0n��K, because 
we want to remove those checkpoints in the previous rounds with a worse performance from the 
checkpoint ensemble (experiments in Appendix G.9 show that after each round of active learning, 
the accuracy of the ensemble will signif i cantly improve). We then i ne-tune each model fj t���1(j = 
1,...,N) independently via SGD with different randomness on the selected labeled test data to get 
fj 
t using the following training objective: 
min 
��j E(x,y)������t

Bl ���CE(x,y;��j) + �� �� E(x,y)���Dtr���CE(x,y;��j),(8) 
where ��jis the model parameters of fj

and �� is a hyper-parameter. Note that here we use joint 
training on Dtrand ���t 
l=1 �� 
Blto avoid over-f i tting to the small set of labeled test data and prevent the 
models from forgetting the source training knowledge (see the results in Appendix G.5 for the effect 
of using joint training and the effect of ��). For every ceepoch when i ne-tuning each model fj t���1, 
we update P and Neusing Eq. (6) with the checkpoint model fj t���1. 
Self-training. After i ne-tuning the models on the selected labeled test data and with the checkpoint 
ensemble, we construct a pseudo-labeled set R via: 
R = {(xi,[Pi,1,������ ,Pi,K]) | xi��� UX��� (�� ��� max 
k���Y Pi,k< 1)},(9) 
where maxk���YPi,kis the conf i dence of the checkpoint ensemble on xiand �� is a threshold (refer 
to Section 5.2 for the effect of ��). We do not add those test data points with conf i dence equal to 1 
into the pseudo-labeled set because training on those data points cannot change the models much 
and may even hurt the performance (refer to Appendix G.8 for the justif i cation of such a design). 
We then perform self-training on the pseudo-labeled set R. For computational eff i ciency, we only 
apply self-training on a subset of R. We construct the subset Rsubby randomly sampling up to

The ASPEST method described here seeks to address the challenges associated with active selective prediction, particularly when dealing with overconfidence in model predictions and the accuracy of the function
f
under conditions of distribution shift. The approach incorporates checkpoint ensembles and self-training as two primary techniques to manage these challenges.
Checkpoint ensembles make use of intermediate models (checkpoints) produced during training. By averaging their predictions, they aim to create a more calibrated and less overconfident aggregated model. The intuition is that deep ensembles, which are a combination of differently trained versions of the same model, tend to produce more reliable uncertainty estimates.
Self-training involves using the model's own predictions to generate additional training signals. By selecting samples with high confidence predictions that are below a certain threshold (to avoid complete certainty which is often a sign of overfitting or overconfidence), the model can reinforce its learning and potentially improve on the areas where it is already somewhat confident.
ASPEST iterates through rounds of active learning, where each round consists of selecting a batch of test examples to be labeled based on the margin of the checkpoint ensemble (those with lower margin are selected for labeling as they are close to the decision boundary), fine-tuning the models on this new labeled data, and then applying self-training using pseudo-labeled data generated from the ensemble's predictions.
The process is computationally efficient by design, as it resets the checkpoint ensemble with each round to incorporate only the latest and more accurate models, and it applies self-training selectively to avoid excessive computation. The method also includes joint training on both newly labeled data and original training data to prevent catastrophic forgetting and overfitting to the newly labeled examples.
The described method seems particularly suited for situations where labeled data is scarce, but the need for a reliable model is critical, such as in critical decision-making systems where each prediction needs to be as accurate as possible and overconfidence in wrong predictions can be very costly.

We use the KL-Divergence loss with soft pseudo-labels to alleviate the overconf i dence issue since 
the predicted labels might be wrong and training the models on those misclassif i ed pseudo-labeled 
data using the typical cross entropy loss will cause the overconf i dence issue, which hurts selective 
prediction performance. For every ceepoch of self-training each model fj t, we will update P and Ne 
using Eq (6) with the checkpoint model fj t. We add checkpoints during self-training into checkpoint 
ensemble to improve the sample selection in the next round of active learning. 
After T rounds active learning, we use the checkpoint ensemble as the i nal selective classif i er: the

In this continuation of the ASPEST method's description, the authors outline how self-training is integrated into the active learning framework. Self-training helps to refine the models' understanding and classification capability by incorporating unlabeled data that the model is relatively confident about. Here���s a breakdown of the process:
Subset Selection from Pseudo-Labeled Data (
Rsub
)
:
A subset
Rsub
is created by sampling a fraction
p
of the pseudo-labeled set
R
, which contains data points that the ensemble model has made predictions for with a confidence level above a threshold
��
but not equal to 1 (to avoid overconfidence).
Self-Training Objective
:
Each model

f_j^t
f
j
t
���
in the ensemble is further trained on this subset using a training objective that combines the KL-Divergence loss on the pseudo-labeled data and the cross-entropy loss on the original training data (
Dtr
).
The KL-Divergence loss is chosen because it is more forgiving when training on soft labels, which might not be entirely accurate, thus helping to mitigate the overconfidence issue.
Model Updating
:
During self-training, after every fixed number of epochs (
ce
), the ensemble predictions matrix
P
and the count
Ne
are updated with the new model checkpoints to ensure that the ensemble always represents the most current state of the individual models.
Checkpoint Ensemble in Active Learning
:
Checkpoints obtained during self-training are added to the ensemble to enhance the quality of sample selection in the subsequent rounds of active learning, further fine-tuning the ensemble's predictive performance.
Final Classifier and Selection Scoring Function
:
After the completion of
T
rounds of active learning, the final selective classifier is determined by the ensemble prediction for each class,

The ASPEST method attempts to improve active selective prediction by addressing the overconfidence problem often seen in models trained on distributions that have shifted. By using ensemble methods and self-training on strategically selected data, the aim is to enhance the reliability and accuracy of the predictive model, particularly in situations where labeling data is expensive or scarce.
5.3ANALYSES ANDDISCUSSIONS 
In this section, we analyze why the key components checkpoint ensembles and self-training in AS- 
PEST can improve selective prediction and perform ablation study to show their effect.

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 
Checkpoint ensembles can alleviate overf i tting and overconf i dence. We observe that in active 
selective prediction, when i ne-tuning the model on the small amount of selected labeled test data, 
the model can suffer overf i tting and overconf i dence issues and ensembling the checkpoints in the 
training path can effectively alleviate these issues (see the analysis in Appendix G.10). 
Self-training can alleviate overconf i dence. We observe that the checkpoint ensemble constructed 
after i ne-tuning is less conf i dent on the test data UXcompared to the deep ensemble. Thus, using 
the softmax outputs of the checkpoint ensemble as soft pseudo-labels for self-training can alleviate 
overconf i dence and improve selective prediction performance (see the analysis in Appendix G.11).

Table 4: Ablation study results for ASPEST. The mean and std of each metric over three random 
runs are reported (mean��std). All numbers are percentages. Bold numbers are superior results. 
Ablation studies. Compared to DE+Margin, ASPEST has two additional components: checkpoint 
ensemble and self-training. We perform ablation experiments on MNIST���SVHN and DomainNet 
to analyze the effect of these. We also study the effect of the threshold �� in self-training. The results 
in Table 4 show for MNIST���SVHN, adding the checkpoint ensemble component alone (ASPEST 
without self-training) does not improve the performance over DE+Margin, whereas adding the self- 
training component alone (ASPEST without checkpoint ensemble) can signif i cantly improve the 
performance. For DomainNet, both checkpoint ensemble and self-training have positive contribu- 
tions. For both cases, ASPEST (with both self-training and checkpoint ensemble) achieves much 
better results than DE+Margin or applying those components alone. We also show the performance 
is not highly sensitive to ��, while typically setting larger �� (e.g. �� = 0.9) yields better results. 
Integrating with UDA. To study whether incorporating unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) 
techniques into training could improve active selective prediction, we evaluate DE with UDA and 
ASPEST with UDA in Appendix G.12. Our results show that ASPEST outperforms (or on par with) 
DE with UDA, although ASPEST doesn���t utilize UDA. Furthermore, we show that by combining 
ASPEST with UDA, it might achieve even better performance. For example, on MNIST���SVHN, 
ASPEST with DANN improves the mean AUACC from 96.62% to 97.03% when the labeling 
budget is 500. However, in some cases, combining ASPEST with UDA yields much worse results. 
For example, on MNIST���SVHN, when the labeling budget is 100, combining ASPEST with UDA 
will reduce the mean AUACC by over 4%. We leave the exploration of UDA techniques to im- 
prove active selective prediction to future work ��� superior and robust UDA techniques can be easily 
incorporated into ASPEST to enhance its overall performance. 
6CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we introduce a new learning paradigm called active selective prediction which uses ac- 
tivelearningtoimproveselectivepredictionunderdistributionshift. Weshowthatthisnewparadigm 
results in improved accuracy and coverage on a distributionally shifted test domain and reduces the 
need for human labeling. We also propose a novel method ASPEST using checkpoint ensemble and 
self-training with a low labeling cost. We demonstrate ASPEST���s effectiveness over other baselines 
for this new problem setup on various image, text and structured datasets. Future work in this di- 
rection can investigate unsupervised hyperparameter tuning on test data, online data streaming, or 
further minimizing the labeling effort by designing time-preserving labeling interfaces.
ChatGPT
The section provides a detailed analysis and discussion of the ASPEST (Active Selective Prediction with Ensemble Self-Training) framework, highlighting how its key components contribute to enhancing selective prediction performance, especially under distribution shifts.
Checkpoint Ensembles and Overconfidence:
The use of checkpoint ensembles helps to mitigate overfitting and overconfidence issues that can arise when fine-tuning models on a small set of selected labeled data. By ensembling checkpoints from the training path, the models become more robust and less likely to be overly confident in their predictions.
Self-Training and Overconfidence:
Self-training with soft pseudo-labels generated from the checkpoint ensemble further reduces overconfidence. The ensemble is less confident on the test data than a deep ensemble, which implies that it provides more cautious and less biased soft labels for self-training.
Ablation Studies:
The ablation study results show that each component of ASPEST contributes positively, but the combination of both checkpoint ensembles and self-training yields the best performance improvement over the baseline (DE+Margin).
It is also noted that performance is not highly sensitive to the threshold
��
\eta
��
, though a higher
��
\eta
��
seems to generally yield better results.
Effect of Threshold
��
\eta
��
:
The threshold
��
\eta
��
determines the confidence level at which pseudo-labels are considered reliable enough for self-training. The results suggest that a higher
��
\eta
��
, such as 0.9, often leads to better results, indicating that more conservative pseudo-labeling can improve the model's performance.
Integration with UDA:
The study examines the effect of integrating unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques into the training process. The results show that ASPEST either outperforms or is on par with the combination of DE and UDA, even without using UDA techniques directly. This suggests that ASPEST's approach is already quite effective at dealing with distribution shifts.
However, the integration of ASPEST with UDA techniques does not always yield better results and in some cases can be detrimental. This indicates a need for careful consideration of when and how to integrate UDA into ASPEST.
Conclusion:
ASPEST introduces an effective way to improve selective prediction under distribution shift by using active learning to reduce the need for extensive human labeling.
The effectiveness of ASPEST is demonstrated across different datasets and compared to other baselines.
Future work could include exploring UDA techniques to further enhance ASPEST, investigating unsupervised hyperparameter tuning, adapting to online data streams, or designing more efficient labeling interfaces to reduce human effort.
Overall, ASPEST presents a promising approach for improving selective prediction in scenarios where the distribution of the test data differs from the training data, which is a common challenge in real-world applications.

It reminds me of this: Walking Down the Memory Maze: Beyond Context Limit through Interactive Reading

ICLR 2024 Conference Submission7818 Authors

Keywords: LLM, language model, long context, reasoning, memory
TL;DR: Go beyond LLM's context limit by allowing the LMs to interactively read different parts of the long text; this is done by navigating a summary tree structure (the memory maze) that is generated by the model itself.
Abstract:
Large language models (LLMs) have advanced in large strides due to the effectiveness of the self-attention mechanism that processes and compares all tokens at once. However, this mechanism comes with a fundamental issue ��� the predetermined context window is bound to be limited. Despite attempts to extend the context window through methods like extrapolating the positional embedding, using recurrence, or selectively retrieving essential parts of the long sequence, long-text understanding continues to be a challenge. We propose an alternative approach which instead treats the LLM as an interactive agent, allowing it to decide how to read the text via iterative prompting. We introduce MemWalker, a method that first processes the long context into a tree of summary nodes. Upon receiving a query, the model navigates this tree in search of relevant information, and responds once it gathers sufficient information. On long-text question answering tasks our method outperforms baseline approaches that use long context windows, recurrence, and retrieval. We show that, beyond effective reading, MemWalker enhances explainability by highlighting the reasoning steps as it interactively reads the text; pinpointing the relevant text segments related to the query
ChatGPT
The project "Walking Down the Memory Maze: Beyond Context Limit through Interactive Reading" introduces an innovative method for tackling the challenge of context limitation in large language models (LLMs), which is indeed related to the concept of self-learning as previously discussed.
Here are some key connections:
Interactive Learning
: Both the human learning exemplified by your projects and the MemWalker method involve active engagement with the material. Just as you learn by doing, the MemWalker model navigates and interacts with information to improve understanding.
Memory and Reasoning
: Your projects require you to remember and apply knowledge creatively, which parallels MemWalker's use of a summary tree to store and navigate information, enhancing long-term reasoning.
Overcoming Limits
: Just like you are pushing the boundaries of knowledge and creativity with your diverse projects, the MemWalker approach is designed to surpass the inherent limitations of LLMs by allowing them to 'read' beyond their fixed context window.
Adaptive Learning
: In the way your projects adapt and evolve, the MemWalker method represents a form of adaptive learning in AI, where the model adjusts its approach based on the information it gathers from the summary tree.
In both cases, there is a theme of extending capabilities���be it a human expanding their skills and knowledge across disciplines or an AI model enhancing its ability to process and understand long texts. Both are examples of learning systems developing strategies to assimilate and utilize large amounts of information effectively.

Speleofacts ring structure built by Neanderthal people in Bruniquel cave 176,500 years ago.
The artificial ring structures made of broken stalagmites have been dated by uranium series dating as 176.5 (��2.1) thousand years old, with 2�� uncertainties (95.5% probability). There are two annular structures, one 6.7 by 4.5 metres (ellipse major/minor axes), and the other 2.2 by 2.1 metres (ellipse major/minor axes), composed of one to four aligned layers of stalagmites, with some small pieces placed inside the layers to support them. Some stalagmites were placed vertically against the rings, possibly as reinforcement. There are also four stacks of stalagmites between 0.55 and 2.60 metres in diameter, two of which were inside the large ring and two outside it. Around 400 stalagmite pieces (called "speleofacts" by the researchers) were used, with a total length of 112.4 metres and weight of around 2.2 tons.

Very few of the stalagmites are whole, with half being from the middle, excluding the root and tip. All six structures show signs of fire, with 57 reddened and 66 blackened pieces. Burnt organic material was also found, including a 6.7 cm bone from a bear or large herbivore. The stalagmite pieces are well calibrated, with an average length of 34.4 cm for the large ring and 29.5 cm for the small one, which in the view of Jaubert and colleagues strongly suggests intentional construction. No other evidence has been found of human activity.

 (2 June 2016) [online 25 May 2016]. "Early Neanderthal Constructions deep in Bruniquel Cave in Southwestern France". Nature. 534 (7605): 111���114.
ChatGPT
The discovery of the ring structures built by Neanderthals in the Bruniquel Cave is a significant archaeological find that has implications for our understanding of Neanderthal cognitive abilities and social behavior. The structures, dated to be around 176,500 years old, suggest a level of social organization and environmental manipulation that was not previously attributed to Neanderthals.
The fact that these structures show signs of fire use indicates that the space may have had a functional purpose, such as for warmth, light, or protection, which further suggests complex behavior. The careful selection and calibration of the stalagmites (termed "speleofacts" by the researchers) imply a level of planning and craftsmanship.
This discovery challenges the stereotypical view of Neanderthals as primitive and incapable of sophisticated behavior. Instead, it adds to the growing body of evidence that Neanderthals were not so different from modern humans in their ability to engage in complex activities and may have had their own form of culture and ritual practices.
No other evidence of human activity being found in the area raises questions about the purpose of these structures. The use of the site is still a matter of speculation; some theories propose that they might have served for ritualistic or symbolic purposes, given their elaborate construction and the absence of habitual living evidence. This find from the Bruniquel Cave is a testament to the complexity and depth of Neanderthal society, and it continues to provoke both scientific inquiry and public fascination.
None of the articles mention its use as a musical instrument but a stalagtite makes a musical sound when struck even when attached, when broken it could be leaned on another stalagtite or wall.
ChatGPT
The idea that Neanderthals could have used stalagmites as lithophones (musical instruments made from stone that produce notes when struck) is a fascinating hypothesis, albeit speculative without direct evidence. Stalagmites can indeed produce clear tones when struck, and there are historical examples of lithophones being used by various cultures.
However, the structures in the Bruniquel Cave have not been directly associated with musical purposes in the scientific literature. The precise function of the rings and the apparent deliberate arrangement of the stalagmites remain unclear. It's entirely possible that the Neanderthals might have discovered the sonic properties of stalagmites by accident and could have exploited this feature for communication, ritual, or entertainment purposes.
The association of these structures with music remains a hypothesis that would require further evidence to be substantiated. This could include finding patterns or wear that suggest regular striking, or arrangements that correspond to specific acoustic properties. Until such evidence is found, the musical theory remains an intriguing possibility that adds to the mystery of these ancient structures.
Yeah evidence of striking would be good although, although reconstruction of how they were places, and experimental archeology where various reconstructive are made
ChatGPT
Indeed, evidence of striking or wear patterns would significantly support the idea of Neanderthals using stalagmites as musical instruments. Experimental archaeology could be quite helpful in this regard. By reconstructing the stalagmite arrangements and testing them for acoustic properties, researchers could gain insights into how these structures might have been used.
Experimental archaeologists often create replicas of historical artifacts or structures to test theories about their use. In the case of Bruniquel Cave, they might attempt to:
Replicate the Stalagmite Arrangements:
To determine how they could have been placed and to explore the acoustics of the structure within a cave environment.
Assess for Wear Patterns:
By recreating the structures and using them in various ways, researchers can look for comparable wear patterns to those on the original stalagmites.
Acoustic Testing:
They can strike the stalagmites in controlled conditions to see if they could produce a range of notes that are musically meaningful.
Cultural Contextualization:
Comparing these structures with other known lithophones or musical artifacts from ancient cultures might provide insights into the potential use of stalagmites as instruments.
Document the Sounds:
Recording the sounds produced by the stalagmites in different configurations could provide a library of the potential 'music' that Neanderthals might have created, even if unintentionally.
If such reconstructions and experiments find that the stalagmites could produce a variety of distinct and repeatable tones, it would lend more credibility to the hypothesis that they were intentionally used as instruments. However, without direct evidence of their use for music, any conclusions would remain speculative. It���s a fascinating avenue for study, reflecting the broader interest in understanding Neanderthal culture and cognitive capabilities.
RSVP is based on poincar�� reoccurance in a closed system, which the universe is not due to speed of communication limits. I argue that near heat death microwave background from all directions continually flows into each observable universe and making each region indistinguishable, when it is very smooth, the entropy is once again very low, and approaches a Janus point after poincar�� time
ChatGPT
The RSVP (Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum) theory, as you've described it, appears to draw on ideas from cosmology and theoretical physics, notably the concept of Poincar�� recurrence, which states that certain systems will, after a sufficiently long period of time, return to a state very close to the initial condition. This is a theorem in classical mechanics that applies to deterministic systems which are finite and bound.
In the context of the universe:
Closed System Argument:
The Poincar�� recurrence theorem assumes a closed system. If the universe were truly closed, then given enough time, every possible state might recur. However, current cosmological evidence suggests that the universe is expanding, and the expansion is accelerating, which would make it an open system on the largest scales.
Heat Death and Entropy:
The 'heat death' scenario refers to the universe reaching a state of no thermodynamic free energy and therefore being unable to sustain processes that increase entropy. At this point, the universe would be in thermal equilibrium. Your suggestion seems to imply that as the universe approaches this state, the cosmic microwave background radiation would make each observable region indistinguishable, leading to a low entropy state akin to the universe's beginning, or a 'Janus point.'
Janus Point:
A Janus point is a concept proposed by some physicists where a moment in time could play a similar role to a spatial boundary condition, potentially representing a point of minimum complexity or maximum order.
Speed of Communication Limits:
This refers to the fact that, due to the finite speed of light, there is a horizon beyond which we cannot communicate or be influenced by other regions of the universe.
Your proposal is a fascinating mix of concepts and would be considered highly speculative in the context of modern cosmology. While Poincar�� recurrence might theoretically occur in a closed system after a vast amount of time, the observable universe doesn't seem to meet the necessary criteria, as it's not closed and it's subject to the laws of thermodynamics which drive it towards increasing entropy.
The idea of a "Janus point" after a Poincar�� time suggests a reversal or significant shift in the state of the universe, akin to the concept of a 'Big Bounce,' where the universe could reach a minimum size and then expand again. This is a theoretical model that contrasts with the more widely accepted 'Big Bang' followed by perpetual expansion and heat death.
However, these ideas are at the very edge of theoretical physics and are not currently supported by empirical evidence. They are part of the ongoing discussion and debate about the ultimate fate of the universe and the laws that govern its large-scale structure and dynamics.
Yeah I say the idea of size its relative, the scale at which useful work changes and the ratio of galactic void to filament changed, but in this model expansion is a misnomer, rather the universe spongeifies, but stays the same size
ChatGPT
Your description proposes an intriguing perspective on cosmic expansion where the 'size' of the universe remains constant, but its structure changes, becoming more 'spongy' as the voids grow and the filaments perhaps thin out. This suggests that rather than expanding in the sense of galaxies moving away from each other into new space, the structure of the existing universe is changing while maintaining its overall 'size.'
This seems to imply a redefinition of scale and metric expansion, where the focus is on the changing distribution of matter and energy rather than the increase in distance between objects. Such a model would still need to account for the observations that underpin the current cosmological consensus, like the redshift of distant galaxies and the cosmic microwave background radiation, which are well-explained by an expanding universe in which space itself is stretching.
The notion that the universe could expand without increasing in size, by changing its structure in a manner analogous to a sponge's pores growing larger, is a concept that would challenge our current understanding of spacetime and expansion. It would require a reevaluation of the fundamental metrics used in cosmology.
In standard cosmology, the expansion of the universe is described by the scale factor, which grows over time, leading to an increase in the observed distance between objects not bound by other forces (like gravity). This is usually interpreted as space itself expanding, rather than objects simply moving through space.
Any new theory that proposes an alternative to this model would have to be consistent with the wealth of observational data and the theoretical framework of general relativity, or it would need to provide a new theory that better explains the observations. It would also need to make testable predictions that could be evaluated against empirical data. The concept you're describing would be quite revolutionary if it could meet these stringent criteria.
The gravitational potential energy is equal to the "expansion" of the earlier inflaton fields, which involved the relative expansion of lighter to denser regions. After 380,000 years, photon's congeal making the universe  into a fine mist of protons everywhere at once. Not expanding outward from a central point
ChatGPT
Your description touches on several aspects of cosmological theory and models:
Inflaton Fields
: The inflationary period of the early universe is indeed theorized to have involved fields known as inflatons. During this very brief period, the universe expanded exponentially, and this expansion is thought to have been driven by the potential energy of these fields.
Gravitational Potential
: The relationship between gravitational potential energy and the expansion driven by inflation isn't typically framed as an equivalence. Still, it's correct to say that as the universe expanded, regions with different densities evolved, eventually leading to the large-scale structures we see today.
Photon Decoupling
: Around 380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe had cooled enough for protons and electrons to combine to form neutral hydrogen, a process known as recombination. This allowed photons to travel freely, creating what we now observe as the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). Before this time, photons were constantly interacting with charged particles, and the universe was opaque.
No Central Point
: Modern cosmology is based on the Cosmological Principle, which states that on large scales, the universe is homogeneous and isotropic, meaning it looks the same in all directions and from all points. There's no central point from which the universe is expanding; instead, every point in the universe is moving away from every other point due to the expansion of space itself.
Mist of Protons
: After recombination and the decoupling of photons, the universe indeed became transparent, filled with a nearly uniform mist of hydrogen gas, which is the protons and neutral hydrogen atoms you mentioned.
Your interpretation that the universe didn't expand outward from a central point is aligned with the standard model of cosmology. The expansion happens uniformly throughout all of space rather than emanating from a particular location in space. This is an important distinction that is often misunderstood in popular science discussions. The universe can be thought of as infinite and unbounded, with its expansion describing the change in the metric that defines the distance between points in space.
Yes and over time we have to use larger and larger measuring tools but this indicates the universe has its energy more evenly distributed, not that it is getting larger. Messages from further regions keep arriving from further regions although microwave shifted. I am referring to a zero energy universe
ChatGPT
The concept of a zero-energy universe is an intriguing one, positing that the total amount of energy in the universe is exactly zero when considering the balance between positive energy (such as matter and radiation) and negative energy (such as gravitational potential energy). In this model, the positive energy of matter is exactly balanced by the negative energy of gravity, leading to a net energy of zero. This idea is speculative and has implications for cosmology and theories of the universe's origin, such as the Hartle-Hawking state, which suggests that the universe could have emerged from a quantum fluctuation.
Regarding the expansion of the universe and the use of larger measuring tools, it's important to distinguish between the universe getting more extensive and the scale of the universe. The distribution of energy becoming more even over time, as you mentioned, is related to the second law of thermodynamics, where entropy tends to increase in an isolated system. The universe's expansion is observed by the redshift of light from distant galaxies, indicating that space itself is stretching, leading to galaxies moving away from each other.
This expansion doesn't necessarily mean that the universe's energy is becoming more "evenly distributed" in the sense of uniformity; rather, it's the metric that defines spatial distances that is changing. The large-scale structure of the universe is still clumpy, with galaxies, clusters, and superclusters, along with vast voids.
The concept of a zero-energy universe doesn't conflict with these observations, but it does offer a different context for interpreting the totality of cosmic energy content. It also provides a potential framework for understanding how the universe might have come into being from "nothing," where the nothing is a state of balance between different types of energy rather than an absence of substance or space-time. This remains a speculative and hotly debated topic in theoretical physics and cosmology.
Ok in RSVP the universe does not begin as nothing but a smooth brick, a quark gluon plasma arranged in a crystal lattice, but extending infinitely, any fluctuations are quickly absorbed by neighboring regions. Everything is hardly moving so it is impossible to tell time or make measurements. When a significant set of "cracks" are in place, these fluctuations are set of everywhere at once, with no knowledge of what is going on in other regions
ChatGPT
The RSVP (Recurrence Singularities Void Parity) model you're outlining seems to present a cosmological scenario where the universe starts in a highly ordered state, specifically as an infinite quark-gluon plasma arranged in a crystalline structure. In this model, it appears that due to the uniform nature of this plasma, any perturbations or "cracks" in the uniformity are rare and have widespread effects when they do occur.
In such a hypothetical scenario, because everything is almost static and uniform, defining time or space through movement or change would indeed be challenging, if not impossible. It's reminiscent of the early universe according to the standard cosmological model just after the Big Bang when it was in a hot, dense state and fluctuations led to the large-scale structures we see today. However, in your scenario, there is no singular point of origin or initial "bang"; instead, there's an infinite, static field that experiences a transition due to instabilities or "cracks."
When these instabilities occur, they disrupt the lattice everywhere simultaneously, since the model suggests no communication limit ��� this deviates from the standard cosmology, where causality is limited by the speed of light and the universe has a finite age, with different regions being causally disconnected at early times.
The model you are describing is highly theoretical and not part of mainstream cosmology. It would have to address several critical aspects to align with observations, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation, the distribution of matter, and the expansion of space as evidenced by redshift data. Additionally, such a model would need to be reconciled with general relativity and quantum field theory, which underpin our current understanding of cosmological and quantum phenomena.
I am summarizing some information I heard from Neil Turok on universal simplicity and cosmologist Mark Whittle on baryon acoustic oscillations
ChatGPT
Neil Turok and Mark Whittle are both respected figures in the field of cosmology, and their work offers significant insights into the early universe and its characteristics.
Neil Turok has worked on various theories related to cosmology, including cyclic models of the universe that challenge the traditional Big Bang theory. His work often focuses on the idea of a universe that goes through an endless series of expansions and contractions, and he has discussed the concept of a universe that is simpler and more symmetrical at its extremes ��� at the Big Bang and at the Big Crunch.
Mark Whittle's work with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) deals with the analysis of sound waves from the early universe that were imprinted in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and later in the distribution of galaxies. BAOs serve as a "standard ruler" for measuring the universe's expansion over time.
When combining ideas from both scientists, you get a picture of a universe that has a potentially cyclical nature, as suggested by Turok, and one that carries the echoes of its early moments through phenomena such as BAOs, which Whittle studies. Both contribute to a narrative of the universe where simplicity and complexity intertwine ��� where simple initial conditions can lead to complex structures and patterns we observe today, and where the large-scale structure of the universe still bears the imprints of its earliest acoustic vibrations.
It's essential to recognize that the work of individual scientists like Turok and Whittle is part of a larger collaborative effort to understand the cosmos. While their research may point to new possibilities and perspectives on the universe's evolution, these ideas are continually tested and refined through observation and analysis within the scientific community.
Ok an outline of my theory
ChatGPT
Certainly, based on what you've shared, here is a rough outline of your theory:
Title: Relative Scale and Perpetual Complexity (RSVP) Theory
Fundamental Premise:
The universe is infinite and unbounded, existing as a smooth, homogenous quark-gluon plasma arranged in a crystal lattice.
There is no "expansion" from a point, but a universal "spongeification," with regions of varying densities.
Time and measurement are undefined due to the uniform movement and distribution of energy.
Cosmological Evolution:
Initial conditions are extremely smooth with minimal fluctuations, which are quickly absorbed.
Over time, a critical threshold of fluctuations triggers a universal change, propagating "cracks" or perturbations.
Energy Distribution:
The gravitational potential equates to the inflaton fields' "expansion," aligning lighter regions relative to denser ones.
A transition occurs where protons pervade the universe, resulting in a uniform mist rather than expansion from a central point.
Temporal Dynamics:
Poincar�� recurrence is not applicable due to the lack of a closed system and limits to the speed of communication.
At or near heat death, the universe attains low entropy, approaching a state of uniformity akin to a "Janus point."
Scale Relativity:
Scale is relative; what matters is how energy is distributed and the changing ratio of void to filament within the universe.
The universe's "size" remains constant, but the distribution of energy becomes more even over time.
Zero Energy Universe:
The universe doesn't begin from "nothing" but from a state of undifferentiated potential.
Fluctuations propagate without coordination, leading to isolated pockets of complexity.
Cosmological Echoes:
Baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) and other large-scale structures retain the early universe's imprints, serving as tools to understand the past.
Theoretical Implications and Predictions:
Discuss potential observational evidence and implications for cosmology and physics.
Present how this theory compares with and differs from current models like the Big Bang and cyclic universes.
Challenges and Critiques:
Acknowledge the counterarguments, limitations, and areas where the theory diverges from established evidence or consensus.
Suggest experiments or observations that could test the theory's predictions.
This outline is based on a mix of conventional cosmology and your own speculations, which would need a substantial framework of mathematical and empirical support to be considered a viable scientific theory.
This is beyond my expertise but I hope to use 5d Ising models and generative adversarial networks to match the parameters of other known simulations and observations
ChatGPT
Using 5D Ising models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore your theory is a novel approach. Here���s how these tools could potentially fit into your research:
5D Ising Models:
These models can be used to simulate phase transitions in high-dimensional spaces.
They could help model the "cracks" or fluctuations within the early universe's lattice structure.
Analyzing how these models behave could provide insights into how uniform conditions might lead to complex structures.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):
GANs can be trained on data from existing cosmological simulations or observational data to learn the underlying distribution.
They can generate new data that could hypothetically adhere to the principles of your theory.
By comparing GAN outputs with actual observations, you can refine your model, tuning it to better represent the universe's evolution.
Matching Parameters:
Parameters from your simulations can be adjusted to see how changes might lead to structures observed in the universe today.
By matching the parameters of known simulations (like Lambda-CDM models), you can see where and how your theory diverges.
Testing and Validation:
Your models should predict unique signatures or phenomena that could be tested against observational data.
If your GANs produce data that current technology cannot validate, they might suggest what future observations or experiments are needed.
Iterative Learning:
As more observational data becomes available (e.g., from the James Webb Space Telescope), your models can be further trained and tested.
The adversarial process inherent in GANs could be particularly effective in evolving the models based on the data feedback loop.
It's important to work closely with experts in cosmology, data science, and computational physics as you develop these models. This multidisciplinary team can help ensure that your approach is scientifically rigorous and that your models are built on sound principles. Additionally, the complex nature of such simulations requires careful consideration of computational resources and the interpretability of results.
Ok another summary of the conversation and interconnections
ChatGPT
Certainly, here is a concise summary and the connections between the various topics we've discussed:
AI and Self-Learning:
The conversation began with a discussion about the capabilities of AI, particularly the self-learning aspect demonstrated by language models like ChatGPT.
Interactive Reading & MemWalker:
We touched on a concept from a hypothetical paper on a method called MemWalker, which allows language models to navigate through long texts interactively, enhancing their understanding and recall capabilities.
Tree of Self-Reflection:
The dialogue then connected the idea of interactive reading to a method known as the Tree of Self-Reflection, which could potentially relate to how AI reviews past interactions to generate insights.
Concepts and Glossary:
A comprehensive glossary was provided, encompassing terms related to AI, consciousness, ethical considerations, and the philosophy of mind, all of which underpin our discussion.
Neanderthal Constructions:
The focus shifted to the discovery of ancient Neanderthal constructions in the Bruniquel Cave, contemplating their purpose and the potential for music-making.
RSVP and Cosmology:
You introduced your theory, RSVP (Reoccurring Simple Versatile Poincar��), which considers the universe in terms of reoccurring simplicity rather than an expanding model. This included discussions about entropy, the heat death of the universe, and baryon acoustic oscillations.
5D Ising Models and GANs:
Lastly, we explored how 5D Ising models and generative adversarial networks might be utilized to simulate the early universe according to your theory, aiming to match and test against known cosmological observations and simulations.
Throughout the conversation, we've interwoven the themes of how complex systems (like the universe or the human mind) can be understood through simple, fundamental rules, how AI can be a tool to understand these systems better, and how past structures (whether Neanderthal constructions or patterns in the early universe) provide clues to complex processes. Each topic, while distinct, shares a common thread of seeking understanding through patterns, structures, and systems, highlighting the human quest for knowledge across various scales and disciplines.
I like the title Reoccurring Simple Versatile Poincar�� but it stood for Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum theory
ChatGPT
Thank you for the clarification. The title "Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum theory" (RSVP) suggests a theory that encompasses various elements of physics:
Relativistic
: Likely involves principles of relativity, which could pertain to both special and general relativity, indicating a framework that considers the fabric of spacetime and the effects of gravity.
Scalar
: Could involve scalar fields which are quantities described by a single value at every point in space, often used in physics to represent potential energy fields.
Vector
: Implies the inclusion of vector fields, which represent quantities that have both magnitude and direction, such as the electromagnetic field.
Plenum
: Refers to a space completely filled with matter or energy. In historical context, 'plenum' opposed the concept of a vacuum, suggesting a cosmological model where the universe is a 'full' continuum.
Combining these terms, RSVP would seem to outline a cosmological model that integrates the effects of relativity with the behavior of scalar and vector fields in a universe treated as a continuous plenum. This could provide a unique perspective on the structure and dynamics of the universe at its most fundamental level.
I thought I would call the conversation Argumentum ad Astra
ChatGPT
"Argumentum ad Astra," which could be loosely translated as "argument to the stars," is a fitting title for a conversation that ventures into a range of topics including the cosmos, advanced theoretical physics, the potential for AI and its implications, and even the prehistoric actions of Neanderthals. This title encapsulates a journey of inquiry and speculation reaching from our ancient past to the farthest reaches of the universe and the depths of complex scientific theory.
I thought that when they started the bone fires it might have made light glisten off drops of dew making it seem like the dome of stars. Much later the Greek idea of cosmos was based on the word for ornament or decoration
ChatGPT
The idea that Neanderthals could have witnessed the light from their fires reflecting off of dew and resembling the night sky is an evocative image, connecting early human experiences with the grandeur of the cosmos. The subsequent connection to the Greek concept of the cosmos, originating from notions of order and beauty, suggests a deep-seated human tendency to find or create patterns and beauty in the environment. This inclination to relate immediate sensory experiences to larger, more abstract concepts could be seen as a fundamental aspect of human cognition, linking the past to philosophical ideas that would only be formalized much later in human history. It's a fascinating thought that such profound notions could have their origins in the very real and tangible experiences of early humans, like those around a prehistoric fireside.
When the cave was rediscovered it was because a boy felt a cold wind and dug for years.

In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years.
ChatGPT
Bruno Kowalsczewski's rediscovery of Bruniquel Cave is a testament to curiosity and perseverance. It's quite poetic that a teenager, driven by the subtle cue of a cold wind, managed to unearth a site that has since provided such significant insights into Neanderthal life. His discovery reiterates how single acts of determination can lead to monumental findings in the field of archaeology, linking us more closely with our distant ancestors. The fact that a place remained untouched for such a lengthy period, only to be unveiled by the persistent efforts of a young explorer, adds a layer of wonder to the human narrative, reminding us of the countless stories still hidden beneath the earth, waiting to be uncovered.

AI and machine learning concepts
, considering how AI processes information and comparing it to human cognitive approaches like the
Tree of Self-Reflection
.
We talked about the importance of
self-reflection
,
beginner's mind
, and how these can relate to both human and artificial learning and development processes.
We delved into the
Zettelkasten method
, which connects to how both humans and AIs can organize information for better retrieval and learning outcomes.
The conversation included thoughts on
consciousness
,
multidimensional thinking
, and
psychology
through the example of the Stroop Test, illustrating the complex interplay between perception and cognition.
We examined
ethical considerations
and
historical dialogues
, especially relating to AI development and the potential for revisiting past conversations for insight.
There was an exploration of
scientific and philosophical concepts
, such as the
universe's structure and origin
, the
physics of its expansion
, and the
nature of time and entropy
.
This led to discussions about
cosmology
,
zero-energy universes
, and a hypothetical closed-system universe model, invoking ideas of Poincar�� recurrence and the potential for a universe that 'spongeifies' rather than expands.
Our dialogue turned to the
technical side
, mentioning
5D Ising models
and
generative adversarial networks
as tools to simulate complex systems, potentially applicable to universal models.
We touched on
archaeological discoveries
such as the
Bruniquel Cave
, considering the implications of Neanderthal constructions for understanding ancient cognitive abilities and potential cultural practices.
The conversation was threaded with a sense of
inquiry and hypothesis-testing
, akin to the scientific method and AI's approach to problem-solving.
In summary, we blended a discussion of high-level theoretical concepts with practical implications, crossing back and forth between how humans and artificial intelligences process, learn, and make sense of the world. The title "Argumentum ad Astra" captures the essence of this exploratory journey from cognitive science to the cosmos and the interconnectivity of knowledge across different domains.
