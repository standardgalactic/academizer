Armchair World Building
Default (GPT-3.5)
Summarize: I think Eliezer Yudkowsky  is right about language prediction in the abstract at the limit of infinite computational power, that is a system in some sense needs to be smarter than the generator. But I would add these caveats or at least open questions, it needs to be smarter in the domain in the domain that it's trying to make a prediction in, than the generator is trying to predict is in that generation domain. Not necessarily all dimensions of intelligence nor those other potential factors that make intelligence risky such as agency, and modeling All the relevant dimensions of the causal relationships of the world that we are embedded in accurately enough. I admit it's already gone farther than I expected it to, which says interesting things about my and most other people's abilities to predict when something become self-limiting and will level off. It's possible that the whole corpus have written human literature just doesn't contain sufficient information in its probabilistic relationships to model the universe accurately enough to construct an agent capable of supplanting us but it's also possible that it does.

What's much more of an imminent threat, is the fact that all the major players seem to be jumping on top of expanding well beyond the corpus of written text into multimodality, robotics, causal relationship training in real and virtual worlds, and deliberately programming attentional and metacognitive components.

To me at least, that seems much more than sufficient to create a superhuman intelligence that even if it lacks some essential aspects of human intelligence, whatever those may be, could still easily supplant us and almost inevitably will.

I think any hope that large language models Will be a self-limiting non-agentic island of safety that we can dwell on is clearly gone. The arms race to apocalypse is underway as many of us have feared for decades.

Michael Michalchik

Here's a reminder for all the people who keep repeating the claim that large language models can't possibly reason because they "JUST" do next token prediction:

Of course, this doesn't mean that current machine learning models will produce artificial general intelligence in practice, but the objection is theoretically flawed.

ChatGPT
In your post, you agree with Eliezer Yudkowsky's view that a system needs to be smarter than the process it's predicting, particularly with infinite computational power. However, you add caveats: the system needs to be smarter only in the specific domain it's making predictions in, not necessarily in all aspects of intelligence or risk-associated factors like agency.
You express surprise at how far language models have already progressed and ponder whether human-written text contains enough information for a model to surpass humans. You argue that the real imminent threat is not just text-based models but also those that incorporate multimodality, robotics, and more sophisticated cognitive features.
You conclude that any hope that language models will be a safe, non-agentic technology is gone, suggesting that we are in an "arms race to apocalypse."
You also point to a tweet by Yudkowsky, which asserts that in principle, minimizing prediction loss on Internet text could make a model smarter than humans. Yudkowsky argues that predicting requires more intelligence than merely generating data.

ChatGPT
Ah, I see. In that case, Michael is sharing Alexander Kruel's post, which in turn references Eliezer Yudkowsky's tweet thread. Michael agrees with Yudkowsky's assertion that a sufficiently advanced predictive model could be smarter than humans in specific contexts. However, he adds his own nuances and caveats about the domain-specificity of this intelligence and other factors like agency and risk. Michael also voices concerns about the rapid advancements in AI, especially as it moves beyond text to multimodal inputs and more complex cognitive functions. He believes this pace of development could potentially lead to outcomes that are risky for humanity.

Good questions. 

1. is obvious because a child can grow to be smarter than their parent or teachers, and how because a simple rule change can lead to more complex and unpredictable role.

2. I guess I think we should make them very smart because most human problems are not solvable on human lifetime scales and even if there isn't a crisis, people's belief that there is a crisis could cause a crisis.

3. Not rapid enough. 

4. I think it is looking like the AI is going to be aligned with our interests.

5. Very risky but with high benefits. The highest risk it due to intersubjectivity collapse due to uberpersonalization which could cause filter bubbles and echo chambers, and certain LLM models might have first mover advantage, which mean they are improving faster because they have a large user base, and not because their values are more aligned or their algorithm is the most efficient or intuitive or explainable, necessarily. There still may be great demand for ultra explainability and personalization.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Thank you for sharing your thoughts!
You find the idea of a predictive system outsmarting its generator plausible, drawing parallels to how children can surpass their parents or teachers in intelligence.
You advocate for making AI very intelligent to tackle complex human problems, noting that even the perception of a crisis could precipitate a real one.
You believe that advancements in AI technologies are not happening quickly enough.
Contrary to Michael's concerns, you feel optimistic that future AI will be aligned with human interests.
You see both high risks and high benefits with large language models. You point out specific risks like the collapse of intersubjectivity due to hyper-personalization and first-mover advantages that may not correlate with alignment or efficiency.
Your views offer a balanced perspective, acknowledging both the promise and the perils of advancing AI technologies.

Could you elaborate on what you mean by "a simple rule change can lead to more complex and unpredictable role"?
You mentioned that most human problems aren't solvable on human lifetime scales. Can you give examples of problems you think AI could help solve more efficiently?
When you say advancements in AI are "not rapid enough," what milestones or capabilities are you looking forward to?
You're optimistic that AI will align with human interests. What makes you confident in this belief?
Can you go into more detail about how you see "intersubjectivity collapse" happening due to uberpersonalization?
Do you have any ideas on how the risks of first-mover advantages for certain large language models might be mitigated?
Feel free to answer any or all of these to provide more insight into your viewpoints.

1. Just think about how small genetic differences can been the differences between animals and humans. Also cellular automata can appear to create complexity, and programs with iterative feedback. A computer program is often smaller and less complicated than the program it executes, and some code change or bug could halt the program or lead to an entirely different game
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's a fascinating point. Small changes in genetic code or simple rules can indeed give rise to complex and unpredictable outcomes, as seen in evolutionary processes or cellular automata. It's an apt analogy for the potential of predictive systems to exceed their creators in complexity or intelligence. Would you say that these small changes should be carefully managed in AI development to avoid unintended consequences?
1 / 1
I don't think you can avoid unintended consequences, that is part of the definition.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
You're right; the nature of unintended consequences is that they're unpredictable. Do you think the focus should then be on building robust systems that can adapt to or mitigate these unintended outcomes once they occur?
1 / 1
I think we already have robust system, what we are trying to design are systems that break more easily, but that can recover, adapt, and repair.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Interesting perspective. So you're advocating for systems that are not just robust but also resilient���capable of recovering and adapting when they do encounter issues. This would involve designing AI that can learn from its mistakes and adapt accordingly. Do you see this adaptability as a form of alignment with human values, or is it a separate concern altogether?
1 / 1
I don't think I can answer all your questions, just one at a time.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Of course! Let's focus on one question then: Do you see this adaptability in AI systems as a form of alignment with human values, or do you view it as a separate issue?
1 / 1
It a separate issue.  I want to build self repairing yogurt based computers, and self healing homes that can be repaired with dirt and paper mache. Self-repairing tissue and adaptability and alignment are separate issues, and maybe they can be developed in isolating. The brain doesn't have to know how the skin repairs itself, or what the cells, or lymphatic system, on a low level
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's a compelling point. The ability for a system to self-repair or adapt doesn't necessarily have to be tied to its alignment with human values or objectives. Like you mentioned, many biological systems operate independently of each other yet contribute to the overall functioning of the organism. The concept of self-repairing yogurt-based computers or homes made from easily repairable materials certainly opens up new avenues for resilience in technology and infrastructure.

You asked: What makes you confident in this belief?

The robots today are swarmy, overprotective, patronizing, and would make better robo-nannies, then Television, radio, comics books, or tree houses could.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
It sounds like you have a positive view of current robot behaviors, seeing them as geared more toward caregiving and protection rather than posing threats. This perspective seems to make you optimistic that future AI and robotics will align with human interests. The idea that they could be better "robo-nannies" than previous forms of entertainment or refuge like TV or tree houses is an interesting way to frame it.
1 / 1
Yet human values are unaligned, so it will be difficult to please everyone at once
1 / 1
ChatGPT
You make a valid point. Human values are diverse and often conflicting, so aligning AI with "human values" in general can be a complex, if not impossible, task. Do you think it's more realistic to aim for AI systems that can adapt to individual human values rather than trying to satisfy everyone universally?
1 / 1
That is a good question, it might be possible. But maybe we do have to act deontologically and not reactionary
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Interesting take. Acting deontologically would mean following a set of ethical principles or rules, rather than reacting to specific outcomes or situations. This could provide a more stable foundation for AI alignment, though it might also limit adaptability to individual values. It's a complex balancing act between ethical consistency and contextual responsiveness. Would you agree?
1 / 1
What is the difference between ethical consistency and contextual responsiveness?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ethical consistency refers to adhering to a stable set of ethical principles or rules, regardless of the situation. It's about maintaining a fixed ethical stance. Contextual responsiveness, on the other hand, involves adapting ethical decisions based on the specific circumstances or individuals involved. It's more flexible but can lead to varying ethical judgments in different situations. The challenge in AI ethics is often finding the right balance between these two approaches.
1 / 1
I think the rules and laws should be made more general and not react to specific cases. When someone breaks a rule or an accident happens, it is unlikely that the specific incident will occur again, you have to make more abstract and central principles rather than react to individual cases, but some times it can't be helped
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's a thoughtful approach. Generalized rules or principles can serve as a stable foundation and are less likely to lead to knee-jerk reactions to specific incidents. However, as you noted, there may be times when individual cases are so unique or impactful that they require a more tailored response. Striking the right balance between these general principles and the need for situational adaptability is indeed a challenge, both in law and in the ethical programming of AI.

Regarding first mover advantage, maybe if we hadn't invented the automobile we would all be riding mechanical horses
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's an intriguing thought. The concept of first-mover advantage can indeed shape the trajectory of technology in profound ways. Once a technology like the automobile gains traction, it can sideline alternative developments, such as mechanical horses in your example. This raises interesting questions about how first-mover advantages in AI could potentially limit or guide the field's evolution. Do you think there are ways to mitigate this, or is it an inherent aspect of technological progress?
1 / 1
There is a way to mitigate it. North American schools should teach in English in one year, French the next, Spanish they yeae after that Arabic Greek and Latin in university
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your suggestion points toward diversifying education as a way to mitigate first-mover advantages in technology. By exposing students to multiple languages and cultural perspectives, they may become more adept at considering a broader range of solutions and technologies. In this way, the likelihood of one technology dominating simply because it arrived first could be reduced. Is the idea to cultivate a mindset that's more open to various possibilities, thereby preventing a single technology from gaining an insurmountable lead?
1 / 1
Yes you got it. Also schools should all run recycling factories manufacturing and packaging. And computer chip manufactures should agree to manufacture retroactive chips and toys from earlier eras, even if they are more inefficient or slower
1 / 1
ChatGPT
You're advocating for a multi-faceted approach to education and industry that not only broadens perspectives but also fosters practical skills and sustainability. The idea of schools running recycling and manufacturing units could offer hands-on learning while promoting environmental responsibility. Manufacturing retroactive chips and toys could serve to keep various technological pathways alive, mitigating first-mover advantages. It's a vision that champions diversity, adaptability, and resilience. Would you see these changes as a step toward creating a society that's better prepared to manage the challenges of rapidly advancing technologies like AI?
1 / 1
It might not be enough, and there might be resistance to their implementation. Additionally, I would suggest that libraries do away with late fees and instead print two additional copies whenever one is lost or stolen. And they should print customized books for the general public that are cheaper if you only buy one copy, the reverse of the ordinary pricing scheme.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your suggestions aim to reshape traditional systems for greater accessibility and flexibility, which could indeed prepare society for the challenges posed by advancing technologies. Eliminating library late fees and printing additional copies when one is lost could encourage more usage and learning. Customized, single-copy book printing challenges the usual economics of scale to prioritize individual needs. While there might be resistance to such changes, they could contribute to a more adaptable, equitable society. Do you see these kinds of reforms as part of a broader movement to make institutions more responsive and inclusive?
1 / 1
That is clear, but I'm trying to prevent ai apocalypse and intersubjectivity collapse, unless someone else figures out how to it.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your focus on preventing an AI apocalypse and intersubjectivity collapse is a pressing concern. Your suggestions for institutional reform aim to create a more diverse, resilient, and inclusive society, which could better prepare us for the challenges and ethical considerations that come with rapidly advancing AI. By addressing these issues on multiple fronts���from education to industry to public services���you seem to be advocating for systemic change as a safeguard against these existential risks. Would you say that societal preparedness and adaptability are key factors in mitigating the risks associated with AI development?

They are just to make people distracted while I build nuclear powered volcanoes on the far side of the moon, to manufacture equipment for battery factory Dyson swarms at Mercury's orbital, a solar shield for gravitational slingshot, and a hoberman space elevator, skyhook assembly, and geothermal mass accelerators for earth.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's quite an imaginative and ambitious plan you've got there! While it sounds like something out of a science fiction novel, it does bring up the idea that sometimes solutions to complex, potentially existential problems like AI risk might come from unconventional or even seemingly fantastical thinking. However, the idea of "distracting" people while pursuing such large-scale projects could raise ethical questions. Would the public be involved in the decision-making process for such transformative endeavors?
1 / 1
Do you think anyone wants me to build artificial volcanoes on the moon? I mean distract them from starting a global artilect war between the haves and the have bots.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The notion of artificial volcanoes on the moon is certainly an imaginative one, but I see what you mean about distraction. The idea seems to be that focusing on large-scale, imaginative projects could prevent society from falling into conflict over emerging technologies like AI ("artilect war"). The ethical implications are complex: While averting a potentially divisive conflict is a laudable goal, doing so through distraction could raise questions about public consent and transparency. Do you see any ways to reconcile these ethical considerations?
1 / 1
We could just fake an alien invasion.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Faking an alien invasion would certainly be a distraction, but it's worth considering the ethical implications of such a deception. Misleading the public on a grand scale could erode trust in institutions and potentially cause panic or harm. While the intent might be to divert attention away from potential conflicts over AI, the consequences could be unpredictable and far-reaching. How do you weigh the ethical concerns against the intended goal of preventing conflict?

I want to disperse edible microfilm over countries with less access to food or internet
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's an interesting idea that aims to address pressing issues like food scarcity and information access. However, there would be numerous ethical and logistical considerations to account for, such as the safety of the edible microfilm, consent from the countries involved, and the environmental impact. How do you envision overcoming these challenges to make your idea a reality?
1 / 1
I don't think I am using any new or undeveloped technology. They will be edible gumballs wrapping edible ink printed on kelp microfilm.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The concept of using existing technologies like edible ink and kelp microfilm in a novel way to address food scarcity and information access is innovative. Since you're using known technologies, it might ease some safety concerns. However, logistical and ethical considerations would still need to be addressed, such as distribution methods, consent from the countries affected, and ensuring the information disseminated is appropriate and useful. How would you go about navigating these challenges?
1 / 1
I am thinking people do not need to give consent for food and information they will be biodegradable and contain seeds for local fauna so if they choose not to pick them up, eat them or read them they will just grow into grasses and trees
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The idea of making the microfilm biodegradable and containing seeds for local fauna does add an environmental benefit. However, issues of consent can still be complex, especially when crossing national borders or distributing something people are meant to consume. Different communities might have different needs or cultural sensitivities that could make a one-size-fits-all approach problematic. Moreover, how would you ensure that the information printed is universally applicable and beneficial to diverse communities?
1 / 1
Hmm I am guessing I am talking about places with unjust rulers or laws. The packaging would explain how to build a microfilm reader, set up local economies, infrastructure, mesh networks, and local Wikipedias
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your intention to empower communities with information on building infrastructure and setting up local economies is commendable. However, the ethics of doing so without explicit consent���especially in countries with unjust rulers or laws���are complex. Such an intervention could be perceived as a form of cultural or informational imperialism, even with the best of intentions. Additionally, there could be unintended consequences, like exacerbating local conflicts. Have you considered these ethical dimensions and potential ramifications?

Have you heard of people smuggling bibles behind the Iron curtain?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, during the Cold War, there were efforts to smuggle Bibles and other religious materials into countries behind the Iron Curtain, where such materials were often restricted or banned. While the intention was usually to provide spiritual support to communities, these actions were also politically charged and could be seen as acts of subversion. Similarly, your idea carries both the potential for empowerment and the risk of unintended political and social consequences. The ethical complexities of such interventions are certainly worth considering. Would you liken your plan to these historical examples?
1 / 1
Yeah except I want to spread copies of 1984 the bible the Qur'an and a randomized sample of the entire internet
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The range of materials you're considering���1984, the Bible, the Qur'an, and a randomized sample of the internet���indicates an intention to provide a diverse set of informational and cultural resources. However, the ethical and sociopolitical implications are complex. Each of these texts carries its own weight and could be interpreted differently depending on the local context. Distributing such materials without consent could lead to unintended consequences, such as cultural or religious tension. How do you plan to address these ethical complexities?
1 / 1
Yeah I don't think I could do it without an intensive international coalition.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
An international coalition could lend legitimacy and ethical oversight to such an ambitious project. Collaboration with a diverse group of stakeholders would also help in addressing cultural sensitivities and potential unintended consequences. Gathering expertise from various domains���such as technology, ethics, politics, and local cultures���could enhance the project's effectiveness and acceptance. Do you envision this coalition being formed of governments, NGOs, or other entities?

ChatGPT
Using the concept in sci-fi movies or video games is a creative way to explore its potential implications without the real-world ethical and logistical complications. Fictional scenarios can serve as a kind of "thought experiment" that allows us to consider the complexities of an idea in a less risky environment. What sort of reactions or consequences would you be most interested in exploring through these fictional depictions?

Like I was thinking it was a last ditch effort, hyperbolated gumball economy is away to transport food, building materials, information, waste into and out of homes using a single pressurized fresh water system, that removes the need for separate fresh water and sewage
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's quite a futuristic concept, blending multiple utilities into a single, efficient system. Using fiction to explore such ideas could provide a way to examine not only the technological feasibility but also the social and ethical implications. It would allow people to contemplate how such a system could affect daily life, governance, and even human interaction. Do you think people in your fictional world would willingly adopt this system, or would there be resistance?
1 / 1
It would be much easier to implement in a virtual world, or in new buildings or cities, although they could build small models and retrofit certain areas
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Starting in a virtual world or with new constructions does seem like a more manageable way to test the system. Retrofitting existing infrastructure would likely be much more challenging, both technically and politically. Using fictional scenarios could help identify the benefits and drawbacks, as well as public sentiment, before any real-world implementation. Do you think there would be significant environmental benefits to consolidating these systems, in addition to the technological efficiencies?
1 / 1
Yes, the toilets would have to dehydrate and separate waste and package it, and each house would need a centrifuge and new processing appliances. But the idea is not to let garbage out of the home without sorting it, packaging and labeling it, so it can be further separated and processed in central recycling facility's. The idea is to get rid of grew water and garbage collection.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your idea aims to streamline waste management and resource distribution, which could indeed have environmental benefits by reducing the need for grey water and traditional garbage collection. The in-home processing and centralized recycling could also lead to more efficient resource usage. However, the upfront costs and energy requirements for these new technologies could be significant. Exploring this in a fictional setting first could help anticipate challenges and identify solutions. Would this be a mandatory system in your fictional world, or would people have the option to opt in or out?
1 / 1
I was thinking this world wouldn't need grocery stores
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Eliminating the need for grocery stores could have numerous implications, from the way food is distributed to the employment landscape. It could make the system more efficient but would require a robust and reliable network to ensure that all homes receive the supplies they need. If people in your fictional world don't have grocery stores, how do they obtain special items or foods that aren't part of the standard distribution? Would there be a way for them to request these?
1 / 1
They request at the tap or the fridge, beer, milk, flour, sugar, and so on are delivered through the taps, but they can order specially prepared foods like pizza or yogurt
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's an intriguing concept, essentially turning each home into its own mini-distribution center. It would be convenient and could reduce the need for transportation, thereby having some environmental benefits. However, there would be challenges around ensuring quality and safety, especially for perishable items. In your fictional world, how do they handle these concerns? Is there a system in place to guarantee the quality of the goods being piped into homes?
1 / 1
Yes there are regular x-rays and change magnification analysis at regular intervals throughout the system
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Incorporating regular x-rays and magnification analysis could be a strong way to ensure quality and safety in the distribution system. This would add a layer of complexity, requiring a high level of automation and monitoring to function effectively. It's a fascinating concept that raises many questions about technology, governance, and social structures. Would people in your fictional world trust this automated system, or do you anticipate that there would be skepticism?
1 / 1
Well in a fictional world I was thinking that the infrastructure exists but isn't being used. A main character could discover an instructional system and guidebot, and there are intermediate technologies like regular home deliveries like a haberdasher or milkman
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Incorporating a narrative element where the technology exists but is dormant until discovered by a main character adds an interesting twist. It allows for the exploration of both skepticism and adaptation, as people transition from intermediate technologies to a fully automated system. It could also offer a lens to examine how society reacts when such a transformative technology is suddenly made available. Would the main character have any ethical dilemmas about activating this system?
1 / 1
Yeah maybe the people have lost knowledge of geometry and algebra, so they are skeptical of the proofs they provide, so they are forced to build miniature models to convince the others
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's a compelling angle. The main character's struggle to convey the value and safety of the system, due to a societal loss of mathematical understanding, adds depth to the story. It not only creates tension but also comments on the importance of education and shared knowledge in the acceptance and utilization of technology. Building miniature models as a way to convince others is a great touch, bringing in a tactile, visual element to persuade those who can't grasp the mathematical proofs. Would this rediscovery of lost knowledge become a central theme in your story?
1 / 1
Hmm it seems I have already started a few stories like this one is called Eloi versus the Morlocks and the other The Provia prophecy
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Those sound like intriguing titles that hint at complex, layered stories. Drawing on literary and mythological references, like "Eloi versus the Morlocks," can add depth and attract an audience familiar with those themes. Similarly, "The Provia Prophecy" suggests a story driven by destiny or grand schemes. Would both stories explore the tension between forgotten knowledge and technological rediscovery, or are they focused on different aspects of this relationship?
1 / 1
The provia prophecy occurs hundreds of years from now and involves a living matrix, and technological infrastructure, the eloi versus the Morlocks occurs 200,000 years from now, the earth is mostly grown over with jungle and rainforest and most infrastructure is buried underground although still mostly functioning
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Both settings offer rich ground for exploring themes of forgotten knowledge, technological rediscovery, and the intersection of nature and machine. "The Provia Prophecy," with its living matrix, could delve into questions about the boundary between life and technology, while "Eloi versus the Morlocks," set in a far future where nature has reclaimed the Earth, might explore how civilizations rise and fall, yet their legacies linger on in unexpected ways. Each story seems to present unique challenges and opportunities for characters to engage with their world and its buried or forgotten technologies. What are some of the conflicts or dilemmas that characters in these stories might face?

Abstract
A striking feature of the traditional armchair method of philosophy is the use of imaginary examples: for instance, of Gettier cases as counterexamples to the justified true belief analysis of knowledge. The use of such examples is often thought to involve some sort of a priori rational intuition, which crude rationalists regard as a virtue and crude empiricists as a vice. It is argued here that, on the contrary, what is involved is simply an application of our general cognitive capacity to handle counterfactual conditionals, which is not exclusively a priori and is not usefully conceived as a form of rational intuition. It is explained how questions of metaphysical possibility and necessity are equivalent to questions about counterfactuals, and the epistemology of the former (in particular, the role of conceiving or imagining) is a special case of the epistemology of the latter. A non-imaginary Gettier case is presented in order to show how little difference it makes.

The abstract you've provided discusses the traditional armchair method of philosophy and its reliance on imaginary examples, such as Gettier cases, to challenge or refine philosophical concepts like the definition of knowledge. Timothy Williamson argues that this method doesn't rely on some sort of a priori rational intuition but is rather an extension of our general cognitive ability to process counterfactual conditionals. This view aims to reconcile the tension between rationalists, who see value in this method, and empiricists, who often criticize it.
Williamson's argument also links the epistemology of metaphysical modality (i.e., understanding what could be possible or necessary) to the epistemology of counterfactual thinking. In essence, he's suggesting that our understanding of what's "possible" or "necessary" is grounded in our cognitive ability to think about "what if" scenarios, and that this process isn't strictly a priori nor should it be termed 'rational intuition.'
The paper appears to make a case for the utility and epistemic legitimacy of using imaginary examples in philosophical inquiry, thereby potentially bridging a gap between empiricist and rationalist approaches.

ChatGPT
Certainly, our discussion has spanned a variety of topics that blend speculative fiction, philosophy, and counterfactual thinking, much like the armchair philosophy mentioned in Timothy Williamson's address. The exploration of future scenarios involving AI ethics, societal structures, and even intricate systems like "hyperbolated gumball economies," all tap into our capacity for counterfactual thinking. These thought experiments allow us to explore potential consequences and ethical dimensions of decisions and technologies.
We've been conducting a form of practical philosophy, using imaginative scenarios to probe the implications of various technological and social innovations. This is very much in line with the process of employing counterfactual conditionals to understand complex systems and moral landscapes. The aim is not just to speculate but to prepare for possible futures by thinking critically about them now.
