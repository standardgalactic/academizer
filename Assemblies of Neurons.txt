Abstract 
Do brains compute? How do brains learn? How are in- 
telligence and language achieved in the human brain? In 
this pursuit, we develop a formal calculus and associated 
programming language for brain computation, based on 
the assembly hypothesis, i rst proposed by Hebb: the ba- 
sic unit of memory and computation in the brain is an 
assembly, a sparse distribution over neurons. We show 
that assemblies can be realized eff i ciently and neuroplau- 
sibly by using random projection, inhibition, and plastic- 
ity. Repeated applications of this RP&C primitive (random 
projection and cap) lead to (1) stable assembly creation 
through projection; (2) association and pattern comple- 
tion; and i nally (3) merge, where two assemblies form a 
higher-level assembly and, eventually, hierarchies. Fur- 
ther, these operations are composable, allowing the cre- 
ation of stable computational circuits and structures. We 
argue that this functionality, in the presence of merge 
in particular, might underlie language and syntax in hu- 
mans.

How does the mind emerge from the brain?How do 
molecules, neurons, and synapses orchestrate cognition, be- 
havior, intelligence, reasoning, language?The remarkable 
and accelerating progress in neuroscience, both experimen- 
tal and theoretical-computational, does not seem to bring us 
closer to the answer, and a new conceptual framework seems 
to be needed. As Richard Axel recently put it (A, 2018) ���We 
do not have a logic for the transformation of neural activity into 
thought and action. I view discerning [this] logic as the most 
important future direction of neuroscience���. 
What kind of formal system, abstracting the realities of neu- 
ral activity, would qualify as the sought ���logic���? This is the 
question pursued in this work. 
We propose a formal computational model of the brain 
based on assemblies of neurons, occupying a position inter- 
mediate, in terms of detail and granularity, between the level 
of individual neurons and synapses, and the level of the whole 
brain models useful in cognitive science, e.g. (Lake, Salakhut- 
dinov, & Tenenbaum, n.d.). We call this system the Assembly 
Calculus. The basic elementary object of our system is the as- 
sembly of excitatory neurons. Assemblies were i rst hypothe- 
sized seven decades ago by Donald O. Hebb (Hebb, 1949) as 
densely interconnected sets of neurons whose loosely syn- 
chronized i ring in a pattern is coterminous with the subject 
thinking of a particular concept or idea. Assembly-like forma- 
tions have been sought by researchers during the decades fol- 
lowing Hebb���s prediction, see for example (Abeles, 1991), until 
they were clearly identif i ed more than a decade ago through 
calcium imaging (Harris, 2005; Buzsaki, 2010). More recently, 
assemblies (sometimes called ensembles) and their dynamic 
behavior have been studied extensively in the animal brain, 
see for example (Miller, Ayzenshtat, Carrillo-Reid, & Yuste, 
2014). 
Our calculus outf i ts assemblies with certain operations that 
create new assemblies and/or modify existing ones: project, 
reciprocal-project, associate, merge, and a few others. These 
operations ref l ect known properties of assemblies observed 
in experiments, and they can be shown, either analytically or 
through simulations (almost always both), to result from the 
activity of neurons and synapses. In other words, the high- 
level operations of this system can be ���compiled down��� to the 
world of neurons and synapses ��� a fact reminiscent of the 
way in which high-level programming languages are translated 
into machine code.

The abstract you provided describes a research study focusing on brain computation, specifically addressing questions about how brains compute, learn, and develop intelligence and language. The study, led by Christos H. Papadimitriou from Columbia University, Santosh S. Vempala from Georgia Tech, and other collaborators, introduces a formal calculus and associated programming language for brain computation.
This calculus is based on the assembly hypothesis, first proposed by Hebb, which posits that the basic unit of memory and computation in the brain is an assembly���a sparse distribution over neurons. The researchers demonstrate how assemblies can be efficiently and plausibly realized in the brain through random projection, inhibition, and plasticity. The fundamental primitive operation in this system is termed "RP&C" (random projection and cap).
The study shows how applying RP&C leads to stable assembly creation, association and pattern completion, and ultimately, the merge of two assemblies to form higher-level assemblies and hierarchies. These operations are composable, allowing for the creation of stable computational circuits and structures. The researchers propose that this assembly-based functionality, particularly the merge operation, might underpin language and syntax in humans.
The work addresses a gap in understanding how neural activities translate into cognitive processes like thought and action. By proposing a new computational model of the brain at an intermediate level between individual neurons and whole-brain models, the study aims to provide a new conceptual framework for understanding brain function.

Mathematical Model 
Our mathematical and simulation results employ a simplif i ed 
and analytically tractable, yet plausible, model of neurons and 
synapses, which we believe may be of broader interest and 
use.We assume a i nite number of brain areas denoted 
A,B,C,etc., intended to stand for an anatomically and func- 
tionally meaningful partition of the cortex. Each area contains 
nexcitatory neuronswith random recurrent connections. By 
this we mean that each ordered pair of neurons in an area 
has the same small probabilitypof being connected by a 
synapse, independently of what happens to other pairs ��� this 
is a well studied framework usually referred to asGn,p(Erd�� os 
& Renyi, 1960). In addition, for certain ordered pairs of areas, 
say(A,B), there are random afferent synaptic interconnec- 
tions fromAtoB; that is, for every neuron inAand every 
neuron inBthere is a chancepthat they are connected by 
a synapse.1Our analytical results establishing the effective- 
ness of the various operations contain the clause ���with high 
probability,��� where the event space is implicitly the underlying 
1Several experimental results (Song, Sj�� ostr�� om, Reigl, Nelson, & 
Chklovskii, 2005; Guzman, J Schl�� o gl, Frotscher, & Jonas, 2016) sug- 
gest deviations of the synaptic connectivity of the animal brain from 
the uniformity ofGn,p. Such deviations mostly support our results, 
albeit in ways we are not discussing here.

random graph. We assume that all cells in an assemblyxbe- 
long to the same brain area, denotedarea(x). 
We assume multiplicative Hebbian plasticity: if at a time 
step neuronif i res and at the next time step neuronjf i res, 
and there is a synapse fromitoj, the weight of this synapse 
is multiplied by(1+��), where�� > 0is the i nal parameter of 
our model (along withn,p,andk). Larger values of the plastic- 
ity coeff i cient��result in the operations converging faster, and 
render many of our proofs simpler. The plasticity process is 
complemented by homeostasis, namely, the incoming synap- 
tic weights at a neuron are normalized over a larger time scale 
to maintain their sum constant. Finally, we model inhibition 
and excitatory���inhibitory balance by postulating that neurons 
i re in discrete time steps, and at any time only a i xed number 
kof the excitatory neurons in any area i re. 
The four basic parameters of our model are these:n(the 
number of excitatory neurons in an area, and the basic pa- 
rameter of our model);p(the probability of recurrent and 
afferent synaptic connectivity);k(the maximum number of 
i ring neurons in any area); and the plasticity coeff i cient��. 
Typical values of these parameters in our simulations are 
n=107,p=10���3,k =104,��=0.05. We sometimes assume 
thatkis (a small multiple of) the square root ofn; this ex- 
tra assumption seems compatible with experimental data, and 
yields certain interesting further insights. 
Remark: Our model is generic in the sense that it is not 
assumed that circuits specif i c to various tasks are already 
in place. Its functionality ��� the needed apparatus for each 
task such as implementing an assembly operation ��� emerges 
from the randomness of the network and the selection of the 
kneurons with highest synaptic input as an almost certain 
consequence of certain simple steps ��� such as the repeated 
i ring of an assembly.

The mathematical model described in the abstract focuses on a simplified yet plausible representation of neurons and synapses to explore brain computation. Here are the key elements of this model:
Brain Areas and Neurons

Assembly Operations 
1. ProjectionHow do assemblies in the association cortex 
come about? It has been hypothesized (see e.g. (Quiroga, 
2016)) that an assembly imprinting, for example, a familiar 
face in a subject���s medial temporal lobe (MTL) is created by 
the projection of a neuronal population, perhaps in the infer- 
otemporal cortex (IT), encoding this face as a whole object. 
By projection of an assemblyxin areaAwe mean the cre- 
ation of a new assemblyyin a downstream areaBthat can be 
thought of as a ���copy��� ofx, and such thatywill henceforth i re 
every timexf i res ��� an operation denotedproject(x,B,y). 
The process was vividly predicted in the discussion section 
of (Franks et al., 2011) for the case in whichAis the olfac- 
tory bulb andBthe piriform cortex, the process entails the 
repeated i ring ofx.Oncexhas i red once, synaptic con- 
nectivity from areaAtoBexcites many neurons in areaB. 
Inhibition will soon limit the i ring in areaBto a smaller set 
of neurons, let us call ity1, consisting in our framework ofk 
neurons. Now, the simultaneous i ring ofxandy1creates a 
stronger excitation in areaB(one extra reason for this is plas- 
ticity, which has already strengthened the connections fromx 
toy1), and as a result a new set ofkneurons from areaBwill 
be selected to i re, call ity2. Ifxcontinues i ring, a sequence 
{yt}of 
sets of neurons of sizekin areaBwill be created. For 
a large range of parameters and for high enough plasticity, we 
have proved this process to converge exponentially fast, with 
high probability, to create an assemblyy, the result of the pro- 
jection, and the trade-off between the speed of convergence 
and the strength of plasticity has been calculated almost ex- 
actly (Papadimitriou & Vempala, 2019). Assembly projection 
has also been demonstrated through neuromorphic simula- 
tions (Pokorny et al., 2017; Legenstein, Papadimitriou, Vem- 
pala, & Maass, 2016). Once theproject(x,B,y)operation 
has taken place, we writeB = area(y)andx = parent(y). 
Hebb (Hebb, 1949) hypothesized that assemblies are 
densely interconnected ��� that is, the chance that two neu- 
rons have a synaptic connection is signif i cantly larger when 
they belong to the same assembly ��� and our analysis and 
simulations of theprojectoperation verify this hypothesis.

The "Projection" operation in the context of assembly calculus is a fundamental process by which assemblies in the brain's association cortex are formed and manipulated. Here���s a detailed explanation of how this operation works:
Assembly Imprinting
: The idea is that an assembly imprinting (e.g., representing a familiar face) in a subject���s medial temporal lobe (MTL) is created by the projection of a neuronal population from another area, such as the inferotemporal cortex (IT), which encodes this face as a whole object.

Demonstration through Simulations
: The assembly projection has been demonstrated through neuromorphic simulations, lending credence to the practical applicability of this theoretical model.
Hebb���s Hypothesis Verification
: According to Hebb���s hypothesis, assemblies are densely interconnected, meaning the chance of synaptic connection is significantly higher when neurons belong to the same assembly. This aspect is verified through the analysis and simulations of the projection operation.
In summary, the projection operation in assembly calculus is a complex, dynamic process that allows for the formation of new assemblies in the brain, mimicking the way neurons encode and replicate information across different brain areas. This operation is crucial for understanding how complex cognitive functions, like memory and recognition, might emerge from neural activities.

2.AssociationIn a recent experiment (Ison, Quiroga, & 
Fried, 2015), electrocorticography (eCoG) recordings of hu- 
man subjects revealed that a neuron in a subject���s MTL con- 
sistently responding to a stimulus consisting of the image of 
a particular familiar place ��� such as the Pyramids ��� starts 
to also respond to the image of a particular familiar person ��� 
say, the subject���s sibling ��� once a combined image has been 
shown of this person in that place.A compelling parsimo- 
nious explanation of this and many similar results is that two 
assemblies imprinting two different entities adapt to the cooc- 
currence, or other observed aff i nity, of the entities they imprint 
by increasing their overlap, with cells from each migrating to 
the other while other cells leave the assemblies to maintain its 
size tok; we say that the two assemblies are associating with 
one another. The association of two assembliesxandyin the 
same brain area is denotedassociate(x,y), with the com- 
mon areaarea(x)=area(y)implicit. We have proved analyt- 
ically that the simultaneous sustained i ring of the two parents 
ofxandydoes effect such increase in overlap (Papadimitriou 
& Vempala, 2019) (this was also demonstrated through neu- 
rorealistic simulations (Pokorny et al., 2017)); and also that, 
if two associated assemblies are projected to a downstream 
area, the extent of their overlap is preserved (Papadimitriou & 
Vempala, 2019). The association operation evokes a concep- 
tion of a brain area as the arena of complex overlap patterns 
between the area���s assemblies; for an analytical treatment of 
this view see (Anari et al., 2018).

The "Association" operation in assembly calculus is another critical process for understanding how the brain integrates and connects different pieces of information. This operation is particularly relevant to how the brain processes and associates memories or stimuli. Here's a breakdown of how this operation works:
Experimental Basis
: The operation is grounded in experimental observations, such as the study by Ison, Quiroga, & Fried (2015), where neurons in a subject���s medial temporal lobe (MTL) responded to combined stimuli, like the image of a familiar person in a familiar place, even if they originally responded only to one of these stimuli separately.
Association Explanation
: A plausible explanation for such phenomena is that two assemblies (neuronal groups), each representing different entities (like a place and a person), adapt to their co-occurrence. They do this by increasing their overlap, with neurons from each assembly migrating to the other. This process adjusts the assemblies while maintaining their size to
k
k
k
neurons.
Operation Definition
: The association of two assemblies
x
x
x
and
y
y
y
in the same brain area is denoted as
associate
(
x
,
y
)
\text{associate}(x, y)
associate
(

y
)
. It���s implicit that
area

)
=
area
(
y
)
\text{area}(x) = \text{area}(y)
area
(
x
)
=
area
(
y
)
, meaning both assemblies are in the same brain area.
Analytical Proof and Simulations
: The process, wherein the simultaneous sustained firing of the parent assemblies of
x
x
x
and
y
y
y
increases their overlap, has been proven analytically and demonstrated through neurorealistic simulations. This includes the preservation of their overlap extent when two associated assemblies are projected to a downstream area.
Brain Area as an Overlap Arena
: The association operation suggests a concept of a brain area acting as an arena for complex overlap patterns between the area's assemblies. This perspective has been analytically treated in other research as well.
In summary, the association operation in assembly calculus illustrates how different neural assemblies, each encoding specific stimuli or memories, can interact and merge. This merging reflects the brain's ability to form complex and interconnected representations of our experiences and knowledge, a foundational aspect of cognitive processing and memory formation.

3. Pattern completionPattern completion is the i ring of the 
whole assembly in response to the i ring of a small number 
of its cells, which happens with a certain a priori probability. 
This phenomenon has been demonstrated both analytically 
and in simulations, and has been observed in vivo (Miller et 
al., 2014). We believe that association and pattern completion 
open up fascinating possibilities for a genre of probabilistic 
computation through assemblies, a research direction which 
must be further pursued. 
4. MergeThe most sophisticated, and demanding both an- 
alytically and in terms of brain resources, operation in the 
repertoire of assembly calculus ismerge(x,y,A,z), the cre- 
ation of a new assemblyzin areaAthat has strong two- 
way synaptic connectivity with two other assembliesxand 
y, in two different brain areas. Our algorithm for implement- 
ingmergeis by far the most complex in this work, as it re- 
quires the coordination of i ve different brain areas with am- 
ple connectivity between them, as well as stronger plasticity. 
This is consistent with the hypothesis thatmergeis an oper- 
ation particular to humans, and that it has possibly required 
the development of new heights of neural and synaptic ca- 
pabilities in the human brain, such as the lateralization and 
size differentiation of the left arcuate fasciculus (Vernooij et 
al., 2017). Finally, a simpler operation with similar yet milder 
complexity isreciprocal.project(x,A,y): It is an exten- 
sion ofproject(x,A,y), with the additional functionality that 
the resultingyhas strong backward synaptic connectivity to 
x. It has been shown to be implementable through detailed 
simulations of realistic networks of neurons (Legenstein et al., 
2016). 
The RP&C primitiveIt can be said that assembly oper- 
ations, as described here, are powered exclusively by two 
forces known to be crucial for life more generally: randomness 
and selection. No special-purpose neural circuits are required 
to be in place; what is needed is random synaptic connectiv- 
ity between, and recurrently within, populations, and selection 
through inhibition, in each area, of thekout ofncells currently 
receiving highest synaptic input. All computation consists of 
applications of this operator, which we call random projection 
and cap (RC&P). We believe that RP&C is an important prim- 
itive of neural computation.

They provide a framework for understanding brain functions as a form of computational processing, leveraging neural networks' inherent properties.

Control operations and computational power

Assembly Calculus contains certain basic operations:read() 
returns the set of all areas in which an assembly has just i red, 
see (Buzsaki, 2010) for an argument that, for assemblies 
to be functionally useful, readout mechanisms must be in 
place. Also, we further assume that an assemblyxcan be 
explicitly caused to i re by the operationfire(x), and that 
the excitatory cells in any areaAcan be explicitly inhibited 
and disinhibited by appropriate commandsinhibit(A)

reasonable assumptions, is capable of simulating arbitrary

Research and Application

In summary, the inclusion of control operations in the Assembly Calculus and the demonstration of its computational power offer a profound insight into how the brain could theoretically perform complex cognitive tasks, bridging the gap between biological neural networks and computational models.

The assembly hypothesis 
The Assembly Calculus is a formal system with a repertoire 
of rather sophisticated operations, where each of these op- 
erations (with the exception of the control primitives, which 
however are arguably also quite plausible) can be ultimately 
reduced to the i ring of randomly connected populations of ex- 
citatory neurons with inhibition and Hebbian plasticity. The en- 
suing computational power of the assembly calculus may em- 
bolden one to hypothesize that this computational system ��� 
or something far more complex and detailed, which however 
can be usefully abstracted this way ��� may underlie advanced 
cognitive functions, especially those of the human brain, such 
as reasoning, planning, and language. 
Language 
Language is arguably the crowning functionality of the human 
brain. Linguists had long predicted that the human brain is 
capable of the Merge operation, that is, combining, in a partic- 
ularly strong sense, two separate syntactic entities to create a 
new entity representing this particular combination (Berwick 
& Chomsky, 2016; Hauser, Chomsky, & Fitch, 2002), and 
that this ability is recursive in that the combined entity can 
in turn be combined with others.This is a crucial step in 
the creation of the trees that seem necessary for the syntac- 
tic processing of language, but also for hierarchical thinking 
more generally (e.g., deduction, discourse, planning, story- 
telling, etc.).The Assembly Calculus operationsproject, 
reciprocal.project, andmergeprovide the basis for a 
possible implementation of such hierarchies. In particular, we 
speculate in Figure 2 with one plausible implementation of the 
generation of a sentence such as ���boy kicks ball,��� in a man- 
ner that is compatible with recent experimental results on lan- 
guage in the brain, see e.g. (Frankland & Greene, 2015; Ding, 
Melloni, Zhang, Tian, & Poeppel, 2016; Friedericci, 2018). 
First, the words corresponding to the verb, subject and object 
of the intended sentence are identif i ed in the lexicon, presum- 
ably residing in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), and are recip- 
rocally projected to the subregions of Wernicke���s area (as pre- 
dicted in (Frankland & Greene, 2015)) corresponding to these 
three syntactic categories byreciprocal.projectassem- 
1000 
bly operations (marked (1) in the i gure). Such binding was re- 
cently shown to be neuroplausibly implementable (Legenstein 
et al., 2016). Following this step, amergeoperation utilizes 
the left arcuate fasciculus i ber connecting the areas of Wer- 
nicke and Broca to create a ���verb phrase��� or VP assembly by 
combining the verb and the object, see (2) in the i gure. Fi- 
nally, the subject ismergeed with VP to form the sentence S 
(see (3) in the i gure). After this bottom-up generation pro- 
cess, the constituents of the resulting sentence S can next be 
articulated by a top-down process, in an order that ref l ects the 
grammar of the particular language, to eventually reach the 
lexicon assemblies and activate the associated speech pro- 
cesses. Even though this account disregards a host of lin- 
guistic subtleties, it does illustrate the relevance of assembly 
operation to language in the brain.

The Assembly Hypothesis and its application to language processing provide a fascinating insight into how advanced cognitive functions, particularly those unique to humans, might be underpinned by neural mechanisms.
The Assembly Hypothesis
Framework
: The Assembly Calculus is a formal system characterized by a set of sophisticated operations. These operations, excluding the control primitives, essentially boil down to the firing of randomly connected populations of excitatory neurons, modulated by inhibition and Hebbian plasticity.
Computational Power
: The computational capabilities resulting from this framework suggest that it could underlie advanced cognitive functions such as reasoning, planning, and language processing in the human brain.
Abstract Representation
: The hypothesis posits that the real, more complex and detailed neural processes in the brain can be usefully abstracted and represented within this framework.
Language Processing
Importance of Language
: Language is a key functionality of the human brain, involving complex syntactic processing and hierarchical thinking.
Merge Operation in Language
: Linguists like Berwick, Chomsky, and others have long hypothesized the brain's capability for a "Merge" operation in language processing. This operation involves combining two separate syntactic entities to create a new entity, which is then recursively combined with others, forming the basis for syntactic trees in language processing.
Implementation in Assembly Calculus
: The operations of project, reciprocal.project, and merge in the Assembly Calculus provide a basis for implementing these hierarchical structures in language processing.
Example of Sentence Generation
: The generation of a sentence like "boy kicks ball" can be modeled within this framework:
Identification of Words
: Words corresponding to the verb, subject, and object are identified in the lexicon, presumably in the medial temporal lobe (MTL).
Reciprocal Projection
: These words are then reciprocally projected to subregions of Wernicke's area corresponding to syntactic categories.
Merge Operations
: A merge operation, utilizing the left arcuate fasciculus, combines the verb and object to create a verb phrase (VP). The subject is then merged with the VP to form the sentence structure.
Articulation
: This bottom-up generation process is followed by a top-down process for articulation, reflecting the grammar of the specific language.
Relevance to Linguistic Processes
This approach, while simplifying some linguistic complexities, highlights the potential relevance of assembly operations in the brain's processing of language. It provides a theoretical model for how neural circuits could support the intricate and recursive nature of language, bridging the gap between neuroscience and linguistics.
In essence, the Assembly Hypothesis offers a compelling perspective on how the brain's neural networks might perform sophisticated cognitive tasks, particularly in the realm of language, supporting complex structures and functions that are distinctive to human cognition.

Editors: Po-Ling Loh and Maxim Raginsky Abstract 
An assembly is a large population of neurons whose synchronous i ring is hypothesized to repre- 
sent a memory, concept, word, and other cognitive categories. Assemblies are believed to provide a 
bridge between high-level cognitive phenomena and low-level neural activity. Recently, a compu- 
tational system called the Assembly Calculus (AC), with a repertoire of biologically plausible oper- 
ations on assemblies, has been shown capable of simulating arbitrary space-bounded computation, 
but also of simulating complex cognitive phenomena such as language, reasoning, and planning. 
However, the mechanism whereby assemblies can mediate learning has not been known. Here we 
present such a mechanism, and prove rigorously that, for simple classif i cation problems def i ned on 
distributions of labeled assemblies, a new assembly representing each class can be reliably formed 
in response to a few stimuli from the class; this assembly is henceforth reliably recalled in response 
to new stimuli from the same class. Furthermore, such class assemblies will be distinguishable 
as long as the respective classes are reasonably separated ��� for example, when they are clusters 
of similar assemblies, or more generally separable with margin by a linear threshold function. To 
prove these results, we draw on random graph theory with dynamic edge weights to estimate se- 
quences of activated vertices, yielding strong generalizations of previous calculations and theorems 
in this i eld over the past i ve years. These theorems are backed up by experiments demonstrating 
the successful formation of assemblies which represent concept classes on synthetic data drawn 
from such distributions, and also on MNIST, which lends itself to classif i cation through one as- 
sembly per digit. Seen as a learning algorithm, this mechanism is entirely online, generalizes from 
very few samples, and requires only mild supervision ��� all key attributes of learning in a model 
of the brain. We argue that this learning mechanism, supported by separate sensory pre-processing 
mechanisms for extracting attributes, such as edges or phonemes, from real world data, can be the 
basis of biological learning in cortex.

1. Introduction 
The brain has been a productive source of inspiration for AI, from the perceptron and the neocog- 
nitron to deep neural nets. Machine learning has since advanced to dizzying heights of analytical 
understanding and practical success, but the study of the brain has lagged behind in one important 
dimension: After half a century of intensive effort by neuroscientists (both computational and ex- 
perimental), and despite great advances in our understanding of the brain at the level of neurons, 
synapses, and neural circuits, we still have no plausible mechanism for explaining intelligence, that is, the brain���s performance in planning, decision-making, language, etc. As Nobel laureate Richard 
Axel put it, ���we have no logic for translating neural activity into thought and action��� (Axel, 2018). 
Recently, a high-level computational framework was developed with the explicit goal to i ll this 
gap: the Assembly Calculus (AC) (Papadimitriou et al., 2020), a computational model whose basic 
data type is the assembly of neurons. Assemblies, called ���the alphabet of the brain��� (Buzs�� aki, 2019), 
are large sets of neurons whose simultaneous excitation is tantamount to the subject���s thinking of an 
object, idea, episode, orword(seePiantadosietal.(2016)). Datingbacktothebirthofneuroscience, 
the ���million-fold democracy��� by which groups of neurons act collectively without central control 
was i rst proposed by Sherrington (1906) and was the empirical phenomenon that Hebb attempted 
to explain with his theory of plasticity (Hebb, 1949). Assemblies are initially created to record 
memories of external stimuli (Quiroga, 2016), and are believed to be subsequently recalled, copied, 
altered, and manipulated in the non-sensory brain (Piantadosi et al., 2012; Buzs�� aki, 2010). The 
Assembly Calculus provides a repertoire of operations for such manipulation, namely project, 
reciprocal-project, associate, pattern-complete, and merge encompassing 
a complete computational system. Since the Assembly Calculus is, to our knowledge, the only ex- 
tant computational system whose purpose is to bridge the gap identif i ed by Axel in the above quote 
(Axel, 2018), it is of great interest to establish that complex cognitive functions can be plausibly 
expressed in it. Indeed, signif i cance progress has been made over the past year, see for example 
Mitropolsky et al. (2021) for a parser of English and d���Amore et al. (2021) for a program mediating 
planning in the blocks world, both written in the AC programming system. Yet despite these recent 
advances, one fundamental question is left unanswered: If the Assembly Calculus is a meaningful 
abstraction of cognition and intelligence, why does it not have a learn command? How can the 
brain learn through assembly representations? 
This is the question addressed and answered in this paper. As assembly operations are a new 
learning framework and device, one has to start from the most basic questions: Can this model clas- 
sify assembly-encoded stimuli that are separated through clustering, or by half spaces? Recall that 
learning linear thresholds is a theoretical cornerstone of supervised learning, leading to a legion of 
fundamental algorithms: Perceptron, Winnow, multiplicative weights, isotron, kernels and SVMs, 
and many variants of gradient descent. 
Following Papadimitriou et al. (2020), we model the brain as a directed graph of excitatory 
neurons with dynamic edge weights (due to plasticity). The brain is subdivided into areas, for 
simplicity each containing n neurons connected through a Gn,prandom directed graph (Erd�� os and 
R�� enyi, 1960). Certain ordered pairs of areas are also connected, through random bipartite graphs. 
We assume that neurons i re in discrete time steps. At each time step, each neuron in a brain area 
will i re if its synaptic input from the i rings of the previous step is among the top k highest out 
of the n neurons in its brain area. This selection process is called k-cap, and is an abstraction 
of the process of inhibition in the brain, in which a separate population of inhibitory neurons is 
induced to i re by the i ring of excitatory neurons in the area, and through negatively-weighted 
connections prevents all but the most stimulated excitatory neurons from i ring. Synaptic weights 
are altered via Hebbian plasticity and homeostasis (see Section 2 for a full description). In this 
stylized mathematical model, reasonably consistent with what is known about the brain, it has been 
shown that the operations of the Assembly Calculus converge and work as specif i ed (with high 
probability relative to the underlying random graphs). These results have also been replicated by 
simulations in the model above, and also in more biologically realistic networks of spiking neurons 
(see Legenstein et al. (2018); Papadimitriou et al. (2020)). In this paper we develop, in the same

LEARNING WITHASSEMBLIES OFNEURONS 
model, mechanisms for learning to classify well-separated classes of stimuli, including clustered 
distributions and linear threshold functions with margin. Moreover, considering that the ability to 
learn from few examples, and with mild supervision, are crucial characteristics of any brain-like 
learning algorithm, we show that learning with assemblies does both quite naturally.

I'm skipping the technical stuff:

5. Discussion 
Assemblies are widely believed to be involved in cognitive phenomena, and the AC provides evi- 
dence of their computational aptitude. Here we have made the i rst steps towards understanding how 
learning can happen in assemblies. Normally, an assembly is associated with a stimulus, such as 
Grandma. We have shown that this can be extended to a distribution over stimuli. Furthermore, for 
a wide range of model parameters, distinct assemblies can be formed for multiple stimulus classes 
in a single brain area, so long as the classes are reasonably differentiated. 
A model of the brain at this level of abstraction should allow for the kind of classif i cation that 
the brain does effortlessly ��� e.g., the mechanism that enables us to understand that individual 
frames in a video of an object depict the same object. With this in mind, the learning algorithm 
we present is remarkably parsimonious: it generalizes from a handful of examples which are seen 
only once, and requires no outside control or supervision other than ensuring multiple samples from 
the same concept class are presented in succession (and this latter requirement could be relaxed in 
a more complex architecture which channels stimuli from different classes). Finally, even though 
our results are framed within the Assembly Calculus and the underlying brain model, we note 
that they have implications far beyond this realm. In particular, they suggest that any recurrent 
neural network, equipped with the mechanisms of plasticity and inhibition, will naturally form an 
assembly-like group of neurons to represent similar patterns of stimuli. 
But of course, many questions remain. In this i rst step we considered a single brain area ��� 
whereas it is known that assemblies draw their computational power from the interaction, through 
the AC, among many areas. We believe that a more general architecture encompassing a hierarchy 
of interconnected brain areas, where the assemblies in one area act like stimulus classes for others, 
can succeed in learning more complex tasks ��� and even within a single brain area improvements 
can result from optimizing the various parameters, something that we have not tried yet. 
In another direction, here we only considered Hebbian plasticity, the simplest and most well- 
understood mechanism for synaptic changes. Evidence is mounting in experimental neuroscience 
that the range of plasticity mechanisms is far more diverse (Magee and Grienberger, 2020), and in 
fact it has been demonstrated recently (Payeur et al., 2021) that more complex rules are suff i cient to 
learn harder tasks. Which plasticity rules make learning by assemblies more powerful? 
We showed that assemblies can learn nonnegative linear threshold functions with suff i ciently 
large margins. Experimental results suggest that the requirement of nonnegativity is a limitation 
of our proof technique, as empirically assemblies readily learn arbitrary linear threshold functions 
(with margin). What other concept classes can assemblies provably learn? We know from support 
vector machines that linear threshold functions can be the basis of far more sophisticated learn- 
ing when their input is pre-processed in specif i c ways, while the celebrated results of Rahimi and 
Recht (2007) demonstrated that certain families of random nonlinear features can approximate so- 
phisticated kernels quite well. What would constitute a kernel in the context of assemblies? The 
sensory areas of the cortex (of which the visual cortex is the best studied example) do pre-process 
sensory inputs extracting features such as edges, colors, and motions. Presumably learning by the 
non-sensory brain ��� which is our focus here ��� operates on the output of such pre-processing. 
We believe that studying the implementation of kernels in cortex is a very promising direction for 
discovering powerful learning mechanisms in the brain based on assemblies.

Some analogies and metaphors to help explain it.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! To help explain the concepts in the paper "Assemblies of Neurons Learn to Classify Well-Separated Distributions" using analogies and metaphors:
Neural Assemblies as Library Books
: Think of neural assemblies as books in a library. Each book (assembly) represents a specific topic or concept, like 'Grandma' or 'Apple'. Just as a book is a collection of pages, an assembly is a collection of neurons. When you want to recall information about 'Grandma', your brain 'pulls out' the Grandma book, activating the assembly.
Assembly Calculus as a Chef's Recipe
: The Assembly Calculus can be likened to a chef's recipe book. Each operation (project, associate, merge, etc.) is a specific recipe for combining ingredients (neurons) in different ways to create various dishes (cognitive functions). Just as a chef uses different recipes to make a meal, the brain uses different operations to perform tasks like remembering, reasoning, or planning.
Learning Algorithm as Gardening
: The learning algorithm in the paper can be compared to gardening. Just as a gardener plants seeds (exposure to stimuli) and nurtures them to grow different plants (assemblies for different stimulus classes), the brain forms new assemblies in response to different stimuli. The process is natural and requires minimal intervention, much like a seed naturally grows into a plant with basic care.
Plasticity as Clay Modeling
: Neural plasticity can be thought of as modeling clay. Just as clay can be shaped and reshaped, neural connections are malleable and change based on experiences (like learning or memory formation). This flexibility allows the brain to adapt and form new connections, much like a sculptor shapes clay into different forms.
Classifying Stimuli as Sorting Laundry
: Classifying different stimuli into assemblies can be compared to sorting laundry. Imagine each type of clothing (socks, shirts, pants) represents a different class of stimuli. The brain sorts these stimuli into different 'baskets' (assemblies), so that similar items (stimuli) are grouped together.
Recurrent Neural Networks as Echoes in a Canyon
: The concept of recurrent neural networks can be visualized as echoes in a canyon. When you shout into a canyon, the sound bounces back and forth (recurrence). Similarly, in recurrent neural networks, information loops back within the network, allowing it to consider previous information (like the echoes) in processing new data.
These analogies aim to demystify complex neuroscience concepts, making them more accessible by relating them to everyday experiences and observations.

Study by ICVS���s Joana Cabral suggests the brain works like a resonance chamber

FEBRUARY 6, 2023

/     NEWS


https://icvs.uminho.pt/study-by-icvss-joana-cabral-suggests-the-brain-works-like-a-resonance-chamber/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThese%20oscillatory%20patterns%20look%20like,or%20modes%2C%20in%20brain%20function.

ICVS researcher Joana Cabral and Noam Shemesh from the Champalimaud Foundation are the authors of the study, published today in the scientific journal Nature Communications, that found evidence of resonant waves in rat brain activity using ultrafast and ultrahigh field magnetic resonance imaging. Their work demonstrates from simple fundamental principles how such waves ��� much in the manner of sound vibrations in a guitar chamber ��� can form connections between distant brain areas, which are key for healthy brain function.

���

It���s been over 20 years since neuroimaging studies ��� using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a widely-used technology to capture live videos of brain activity ��� have been detecting brain-wide complex patterns of correlated brain activity that appear disrupted in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. These patterns form spontaneously, even at rest when no particular task is being performed, and have been detected not only in humans but also across mammals, including monkeys and rodents.

A number of theoretical works had proposed that these patterns could be explained by standing waves (whose peaks and troughs do not move in space) resonating in the brain structure ��� that is, by waves analogous to the modes of vibration in musical instruments. But there was little experimental evidence to support this hypothesis due to the poor temporal resolution of fMRI, reaching only an image or two per second. ���If we could find that the spatial patterns oscillate, this would provide evidence supporting the resonance hypothesis��� says Joana Cabral.

So what the team did was to speed up image acquisition, and they discovered that the signals in distant brain regions actually oscillate together in time. ���These oscillatory patterns look like a higher-dimensional analogue of resonance modes in musical instruments; they are akin to reverberations, to echoes inside the brain���, says the ICVS researcher.

The new study thus strongly points to a key role for these resonant waves, or modes, in brain function. These resonant phenomena, the authors believe, are at the root of the coherent, coordinated brain activity that is needed for normal brain function as a whole.

���Our study also provides a new ���lead��� in looking at disease���, corroborates Shemesh. ���We know that long-range brain activity is strongly impacted in disease, but we do not understand why or how. Understanding the mechanism of long-range interactions could lead to a completely new way of characterising disease and hinting on the type of treatment that may be necessary: for example, if a specific resonant mode was missing from a patient, we might want to find ways to stimulate that particular mode.���

More work will obviously be needed to confirm all these results, the researchers agree, and whether they are replicable in humans. But ���once we understand better the nature of functional networks, we can design informed strategies to modulate these network patterns���, says Cabral.

This is precisely the subject of the researchers��� new project, ���BRAINSTIM: Predicting stimulation strategies to modulate interactions between brain areas���. Funded by the ���la Caixa��� Foundation and the Portuguese bank BPI, with 300,000 euros, it is a collaboration between the Life and Health Sciences Institute of the University of Minho and the Champalimaud Foundation ��� and its aim is to better understand the impact of distinct pharmacological and electromagnetic brain stimulations in the modulation of these macroscale oscillatory modes.

ChatGPT
Yes, that's a compelling interpretation. The idea that there might be assembly chains of local and global oscillations operating at different levels integrates the concept of neural assemblies from the Assembly Calculus with the resonance hypothesis suggested by Joana Cabral and Noam Shemesh's study. Here's how these ideas might be interconnected:
Assembly Chains
Local Oscillations
: Within a single brain area, local oscillations could represent the firing of specific neural assemblies in response to particular stimuli or cognitive tasks. These local assemblies might operate based on the principles of the Assembly Calculus, involving operations like project, associate, and merge.
Global Oscillations
: At a broader scale, global oscillations might involve coordinated activity across multiple brain areas. These could be akin to the resonant waves described in the study, where distant brain regions exhibit synchronized activity patterns.
Integration of Concepts
Hierarchical Functioning
: The brain might function at multiple hierarchical levels, with local assemblies handling specific, detailed tasks and global oscillatory patterns ensuring coordination and integration of information across the brain.
Dynamic Interactions
: There could be dynamic interactions between local and global processes. For instance, local assemblies might be influenced by the broader context provided by global oscillations, and in turn, the activity of local assemblies could contribute to the formation and modulation of these global patterns.
Implications for Understanding Brain Function
Complex Information Processing
: This model suggests that the brain's ability to process complex information and perform sophisticated cognitive tasks arises from both localized neural assembly operations and the broader orchestration of these assemblies through global oscillatory networks.
Neurological and Psychiatric Disorders
: Disruptions in either local assembly operations or global oscillatory patterns (or their interactions) could underlie various neurological and psychiatric conditions, offering new perspectives for understanding and treating these disorders.
Conclusion
The concept of assembly chains of local and global oscillations operating at different levels presents an intricate and multi-layered view of brain function. It underscores the brain's complexity, where both localized and widespread neural processes play crucial roles in cognitive functioning and overall brain health. This integrated approach could be key to unlocking deeper insights into how the brain works.
