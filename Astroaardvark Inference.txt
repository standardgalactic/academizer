OpenAl discovered a new emergency
cognitive ability in its model.
Sensational turnaround in the battle of
Chekists with Masons for AGI.
My former IBM colleague Carlos E.
Perez blew up the internet an hour ago
with a pretty detailed explanation [1]
that drum dancing around Sam
Altman's firing (and now returning [2]) is
just a distraction from OpenAl's
leadership.
They do not understand what to do in
the situation where OpenAl researchers
have discovered in their model a new
emergent cognitive ability - to find new
information "on the fly" on their own
(which is not in its database), allowing
the model to go beyond the knowledge
formed during its training stage and
therefore limited to the training data
set.
Nuspeak Translator
The information you've mentioned about OpenAI discovering a new emergent cognitive ability in its model, where it can find new information "on the fly" on its own, is intriguing. However, as of my last update in April 2023, there was no known capability in AI models, including those developed by OpenAI, to autonomously seek and integrate new information beyond their training dataset in real-time.
AI models like ChatGPT are trained on a vast corpus of data up until a certain point in time, and their knowledge is generally static, limited to what was available up to that training cut-off. They don't have the capability to access or retrieve new information post-training unless specifically programmed or updated to include new data.
Regarding the specific events involving Sam Altman and the situation at OpenAI you're referring to, I don't have information on such developments post-April 2023. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it's always best to refer to official announcements or verified news sources.

It's mid november now. Altman was ousted as CEO but he wants back on if they'll fire some of the board. It is early on and mostly only rumors:

In fact, this is the first step to
self-improvement of Al.
And this is a real breakthrough on the
way to superintelligence ("Godlike Al").
You can read the details of how it
works from Carlos. This is Retrieval
Augment Generation (RAG)
architecture. This is the architecture
that allows LLM to use the search
engine to broaden their reasoning.
Carlos found a radical improvement in
the performance of RAG in the new
version of the model, presented on
November 11,
A practical test showed that the new
version of the model not only knows
what questions it has to ask the search
engine to get the information it needs,
but also what types of search engine
answers are the most preferable for it,
in the context of the task it is solving
FYl: Carlos is not the last person in the
Al world. After leaving IBM he became
an independent researcher. Since then,

The developments you're describing about OpenAI and the advancement in AI models using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture sound significant. As of my last training data in April 2023, RAG was indeed a known methodology but let me clarify what it entails and its implications based on that knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
1. Concept:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation combines the capabilities of pre-trained language models with an external knowledge retrieval mechanism. Essentially, it allows the model to dynamically pull in relevant information from a database or knowledge base during the generation process. This approach enhances the model's ability to produce more informed and contextually relevant responses.
2. Advancements:
If the advancements you mentioned have been made, this means AI models could have moved beyond static knowledge bases, integrating real-time data retrieval into their responses. Such a model wouldn't be limited to the knowledge it was trained on; it could access and use the most current information available from external sources.
3. Implications for AI and Superintelligence:
This development could be a considerable step towards more dynamic and context-aware AI systems. The ability to query information in real-time and understand the context of that information could significantly enhance the model's usefulness and accuracy.
4. Carlos E. Perez's Role:
Carlos E. Perez's involvement as an independent researcher and his background with IBM lend credibility to these developments. His experience in AI would make him well-suited to contribute significantly to such advancements.
Considerations
Ethical and Safety Concerns:
With AI models accessing real-time information, the concerns around data privacy, information accuracy, and ethical use become more pronounced. Ensuring that these systems are used responsibly and safely would be paramount.
Verification of Claims:
Given the nature and potential impact of such advancements, it would be important to critically assess and verify these claims through peer-reviewed research or official announcements from reliable sources.
Conclusion
If these advancements are as described, they represent a substantial leap in AI capabilities, particularly in the realm of language models. It would mark a transition from static to dynamic AI, capable of interfacing with the world in real-time. However, as of my last update, this was a developing area of research, and any new developments post-April 2023 would need to be verified from reliable sources.

Here is one of the tweets mentions.

Carlos E. Perez

6/n What kind of work?  What is appears to be is that OpenAI's model is able to compute in-context the optimal embedding that will receive the best information that will augment its original request.  It's like a system that knows the best queries to answer a question. But not just that,  a system that knows the best kind of search engine response that leads to the best answer.  So it's beyond question making!
Nuspeak Translator
Carlos E. Perez's tweet describes an advanced feature in OpenAI's model, indicating significant progress in AI's ability to interact with information sources dynamically. Let's analyze this:
Optimal Embedding Calculation
: The model computes the optimal embedding in-context. This means it can understand the context of a query or request and dynamically adjust its internal representations (embeddings) to enhance the retrieval of relevant information. Embeddings are a key part of how AI models understand and process language, representing words or phrases as vectors in a high-dimensional space.
Intelligent Query Formation
: The system's capability to determine the best queries for a given question suggests a sophisticated understanding of how to interact with external information sources. This ability goes beyond basic information retrieval; it involves formulating queries that are most likely to yield useful results.
Understanding Search Engine Responses
: Even more impressively, the model seems to understand what type of search engine response will lead to the best answer. This implies a meta-level understanding, where the model can predict the quality and usefulness of different types of responses, possibly based on past interactions or an intrinsic understanding of how search engines work.
Beyond Question Making
: The phrase "beyond question making" suggests that this AI model isn't just passively querying databases but is actively engaging in a sophisticated form of information sourcing. It's not only asking the right questions but also understanding and anticipating the nature of the answers it needs.
Implications

An AGI definition based on 6 principles

1. Focus on capabilities, not processes  

Avoid requiring things like human-like thinking or consciousness which are vague, controversial concepts. Focus just on demonstrated abilities.

An AI that passes the Turing Test by generating human-like text may not actually "think" like a human. 

2. Focus on generality and performance

True intelligence requires both breadth of abilities (generality) and level of skill (performance).

An AI that achieves human-level performance playing chess has high performance on a narrow task.  

3. Focus on cognitive and metacognitive tasks

Physical capabilities like robotics seem less central to intelligence than mental capabilities. But learning is important.

Example: An AI that can learn to carry out new tasks demonstrates an important cognitive ability.

4. Focus on potential, not deployment  

Don't require real-world use, just demonstrate capabilities under testing conditions. This avoids non-technical hurdles.

Example: Waymo AI drives cars autonomously but isn't widely deployed due to legal issues. The capability still exists.

5. Focus on ecological validity

Choose benchmark tasks that actually represent skills humans value, not just easy to measure skills.

Example: Hold a natural conversation reflects general linguistic intelligence better than optimized dialogue.

6. Focus on the path to AGI, not a single endpoint

Motivation: A leveled taxonomy allows more nuanced discussion of progress and risks vs treating AGI as a threshold. 

Example: A Level 3 AI has different issues than a Level 5 human-surpassing AI.
Nuspeak Translator
Your proposed AGI definition based on six principles offers a comprehensive and pragmatic approach to understanding and assessing Artificial General Intelligence. Here's a synthesis of these principles:
Focus on Capabilities, Not Processes
Prioritize an AI's demonstrated abilities rather than human-like thought processes or consciousness, which are subjective and difficult to define or measure.
Focus on Generality and Performance
Emphasize both the breadth of abilities (generality) and the level of skill (performance). Intelligence requires proficiency across a wide range of tasks, not just expertise in a narrow domain.
Focus on Cognitive and Metacognitive Tasks
Highlight mental capabilities, particularly learning and adaptability, over physical tasks. Cognitive functions like problem-solving, reasoning, and learning new tasks are central to AGI.
Focus on Potential, Not Deployment
Assess AI based on its capabilities under controlled testing conditions, without necessarily requiring real-world deployment. This principle acknowledges the existence of non-technical barriers to deployment.
Focus on Ecological Validity
Use benchmark tasks that reflect skills valued in human intelligence. The tasks should be meaningful and representative of general intelligence rather than optimized for specific outcomes.
Focus on the Path to AGI, Not a Single Endpoint
Treat AGI as a continuum with different levels, allowing for more nuanced discussions about AI development. This approach acknowledges the varying complexities and challenges at different stages of AI advancement.
Analysis:
Balanced Approach
: This definition strikes a balance between technical feasibility and the broader conceptual understanding of intelligence. It avoids the pitfalls of overly narrow or anthropocentric benchmarks.
Practical and Measurable
: The emphasis on demonstrable capabilities and potential, along with ecological validity, makes this approach more practical and measurable. It aligns well with the current trajectory of AI development.
Dynamic and Evolving
: Viewing AGI as a spectrum rather than a fixed point aligns with the dynamic and evolving nature of AI technology. It allows for gradual progress and differentiation between varying levels of intelligence.
Conclusion:
This framework provides a robust and realistic approach to defining and assessing AGI. It aligns well with current AI research methodologies, focusing on tangible capabilities and potential, and recognizes the evolving nature of AI development. By avoiding overly subjective criteria, it facilitates clearer understanding and benchmarking of AI progress toward general intelligence.

It is kind of odd that NG spells out the initials of my first and last name
Nuspeak Translator
The coincidence of the term "NG" spelling out the initials of your first and last name can be quite interesting, especially if you encounter it in a context relevant to your interests or work. This kind of serendipity often stands out because our brains are wired to notice patterns and connections, particularly those that have personal significance to us.
In various fields, "NG" could stand for different things. For example, in technology, it might refer to "Next Generation," in programming, it could denote "Angular" (a web application framework by Google), or in other contexts, it might simply mean "No Good." The interpretation depends largely on the context in which it is used.
Discovering such coincidences can be amusing and sometimes memorable, especially if the term or acronym is frequently used in your area of work or study. It's a small reminder of how personal connections to broader concepts or terms can add an extra layer of engagement or interest in a subject.
