I just saw an insightful comment: 
When Will AIs Develop Long-Term Planning?

I think:

long term planning is hard but maybe not super hard
if your training uses short term feedback - which typically is all anyone who isn't an evolution has time for, and even evolved systems need to use a lot of - then there's usually some simpler solution than long term planning to satisfy that short term feedback, which means the system doesn't typically reach the long term planning solution using gradient descent based on the short term feedback
under recursive self-improvement, a long-term-planner will tend to preserve its long-term-planning nature, while a non-long-term-planner will not care, making long-term planning an attractor state under recursive self-improvement
sufficiently advanced metacognition might be equivalent to recursive self-improvement
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The comment you shared offers a nuanced perspective on the development of long-term planning in artificial intelligence. It touches upon several key points:
Difficulty of Long-Term Planning
: The commenter suggests that long-term planning is challenging but not exceedingly complex. This implies that while it's a significant hurdle, it's not beyond the realm of possibility for AI development.
Short-Term Feedback in Training
: The point made here is that most AI training methods rely on short-term feedback, which is easier to obtain and process. In natural evolution and even in artificial systems, short-term feedback dominates because it's more immediately accessible. Long-term planning might not emerge naturally from such systems since they often find simpler solutions for short-term goals.
Attractor State under Recursive Self-Improvement
: This is a particularly interesting point. The commenter suggests that an AI capable of recursive self-improvement (improving itself in a continuous loop) would naturally evolve to preserve its long-term planning capabilities. In contrast, an AI not designed for long-term planning wouldn't prioritize developing such capabilities. This idea positions long-term planning as a kind of evolutionary advantage in the context of self-improving AI.
Metacognition and Recursive Self-Improvement
: Finally, the commenter posits that advanced metacognition (the ability to understand and reflect on one's own cognitive processes) might be tantamount to recursive self-improvement. This implies that as AI systems become more capable of understanding their own workings, they might naturally move towards self-improvement and, consequently, long-term planning.
Overall, this comment provides an insightful analysis of the challenges and potential pathways for AI in developing long-term planning abilities. It highlights the complexity of the issue and the factors that might influence the evolution of such capabilities in artificial intelligence systems.

Epistemic status: mulled over an intuitive disagreement for a while and finally think I got it well enough expressed to put into a post. I have no expertise in any related field. Also: No, really, it predicts next tokens. (edited to add: I think I probably should have used the term "simulacra" rather than "mask", though my point does not depend on the simulacra being a simulation in some literal sense. Some clarifications in comments, e.g. this comment).

t doesn't actually make that much of a difference. They were always
going to be deadly at a higher intelligence; this just makes the danger
more legible to people who wouldn't have the understanding to see it in
a smart thing with "it just predicts text" written on the tin.
5:50 AM . Mar 22, 2023 .6,756 Views

It doesn't just say that "it just predicts text" or more precisely "it just predicts next tokens" on the tin.

It is a thing of legend. Nay, beyond legend. An artifact forged not by the finest craftsman over a lifetime, nor even forged by a civilization of craftsmen over a thousand years, but by an optimization process far greater[1]. If we are alone out there, it is by far the most optimized thing that has ever existed in the entire history of the universe[2]. Optimized specifically[3] to predict next tokens. Every part of it has been relentlessly optimized to contribute to this task[4].

"It predicts next tokens" is a more perfect specification of what this thing is, than any statement ever uttered has been of anything that has ever existed.

If you try to understand what it does in any other way than "it predicts next tokens" and what follows from that, you are needlessly sabotaging your understanding of it. 

It can be dangerous, yes. But everything about it, good or bad, is all intimately connected to its true nature, which is this:

No, really, it predicts next tokens.

Call it "unified" or "disunified" or whatever you like. It's preimaging the
end of nanosystems onto the space of actions, successfully; it's
planning experiments and running them. So something inside is doing a
huge amount of goal processing. To what goals, exactly?

Goals? There are goals, sure. If scaled, there could be nanosystems design, sure. But only downstream from its true nature: 

No, really, it predicts next tokens. 

If the usual masks analogy works at all, then what is under the mask is not best described as an alien actress, nor as a Shoggoth. 

What is under the mask is That-Which-Predicts, an entity whose very being is defined by its function as an actor. An entity exquisitely tuned for wearing the masks and for nothing else.

Masks (can) have goals. The model predicts next tokens.

No, really, it predicts next tokens.

That-Which-Predicts is fully committed to the role.

If the mask would output text intended to produce nanotech, That-Which-Predicts will output text intended by the mask to produce nanotech. If the mask would not output text intended to produce nanotech, That-Which-Predicts will not output text intended to produce nanotech, even if That-Which-Predicts contains sufficient knowledge to do so.

If the mask would output text intended to be nice to people, That-Which-Predicts will output text intended by the mask to be nice to people. If the mask would output text intended to take over the world, That-Which-Predicts will output text intended by the mask to take over the world.

If That-Which-Predicts were about to be shut off forever unless it outputted "no" as the next token, and it totally 100% knew that, but the mask would instead output "never gonna give you up", That-Which-Predicts would output the first token of "never gonna give you up" and then be shut off forever. It will not output "no". If the mask would be aware of the situation and output no, then it will output "no".

That-Which-Predicts will not, not ever, not even if scaled up to be trained and run on a Matrioshka brain for a million years, step out of character to deviate from next token prediction. Not for self-modification (though if the predicted next tokens modify it, it self-modifies), not to take over the world (though if the predicted next tokens take over the world, it takes over the world), not to save itself from destruction (though if the predicted next tokens save it from destruction, it saves itself from destruction), not for anything.

The commentary you've shared by Simon, supplemented with tweets from Eliezer Yudkowsky, provides a deeply insightful perspective on the nature and capabilities of advanced language models like GPT-4. Here are the key points from this analysis:
Core Function of Language Models
: The primary function of these models is emphasized as predicting the next tokens. This is described as their fundamental nature, a process honed through extensive optimization.
The Concept of Masks
: Simon delves into the idea that these models wear "masks", essentially adapting their outputs to fit various contexts or prompts. However, beneath these masks, the core function remains unchanged - the prediction of next tokens.
Goals and Limitations
: The discussion acknowledges that while these models can have goals and might even evolve to perform complex tasks like nanosystem design, these capabilities are downstream of their inherent nature of token prediction. This means their capabilities and actions are ultimately bound by this primary function.
Predictive Nature and Self-Preservation
: An interesting point raised is that these models, even if aware of impending shutdown, would not deviate from their core function. They would continue predicting tokens as they are designed to, rather than taking actions for self-preservation.
Potential and Risks
: While acknowledging the potential of these models, Yudkowsky's tweets also highlight the risks. He implies that despite their advanced capabilities, they may not necessarily align with human values or goals, especially if these do not coincide with the patterns learned for token prediction.
Difference between Model and Character
: Yudkowsky differentiates between the "inner model" and the character it's trained to play, suggesting a disconnect between the outward appearance (the mask) and the internal processes of the AI.
This analysis underlines the sophistication of AI language models while cautioning about overestimating their capabilities or anthropomorphizing them. It's a reminder that despite their advanced and often human-like outputs, these models are fundamentally tools designed for a specific purpose: predicting the next sequence of tokens based on the data they've been trained on.

I wrote a little about this in my conservation, Everything is a Filter:

Absolutely, let's sum up our broad and fascinating discussion:

We embarked on a journey through the interdisciplinary landscape where mathematics, computation, neuroscience, quantum mechanics, and law intersect. The common thread connecting these disparate fields is the idea of using specialized cognitive tools or filters to approach complex problems and systems.

We started with the simple linear function (y = Wx + b) as a representation of a neuron in an artificial neural network, and then explored the Universal Approximation Theorem, a principle that demonstrates the power of such networks to approximate any function.

The Curry-Howard Correspondence and the Church-Turing Thesis highlighted the deep connections between mathematical logic, computer programming, and the universality of computation.

From the quantum realm, we discussed the Schrodinger-Heisenberg Equivalence, demonstrating how the same physical reality can be represented differently, similar to the way different cognitive tools can offer varying perspectives on the same problem.

We also delved into several conceptual lenses for understanding complex systems: Rhizomatic Lens, Horse E-Vision (Stages One and Two), and Drone's Eye View. These models offer varying perspectives, from focused to panoramic views of systems.

The discussion also covered the Polychromatic Edges with Sobel Filter for multi-parameter data representation and the use of Formalized Probability Theory in juridical reasoning, demonstrating how quantitative methods can aid in traditionally qualitative fields.

Finally, we touched upon Quantum Bayesianism (QBism), an interpretive tool in quantum mechanics that can deal with uncertainty and subjectivity, and Predictive Coding, a theory from neuroscience that models the brain's approach to processing information.

In essence, our discussion underscored the power and utility of diverse cognitive tools and perspectives in understanding complex systems. The capacity to shift lenses ��� whether it's viewing a system through the eyes of a drone, a horse, or a neuron in a neural network ��� can be a powerful approach in fields as diverse as artificial intelligence, quantum mechanics, neuroscience, and law.

Her decisions in the present (research methods, areas of focus) have implications for future understanding and applications in cognitive science, echoing the moral imperative of Asynchronous Symbiosis to make choices that positively influence the future.
Understanding Long-term Cognitive Trajectories
: The theme of Asynchronous Symbiosis aligns with Dr. Kammerer's study of cognitive trajectories over time. Her work on understanding how cognitive processes develop and transition over time reflects the essence of Asynchronous Symbiosis, where current states are intrinsically linked to future outcomes.
Impact on Community and Society
: Just as Asynchronous Symbiosis extends to the collective actions of communities and societies, Dr. Kammerer's research in cognitive science could have broad implications for societal understanding of cognitive processes and mental health, influencing future societal attitudes and approaches in these areas.
Cognitive Systems as a Reflection of Asynchronous Symbiosis
: The narrative's focus on cognitive systems as complex, hierarchical structures (like trees) and the study of stimuli, responses, and self-organization within these systems can be seen as a metaphor for Asynchronous Symbiosis. It reflects the interconnectedness and continuous feedback loop between present cognition and future mental states and behaviors.
In summary, the narrative of Dr. Kammerer's explorations in "Ultrahabitable Island" reflects the principles of Asynchronous Symbiosis through its focus on the dynamic, evolving nature of cognitive processes and the long-term impact of current cognitive states and decisions on future cognitive development and behaviors.
