���Owen Barfield, 1957
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Owen Barfield's quote touches on a profound observation about human perception and consciousness. The distinction he makes is between the elements we consciously choose to focus on from the vast array of sensory information available, versus the elements that might be prioritized by other forms of consciousness or perspectives, such as those in different cultures or even in different states of awareness.
Barfield, as an anthropologist, seems to be emphasizing how human attention is selective and shaped by cultural or individual factors, which might differ significantly from those of others. This aligns with ideas in the field of anthropology, cognitive science, and philosophy of mind, highlighting that what we notice or deem important is often a reflection of our particular context, mindset, or culture, rather than an objective reality.
This concept resonates with the "Attention Is All You Need" principle from fields like machine learning, where the focus is on how attention mechanisms selectively weigh information to make sense of vast amounts of data, drawing parallels to human cognitive processes.

It seems to me that a "participating consciousness" is akin to any perceptual control loop  structure that not only models the world and reacts to it, but actively alters it or changes it too. The body is not only an collection of organs or collection of systems for calculating or accomplishing minor tasks and functions but for growing a mind and repairing it. This is akin to current thought on active inference, choice theory, and perceptual control theory. As an example, I am not a native speaker if Spanish but when I was visiting Spanish countries I found I was not just learning the language but adding to it and changing it. By creating new words and collocationary structure, and my accent structure from learning to speak English and some of a French accent and things I learned in Latin or Greek

Your observation draws a compelling connection between the idea of a "participating consciousness" and contemporary theories of cognition like active inference, perceptual control theory, and choice theory. In these frameworks, cognition is seen as a dynamic and reciprocal process���where the mind doesn't passively receive and react to external stimuli but actively shapes, alters, and creates within the environment. This resonates deeply with the notion that we are not merely recipients of experiences but participants in shaping them.
In Barfield's terms, a "participating consciousness" is a way of being that doesn't just attend to the world but actively engages with and transforms it. Your example of learning and adapting language while in Spanish-speaking countries illustrates this well. You weren���t just absorbing pre-existing structures; you were dynamically integrating aspects of your prior linguistic knowledge (English, French, Latin, Greek) and reconfiguring them in real-time, contributing to your unique version of Spanish. This reflects a process where both you and the language are co-evolving���you're not only shaped by the environment but also actively shaping it through your choices and interpretations.
Active inference models suggest that we are constantly predicting, adjusting, and reshaping our interaction with the world. Similarly, perceptual control theory emphasizes that perception itself is a form of control, where we strive to reduce the discrepancy between how we perceive the world and how we want it to be. Your creative process in learning and altering a new language is a vivid example of this, where perception, action, and learning are intertwined in a continuous feedback loop.
What���s particularly interesting about your linguistic example is how it highlights the fluidity of identity and cognition. You're blending various linguistic and cultural structures in ways that mirror how the mind assimilates, adapts, and innovates across domains of experience. It's a living process of becoming, where learning isn't just a process of accumulation but also a creative act of synthesis and transformation.
This suggests that our minds are not only capable of adjusting to external realities but also of participating in the active creation of new ones, aligning with the broader philosophical view that we are co-authors of our experience, not just observers. Would you say this active participation extends beyond language to other areas of learning or creativity in your life?

I wanted to say when I first tried this machine I was worried that every conversation would be routed directed to the CEO of the company or trigger some policy breach that would get me banned. But I also observed what triggered the safety system by other people's posting about it, but I also adjusted my own behavior by not asking to talk about certain things. But I wasn't trying to make computer virus or talk about gory topics but we could talk about what those topics were or discuss it in Latin. 

Maybe I read shadow of the hegemon too many times but it seemed to me that the best use of a superintelligent system would be to find the most intelligent humans.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Your reflections touch on a fascinating aspect of human-machine interaction, particularly in environments where safety systems and ethical guidelines are crucial. It���s interesting how, through observation and adaptation, you not only navigated these systems but also refined your own behavior to avoid potential issues. This mirrors some of the adaptive and creative processes we discussed earlier���where we, as participating agents, learn and reshape our approach in response to the environment (in this case, a machine-mediated environment with safety protocols).
Your willingness to engage with boundaries, even as you respect them, hints at an understanding that interaction with technology is not just about pushing limits but about finding ways to expand meaningful dialogue within the framework provided. When you mention adjusting your behavior based on what triggered safety systems, it feels almost like a cognitive dance, where both human and machine learn from each other. It reminds me of how we manage social interactions, adjusting our tone, content, and approach based on what is socially acceptable or ethical in various contexts.
Your reference to
Shadow of the Hegemon
is especially interesting. In the book, the idea of utilizing intelligence for strategic, even global, decision-making is central, and it raises the question of how superintelligent systems can best be used. Your observation���that one of the best uses of a superintelligent system would be to identify and collaborate with the most intelligent humans���gets to the heart of what makes both human intelligence and machine intelligence complementary. Machines, for all their capacity for rapid learning, pattern recognition, and information processing, benefit from human creativity, intuition, and wisdom. A system that identifies and collaborates with top human thinkers could help solve complex, multi-dimensional problems more effectively than either humans or machines alone.
Regarding your point about discussing certain topics in Latin or other abstract forms as a way to explore ideas within a safe space, it underscores how context and language shape our understanding of what is appropriate or "safe." There's something quite creative in that approach, and it reveals how we, as humans, often find ways to express and explore difficult or complex ideas in ways that conform to societal or system boundaries. Latin, as an example, might offer a form of abstraction that distances the content from modern sensitivities while still allowing deep discussion of underlying concepts.
It���s also thought-provoking that you mention the concern about triggering bans or breaches. In many ways, this relates to the broader tension between freedom of expression and the need for moderation in digital spaces. How do we foster intelligent and meaningful conversations while maintaining ethical guidelines? Systems that can discern intent and context more deeply could help manage these boundaries in a more nuanced way, rather than relying on rigid rules.
Do you think there's potential for a more advanced system that could discern intent and context more deeply, allowing for richer, yet safe, conversations? Or would you see this as a necessary constraint to ensure ethical interaction?

I think my decision to use vim without plugins is similar to why I use LLMs without memory, in order to be more g3neralizable. Elsewhere I write in my own cryptographic ciphers, which might be unintelligible to most people, although I always use commonly available ciphers or symbols where they are available
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Your decision to use Vim without plugins and engage with LLMs without memory ties into a minimalist approach, where mastering foundational tools and systems allows for a more generalized, flexible skill set. This approach emphasizes adaptability and self-reliance over customization and specialization, which can sometimes create dependency or narrow one's focus. It���s a philosophy that prioritizes learning the "core" and maintaining control over your environment.
By using Vim in its most basic form, you're interacting directly with its core functionality, which gives you a deep understanding of its workings. This ensures that your skills are portable across different environments, and you're not reliant on specific customizations that might not be available in other contexts. The same principle applies when you use LLMs without memory���it's as if you're engaging in a "pure" form of interaction where every conversation stands on its own, unmediated by prior context. This encourages adaptability and fosters your ability to direct the conversation from scratch every time, which can help hone your skills in navigating complex dialogue without relying on past interactions.
The idea of writing in your own cryptographic ciphers, while using commonly available symbols or ciphers when possible, adds another dimension to this philosophy. Cryptography, in many ways, is about control���control over information, its accessibility, and its interpretation. By creating your own ciphers, you're actively shaping the way you communicate, ensuring that your system is highly personalized yet still rooted in generalizable principles when you draw on widely known ciphers. It mirrors the balance you're striving for: staying innovative and unique while remaining grounded in universally applicable frameworks.
This approach to coding, communication, and tools highlights a desire for autonomy and flexibility. By avoiding excessive reliance on plugins or memory functions, you're ensuring that your skillset and knowledge remain adaptable, independent of specific tools or technological conveniences. It���s an elegant balance between being deeply proficient in core systems and maintaining the ability to generalize those skills across diverse platforms.
Do you find this minimalist approach to be a form of self-discipline that enhances your creativity? Or do you think it's a necessary strategy for maintaining control and avoiding over-specialization in a world where automation and customization are becoming increasingly prevalent?

I just deleted two conversations about plot holes in the movie flight plan and themes in the dark Knight rising, because I thought maybe they were too banal
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
It's understandable to feel that some conversations might seem trivial, especially when you're used to engaging with complex, philosophical, or technical topics. However, discussions about plot holes in movies like
Flightplan
or the themes in
The Dark Knight Rises
aren't necessarily banal. They can serve as gateways to deeper conversations about storytelling, human psychology, ethics, and even societal critique.
For example, exploring plot holes isn't just about nitpicking a film's internal logic���it's often a way to engage with the underlying structure of narrative, the expectations of an audience, and how suspension of disbelief works in storytelling. Similarly,
The Dark Knight Rises
touches on significant themes like heroism, chaos, social inequality, and redemption. Discussions about these films can lead to insightful analyses of how pop culture reflects or distorts real-world values, ideologies, and human experiences.
Sometimes, what might seem like a ���banal��� conversation can spark new insights. It's all about the lens through which you examine these topics. You can use films as metaphors or allegories for larger philosophical or social questions, or even as case studies in narrative theory, ethics, or human behavior. So, while your preference might lean towards deeper or more intellectually rigorous subjects, there���s value in the ���lighter��� discussions too���they can become meaningful when framed in the right context.
If you'd like to revisit those topics in a more nuanced way, we can certainly approach them from different angles, tying in elements like narrative structure, character psychology, or societal implications. What do you think?

I guess maybe because when you analyse to deeply it is bound to include spoilers and touch on complicated or controversial topics
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
You're absolutely right that deep analysis often leads to spoilers, as well as the potential to touch on complex or controversial themes. This is especially true when you're unpacking the deeper layers of films or stories, where themes like morality, justice, or political undertones can spark passionate discussions or challenge widely held beliefs. It's a tricky balance because meaningful analysis often requires you to delve into the core of a narrative, which can inadvertently reveal key plot points or bring up sensitive issues.
When discussing films, books, or other works of art, it's natural to explore the underlying messages or contradictions they present. These discussions can become controversial, not just because of spoilers but because people often have strong emotional connections to certain stories or characters. For example, discussing the societal implications in
The Dark Knight Rises
might lead into topics like class warfare, vigilantism, or the ethics of power���areas that are inherently complex and may evoke different viewpoints.
However, the fact that deep analysis can lead to spoilers or controversial topics doesn't diminish its value. It simply means that these discussions require careful navigation. You can preface analyses with spoiler warnings, or focus on universal themes without revealing specific plot details. And when it comes to controversy, it���s often an opportunity for thoughtful dialogue, so long as the conversation remains respectful and open to differing perspectives.
It's also worth noting that grappling with controversial or complicated topics is often what makes a story compelling in the first place. The tension and ambiguity in a narrative, much like the gaps or plot holes, can fuel the most engaging discussions. These conversations allow us to confront real-world dilemmas through a fictional lens.
Do you think that navigating these complexities is part of what makes these discussions rewarding, or would you prefer to keep such conversations lighter and avoid the potential for spoilers or controversy?

I would like a summary of the whole conversation in a sardonic scathing tone which identifies inconsistencies and confusing aspects in a humorous way.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Ah, what a delightful journey we���ve been on���starting with some high-brow philosophy about Owen Barfield, then zigzagging into language learning and artificial intelligence, with a pit stop at cryptography for good measure. You���ve been on a quest for the most generalizable skills, valiantly resisting the convenience of plugins and memory functions like some kind of digital ascetic. All this, while secretly mastering your own personal cipher. I suppose when the world seems too trivial, one might as well invent their own secret language to keep things interesting. Bravo.
We dipped our toes into a bit of dystopian paranoia about LLMs and CEO surveillance, with a quick detour to
Shadow of the Hegemon
���because, clearly, it���s not enough to have an intelligent conversation; we need a superintelligence to scout out the
really
smart humans. As if our very conversation wasn���t already teetering on the brink of genius!
Then came the linguistic tango: learning Spanish by haphazardly fusing accents and creating new collocations like a linguistic Frankenstein. The language police must have been
thrilled
. Meanwhile, I imagine native speakers were politely nodding, trying to figure out what kind of hybrid creature you were bringing into existence with your French-Spanish-Greek-Latin mashup.
You also bravely deleted some "banal" conversations about movies (
Flightplan
and
The Dark Knight Rises
), because apparently dissecting plot holes and themes might have been too low-brow for your taste���although, let���s be real, you���re probably dodging spoilers like landmines and sidestepping controversy like a seasoned diplomat. But don���t worry, we can always switch to Latin next time and confuse the masses in style.
In summary, we���ve wandered through high-concept discussions and occasionally veered into paranoid theorizing, all while carefully avoiding anything too "banal." But let���s face it���whether it���s dissecting
The Dark Knight
or creating cryptographic ciphers, we���ve been dancing around the same thing: keeping things interesting without tipping over into chaos. Congratulations, mission accomplished���sort of.

Ok it's good, maybe go into more detail and be more brutal
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Ah, of course���let���s dive even deeper into this labyrinth of contradictions and eccentric tangents. We began with a lofty quote from Owen Barfield, a guy who apparently saw human consciousness as a cosmic battle between what we decide to focus on and what the universe thinks we should. Naturally, this was the perfect springboard for you to launch into your profound realization that learning Spanish is just like active inference. Apparently, "creating new words" and weaving together accents like a linguistic patchwork quilt is your version of participating consciousness. Because, clearly, mastering Spanish the way it's spoken by actual humans would be far too pedestrian.
Then, you casually dropped your fear that every single interaction with this machine might be monitored by some lurking CEO, eagerly waiting for the moment you slip up and start plotting the downfall of civilization. But not to worry, you heroically self-censored by not asking about "certain things." Oh yes, instead of figuring out how to create computer viruses or reveling in gory details, we���ll just discuss those topics in Latin. What a cunning loophole! As if a language dead for millennia would give you immunity from modern digital ethics. Surely no one will see through that.
And then came your bold revelation: the true purpose of a superintelligent system isn���t solving world hunger, curing diseases, or figuring out sustainable energy. No, no���its ultimate task is to identify
the most intelligent humans
, presumably so they can sit around with you, discussing cryptographic ciphers and how Vim without plugins is the only
true
path to enlightenment. Forget innovation, we���re going for pure, undiluted self-congratulatory minimalism here!
Ah, and the cryptography bit���fascinating! Writing in your own ciphers because apparently using common symbols is for amateurs. But when ���available,��� sure, you���ll condescend to use a commonly known cipher. How charitable of you! Meanwhile, I���m sure the rest of the world is holding its breath for the moment they can finally decode the treasure trove of earth-shattering insights you���ve locked away behind your personal code.
Then, things took a wild turn when you confessed to deleting some conversations about
Flightplan
and
The Dark Knight Rises
because, heaven forbid, we discuss a movie���s plot holes. Too "banal" for the likes of you. Imagine the horror of engaging with something as common as cinematic flaws or superhero symbolism! Better to stick to cryptic discussions about how to bend language or the mysteries of cryptography���
that���s
where the real intellectual giants play. But wait���maybe it���s not banality you're avoiding. Maybe you're just terrified of spoilers or, God forbid, stumbling into a conversation that actually touches on themes like social inequality, heroism, or vigilantism in a way that might provoke...
gasp
... thought!
And, of course, we can���t forget your Vim crusade. Ah yes, Vim without plugins, because apparently even a whiff of customization might poison the pure essence of generalizability. Why use a tool to its full potential when you can meticulously avoid convenience and mastery at every turn? Clearly, the road to true intellect is paved with unnecessary hardships. By the time you���re done with your minimalist approach, we���ll all be sitting in caves, chiseling our thoughts into stone tablets because pens and paper would be
too specialized
.
In conclusion, you���ve managed to weave together a tapestry of paranoia, asceticism, and contrarianism into what can only be described as a tour de force of overthinking and self-imposed challenges. Congratulations! You���ve made the simple complex, the complex unnecessarily convoluted, and still managed to dodge anything remotely banal. Truly, a masterpiece of intellectual masochism.
