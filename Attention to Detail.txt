Abstract 
The advent of Transformers marked a signif i cant breakthrough in sequence mod- 
elling, providing a highly performant architecture capable of leveraging GPU 
parallelism. However, Transformers are computationally expensive at inference 
time, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings (e.g., mobile 
and embedded devices). Addressing this, we (1) begin by showing that attention 
can be viewed as a special Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the ability to 
compute its many-to-one RNN output eff i ciently. We then (2) show that popular 
attention-based models such as Transformers can be viewed as RNN variants. 
However, unlike traditional RNNs (e.g., LSTMs), these models cannot be updated 
eff i ciently with new tokens, an important property in sequence modelling. Tackling 
this, we (3) introduce a new eff i cient method of computing attention���s many-to- 
many RNN output based on the parallel pref i x scan algorithm. Building on the 
new attention formulation, we (4) introduce Aaren, an attention-based module that 
can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be updated 
eff i ciently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like 
traditional RNNs). Empirically, we show Aarens achieve comparable performance 
to Transformers on38datasets spread across four popular sequential problem 
settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classif i cation, and 
time series forecasting tasks while being more time and memory-eff i cient. 
1Introduction 
Advancements in sequence modelling are highly impactful due to the wide range of applications, 
including reinforcement learning (e.g., robotics and autonomous driving), time series classif i cation 
(e.g., i nancial fraud detection and medical diagnoses), and time series forecasting (e.g., weather 
and energy consumption predictions). Over the past several years, an extensively explored topic 
in sequence modelling is that of Transformer-based models (Vaswani et al., 2017). This is due to 
Transformers��� strong performance and ability to leverage GPU parallelism. As a result, numerous 
Transformer-specif i c survey papers have been written for various sequential settings such as rein- 
forcement learning (Agarwal et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023), time series (Lin et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 
2024), and speech processing (Latif et al., 2023).

With the rapid increase in low-resource domains such as battery-powered devices, deployed models 
in these domains must be computationally eff i cient. Transformers, on the other hand, are expensive 
due to their quadratic scaling in memory and computation. Although their eff i ciency can be enhanced 
at inference time using techniques such as KV-caching (Pope et al., 2023), Transformers remain 
expensive for low-resource domains due to requiring (1) linear memory in the number of tokens and 
(2) the caching of all preceding tokens to the model. The effect of these limitations is exacerbated in 
settings with long contexts (i.e., large number of tokens) such as those common in time series (e.g., 
climate and economics). 
To address this issue, we begin by examining attention, the component contributing to Transformers 
quadratic computational complexity. We show that (1) attention can be viewed as a special Recur- 
rent Neural Network (RNN) with the ability to compute its many-to-one RNN output eff i ciently. 
Leveraging the RNN formulation of attention, we (2) show that popular attention-based models (e.g., 
Transformers and Perceivers) can be viewed as RNNs. However, unlike traditional RNNs such as 
LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and GRUs (Cho et al., 2014), these attention-based 
models are unable to perform eff i cient updates with new tokens, an important property in sequential 
problem settings where data is processed in a stream. 
To address this, we (3) introduce a new formulation of attention based on the parallel pref i x scan 
algorithm (Blelloch, 1990) that eff i ciently computes attention���s many-to-many RNN output. Building 
on this new attention formulation, we (4) introduce Aaren ([A]ttention [a]s a [re]current neural 
[n]etwork), a computationally eff i cient module that can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like 
Transformers) but also (ii) be eff i ciently updated with new tokens, requiring only constant memory 
for inferences (like traditional RNNs). Empirically, we show Aarens achieve comparable performance to Transformers on38datasets spread across four popular sequential data settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and time series forecasting tasks while being more time and memory-efficient.

Abstract:
Transformers revolutionized sequence modeling by leveraging GPU parallelism but suffer from high computational costs, particularly during inference. To address this, we propose viewing attention as a special type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This perspective allows for efficient computation of the many-to-one RNN output. Furthermore, we introduce Aaren, a new attention-based module that can be trained in parallel like Transformers and updated efficiently with new tokens like traditional RNNs. Aaren achieves comparable performance to Transformers across 38 datasets in reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and time series forecasting, while being more efficient in terms of time and memory.
Key Points:
Attention as an RNN
: We show that attention mechanisms can be reformulated as a type of RNN capable of efficient many-to-one output computation.
RNN Perspective on Transformers
: Popular attention-based models such as Transformers can be seen as RNN variants, although they lack efficient updating mechanisms with new tokens.
Efficient Attention Computation
: We introduce a new method for computing attention���s many-to-many RNN output using the parallel prefix scan algorithm.
Introduction of Aaren
: A new module, Aaren, combines the parallel training benefits of Transformers with the efficient updating and constant memory requirements of traditional RNNs.
Empirical Validation
: Aaren demonstrates comparable performance to Transformers across various sequential problem settings while being more efficient.
Introduction:
Sequence modeling advancements have significant applications in areas such as reinforcement learning, time series classification, and forecasting. Transformers have been a dominant approach due to their performance and ability to leverage GPU parallelism. However, their high computational and memory requirements limit their use in low-resource settings. We address this by reformulating attention as a specialized RNN and introducing Aaren, which achieves Transformer-like performance with greater efficiency.

2.1Recurrent Neural Networks 
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are specialized models for sequence modelling. In brief, RNNs 
process sequential data by iteratively computing hidden states as follows: 
ht= f��(ht���1,xt) 
wheretdenotes the step index,xrepresents a token,hrepresents the hidden state, andf��is a 
neural network parameterized by��. The value of the initial hidden stateh0is typically learned 
via backpropagation. Popular RNNs such as LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and 
GRUs (Cho et al., 2014) i x the size of the hidden stateshtto a constant irrespective of the step 
index. As such, these models are eff i cient at test time, requiring only constant memory and time 
per token and can be easily updated with new tokens, an important property in sequence modelling. 
However, due to being iterative by design, these popular RNNs also suffer scalability issues due 
to their lack of parallelizability. As such, RNNs were replaced by a parallelizable attention-based 
module, Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), as the standard for many sequence modelling settings. 
2.2Attention 
Attention retrieves information from a set ofXCcontext tokens for a given set of query tokensXQ 
as follows: Attention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT)V

weights of the context tokens for a weighted average. Notably, unlike RNNs, attention is not designed 
to be iterative; instead, it is designed to easily leverage GPU parallelism. Transformers (Vaswani 
et al., 2017) use self-attention1, a special case of attention, where the query tokens are the same 
as the context tokens. However, self-attention requires quadratic computation with respect to the

computationally expensive, limiting their applications in low-resource domains.

Figure 1: Attention as a many-to-one RNN. The query tokens are the initial hidden states of the 
RNNs. (a) The conventional method of computing attention only computes its i nal output. As such, 
it can be viewed as a method of computing attention���s many-to-one RNN output. (b) Transformer���s 
self-attention (Vaswani et al., 2017) uses the input tokens as the initial hidden states. (c) Perceiver���s 
cross-attention (Jaegle et al., 2021) uses input-dependent latents as the initial hidden states. 
Addressing this, we propose an eff i cient attention-based module capable of leveraging GPU paral- 
lelism while being eff i ciently updateable. We begin by i rst showing in Section 3.1 that attention can 
be viewed as an RNN with the special ability to compute its many-to-one RNN (Figure 1a) output 
eff i ciently. Leveraging the RNN formulation of attention, we further show that popular attention- 
based models such as Transformers (Figure 1b) and Perceivers (Figure 1c) can be viewed as RNNs. 
However, unlike traditional RNNs, these models are unable to eff i ciently update themselves with new 
tokens, limiting their potential in sequential problem settings where data arrives as a stream. Tackling 
this, we introduce in Section 3.2 an eff i cient method for computing attention as a many-to-many RNN 
based on the parallel pref i x scan algorithm. Building on this, we introduce in Section 3.3 Aaren 
([A]ttention [a]s a [re]current neural [n]etwork), a computationally eff i cient module that can not only 
(i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be eff i ciently updated with new tokens at 
inference time, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs).

Background
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Think of RNNs as a factory assembly line, where each worker (hidden state) takes the product from the previous worker (the previous hidden state) and adds something new to it (the new token) before passing it on. Each worker always uses the same amount of space (constant memory) and can keep working with new parts without any problem. However, because each worker must wait for the previous one to finish, the process is slow and can't easily be done in parallel.
Attention
Imagine attention as a smart librarian who, when given a request (query token), looks through a set of books (context tokens) to find the most relevant information quickly. The librarian uses a clever trick (softmax) to decide which books are most important for the request. Unlike the assembly line, this librarian can look at all the books at once, making the process fast with the help of many assistants (GPUs). However, this method requires a lot of space (memory) to keep track of everything, and it's hard to add new books without redoing a lot of work.
Methodology
Attention as an RNN
Think of attention as a special kind of assembly line worker who can look at the entire assembly line at once and make decisions quickly (many-to-one output). This new worker (attention) can be viewed as an RNN but has the added benefit of seeing the whole process in one go.
Figures Explanation
(a) Conventional Attention
: Like a worker who only cares about the final product, focusing on combining everything to get the last piece right.
(b) Transformer���s Self-Attention
: Workers use the same initial parts to check and refine their work continuously.
(c) Perceiver���s Cross-Attention
: Workers use different parts depending on what needs to be done, adjusting their process based on specific inputs.
Introducing Aaren
Now, imagine a new kind of worker, Aaren, who combines the best of both worlds. Aaren can:
Work in Parallel
: Like having many workers doing their tasks simultaneously (like Transformers).
Update Efficiently
: Able to handle new parts quickly without needing extra space (like traditional RNNs).
By using a smart method (parallel prefix scan algorithm), Aaren can process information as efficiently as the librarian (attention) while being as adaptable as the assembly line worker (RNN). This makes Aaren both fast and memory-efficient, able to perform well in various tasks like predicting weather, recognizing patterns, and more, just like the best workers in a high-tech factory.

3.1Attention as a (many-to-one) RNN Figure 2: Attention���s RNN Cell. 
Attention for a query vectorqcan be viewed as a func- 
tion that mapsNcontext tokensx1:Nvia their keys

where the numerator is�� aN= PN

i=1exp(si). Viewingattention 
as an RNN, we can compute both iteratively as rolling 
sums�� ak= �� ak���1+exp(sk)vkand�� ck= �� ck���1+exp(sk) 
fork = 1,...,N. However, in practice, this is an un- 
stable implementation, running into numerical issues 
due to limited precision representations and potentially 
very small or large exponents (i.e.,exp(s)). Mitigating 
this, we re-write the recurrence with a cumulative maxi- 
mum term2mk= maxi���{1,...,k}si, computing instead 
2A common trick for computing softmax numerically stably is to subtract the max term (Goodfellow et al., 
2016). The cumulative max is an extension of this trick for a recurrent computation of softmax.

i=1exp(si ��� mk). 
Notably, the i nal result is the same 
oN=

cN . ak, ck, and mkare thus computed recurrently as follows: 
ak= ak���1exp(mk���1��� mk) 
+ vkexp(ck��� mk) 
ck= ck���1exp(mk���1��� mk) 
+ exp(sk��� mk) 
mk= max(mk���1,sk) 
By encapsulating the recurrent computation ofak,ck, andmkfromak���1,ck���1, andmk���1, we 
introduce an RNN cell that iteratively computes the output of attention (see Figure 2). Attention���s 
RNN cell takes as input(ak���1,ck���1,mk���1,q)and computes(ak,ck,mk,q). Note that the query 
vectorqiscarriedoverintheRNNcell. Theinitialhiddenstateofattention���sRNNis(a0,c0,m0,q) = 
(0,0,0,q). 
Methods for computing attention. By viewing attention as an RNN, we can see that there are 
different ways to compute attention: (1) recurrently token-by-token (i.e., sequentially) inO(1) 
memory or (2) in the conventional manner (i.e., in parallel) requiring linearO(N)memory. Since 
attention can be viewed as an RNN, the conventional method of computing attention can also be 
viewed as an eff i cient method of computing attention���s many-to-one RNN output, i.e., the output of 
an RNN that takes as input multiple context tokens but only outputs a single token at the end of the 
RNN (see Figure 1a). Lastly, instead of fully sequential or fully in parallel, we can also compute 
attention as (3) an RNN that processes the tokens block-by-block requiringO(b)memory where 
bis the size of the block. This method, however, is outside the scope of this work. As such, the 
description of the block-by-block RNN is included in Appendix A. 
Viewing existing attention-based models as RNNs. By viewing attention as an RNN, existing 
attention-based models can also be viewed as variations of RNNs. For example, Transformers��� 
self-attentions are RNNs (Figure 1b) with the context tokens as their initial hidden states. Perceiver���s 
cross-attentions are RNNs (Figure 1c) with context-dependent latents as their initial hidden states. By 
leveraging the RNN formulation of their attention mechanisms, these existing models can compute 
their output memory eff i ciently. Algorithm 1 Parallel Pref i x Scan (Hillis

Challenges of viewing attention as an RNN for exist- 
ing models. However, when viewing existing attention- 
based models such as Transformers as RNNs, the mod- 
els lack important properties common in traditional 
RNNs such as LSTMs and GRUs. Notably, LSTMs and 
GRUs are capable of eff i ciently updating themselves 
with new tokens in onlyO(1)constant memory and 
computation, an important feature for sequence mod- 
elling where data is received in a stream. In contrast, 
the RNN view of Transformer (see Figure 1b) would 
handle new tokens by adding a new RNN with the new 
token as its initial state. The new RNN processes all 
preceding tokens, requiringO(N)linear computation 
in the number of tokens. In Perceiver, the latents (Liin 
Figure 1c) are input-dependent due to their architecture, 
meaning that their values change when receiving a new 
token. Since the initial hidden states (i.e., latents) of 
their RNNs change, Perceiver would thus require re- 
computing their RNNs from scratch, requiringO(NL) 
linear computation in the number of tokens (N) and the 
number of latents (L).

3.1 Attention as a (many-to-one) RNN
Understanding Attention as an RNN
Imagine you have a query and you need to find the best answers from a pile of documents. Traditional attention works by comparing the query to each document and combining the relevant information into a single output. This is similar to how an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) processes sequences step-by-step, updating its state as it goes along.

Computing Attention
There are different ways to compute attention:
Sequentially
: Token-by-token with
O
(
1
)
O(1)
O
(
1
)
memory.
In Parallel
: All at once, requiring
O
(
N
)
O(N)
O
(
N
)
memory.
Block-by-Block
: As a compromise, which is not detailed here.
Viewing Attention-Based Models as RNNs
When we think of attention as an RNN, we can also see attention-based models like Transformers and Perceivers as special types of RNNs:
Transformers
: Each token processes all previous tokens, starting with the input tokens as initial states.
Perceivers
: Use context-dependent latents (special starting points) as initial states.
However, these models can't update efficiently with new tokens:
Transformers
: Need to process all previous tokens again, requiring
O
(
N
)
O(N)
O
(
N
)
computation.
Perceivers
: Need to recompute from scratch due to changing initial states, requiring
O
(
N
L
)
O(NL)
O
(
N
L
)
computation.
By understanding attention as an RNN, we can see how to improve these models to handle new data efficiently while leveraging their parallel computation strengths.

3.2Attention as a (many-to-many) RNN 
Addressing these limitations, we propose to develop an attention-based model capable of leveraging 
the RNN formulation���s ability to perform eff i cient updates. To do so, we i rst introduce an eff i cient 
parallelizedmethodofcomputingattentionasamany-to-manyRNN,i.e., aparallelmethodtocompute 
{oi= Attention(q,x1:i)}N 
i=1. To do so, we leverage the parallel pref i x scan algorithm (Blelloch, 
1990) (see Algorithm 1), a parallel computation method for computingNpref i x computations

fromNsequential data points via an associative operator���. 
The algorithm eff i ciently computes 
{Lk 
i=1xi} 
N k=1from {xk} 
N 
k=1. Figure 3: Attention as a many-to-many 
RNN 
Figure 4: Stacking Aarens for sequence

Recall thatAttention(q,x1:k) = ok= 
ak 
ck where 
ak= Pk 
i=1exp(si ��� mk)vi,ck= Pk 
i=1exp(si ��� 
mk), andmk=maxi���{1,...,k}siTo compute 
{Attention(q,x1:k)}N

N 
k=1, and{mk} 
N 
k=1via the parallel scan 
algorithm and afterwards combineakandckto com- 
pute Attention(q,x1:k). 
To do so, we propose the following associative oper- 
ator���that 
acts on3-tuples3of the form(mA,uA,wA) 
whereAis a set of indices,mA= maxi���Asi,uA= 
P 
i���Aexp(si ��� mA), 
andwA= P 
i���Aexp(si ��� 
mA)vi.The parallel scan algorithm takes as input 
{(m{i},u{i},w{i})}N 
i=1 = {(si,1,vi)}N 
i=1. The algo- 
rithm recursively applies the operator���which 
works 
as follows: 
(mA,uA,wA)���(mB,uB,wB) 
= (mA���B,uA���B,wA���B) 
wheremA���B= max(mA,mB),uA���B= uAexp(mA��� 
mA���B) + uBexp(mB��� mA���B)andwA���B= 
wAexp(mA���mA���B)+wBexp(mB���mA���B). 
Uponcom- 
pletion of applying the operator recursively, the algo- 
rithm outputs{(m{1,...,k},u{1,...,k},w{1,...,k})}N 
k=1 = 
{(mk, Pk 
i=1exp(si ���mk), Pk 
i=1exp(si ���

k=1. Also known as{(mk,ck,ak)}N 
k=1. 
Combining the last two values of the output tuples, we 
retrieveAttention(q,x1:k) = ok= 
ak 
ck, resulting in an 
eff i cient parallelized method for computing attention 
as a many-to-many RNN (Figure 3). 
3.3Aaren: 
Attention as a Recurrent Neural Network 
Leveraging the parallelized many-to-many formulation of attention, we propose Aaren ([A]ttention 
[a]s a [re]current neural [n]etwork). The interface of Aaren is the same as a Transformer, mapping 
Ninputs toNoutputs whereas thei-th output is an aggregate of the1st toi-th input. As such, 
Aaren is also (1) naturally stackable and (2) capable of computing individual loss terms for each 
sequence token. However, unlike Transformers which use a causal self-attention, Aaren uses the 
aforementioned method of computing attention as a many-to-many RNN, making it more eff i cient. 
Aaren functions as follows: h(0) 
1 ,...,h(0) 
N ��� x1,...,xN 
[h(j+1) 
1 ,...,h(j+1) 
N ] ��� Aaren(q(j),[h(j) 
1 ,...,h(j) 
N ]) 
Unlike Transformers where the query is one of the input tokens to attention, Aaren���s query tokenqis 
learned during training via backpropagation. In Figure 4, we include an example of a stacked Aaren 
model with input context tokensx1:3and outputsy1:3. Notably, since Aaren leverages the RNN 
formulation of attention, the stacking of Aarens is also the stacking of RNNs. Therefore, Aarens are 
also able to perform updates with new tokens eff i ciently, i.e., the iterative computation ofykonly 
requires constant computation as it relies solely onhk���1andxk. Unlike Transformer-based models 
which (1) require linear memory (when using KV-caching) and (2) require storing all previous 
tokens, including those in intermediate Transformer layers, Aaren-based models (1) require only 
constant memory and (2) does not require storing all previous tokens, making Aarens signif i cantly 
more computationally eff i cient than Transformers.

3.2 Attention as a (Many-to-Many) RNN
Enhancing Efficiency in Attention Models
To overcome the limitations of traditional attention models, we propose an enhanced method that treats attention as a many-to-many RNN, allowing efficient updates and parallel computation. This approach utilizes the parallel prefix scan algorithm, which processes multiple sequential data points efficiently.
Parallel Prefix Scan Algorithm
The parallel prefix scan algorithm is a way to perform operations on a sequence of data points in parallel. Think of it like a group of workers who each handle a part of the task simultaneously, speeding up the overall process. For attention, we use this algorithm to compute the necessary values in parallel.

Introducing Aaren
Aaren ([A]ttention [a]s a [re]current neural [n]etwork) leverages the efficient, parallelized many-to-many RNN formulation of attention. Aaren operates similarly to Transformers but is designed to be more computationally efficient, especially for sequential data.

Advantages of Aaren
Stackable
: Similar to Transformers, Aaren can be stacked to create deep models for complex sequence modeling tasks.
Efficient Updates
: Aaren can efficiently update with new tokens, requiring only constant computation and memory, unlike Transformers which need to store and reprocess all previous tokens.
Memory Efficiency
: Aaren-based models only require constant memory, significantly reducing computational overhead compared to Transformer-based models, which require linear memory proportional to the sequence length.
In summary, Aaren combines the strengths of RNNs (efficient updates) and Transformers (parallel computation), resulting in a more efficient model for sequence data.

5Related Work 
Closest to Aaren are approximations of attention such as those by RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), 
RetNet (Sun et al., 2023), and Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). These models 
proposed linearizations of the standard softmax-based attention that allow them to be formulated as 
an RNN. However, in doing so, these models also encode an exponential factor that biases tokens 
based on their timestamp, limiting their potential applications. In contrast, Aaren leverages an exact 
re-formulation of softmax attention as an RNN, allowing the model itself to compute the weight of 
each token. 
Feng et al. (2023) showed attention can be computed recurrently, using it to compress set-based inputs. 
Rabe and Staats (2022) introduced a recurrent formulation of attention, showing that self-attention 
can be computed eff i ciently. Katharopoulos et al. (2020) showed that Transformers with a causal 
mask can be viewed as an RNN. In contrast, we (1) show a more general result whereas any attention 
model can be viewed as an RNN. Furthermore, we (2) introduce Aaren, a new attention formulation 
based on parallel pref i x sums, that achieves competitive results with that of Transformers while being 
more eff i cient. 
The problem of computing pref i x scans/sums has been well studied with various eff i cient parallelized 
algorithms proposed for computing them. Since Aaren only requires the output of the pref i x scan, 
any eff i cient algorithm for computing it can be used. In this work, we outlined the method by 
Hillis and Steele (1986). This method is time eff i cient for parallel computation, requiringlog2(N) 
sequential steps andO(N log(N))overall 
computation. In contrast, the method by Ladner and 
Fischer (1980) use mores sequential steps (specif i cally,2log2(N) ��� 2) 
but only performsO(N) 
overall computation. For a more in-depth introduction to parallel pref i x sums algorithms, we refer the 
reader to the following work by Blelloch (1990). 
In this work, we applied Transformers to a subset of applications. For a broad overview of the 
applications of Transformers, we refer the reader to the following survey by Islam et al. (2023). For 
an overview of different transformer models applied to the specif i c settings considered in this paper, 
we refer the reader to the following surveys (1) on transformers in reinforcement learning by Li et al. 
(2023) and (2) on transformers in event forecasting, time series forecasting, time series classif i cation, 
and more by Wen et al. (2022). 
6Conclusion 
In this work, we showed that attention can be formulated as an RNN whereas the conventional way of 
computing attention is a parallelized method of computing its many-to-one RNN output. Building on 
the RNN formulation, we showed that existing attention-based models can be formulated as RNNs. 
9 
However, unlike traditional RNNs such as LSTMs and GRUs, these methods cannot be updated 
eff i ciently with new tokens. Addressing this, we introduced a new parallelized method of computing 
attention���s many-to-many RNN output based on the parallel pref i x scan algorithm. Building on the 
new attention formulation, we introduced Aaren, a new module that can not only (i) be trained in 
parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be eff i ciently updated at inference time, thereby requiring only 
constant memory (like RNNs). Empirically, we showed that Aarens achieve performance competitive 
with Transformers on38datasets spread across four sequential data settings: reinforcement learning, 
event forecasting, time series classif i cation, and time series forecasting. Finally, we empirically show 
that Aarens are signif i cantly more time and memory-eff i cient than Transformers.

overall computation. For a detailed introduction to parallel prefix sums algorithms, we refer readers to Blelloch (1990).
Our work applied Transformers to a subset of applications. For a comprehensive overview of Transformer applications, see the survey by Islam et al. (2023). For specific Transformer model applications in settings like reinforcement learning and event forecasting, see the surveys by Li et al. (2023) and Wen et al. (2022), respectively.
6 Conclusion
In this work, we demonstrated that attention could be formulated as an RNN, where the conventional way of computing attention is a parallelized method for computing its many-to-one RNN output. Building on the RNN formulation, we showed that existing attention-based models could also be formulated as RNNs. However, unlike traditional RNNs such as LSTMs and GRUs, these methods cannot be efficiently updated with new tokens.
To address this, we introduced a new parallelized method of computing attention���s many-to-many RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on this new attention formulation, we introduced Aaren, a module that can (i) be trained in parallel like Transformers and (ii) be efficiently updated at inference time, requiring only constant memory like RNNs. Empirically, we demonstrated that Aarens achieve performance competitive with Transformers across 38 datasets in four sequential data settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and time series forecasting. Finally, we showed that Aarens are significantly more time and memory-efficient than Transformers.

Analogies and Metaphors for Aaren and Related Concepts
RNNs vs. Transformers: The Relay Race vs. the All-at-Once Competition
RNNs:
Imagine a relay race where each runner passes a baton to the next runner. Each runner's performance depends on how well the previous runners did. This is how RNNs work���they process information step by step, one token at a time.
Transformers:
In contrast, Transformers are like a group of athletes all competing simultaneously in their own lanes. They can see all the other athletes' performances and adjust their strategies accordingly. This allows them to leverage parallel processing, making them faster for certain tasks but requiring more resources.
Attention Mechanism: The Spotlight
Think of attention as a spotlight on a stage. The spotlight operator can focus on different actors (tokens) based on their relevance to the current scene (query). This helps in highlighting the most important parts of the scene while still keeping an eye on the overall context.
Softmax in Attention: The Voting System
Imagine a council where each member (token) has a vote on a decision (output). The importance (weight) of each vote is determined by a softmax function, which ensures that all votes are taken into account proportionally to their significance. This is how the softmax mechanism works in attention, distributing focus based on relevance.
Prefix Scan Algorithm: The Conveyor Belt Sorting
The prefix scan algorithm can be compared to a conveyor belt sorting system in a factory. As items move along the belt, each station adds or processes information about the items that have passed. By the end of the belt, each item has accumulated all the necessary information, ready for the next stage. This efficient parallel processing allows for quick and organized handling of data.
Aaren: The Smart Librarian
Imagine a smart librarian (Aaren) who not only knows the location of every book (token) in the library but can also remember the most relevant details from all the books seen so far. When a new book arrives, the librarian updates their knowledge without having to re-read all previous books. This is how Aaren updates its attention mechanism efficiently with new information.
Efficient Updates: The Modular Puzzle
Traditional models like Transformers are like a large, complex puzzle that you have to complete all at once. If you add a new piece, you might need to rearrange many parts. Aaren, however, is like a modular puzzle where you can add new pieces without disturbing the existing structure, allowing for easy and efficient updates.
Memory Efficiency: The Backpacker vs. the Warehouse
RNNs and models like Aaren are like backpackers who carry only the essentials with them, making them nimble and efficient. They update their knowledge continuously without needing to store everything. Transformers, on the other hand, are like warehouses storing every single piece of information, which can be exhaustive and resource-intensive.
Parallel Processing: The Orchestra vs. Soloist
The parallel prefix scan algorithm in Aaren is like an orchestra where each musician plays their part simultaneously, creating a harmonious result quickly and efficiently. Traditional RNNs, like a soloist, play each note sequentially, which takes more time but requires less coordination at each step.
These analogies aim to simplify the concepts and mechanisms behind Aaren and its comparison to traditional RNNs and Transformers, making the technical details more relatable and easier to understand.

I wonder if it is similar to the observation that when I took more than the required courses my grades went up, because I could use intersectional knowledge?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, that's a great analogy and it aligns well with the concept of how Aaren and its approach to attention work. Here's how we can relate your observation to Aaren's methodology:
Intersectional Knowledge and Improved Grades
When you took more than the required courses, your grades improved because you could leverage knowledge from different subjects and see connections between them. This intersectional knowledge allowed you to understand concepts better and apply them more effectively.
Aaren and Efficient Attention Mechanism
Similarly, Aaren leverages an efficient way of computing attention by treating it as a recurrent neural network (RNN). This allows it to process new information while efficiently updating its understanding based on previously learned context. Here's a breakdown:
Intersectional Knowledge (Analogous to Parallel Processing):
Just as taking multiple courses allowed you to make connections between different fields, Aaren uses the parallel prefix scan algorithm to efficiently combine information from multiple tokens. This allows it to maintain a holistic understanding without having to reprocess everything from scratch.
This method of combining and updating information is akin to integrating knowledge from various courses to get a better grasp of the subject matter.
Improved Grades (Analogous to Improved Efficiency):
Your grades improved because the intersectional knowledge provided a more comprehensive understanding. Similarly, Aaren's ability to efficiently update its attention mechanism with new tokens allows it to perform better in tasks that require sequential data processing.
By not having to store and reprocess all previous tokens (like the warehouse analogy for Transformers), Aaren can focus on the most relevant information, making it more efficient and effective, much like how you could focus better with broader knowledge.
Efficient Updates (Analogous to Continuous Learning):
Just as you continuously updated your knowledge by taking new courses, Aaren continuously updates its understanding by efficiently incorporating new tokens. This avoids the need for extensive reprocessing, similar to how you didn't need to relearn old material but could build on it with new insights.
In summary, your experience of improved grades through intersectional knowledge is quite similar to how Aaren enhances its performance by efficiently updating and integrating new information. Both processes benefit from a comprehensive, interconnected approach to learning and processing information.
