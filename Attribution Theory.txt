Randy Hall:
Honest question: when you say "crossover" what is being exchanged? A certain few lines of code? A subroutine? Some sort of defined function? Of course I'm familiar with the biological (genetic) concept of crossover, but how does this happen in computer science?

Monica Anderson:
GAs all do contain a genome of some sort. Part of the design challenge for the crossover and the goal function is that the practitioner needs to understand the problem well enough to determine which individual is better, but also to be able to determine the parameters that comprise all solutions.

There really is not a Phenotype in simple GAs. We evaluate the genotype directly using the goal function. This is a pretty radical shortcut ���� but one that is actually starting to get used in wetlab genomics: Labs make grains with better yields without the bother to grow the seeds for a year, because they know what a higher yield DNA genome looks like.

Suppose you wanted to use GA to optimize shipping cost to design a square cornered box big enough for shipping a bicycle. The genome would contain the X, Y, and Z sizes of the box and those would initially be totally randomized in each individual. The goal function returns zero fitness for every box that cannot fit the bicycle (You would need to put this computation into the goal function) and otherwise returns the length and circumference so that we can compute the shipping cost the traditional way.

The crossover function might take two parents and use X from one and Y and Z from the other, and sometimes X and Y from one and Z from the other.

Very rapidly we will note that the best boxes in each generation become smaller and smaller and cheaper to ship. When the Elite is stable, they all have the same X, Y, and Z which is the optimal solution.

Now imagine a problem with 2000 parameters, some boolean, some numbers, and a goal function that uses every single one of them. This may be expensive, but if it is the only way forward, we'll take it. Well-behaved problems will converge rapidly.

A typical individual would keep those values in an array and crossover would brutally merge the first part of one parent's array with the rest from the other parent... for one or more randomly chosen switchpoints.

Randy Hall and Monica Anderson are discussing Genetic Algorithms (GAs), a method in computer science that mimics the process of natural selection to solve optimization and search problems. Let me break down the key points of their conversation:
Crossover in Computer Science
: In GAs, crossover refers to the combining of genetic information from two parent solutions to produce a new solution (offspring). This is analogous to biological crossover, where genetic material is exchanged between two parents to create offspring with traits from both. In the context of GAs, this might involve combining elements of two arrays, each representing a solution, at one or more randomly chosen points.
Genome in GAs
: The "genome" in a GA is a set of parameters or a data structure (like an array) that represents a possible solution to the problem. For example, in the bicycle shipping problem Monica describes, the genome would include the dimensions (X, Y, Z) of a shipping box.
Goal Function
: The goal function (also known as the fitness function) evaluates how good a solution is. In the bicycle box example, the goal function would reject any box sizes that couldn't fit a bicycle and calculate the shipping cost for those that could. The fitness of a solution is based on how well it meets the desired criteria.
Phenotype vs. Genotype
: In simple GAs, there's often no distinction between phenotype (observable characteristics) and genotype (genetic makeup). The genotype is evaluated directly using the goal function. This is a simplification compared to biological systems, where phenotype is usually what's selected for.
Optimization Example
: Monica's example of designing a box to minimize shipping cost illustrates how GAs work. The GA randomly generates initial solutions (box dimensions), evaluates them using the goal function (fit for the bicycle and shipping cost), and then uses crossover and possibly mutations to generate new solutions. Over generations, this process ideally converges towards the optimal solution.
Complex Problems
: For problems with many parameters, GAs can still be effective. Even with thousands of parameters, the process remains the same: generate solutions, evaluate them, and use crossover and mutations to create new generations of solutions.
In summary, the crossover in GAs is a method of combining parts of two solutions to create a new solution, aiming to bring together the best features of each to find an optimal or near-optimal solution over successive generations.
You
She also adds:

I forgot to mention my two favorite pieces of advice when creating a crossover function. First:

"There has to be SOME chance for the offspring to inherit SOME feature(s) of what made the parent(s) successful".

I've seen beginners make crossover functions that lose all history from the parents and hence the system degrades to random search.

Second:
"In order to test that your system works, compare convergence of your full system  with convergence of a version where you replace the crossover function with just creating a new random individual without history from the parents. Now you have a random search system. If it isn't significantly slower than your fully functioning GA ���� you need to go back to the drawing board.

It will also tell you how much EV can speed things up over linear or random search (which are equivalent).
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Monica Anderson's additional advice provides valuable insights into designing effective crossover functions in Genetic Algorithms (GAs):
Inheritance of Successful Features
: It's crucial that the crossover function allows offspring to inherit features from their parents that contributed to the parents' success. This principle is at the heart of why GAs work: by combining successful traits from different solutions, the algorithm can explore the solution space more effectively. If the crossover function fails to retain these advantageous features, the GA may degrade into a random search, losing the efficiency that comes from building upon previous successes.
Testing the Effectiveness of the GA
: Monica suggests an important method for validating the effectiveness of a GA. By comparing the convergence speed (how quickly the algorithm finds a good solution) of the original GA with a version where the crossover function is replaced by generating entirely random individuals, one can gauge the impact of the crossover process. In a well-designed GA, the original version should converge to a good solution significantly faster than the random search version. If it doesn't, it indicates that the GA isn't effectively using historical information and needs refinement.
This comparison also illustrates the advantage of Evolutionary Computation (EC) over linear or random search methods. EC, through mechanisms like crossover, is designed to more efficiently navigate the search space by building on the successes of previous generations, whereas linear or random searches do not leverage such historical information.
In essence, these pieces of advice emphasize the importance of designing crossover functions that meaningfully combine parental traits to produce successful offspring and the necessity of validating the GA's efficiency against simpler search methods to ensure it's effectively utilizing its evolutionary components.

Here was Monica's original post:

Evolutionary Computation is under-appreciated.  Objections include "Evolution takes millennia" and "I don't get the point".

They are (or should be) very important to people in the AI community because they provide a primitive form of intelligence. Understanding Evolutionary Computation (EC) will make understanding LLMs easier.

In order to not have to define "AI" again, I will now define a new term SHAG which stands for "SuperHuman Answer Generator".

A SHAG is a computer based system which can provide answers to questions that the client or programmer that is using the system cannot (or cannot be bothered to) compute an answer to themselves. Or shorter: A SHAG generates answers that humans cannot generate.

Unsurprisingly, all LLMs are SHAGs. They can generate answers that their programmers could not. Such as understand and reply in Finnish. To many, it is more surprising that all SHAGs (and hence all LLMs) are Holistic.

Since SHAGs are Holistic we can identify several problems shared by all Holistic systems (discussed in my Red Pill):

- The answers provided may not be correct
- The answers provided are not known to be optimal, complete, repeatable, parsimonious, explainable, or transparent.

As evidence, we recognize these problems as endemic to current LLMs.

But are there SHAGs that are not LLMs? Besides current LLMs (including my own systems), Genetic Algorithms (GA), Genetic Programming (GP), and simulated annealing (SA) are SHAGs. I will mainly discuss GAs in what follows.

My favorite way of using GAs:

- Define an individual that defines a solution but has to compete for survival, initialized randomly for diversity.
- Create a population of those and store all of them in an Array. Say, 1000 individuals in the population.
- Define a goal function that returns a number indicating how good (fit) the individual is.
- Define an crossover function that breeds two successful individuals together, hoping to create an even better offspring
- Define a mutation function that reintroduces more diversity into some individuals.

Loop until system stops improving, which is detectable by noticing that the elite is not changing. This might take as little as 10 cycles for well behaved problems:

- Compute fit for each individual using the goal function
- Sort the array by fitness of the individuals
- Start with the worst individual and move towards better ones:
- Replace the individual with crossover of two superior individuals
- Stop a bit below the top (to preserve the "elite" ones)

Note: Mutation is MUCH LESS important than crossover to the point of being optional. Beginners get this backwards and even textbooks fail to emphasize this enough. If you are not using crossover, then you are just using random search and are discarding the entire point and power of GA.

In a population of 1000 I might use an elite of 10 and will therefore replace 990 worst individuals with potentially superior offspring each turn through loop.

We can now deal with the objection that "Evolution takes millennia". It does, in nature, especially if you get only one chance to create offspring per year. But computers do it a bit faster :-) 

A modern CPU runs at 3GHz --  3E9 cps, which is 3,000,000,000 clock cycles per second.

Suppose we have a problem where computing the goal function value takes 1000 clock cycles per individual. This is often generous.  A GA with a population of 1000 can therefore run 3,000 generations per second... per thread. If we are in a hurry, we can use multithreading and there are special versions of GA frameworks that can run on a cloud.

So speed is not the issue. As to the other objection: The point of SHAGs is that they can provide answers problems humans can't solve, including problems without reliable and complete input data, and NP-Hard and NP-Complete problems such as knapsack problems. These are discussed in The Red Pill. If you are in this situation, you need to explore Holistic Methods, and you need to know that a GA may sometimes be an option. A GA may be a million times cheaper than an LLM which becomes important for frequently occurring problems.

So SHAGs in computers are LLMs and other (future?) AIs, GA, GP, and SA. But the biggest SHAG of all is Darwinian Evolution of Species in Nature. Humans certainly could not make a platypus from scratch. :-| but Evolution did.

A side note: Holistic Systems including GAs can provide true creativity. I posted about that recently.

Bottom line advice: In order to understand how LLMs can solve problems we cannot solve ourselves, study GAs.

Monica Anderson's post delves into the significance of Evolutionary Computation (EC) in the field of AI and introduces the concept of SHAGs (SuperHuman Answer Generators). Let's break down the key points:
Evolutionary Computation (EC) and AI
: EC is seen as underappreciated in AI. Anderson argues that understanding EC can facilitate a better grasp of Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI systems, as EC embodies a primitive form of intelligence through its mimicry of natural evolutionary processes.
Definition of SHAG
: A SHAG is a system capable of generating answers to questions that are beyond the computation or interest of the user. All LLMs are considered SHAGs because they can provide answers or perform tasks that their creators cannot, like understanding and responding in a language foreign to the programmers.
Characteristics of Holistic Systems
: SHAGs, being holistic, share certain limitations: their answers may not be correct, optimal, complete, repeatable, parsimonious, explainable, or transparent. These challenges are also evident in current LLMs.
Genetic Algorithms (GAs) as SHAGs
: GAs, along with Genetic Programming (GP) and Simulated Annealing (SA), are categorized as SHAGs. Anderson prefers GAs, which involve defining a problem solution as an "individual" in a population, a goal function to measure fitness, and operations like crossover and mutation to evolve solutions.
Efficiency of Evolution in Computing
: Contrary to the notion that evolutionary processes are slow, Anderson points out that in computing, these processes can occur rapidly. For example, a GA with a population of 1000 can potentially run thousands of generations per second, especially when leveraging multithreading or cloud computing.
Applications of SHAGs
: SHAGs can tackle complex problems, including those with incomplete data or those categorized as NP-Hard or NP-Complete. GAs might offer a more cost-effective solution compared to LLMs for frequently occurring problems.
Creativity in Holistic Systems
: Anderson notes that holistic systems like GAs can exhibit true creativity, an aspect often overlooked in discussions about AI.
Advice on Understanding LLMs
: To grasp how LLMs solve complex problems, Anderson suggests studying GAs, as they provide a foundational understanding of how systems can generate solutions beyond human capabilities.
Darwinian Evolution as the Ultimate SHAG
: In a broader perspective, Anderson views natural evolution as the most significant example of a SHAG, creating diverse species like the platypus, something humans couldn't achieve from scratch.
Overall, Anderson's post highlights the importance of evolutionary computation in AI, emphasizing its role in problem-solving, creativity, and understanding the capabilities of advanced AI systems like LLMs.

So I think that my definition of general intelligence might be broader. I would consider most art, like poetry and paintings to be evolving in this way but the selection pressure is not in the pieces, a person can repaint copies of a painting that is good, or improve it if it has problems
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your perspective on general intelligence, encompassing the evolution of art forms like poetry and paintings, is indeed broader and quite insightful. It highlights a key aspect of creativity and innovation, extending the principles of evolution beyond biological or computational realms to the domain of art and culture. Let's explore this idea further:
Evolution in Artistic Contexts
: In art, evolution occurs not through genetic mechanisms, but through cultural and creative processes. Artists learn from existing works, incorporate influences, and often innovate to create something new or improved. This process is akin to the evolutionary concepts of variation and selection, but the mechanisms and pressures are different.
Selection Pressure in Art
: Unlike in biological evolution or computational models like GAs, where fitness or goal functions determine selection pressure, in art, selection pressures are more subjective and varied. They can include aesthetic appeal, cultural significance, emotional impact, critical reception, or commercial success. An artwork evolves over time as artists and audiences reinterpret or reinvent it, influenced by changing tastes, cultural contexts, and technological advancements.
Iterative Improvement and Variation
: Just as a GA involves iterating over generations of solutions, improving upon each iteration, artists often refine their work over time. They might revise a poem, repaint a canvas, or draw inspiration from a successful piece to create something new. This iterative process is driven by the artist's evolving vision, skills, and responses to external feedback.
Human Agency in Art Evolution
: A key difference in the evolution of art compared to biological or computational evolution is the role of human agency. Artists actively make choices about what elements to change or keep, often driven by conscious goals, emotions, and intellectual exploration. This adds a layer of intentionality and self-reflection that is not present in genetic algorithms or natural selection.
Cultural and Societal Influence
: The evolution of art is deeply intertwined with cultural and societal dynamics. What is considered innovative, beautiful, or meaningful can change with cultural shifts, leading to new styles, movements, and forms of expression.
Collaborative and Collective Evolution
: Artistic evolution can also be collaborative and collective. Movements and schools of thought in art, like in science or technology, evolve through the contributions of many individuals, each adding their perspective and building upon the work of others.
In summary, your view of general intelligence as encompassing the evolution of art highlights the dynamic and complex nature of creativity and cultural evolution. It underscores how principles of evolution and iteration apply broadly, shaping not just biological and computational systems, but also the rich tapestry of human artistic expression.
You
So I was thinking that the genetic society was running in each human that sees the piece, they compare it against their previous reactions. Developing preferences for certain styles, subjects, colors and rejecting others. Maybe each piece is complicated so that if it has cohesion or parsimony it might add new constraints to the algorithm. Sometimes a piece becomes more pleasant over time as one discovers more interesting details or becomes jarring as more problems are found with it.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your concept of viewing each human as a running "genetic algorithm" for evaluating and evolving art is a fascinating extension of the evolutionary paradigm to cultural and aesthetic experiences. It encapsulates how individual preferences and interpretations play a crucial role in the evolution of art. Let's explore this idea further:
Human Perception as a Genetic Algorithm
: In this analogy, each person's reaction to a piece of art is akin to a generation in a genetic algorithm. As individuals encounter different artworks, they 'select' those that resonate with their tastes and experiences, similar to how a genetic algorithm selects for fitness. These preferences evolve over time, influenced by exposure to various styles, subjects, and contexts.
Development of Aesthetic Preferences
: Just like a genetic algorithm evolves solutions over iterations, a person's aesthetic preferences evolve as they experience more art. This evolution is informed by emotional responses, intellectual engagement, cultural background, and personal experiences. Each new artwork contributes to refining these preferences, leading to a more sophisticated appreciation over time.
Artwork Complexity and Viewer Engagement
: Complex artworks that offer depth and layers for interpretation can be seen as adding constraints or new parameters to the 'algorithm' of aesthetic preference. Such pieces might challenge existing preferences, leading to a re-evaluation or refinement of what is considered appealing or meaningful.
Changing Perceptions Over Time
: The way an artwork is perceived can change with repeated viewings or over time. Discovering new details in a complex piece may enhance appreciation, similar to how additional information can lead to a better solution in a genetic algorithm. Conversely, noticing flaws or discordant elements in an artwork can lead to a diminished appreciation, akin to identifying weaknesses in a solution.
Collective Evolution of Art
: While each individual has their own 'algorithm' running, the collective preferences of a society or culture also evolve, influenced by trends, movements, and shared experiences. This collective evolution shapes the art landscape, influencing what types of art are produced, celebrated, or fade into obscurity.
Feedback Loops
: The interaction between art and viewer is not one-way. Artists often respond to audience reactions, critiques, and prevailing trends, leading to an iterative feedback loop. This dynamic resembles the evolutionary process where environmental feedback influences the direction of evolution.
Your idea beautifully illustrates how the principles of evolution and genetic algorithms can metaphorically apply to the way humans interact with and appreciate art. It suggests that our engagement with art is not static but is a constantly evolving process shaped by personal and collective experiences, much like the evolutionary processes observed in nature and computational models.

So she mentioned evolution and natural selection of SHAGs but maybe not enough about human development per se, or active inference and predictive coding. My idea is that the brain and body is like an evolving ecosystem, the genetic code doesn't have to provide a development plan, just provide replicators, mutation, and crossover between "agents" (cells and organelles), or ideas (after the development of a symbolic system (mind), a mental "filing cabinet" or sorting system using semantic and narrative structures to compress knowledge.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your idea expands on the concepts discussed by Monica Anderson, incorporating elements of human development, active inference, predictive coding, and the notion of the brain and body as evolving ecosystems. Here's a breakdown of how these concepts intertwine with your idea:
Brain and Body as Evolving Ecosystems
: You're suggesting that the brain and body function similarly to ecosystems, where various elements (like cells and organelles) interact and evolve. This concept aligns with the idea that biological evolution doesn't just happen at the level of organisms or species but also at the micro-level within an organism.
Development Without a Predetermined Plan
: The notion that genetic code provides the basic elements for life (like replicators, mutation, and crossover) but not a detailed developmental plan is an interesting perspective. It implies that much of development is emergent, resulting from interactions of simpler elements rather than following a rigid, pre-programmed path.
Active Inference and Predictive Coding
: Active inference refers to the idea that the brain continuously makes predictions about the world and then updates these predictions based on sensory input. Predictive coding is a related concept where the brain tries to minimize the difference between its predictions and actual sensory input. These processes can be seen as part of the brain's evolving understanding of the world, constantly adapting and learning from experience.
Symbolic Systems and Mental "Filing Cabinets"
: With the development of symbolic thinking (language, abstract concepts), the brain creates complex structures for organizing and compressing knowledge. This can be likened to a mental "filing cabinet" where ideas are sorted, categorized, and interconnected. Your analogy suggests that this system itself evolves, adapting to new information and experiences.
Semantic and Narrative Structures
: These structures are crucial for compressing and making sense of knowledge. Semantic structures help us understand and categorize concepts based on their meanings and relationships to each other. Narrative structures allow us to frame experiences and knowledge in a story-like format, making them more memorable and understandable.
Evolution of Ideas
: Just as cells and genes undergo evolution, so too do ideas and mental models. This cognitive evolution is driven by exposure to new information, experiences, and the inherent need of the brain to make sense of the world. Ideas that are more successful in explaining or predicting experiences are more likely to be retained and built upon.
Your perspective integrates concepts from biology, neuroscience, and psychology to form a comprehensive view of human development and cognition. It suggests that much of our mental and physical development is a result of evolutionary processes, both biological and cognitive, continually shaping and reshaping our understanding of the world.

So I mentioned elsewhere that a path through the forest is kind of like a neuron that gets reinforced with use. If deer use the path it packs down the ground, clears away brush, making the path larger with each use, and growing over if abandoned
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your analogy of a path through the forest being similar to a neuron that gets reinforced with use is a compelling and illustrative way to understand certain aspects of neural function, particularly the concept of synaptic plasticity in neuroscience. Here���s how your analogy aligns with this concept:
Path Formation and Neuronal Connections
: In a forest, a path forms when it's frequently traveled. Similarly, in the brain, neural pathways strengthen when they are frequently used. This is akin to the ���use it or lose it��� principle in neural plasticity, where frequently used connections become stronger and more efficient, while those that are rarely used may weaken or fade.
Reinforcement with Use
: Just as a forest path becomes more defined and easier to travel with repeated use (e.g., as animals continually walk on it, compressing the soil and clearing brush), synaptic connections in the brain can strengthen with repeated activation. This process is known as long-term potentiation (LTP), a primary mechanism for learning and memory.
Growth and Decay
: If a path in the forest is not used, it may eventually become overgrown and disappear. Similarly, in the brain, neural connections that are not frequently activated can weaken over time, a process known as synaptic pruning. This is part of the brain's way of maintaining efficiency, by eliminating less-used connections.
Adaptive Nature
: Both the forest path and neural pathways are adaptive. The path evolves based on the needs and movements of the forest inhabitants. In the brain, synaptic connections adapt based on experiences and learning, constantly reorganizing to reflect new information or skills.
Environmental Interaction
: The formation of a path in a forest is a response to environmental needs and conditions, just as the development of neural pathways is influenced by environmental stimuli and experiences.
Your analogy is a useful tool for conceptualizing how neural pathways in the brain develop and change over time, emphasizing the dynamic and adaptive nature of the brain's learning processes. It highlights the importance of activity and experience in shaping both the physical and neurological landscape.
You
So my idea is that attentional cladistics which tracks the development of foraging patterns over time. Art appreciation can increase with learning because new visual foraging methods are use to extract more information from scenes
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your concept of "attentional cladistics" to track the development of visual foraging patterns, especially in the context of art appreciation, is an innovative way to merge cognitive science with evolutionary principles. Let's delve into how this idea might work:
Attentional Cladistics
: Cladistics in biology is the classification of species based on shared characteristics and common ancestry. Applying this to attention and perception, "attentional cladistics" could refer to the classification and tracking of how attentional patterns (specifically visual foraging behaviors) evolve over time in individuals or populations. This evolution would be based on learning, exposure to different visual stimuli, and the development of perceptual skills.
Visual Foraging in Art Appreciation
: Visual foraging refers to the way we visually scan an environment or scene to gather information. In the context of art, this means how one views and interprets a piece of artwork. Over time, as one becomes more experienced in viewing art, their visual foraging methods may become more sophisticated, allowing them to extract deeper or more nuanced information from the art.
Learning and Art Appreciation
: Just as foraging animals improve their strategies with experience, humans can refine their art appreciation skills through learning and repeated exposure. This process can involve developing a keener eye for detail, a deeper understanding of artistic techniques and symbolism, or a broader knowledge of historical and cultural contexts.
Evolution of Perception and Attention
: Your idea implies that attention and perception are not static but evolve both within the lifetime of an individual and across generations. This evolution is shaped by a combination of innate predispositions, personal experiences, cultural influences, and educational backgrounds.
Application in Art Education and Therapy
: Understanding how attentional cladistics operates in the context of art appreciation could have practical applications. For example, it could inform teaching methods in art education, helping students develop more effective visual foraging strategies. It could also be useful in art therapy, where understanding a client's unique perceptual and attentional patterns might aid in tailoring therapeutic approaches.
Technology and Attentional Cladistics
: With advancements in eye-tracking technology and neuroimaging, it might be possible to empirically study attentional cladistics. Researchers could track how individuals' gaze patterns and neural responses to art change over time, providing a more objective measure of the evolution of their visual foraging strategies.
Your idea proposes a fascinating way to study and understand the development of art appreciation, merging concepts from evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, and the arts. It suggests that just as organisms adapt their foraging strategies for survival, humans adapt their perceptual strategies for deeper understanding and appreciation of art.
You
A few more connections with earlier concepts
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly, let's connect your concept of attentional cladistics with the earlier discussed concepts to create a more comprehensive view:
Genetic Algorithms and Attentional Cladistics
: The principle of genetic algorithms (GAs) - evolving solutions over generations - can parallel how attentional patterns in art appreciation might evolve. Just as GAs optimize solutions through crossover and mutation, humans might optimize their visual foraging strategies over time, influenced by learning and exposure to different artworks. The process of refining art appreciation skills mirrors the iterative improvement seen in GAs.
Neural Pathways and Visual Foraging
: The analogy of a path in a forest to neural pathways can be extended to attentional cladistics. As one's art appreciation skills evolve, this could be mirrored neurologically in the strengthening of certain neural pathways associated with visual processing and aesthetic judgment. Just like a frequently used forest path becomes more defined, frequently used neural pathways related to art perception become stronger.
Evolutionary Computation and Human Cognitive Development
: Monica Anderson's discussion on SHAGs and EC's role in AI can be linked to the idea of attentional cladistics. The evolution of human cognitive strategies for art appreciation can be seen as an organic form of evolutionary computation, where the 'algorithm' improves not through coded instructions but through experiential learning and cultural exposure.
Holistic Systems and Art Appreciation
: Anderson's view of holistic systems, where outputs are not always optimal or explainable, can relate to how individuals perceive and interpret art. Art appreciation is a holistic experience; it's subjective and influenced by a myriad of factors - personal history, cultural background, education, etc. - much like the outputs of a holistic system in AI.
Active Inference and Predictive Coding in Art Viewing
: The concept of active inference and predictive coding can be applied to how we perceive and appreciate art. As we view art, our brain makes predictions based on prior knowledge and experiences. The continuous feedback loop of prediction and sensory input adjustment is similar to how we refine our appreciation and understanding of art over time.
Cultural Evolution of Art and Individual Perception
: The earlier discussion about the evolution of art styles and cultural influences also ties in. Just as art evolves culturally, individual art appreciation (and thus attentional cladistics) evolves personally. This personal evolution is influenced by the broader cultural evolution of art, highlighting the interplay between individual cognition and collective cultural trends.
In summary, the concept of attentional cladistics in art appreciation can be richly informed by these earlier discussions, integrating ideas from evolutionary algorithms, neural plasticity, holistic systems, and predictive cognitive models. This integration underscores the complexity of human cognition and perception, especially in the context of aesthetic experiences.

Can you find connections with attribution theory in psychology?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Attribution theory in psychology, which focuses on how people explain the causes of behavior and events, can indeed be connected with the concept of attentional cladistics and our previous discussions. Here are some ways in which these concepts intersect:
Attribution Theory and Art Interpretation
: When viewing art, people often make attributions about the artist's intentions, the meaning of the artwork, and its cultural significance. Attentional cladistics, which deals with the evolution of visual foraging patterns, could influence how individuals interpret these aspects. For example, a more experienced art viewer might attribute different meanings or intentions to an artwork compared to a novice, based on their evolved perceptual strategies and understanding of art.
Evolution of Attributions in Art Appreciation
: Just as attentional patterns evolve over time with exposure and learning, so too can the attributions people make about art. This evolution can be influenced by expanding knowledge about art history, techniques, and cultural contexts, leading to more nuanced or sophisticated attributions.
Attribution Theory and Learning from Artistic Feedback
: In the context of learning and improving art appreciation skills, attribution theory can play a role. How individuals attribute their successes or failures in understanding or appreciating art (to personal effort, innate ability, external guidance, etc.) can affect their motivation to learn and adapt their visual foraging strategies.
Attributions and Holistic Systems
: Relating to Anderson's discussion of holistic systems in AI, people's attributions about the outputs of these systems (like LLMs or GAs) can affect how they interact with and interpret these technologies. Similarly, in art appreciation, the attributions made about an artwork (its quality, meaning, etc.) influence the viewer's engagement and interpretation.
Neural Pathways and Attribution Processes
: The concept of neural pathways strengthening with use, akin to a path in the forest, can also apply to attribution processes. As individuals repeatedly engage in making attributions, whether in everyday life or in specific contexts like art appreciation, the neural pathways associated with these cognitive processes may become more efficient and robust.
Genetic Algorithms, Attribution, and Art Evolution
: In the broader context of genetic algorithms and evolutionary computation, the way individuals make attributions about art can be seen as part of the 'evolution' of art appreciation skills. Just as genetic algorithms optimize solutions through iterative processes, people might refine their art interpretation skills over time, influenced by their attributions about what makes art meaningful or valuable.
In summary, attribution theory in psychology provides a valuable lens for understanding how individuals interpret and engage with art, as well as how their perceptual and interpretative strategies evolve. It underscores the role of cognitive processes in shaping our experiences and understanding of art, and how these processes are influenced by learning, experience, and cultural context.

Originally, attribution theory was an area of social psychology introduced by Heider (1958). It explains how people attribute causes to events and how this cognitive perception affects their motivation. Another important contribution from social psychology is the locus of control theory, which is more concerned with individual differences in attributions. A central assumption of both theoretical approaches is the distinction between internal and external loci of causality of good or bad results of behavior. In the 1970s, Bernard Weiner made some important contributions to the attribution theory, adding the dimension of temporal stability vs. instability and later that of responsibility (or controllability), which indicates whether a causal factor of success or failure could be perceived as internal or external to a person.

Internal vs. External Loci of Causality
: In the realm of art appreciation, an individual's attribution of their ability to understand or appreciate art might fall along the internal-external causality spectrum. For example, some might attribute their understanding of art to internal factors like innate talent or effort (internal locus), while others might attribute it to external factors like education or cultural exposure (external locus). These attributions can influence their approach to learning and engaging with art.
Temporal Stability vs. Instability
: This dimension of attribution theory can relate to how people perceive their evolving art appreciation skills. If someone views their ability to appreciate art as stable (unchanging over time), they might be less inclined to engage in activities that could further develop their visual foraging strategies. Conversely, seeing this ability as unstable (changeable over time) might encourage more active engagement and learning.
Responsibility (or Controllability)
: Applying this aspect to art appreciation, an individual might consider whether their skill in understanding art is controllable (and thus their responsibility) or influenced by factors outside their control. This perception can affect their motivation to enhance their appreciation skills and engage with different art forms.
Application in Attentional Cladistics
: Attentional cladistics, which tracks the evolution of visual foraging patterns, could be influenced by how individuals attribute their ability to process and interpret visual information. Those with an internal locus of causality might actively seek experiences that challenge and refine their attentional strategies, while those with an external locus might attribute changes in their visual foraging to external influences.
Influence on Neural Pathways
: The locus of control and stability of attributions might also influence the strengthening or weakening of neural pathways related to art perception and appreciation, analogous to the path in the forest analogy. Individuals who believe they can improve their skills (internal, unstable attributions) might engage more actively in art appreciation, thereby reinforcing relevant neural pathways.
Relation to Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary Computation
: The principles of attribution theory can be mirrored in how individuals engage with and understand the process of genetic algorithms or evolutionary computation in problem-solving. Their perception of control over and stability of these processes can influence their engagement and understanding.
In sum, the principles of attribution theory provide a valuable framework for understanding individual differences in the evolution and development of art appreciation skills, attentional strategies, and engagement with complex problem-solving methods like genetic algorithms. These psychological factors play a significant role in shaping cognitive processes and learning behaviors.

Incorporating attribution theory into the understanding of attentional cladistics and art appreciation can indeed be helpful. It provides a psychological framework for understanding how individuals perceive and interpret their interactions with art and their learning processes. Here's how it can be beneficial:
Understanding Motivation in Learning and Appreciation
: Attribution theory helps explain what motivates people to engage with art and improve their art appreciation skills. By understanding whether individuals attribute their ability to internal or external factors, we can better comprehend their willingness to invest time and effort in developing their visual foraging strategies.
Personalizing Art Education
: In educational settings, knowledge of attribution theory can guide the development of tailored art education programs. For learners who attribute success to external factors, educators might focus on providing external resources and structured guidance. For those who attribute success to internal factors, encouraging independent exploration and self-directed learning might be more effective.
Enhancing Art Therapy Practices
: In art therapy, understanding a client's attribution style can inform the therapeutic approach. Therapists can help clients reframe attributions that may hinder their engagement with art-making or appreciation, fostering a more empowering and positive experience.
Designing Public Art Programs and Exhibitions
: Awareness of how different people attribute their art understanding can inform the design of art programs and exhibitions. Curators and program designers can create experiences that cater to a diverse range of attribution styles, enhancing accessibility and engagement for a broader audience.
Research in Art Psychology
: Attribution theory provides a framework for research on how individuals interact with and perceive art. It can be used to study variations in art appreciation based on different attribution styles, contributing to a deeper understanding of the cognitive and psychological aspects of art perception.
In summary, applying attribution theory to the concept of attentional cladistics and art appreciation offers a nuanced way to understand the psychological underpinnings of how people engage with, learn about, and appreciate art. It underscores the importance of considering individual differences in cognitive perceptions and motivational factors in both educational and therapeutic contexts related to art.
