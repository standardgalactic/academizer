ABSTRACT 
Whenhumanprogrammershavemasteredaprogramminglanguage, itwouldbeeasierwhentheylearn 
a new programming language. In this report, we focus on exploring whether programming languages 
can boost each other during the instruction i ne-tuning phase of code large language models. We 
conduct extensive experiments of8popular programming languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, 
C, C++, Java, Go, HTML) on StarCoder. Results demonstrate that programming languages can 
signif i cantly improve each other. For example, CODEM-Python15B trained on Python is able to 
increase Java by an absolute17.95% pass@1on HumanEval-X. More surprisingly, we found that 
CODEM-HTML7B trained on the HTML corpus can improve Java by an absolute15.24% pass@1.

1Introduction 
Code large language models (code LLMs) are blooming recently [Zan et al., 2023]. A lot of code LLMs are released 
in succession, e.g., Codex [Chen et al., 2021], AlphaCode [Li et al., 2022], PaLM-Coder [Chowdhery et al., 2022], 
CodeGen [Nijkamp et al., 2023], CodeGeeX [Zheng et al., 2023], StarCoder [Li et al., 2023], and Code Llama [Rozi��re 
et al., 2023]. Owing to their amazing code generation performance, code LLMs have attracted considerable attention 
from both academic and industrial circles. Recent works [Ouyang et al., 2022] have witnessed the instruction tuning 
technique that can teach LLMs how to follow instructions. In the realm of code generation, WizardCoder [Luo et al., 
2023] and PanGu-Coder2 [Shen et al., 2023] also adopt this technique to elicit their code generation capabilities. 
Although some code LLMs, such as CodeGen-Multi Nijkamp et al. [2023] and StarCoder-base Li et al. [2023], are 
trained on corpora spanning multiple programming languages, the interplay among these languages remains unexplored. 
In programming practice, once a human programmer has mastered a programming language, it would be easier to 
learn a new one due to the homogeneity between programming languages. Motivated by this, we would like to explore 
whether different programming languages can boost each other during instruction i ne-tuning of code LLMs. 
To explore this idea, we craft the training corpus for each of8popular programming languages (Python, JavaScript, 
TypeScript, C, C++, Java, Go, HTML), where each language includes about9K programming exercises. We train 
StarCoder7B using the instruction tuning technique on each programming language corpus separately, and test the 
performance of each i ne-tuned model across every programming language. Our i ndings reveal that programming 
languages can signif i cantly boost each other. Meanwhile, we found that the improvement margin of different program- 
ming languages to each other is related to the language similarity between them. For example, CODEM-JavaScript 
7B trained on JavaScript data can yield an absolute11.80% pass@1improvement in TypeScript. More interestingly,

The provided abstract details a technical report examining the interaction between programming languages and their potential to improve each other, especially during instruction fine-tuning phases of code large language models (code LLMs).
Key Takeaways
:
Interplay Among Languages
: While many large language models trained for code (like Codex, AlphaCode, StarCoder, etc.) are available, the interaction between various programming languages within these models remains a less explored area. This study seeks to address this gap.
Boosting Through Homogeneity
: There's a notion that once a programmer masters one language, learning another becomes simpler due to similarities between them. The authors used this idea to investigate if programming languages can assist in enhancing each other when instruction fine-tuning code LLMs.
Experiments & Results
: Eight popular programming languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Java, Go, and HTML) were considered for experiments using StarCoder. Findings indicate that programming languages can indeed boost one another significantly. For instance, a model trained only on Python data can notably improve performance on Java. Even more surprising is the fact that training on HTML (which is a markup language and not a traditional programming language) can also greatly enhance performance on Java.
Language Similarity Matters
: The extent to which one language boosts another appears to be related to their similarities. For example, training on JavaScript resulted in significant improvement in TypeScript (which is quite expected, given that TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript).
Public Dataset
: The authors intend to release their training data to the public, which can be beneficial for further research in this domain.
Implications
: The study underscores the potential of leveraging knowledge from one programming language to enhance performance in another, particularly in the context of large language models for code. This can have substantial implications for the way LLMs are trained in the future and can pave the way for more efficient and versatile code-generating models.

2Methodology 
2.1Crafting Training Corpus of Eight Programming Languages 
We select8popular programming languages and construct their training data separately. Our selected languages include 
Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Java, Go, and HTML, covering diverse types such as procedure-oriented, 
object-oriented, script, and even markup languages. For each programming language, we construct its training data 
containing about9K data pairs. Each pair includes both an instruction describing the programming problem and its 
corresponding response. One practical example of HTML is shown in Figure 1. 
Based on these selected languages, we construct a series of monolingual datasets. We start from the dataset of 
CodeAlpaca 20K2, and extract those Python-related data to form our seed instruction set. Then for each selected 
programming language, we evolve existent instructions in the seed instruction set to get corresponding new ones by 
prompting OpenAI���s GPT-3.53. For all the selected languages except HTML, we adopt an in-depth evolution [Xu et al., 
2023], by asking GPT-3.5 to rewrite the seed instruction (Python) into a more complicated version relevant to the target 
language (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Java, or Go). However, for HTML, we adopt in-breadth evolution to 
produce a brand-new HTML-related instruction, since HTML (markup language) is too different from other languages 
(non-markup languages). 
2.2Instruction Tuning 
Code pre-trained models such as Codex [Chen et al., 2021] and StarCoder [Li et al., 2023] store a wealth of code 
knowledge. However, these models only support left-to-right code generation based on context, as they are trained 
solely on plain code snippets. Of late, the instruction tuning techniques [Ouyang et al., 2022, Luo et al., 2023, Shen 
et al., 2023] are proposed, which can enhance the model���s capabilities of following instructions so as to enable chat 
features. During instruction tuning, we train StarCoder using the prompt in Figure 2 to obtain our CODEM. We use 
DeepSpeed to accelerate the training of CODEM withfp16enabled. Additionally, we set the batch size to2per GPU, 
the learning rate to2e-5with a cosine annealing schedule, the gradient accumulation steps to4, and the warmup steps 
to30. After instruction tuning, we use the prompt in Figure 3 to do the inference on downstream tasks across various 
programming languages. For inference, we adopt the greedy decoding strategy for sampling. Given that CODEM is a chat-style model, the responses it generates often contain elements beyond just codes, which typically makes them 
non-executable. So, we extract the code snippets from the generated response to evaluate the performance of code 
generation.

The "Methodology" section provides an in-depth view into the research approach. Here's a concise breakdown:
2.1 Crafting Training Corpus of Eight Programming Languages
:
Languages Selected
: Eight programming languages were chosen - Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Java, Go, and HTML. These languages span different types like procedure-oriented, object-oriented, script, and markup languages.
Data Construction
: For each language, about 9K data pairs were constructed. Each pair had an instruction describing a programming problem and its respective solution.
Monolingual Datasets
: The base dataset, named CodeAlpaca 20K2, was used to extract Python-related data which formed the seed instruction set. For each language, they adapted the seed instructions by utilizing OpenAI���s GPT-3.5.
For languages other than HTML: The Python instruction was re-written to a more intricate version related to the target language.
For HTML: A completely new instruction was generated since HTML is markedly different from the others.
2.2 Instruction Tuning
:
Code Pre-trained Models
: Models like Codex and StarCoder have vast code knowledge, but they typically generate code in a left-to-right fashion based on the context.
Instruction Tuning Technique
: New techniques have been proposed that enable these models to better follow given instructions, thus allowing for chat-like features. The research used StarCoder, guided by specific prompts, for instruction tuning.
Training Parameters
: Training was sped up using DeepSpeed with fp16 enabled. Specific training parameters like batch size, learning rate, gradient accumulation steps, and warm-up steps were detailed.
Inference
: After training, a different prompt was used for inference across various languages. A greedy decoding strategy was chosen for sampling. Given that their model is chat-style, the responses often have non-code elements. Therefore, code snippets were extracted from these responses to evaluate the code generation capability.
Implication
: The methodology underscores the process of creating training datasets for diverse programming languages and refining large code models to understand and follow given instructions. By understanding these models' potential and limitations, the researchers can fine-tune them to generate accurate and efficient code across various programming languages.

their base model StarCoder7B across all programming languages by a large margin. Also, we found that programming 
languages can boost each other signif i cantly. For example, CODEM-Python trained solely on Python corpus is able 
to improve HumanEval-Java by an absolute14.03% pass@1. This i nding reveals the inherent commonalities among 
different programming languages. More surprisingly, CODEM-HTML boosts HumanEval-Java by an absolute15.24% 
pass@1, even exceeding CODEM-Java. Similarly, CODEM-C++ beats CODEM-C on HumanEval-C, and CODEM- 
JavaScript beats CODEM-TypeScript on HumanEval-Typescript. Drawing upon these observations, we conjecture that 
the improvement in multilingual code generation performance is predominantly due to instruction tuning unlocking 
the model���s inherent potential, such as natural or programming language understanding and following-instruction 
capabilities, rather than merely incorporating new knowledge. In addition to training CODEM on a monolingual training 
corpus, we further construct a9K multilingual training set covering8programming languages. Although each language 
comprises only a small amount (~1.2K) of training instances, experimental i ndings suggest that CODEM-Mixed excels 
in all languages, even surpassing CODEM-Python on HumanEval-Python and CODEM-Java on HumanEval-Java. This 
suggests that it is possible to yield superior code generation performance by leveraging multilingual data in instruction 
tuning, without harming the generalization of the model. 
We also conduct experiments on StarCoder15B to verify the effectiveness of CODEM. Specif i cally, we obtain108K 
Python training data following WizardCoder [Luo et al., 2023], and i netune StarCoder15B to get CODEM-Python. 
The results are shown in Table 2. CODEM-Python achieves state-of-the-art performance on HumanEval-Python with 
64.63% pass@1, compared with other models of the same scale. CODEM-Python also gets a tremendous improvement 
in the generation of other programming languages. For instance, it improves Java and JavaScript by an absolute17.95% 
and 16.77% pass@1, respectively. 
3.2.2Closer Analysis 
We analyze the correlation between different programming languages. As illustrated in Figure 4 (a), the improvement 
of code generation performance is sensitive to training corpus of different programming languages. Moreover, we 
found that C and C++ can boost each other more signif i cantly, which is the same for JavaScript and TypeScript. It is 
reasonable because these languages are correlated to each other in language design, sharing some common syntax and 
grammar. Figure 4 (b) shows that training on each programming language can boost the code generation performance 
of all other languages. We can see that the correlation values in Figure 4 (b) are mostly all positive, implying that the 
improvement trend of different language brought by one monolingual training corpus is relatively similar.

4Related Work 
Codex [Chen et al., 2021] with 12-billion parameters is able to solve Python programming problems automatically. 
This remarkable success triggered a signif i cant buzz in both the academic and industrial realms. Followed by Codex, 
a plenty of code LLMs are proposed, including AlphaCode [Li et al., 2022], PaLM-Coder [Chowdhery et al., 2022], 
CodeGen [Nijkamp et al., 2023], InCoder [Fried et al., 2023], CodeGeeX [Zheng et al., 2023], replit4, CodeT5 [Wang 
et al., 2021, 2023], PyCodeGPT [Zan et al., 2022], SantaCoder [Allal et al., 2023], StarCoder [Li et al., 2023], 
Code Llama [Rozi��re et al., 2023], and phi-1 [Gunasekar et al., 2023]. These above models are trained on a large- 
scale code corpus and achieve impressive code generation performance. During their pre-training, some models are 
trained on datasets of multilingual programming languages and then i ne-tuned on a monolingual dataset to produce a 
more powerful specialist version. As for the instruction i ne-tuning phase, WizardCoder [Luo et al., 2023], PanGu- 
Coder2 [Shen et al., 2023], and Phind-CodeLlama5are proposed to bolster the capability of following instructions and 
further boost the code generation capability. Yet, none of these aforementioned models explore the intricate interplay 
between different programming languages. In this report, we therefore would like to investigate whether training code 
LLMs on monolingual data can bolster performance in other programming languages. 
5Conclusion 
Our i ndings reveal that a monolingual training corpus can enhance the multilingual code generation capabilities of 
code LLMs via instruction tuning. This highlights the intrinsic commonality and interconnectedness among multiple 
programming languages. In our future work, we plan to delve into the reasons why multiple languages can enhance 
each other. Also, we will explore how to leverage our i ndings to elevate code generation capabilities for these obscure 
or less-used programming languages by training on data from those popular ones.

Here's a concise summary of the provided text:
Results
:
The base model, StarCoder7B, was surpassed across all programming languages. It was observed that different programming languages can enhance each other significantly. For example, training solely on Python data improved performance on Java tests. This suggests that there are inherent similarities across programming languages.
Interestingly, training on HTML data improved Java performance even more than training on Java data itself. Other examples include CODEM-C++ outperforming CODEM-C on C tests and CODEM-JavaScript surpassing CODEM-TypeScript on TypeScript tests.
These observations suggest that the improvements might stem more from unlocking the model's potential through instruction tuning than just incorporating new knowledge.
When training on a mixed set of languages, the results were even more promising. This indicates that multilingual data can enhance code generation capabilities without compromising generalization.
Closer Analysis
:
The relationship between different programming languages was explored. The correlation between languages like C and C++, as well as JavaScript and TypeScript, is strong due to shared syntax and design.
Training on one language positively impacts code generation capabilities in other languages.
Related Work
:
The success of Codex, with 12-billion parameters, sparked significant interest. This led to the development of several models like AlphaCode, PaLM-Coder, CodeGen, and more. Some models fine-tuned on monolingual datasets to generate specialist versions.

Let's delve deeper into the etymological roots of "Haplopraxis":

1. Haplo-

Origin: Derived from Ancient Greek.

Root Word: "�������������" (hapl��os)

Meaning: In its ancient context, "�������������" can be understood to mean "single", "simple", or "uncompounded". In many contexts today, especially scientific, "haplo-" has been employed to indicate singleness or simplicity. For instance:

Haploid: In biology, it describes cells that have a single set of chromosomes, as opposed to diploid cells, which have two sets.

Haploidy: Refers to the state of being haploid.

Haplotype: A combination of alleles (DNA sequences) at different places (loci) on the chromosome that are transmitted together.

2. -praxis

Origin: Derived from Ancient Greek.

Root Word: "�������������" (pr��xis)

Meaning: The term "�������������" in ancient contexts denotes "action", "activity", or "a doing". It was also employed philosophically, especially by Aristotle, to indicate a form of ethical or practical thought as opposed to mere theory ("theoria"). In modern usage:

Praxis: Often indicates practice or action, especially in contrast to theoretical knowledge. For instance, in pedagogy, the term often refers to the practice of teaching. In some contexts, it is also used as a synonym for "method" or "technique".

Malpraxis: As previously mentioned, refers to bad practice or negligence, especially in the medical field.

Given the etymological breakdown, "Haplopraxis" conveys a rich tapestry of meanings, but at its core, it suggests a concept based on a "single/simple action or practice". In the context of your game, this is both descriptive and evocative, encapsulating the straightforward yet potentially layered experience of the gameplay.

I was thinking of Wittgenstein's ladder.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, Wittgenstein's ladder, often referred to metaphorically as a tool that is discarded once its purpose is fulfilled. Ludwig Wittgenstein, in his early work "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus," touches on this idea, suggesting that once one understands the propositions and climbs the ladder, they must throw it away. It is a profound concept that encapsulates the idea of using foundational or simpler concepts to reach a higher understanding and then discarding or moving beyond those basic concepts.
Incorporating this perspective into the aforementioned essay:
Cognitive Vaporware: Wittgenstein's Ladder in a Digital Age
As we ascend the complex edifice of modern technology, Wittgenstein's metaphor of the ladder finds renewed relevance. This essay ventures into the realm where artificial intelligence, Vim's intricate commands, and augmented realities converge, reflecting on how these tools serve as rungs that elevate our cognitive experiences.
GPT-3.5, a monument of artificial intelligence, represents a pivotal rung in our climb. Its prowess in programming underscores the importance of crafting a meticulous training corpus and instruction tuning. But, like any initial understanding, is it merely a stepping stone to be discarded in pursuit of greater comprehension?
Similarly, the Vim text editor, with its convoluted commands, acts as a cognitive ladder. Its mastery, though arduous, paves the way for heightened efficiency and capability. But in our digital ascent, at what point do we transcend these commands, rendering them mere vestiges of our early climb?
The universe of "������L����R������S" extends this metaphor further, positioning players on the precipice of cognitive challenges. Tasked with managing an expansive celestial watchlist, players grapple with cognitive load theory's constraints. Yet, as they ascend, reshuffle, and adapt, might they too leave behind earlier strategies, echoing Wittgenstein's notion of discarding the ladder once ascended?
"Cognitive Vaporware" is more than a term; it is a reflection on our digital ascent. As we navigate the nexus of AI, Vim, and augmented realities, we are consistently challenged to discern when to grasp the ladder's rungs tightly and when to let them go. Through this essay, we explore the transformative journey of understanding, from foundational tools to transcendent realizations, reminding us that in our relentless pursuit of knowledge, sometimes what we leave behind is as significant as what we carry forward.
