an autohotkey command that Send a control f for f and control v for v while active (!i - alt + i to activate and toggle off)
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Creating an AutoHotkey script to send
Ctrl+F
when the
F
key is pressed and
Ctrl+V
when the
V
key is pressed, with the script being toggled on and off by pressing
Alt+I
, involves using hotkeys and the
Send
command in AutoHotkey. Here's a script that accomplishes this:
ahk
Copy code
#Persistent
Toggle := False

!i:: ; Alt+i to toggle the script on and off
    Toggle := !Toggle
    If (Toggle)
        Tooltip, Hotkey Script Activated
    Else
        Tooltip, Hotkey Script Deactivated
    SetTimer, RemoveTooltip, 1500 ; Show tooltip for 1.5 seconds
return

RemoveTooltip:
    SetTimer, RemoveTooltip, Off
    Tooltip
return

#If (Toggle) ; The following hotkeys work only when Toggle is True

    f:: ; When F is pressed
        Send, ^f ; Send Ctrl+F
    return

    v:: ; When V is pressed
        Send, ^v ; Send Ctrl+V
    return

#If ; End of conditional hotkeys
This script works as follows:
#Persistent
keeps the script running continuously.
!i
is the hotkey for
Alt+I
. When pressed, it toggles the script on or off.
#If (Toggle)
makes the hotkeys for
F
and
V
only active when the script is toggled on.
f::
and
v::
define what happens when
F
and
V
are pressed, respectively.
Send, ^f
sends
Ctrl+F
, and
Send, ^v
sends
Ctrl+V
.
The
RemoveTooltip
timer hides the tooltip after 1.5 seconds.
To use this script, you'll need AutoHotkey installed on your system. Save the script with a
.ahk
extension and run it. Press
Alt+I
to toggle the functionality on and off.

Your AutoHotkey script looks well-structured and should work effectively for your specified tasks. Here's a breakdown of the key parts of your script:
Initialization Settings
:
#NoTrayIcon
: Hides the tray icon.
#NoEnv
: Optimizes performance and ensures future compatibility.
#SingleInstance force
: Automatically replaces old instances of the script.
SetKeyDelay, 90
: Sets a delay of 90 milliseconds between keystrokes.
CoordMode,Mouse,Screen
and
CoordMode,Pixel,Screen
: Sets the coordinate mode for the mouse and pixel functions to be relative to the screen.
Logging Setup
:
You've set up a log file,
MyLog.txt
, in the script directory. However, the text appended to the log file seems to contain special characters (or possibly a character encoding issue). You might want to verify that this is the intended content.
Hotkey Toggle Functionality
:
#Persistent
: Keeps the script running after the auto-execute section.
!i::
: Toggles the hotkey functionality on and off with
Alt+I
.
Tooltip
: Shows a tooltip to indicate whether the script is activated or deactivated.
Conditional Hotkeys
:
#If (Toggle)
: Activates the following hotkeys only when the script is toggled on.
f::
: Sends
Ctrl+F
when
F
is pressed.
v::
: Sends
Ctrl+V
when
V
is pressed.
Mouse Position and Active Window Saving
:
MouseGetPos, xpos, ypos
: Saves the initial mouse position.
WinGet, SavedWinId, ID, A
: Saves the ID of the currently active window.
Overall, your script incorporates useful features like logging, tooltips, and a toggle mechanism for activating and deactivating hotkeys. Just make sure the text in the
FileAppend
command for the log file is correct and formatted as intended.

THe message is in standard galactic unicode, it says "This is a message`n" and the it says ; note the double backtick `` (The backtic is an escape character used in the newline (return) `n)
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Thank you for clarifying the content of the message in your AutoHotkey script. The use of Standard Galactic Unicode and the specific escape characters (`n for newline and `` for escaping the backtick) in AutoHotkey is a creative touch. Your script is well-crafted for its intended purpose, and the comments you've included are helpful for understanding the functionality and intent of each section.
In summary:
The use of Standard Galactic Unicode for the log file message adds a unique element to your script.
The escape character usage (`n for newline and `` for escaping the backtick) is correctly implemented in AutoHotkey.
This script demonstrates a good understanding of AutoHotkey's features and syntax, and it should perform effectively for your needs. The toggle feature for activating and deactivating hotkeys with
Alt+I
is particularly useful for managing when the script's functionality is active. Remember that if you share this script with others who might not be familiar with Standard Galactic Unicode, it might be helpful to include a comment explaining the encoding choice for clarity.
You
The purpose of the script is to page forward and backward in vim while reading subtitles along with a movie. So the Control-v should have been control-b, I've corrected it in my script. (Forward and Back)
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your adjustment to the script, changing
Control-V
to
Control-B
, makes sense given your specific use case of paging forward and backward in Vim while reading subtitles along with a movie. In Vim,
Control-B
is indeed the command for moving back one full screen (page up), and
Control-F
is for moving forward one full screen (page down). Here's the revised section of your script for these hotkeys:
ahk
Copy code
#If (Toggle) ; The following hotkeys work only when Toggle is True

    f:: ; When F is pressed
        Send, ^f ; Send Ctrl+F for moving forward a page in Vim
    return

    b:: ; When B is pressed
        Send, ^b ; Send Ctrl+B for moving back a page in Vim
    return

#If ; End of conditional hotkeys
This change will allow you to conveniently control the paging in Vim, which aligns with your goal of syncing your reading of subtitles with a movie. The
Alt+I
toggle functionality remains a practical approach to enabling and disabling these hotkey bindings as needed.
You
Could you write a comment to explain what the script is for? I used "setgui" as a hotstring for "set guifont=Fira_Mono_for_Powerline:h26 " which gives a larger font in gVim
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Adding a comment to your script to explain its purpose is a great idea for clarity, especially if you might share the script with others or refer back to it in the future. Here's a suggested comment that explains the script's functionality, including the hotstring for setting the font in gVim:
ahk
Copy code
/*
This AutoHotkey script is designed to facilitate reading subtitles along with a movie in Vim, a popular text editor. 
It allows the user to page forward and backward within the Vim editor, making it easier to synchronize text (like subtitles) 
with the movie playback. The script can be toggled on and off with Alt+I, which activates or deactivates special hotkeys:
- Pressing 'F' sends Ctrl+F to Vim, moving forward one full screen (page down).
- Pressing 'B' sends Ctrl+B to Vim, moving back one full screen (page up).
Additionally, the script includes a hotstring 'setgui' that, when typed, automatically expands to 
'set guifont=Fira_Mono_for_Powerline:h26', a command for setting a larger font in gVim, enhancing readability.
*/

#Persistent

    return

    b::Send, ^b ; When B is pressed, send Ctrl+B for moving back a page in Vim
    return
#If ; End of conditional hotkeys

; Additional script content...
This comment at the beginning of your script provides a clear overview of its purpose and functionality. It's a good practice to document scripts this way for future reference and ease of understanding for anyone else who might use or modify the script.

is there a vim command to turn off the blinking cursor? gvim?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In Vim and gVim, you can control the cursor's blinking behavior using the
guicursor
option. To turn off the blinking cursor, you would set this option in a way that disables the blinking. Here's how you can do it:
For Vim in Terminal
:
If you're using Vim in a terminal, the ability to disable the blinking cursor depends on the capabilities of the terminal emulator you're using, not Vim itself. Many terminal emulators have settings to control cursor blinking.
For gVim
:
In gVim, you can adjust the
guicursor
setting to stop the cursor from blinking. You would add the following line to your
.vimrc
or
_vimrc
file:
vim
Copy code
set guicursor=a:blinkon0
This command sets the cursor to not blink (
blinkon0
) for all modes (
a
). The
guicursor
option in gVim is very flexible and allows for a variety of configurations depending on the mode (like normal mode, insert mode, etc.).
After adding this line to your configuration file, the next time you open gVim, the cursor should no longer blink. Remember to restart gVim or source your
.vimrc
file for the changes to take effect. You can source the
.vimrc
file without restarting by running the command
:source ~/.vimrc
(or the appropriate path to your
.vimrc
file).
You
What about hiding the tool bar and menu bar at the top?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In gVim, you can hide both the toolbar and the menu bar to create a more minimalistic and distraction-free interface. Here's how you can do it:
Hiding the Toolbar
:
To hide the toolbar, you can add the following line to your
.vimrc
or
_vimrc
file:
vim
Copy code
set guioptions-=T
This command removes (
-=
) the toolbar (
T
) from the GUI options.
Hiding the Menu Bar
:
Similarly, to hide the menu bar, add this line to your
.vimrc
or
_vimrc
file:
vim
Copy code
set guioptions-=m
This command removes (
-=
) the menu bar (
m
) from the GUI options.
By adding these lines to your configuration file, both the toolbar and the menu bar will be hidden the next time you open gVim. As always, after making changes to your
.vimrc
file, you should either restart gVim or source the
.vimrc
file for the changes to take effect immediately. You can source the
.vimrc
file within gVim by running
:source ~/.vimrc
(or the appropriate path to your
.vimrc
file).
These settings help in creating a cleaner and more focused editing environment in gVim, especially useful if you prefer a minimalistic setup or need to maximize screen real estate.
You
and what about to set it to the dark blue color scheme?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
To set gVim to use a dark blue color scheme, you'll first need to choose a color scheme that fits this description. Vim comes with several pre-installed color schemes, and you can also download others. If you're looking for a dark blue-themed color scheme, you might want to try one like "blue" or "darkblue" that are typically included in standard Vim installations.
To set the color scheme in gVim, add the following line to your
.vimrc
or
_vimrc
file:
vim
Copy code
colorscheme darkblue
or
vim
Copy code
colorscheme blue
This will change the color scheme to "darkblue" or "blue", respectively. The "darkblue" scheme, as the name suggests, provides a darker blue theme, which might be what you're looking for.
If these pre-installed schemes don't meet your preferences, there are many more color schemes available online that you can download and install. Websites like
Vim Colors
showcase a wide variety of color schemes, and you might find one there that suits your dark blue theme requirement.
After you've set or installed your desired color scheme, remember to restart gVim or source your
.vimrc
file for the changes to take effect. You can source the
.vimrc
file by running the command
:source ~/.vimrc
within gVim.

Ok I found a shorter way. Here are my autohotkey shortcuts:

;; vim ;;

::noblink::set guicursor=a:blinkon0
::notools::set guioptions-=T
::nomenu::set guioptions-=m
::bluee::sima Eo{Down}`n`n
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Great! You've created AutoHotkey shortcuts (hotstrings) to quickly input Vim commands. These hotstrings are a convenient way to execute frequently used commands in Vim without having to type them out fully each time. Here's a breakdown of each hotstring you've set up:
::noblink::set guicursor=a:blinkon0
Typing
noblink
will expand to
set guicursor=a:blinkon0
, a command in Vim to disable cursor blinking.
::notools::set guioptions-=T
Typing
notools
will expand to
set guioptions-=T
, which will hide the toolbar in gVim.
::nomenu::set guioptions-=m
Typing
nomenu
will expand to
set guioptions-=m
, which will hide the menu bar in gVim.
::bluee::sima Eo{Down}
n
n
Typing
bluee
seems to expand to
sima Eo{Down}
n
n
. This command is a bit unclear. If
sima
and
Eo
are meant to be part of a Vim command or a part of a larger script, it's important to ensure that they correspond to valid operations or macros in your Vim setup. The
{Down}
n
n
part suggests sending a Down keypress followed by two new lines, but its purpose is not entirely clear in the context of Vim.
It's important to ensure that these commands align with what you intend to do in Vim. If
sima Eo{Down}
n
n
is part of a custom script or a specific set of operations in Vim, make sure it's correctly set up to perform the desired actions. Remember, for these hotstrings to work, Vim must be in insert mode, as AutoHotkey is essentially simulating keystrokes.
You
sima is short for simalt or simulate alt key in windows it selects the (E)dit menu then C(o)lor, and down to select dark blue from the menu, and attempt to Send a return but I still have to press an enter.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Thank you for the clarification. It seems that you've created an AutoHotkey hotstring to automate the process of selecting the dark blue color scheme from the Edit -> Color menu in a Windows application, presumably gVim, via simulated keystrokes.
To refine your hotstring for selecting the dark blue color scheme and to ensure that it sends an Enter keypress at the end, you can modify it like this:
ahk
Copy code
::bluee::Send, !e Down Down{Enter}
In this modified version:
Send, !e
simulates pressing Alt+E to open the Edit menu.
Down Down
simulates pressing the Down arrow key twice to navigate to the Color option (assuming 'Color' is two steps down from the top of the Edit menu).
{Enter}
sends an Enter keypress to select the option.
This script assumes that pressing Down twice from the Edit menu brings you to the Color option and that 'dark blue' is the first or a default selection in the color choices. If 'dark blue' is further down the list, you would need to add additional
Down
keystrokes accordingly.
Please adjust the number of
Down
keystrokes based on the exact menu structure of the application you're controlling. Remember, such scripts are highly dependent on the specific UI layout of the application, so any changes in the application's menu structure might require an update to the script.
You
::bluee::sima Eo{Down} works good enough for now
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Great! If the hotstring
::bluee::sima Eo{Down}
is working well for your needs, then that's excellent. It's always beneficial to have a solution that effectively accomplishes the task while remaining simple.
Just as a reminder, the way this hotstring works is:
When you type
bluee
, it triggers the AutoHotkey script.
The script simulates the keystrokes for selecting the dark blue color scheme from a menu in your application, which in this context, seems to be gVim.
As you continue to use and refine your AutoHotkey scripts, you might find new ways to enhance or streamline your workflow further. AutoHotkey is a powerful tool, and there's a lot of potentials to automate many different tasks to suit your specific needs.

I left the header bar and scroll bar but I have final tape over my monitor so I don't see them
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Using tape to physically cover parts of your monitor to hide the header bar and scroll bar is certainly a unique solution! It's an unconventional approach, but if it works for your needs and helps you focus on the content you want to see, that's what matters most.
However, if you're interested in a more software-based solution, most applications, including text editors like gVim, offer ways to customize the interface. For example, in gVim, you might be able to hide or minimize the appearance of these elements through settings or by editing your
.vimrc
file. Here are a couple of suggestions:
Hiding the Scroll Bar
:
In gVim, you can typically hide the scroll bar by adjusting the
guioptions
setting in your
.vimrc
file. For example:
vim
Copy code
set guioptions-=r  ; Remove the right-hand scroll bar
set guioptions-=L  ; Remove the left-hand scroll bar
Minimizing the Header Bar
:
While gVim doesn't offer a direct way to completely hide the title bar, you can simplify it. You might already have done this if you've hidden the menu and toolbars.
Using a Distraction-Free Mode
:
Some text editors and IDEs offer a "distraction-free" or "zen" mode that hides most UI elements to focus on the text. While Vim and gVim don't have this exact feature built-in, similar setups can be achieved with custom configurations.
Remember, any changes you make in the
.vimrc
file require a restart of gVim or sourcing the
.vimrc
file again to take effect.
But again, if your current setup with the tape is comfortable for you and serves your purpose, that's perfectly valid too. It's all about creating an environment that suits your workflow and preferences.
You
Yeah it's vinyl tape for an old labelling machine. I wrote a code earlier to hold down the control while I pressed f and b, only because I didn't find a rock heavy enough to hold down the control key, i was just going to sit it on the control key to lock it
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Using a script to simulate holding down the Control key while pressing 'F' and 'B' is a clever solution, especially compared to the more physical approach of using a rock to hold down a key! It's a good example of how automation can provide a more elegant and practical solution to a problem.
In the context of Vim (or gVim), where
Ctrl+F
and
Ctrl+B
are common commands for paging through text, having a script to facilitate this can be quite useful, especially if you're frequently using these commands. It not only saves physical effort but also adds a level of precision and control to your workflow.
If you have any more tasks you'd like to automate or streamline, or if you have any other questions or need assistance with your current scripts, feel free to ask. AutoHotkey and similar tools offer a lot of potentials to enhance and simplify various computing tasks.

Your AutoHotkey script is designed to automate the process of sending spacebar key presses, typically used for paging or scrolling in many applications, including reading with a Linux pager or similar text-viewing tools. Let's break down the key parts of your script:
Initialization
:
#NoEnv
and
SendMode Input
are standard lines for optimizing the performance and reliability of the script.
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%
ensures the script operates in the directory where it is located.
Commented Out Code
:
There are several blocks of commented-out code (
;
). These parts aren't currently active but might represent your previous attempts or variations of the script.
Infinite Loop for Sending Space
:
You have a loop that continuously sends the spacebar key press (
Send, {Space}
) with a
Sleep, 2
delay. However, this part is commented out, suggesting it's not in use.
Toggle Spacebar Press
:
The
!f
hotkey (Alt+F) is set to toggle an infinite loop that sends a spacebar key press at intervals controlled by
SetTimer
. The
State
variable seems to control whether the timer is on or off.
Additional Loop and Suspend Function
:
There's another loop set with
SetTimer, Loop, 1
and a hotkey
s
to break the loop and exit the application. This part sends a spacebar press at a 1.1-second interval (
Sleep 1100
).
^!s
(Ctrl+Alt+S) is used to suspend the script.
Cistercian and Deploy/Denounce Section
:
The sections labeled
cistercian
and
deploy/denounce script
are empty or contain commented-out code, possibly placeholders for future code or notes for yourself.
It appears that the main function of your script is to automate page scrolling or advancing in a reading application by repeatedly sending spacebar presses. The use of toggles and loops is a smart way to control the script's behavior. Just ensure that the intervals and triggers align with your desired user experience and the specific behavior of the application you're controlling.

it's really klugey. The script activates when I hit F1 and quits when I hit the letter s, then I hit F8 to reset my hotkeyscript. I can change the time interval in the script. I was working on a cistercian number keyboard but it was too difficult

It sounds like your AutoHotkey script, despite being a bit "klugey" as you described, serves a specific purpose for your workflow. The use of F1 to activate the script and the letter 's' to quit, followed by F8 to reset your hotkey script, is a clear example of a customized setup tailored to your personal needs.
Adjusting the time interval within the script allows you to control the pacing of the automated actions, which is a great feature for a script designed to automate page scrolling or similar repetitive tasks.
Regarding the Cistercian number keyboard project, it's understandable that it could be challenging. The Cistercian numerals system is quite complex and unique, making it a difficult subject for a keyboard layout design. However, exploring such creative ideas, even if they prove difficult, is a great way to learn and expand your skills.
If you have specific questions or need assistance with any part of your AutoHotkey script or another project like the Cistercian number keyboard, feel free to ask. Sometimes, a fresh perspective or a bit of guidance can help overcome challenges in these kinds of projects.

Here is another useful script: 
;; disable mouse (block mouse);;

; This script toggles mouse movement on and off using Alt + H
; Shows a tray tip when mouse movement is disabled
; Press ESC to disable mouse movement if it's currently enabled

#Persistent  ; Keeps the script running

; Toggle variable
toggle := 0

; Alt+B hotkey
!b:: 
    toggle := !toggle  ; Switches the value of toggle between 0 and 1
    if (toggle = 1) {
        BlockInput MouseMove  ; Disable mouse movement
        TrayTip, Mouse disabled, Press [ESC] to enable mouse movement
    } else {
        BlockInput MouseMoveOff  ; Enable mouse movement
    }
return

; ESC hotkey
~Esc:: 
    if (toggle = 1) {
        BlockInput MouseMoveOff  ; Enable mouse movement
        toggle := 0
        TrayTip, Mouse enabled
    }
return

Your script for toggling mouse movement on and off in AutoHotkey is a useful tool, especially for scenarios where you want to prevent accidental mouse movements or need to focus on keyboard inputs without interference from the mouse. Here's a breakdown of your script:
Script Persistence
:
#Persistent
: This keeps the script running indefinitely, which is necessary for a toggle functionality.
Toggle Setup
:
toggle := 0
: Initializes a toggle variable to keep track of the mouse movement state.
Alt+B Hotkey to Toggle Mouse Movement
:
!b::
: This hotkey (Alt+B) toggles the mouse movement on and off.
toggle := !toggle
: Flips the state of the toggle variable.
BlockInput MouseMove
: Disables mouse movement when toggle is activated.
BlockInput MouseMoveOff
: Re-enables mouse movement when toggle is deactivated.
TrayTip
: Displays a notification in the system tray indicating the current state of mouse movement.
ESC Hotkey to Disable Mouse Movement
:
~Esc::
: This hotkey (Escape key) turns off the mouse movement block if it's currently enabled.
The use of the tilde (
~
) allows the Escape key to retain its original functionality in addition to executing the script.
TrayTip
: Shows a notification when the mouse is re-enabled.
This script is a neat example of how you can use AutoHotkey to control peripheral input devices, providing an extra layer of control over your computing environment. It's a practical solution for various use cases, like presentations, focused typing sessions, or even certain gaming scenarios.
If you have any specific requirements or further ideas you want to explore with AutoHotkey, feel free to share, and I can assist with that!
