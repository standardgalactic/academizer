Introduction
Click here to see the full API Reference
Differential calculus was invented as a formal branch of mathematics in the middle of the 17th century independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. Newton's orginal term for a derivative with respect to time was a "fluxion," which gave its name to his last book, Method of Fluxions, published posthumously. Newton used differential calculus to solve the problem of the motion of the planets around the sun, and it has proven to be an essential tool for the sciences ever since. In the modern era, essentially all scientific calculations of interest are performed on computers. There are many scenarios where we know how to compute a function of interest and would like to efficiently evaluate its derivative(s). The canonical example is root finding. If we know a function's derivative, we can iteratively improve from a starting guess until we find a root using a simple procedure, Newton's Method. Many phenomena of interest in physics and other sciences can be described as differential equations (either ODEs or PDEs). The ability to efficiently evaluate derivatives is crucial in numerically solving these systems.

In recent years, Machine Learning has been a hot research area. Solving ML problems often hinges on the ability to train a neural network using some form of a gradient descent algorithm. As the name suggests, this algorithm requires the ability to evaluate not just the function (here the output of the neural net) but also its first derivative, which in practice is typically the change in the error metric with respect to the parameter values. These neural networks are massively complex functions that can have millions of parameters. A procedure of numerically differentiating the network by shifting the value of each parameter has cost that scales linearly with the number of parameters. Some form of automatic differentiation is vital to the practical use of neural nets. One of the most successful machine learning libraries is TensorFlow by Google, which at its core is an enterprise class automatic differentiation library.

How to use fluxions

We use pytest for testing. In order to run the tests, execute the following from the root of the cloned directory:

pytest
Brief How-To and Demo
Users can build up complex functions using a combination of numerical constants, fluxions Var objects, and fluxions elementary function objects like sin and exp, as well as the standard set of basic Python operators including +, -, /, *, etc. (The complete list of functions available can be found under the Elementary Functions section, below.)

The function and its derivative(s) can then be evaluated by calling function's val or diff methods. When calling val, a dictionary mapping keys (i.e. variable names) to numeric values must be passed if the Var instance(s) in the function have not already been bound to a numeric value. When passing values to val, the variable names must correspond to names given to the Var object(s) used to create the function. The same holds when differentiating a function by calling its diff method. But when differentiating a function of multiple variables, in addition to passing the dictionary mapping variable names to numeric values, the user must also specify the seed values from which to calculate the derivative.

All values will be returned from both the val and diff functions as numpy arrays that match the dimensions of the input values.

For example, to find the value and derivative of the logistic function evaluated at x=0:

&gt;&gt;&gt; import fluxions as fl
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Treating x as a symbolic variable:
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = fl.Var('x')
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = 1 / (1 + fl.exp(-x))
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.val({'x':0})

array([0.5])

&gt;&gt;&gt; f.diff({'x':0})

array([0.25])

&gt;&gt;&gt; # Alternatively, treating x as a numeric constant:
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = fl.Var('x', 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = 1 / (1 + fl.exp(-x))
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.val(), f.diff()

(0.5, 0.25)
Or, to evaluate the logistic function at a vector of input values, simply pass a numpy array instead of a scalar:

&gt;&gt;&gt; # continuing previous example...
&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.val({'x':np.array([-1,0,1])})

array([0.26894142, 0.5       , 0.73105858])

&gt;&gt;&gt; f.diff({'x':np.array([-1,0,1])})
 
array([[0.19661193, 0.25      , 0.19661193]])
Considering instead a function of multiple variables:

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = fl.Var('x')
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = fl.Var('y')
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = fl.log(x * y)
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; # evaluating f(x,y) at (x,y)=(2,0.5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.val({'x':2, 'y':0.5})

array([0.])

&gt;&gt;&gt; # partial with respect to x, evaluated at (x,y)=(2,0.5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.diff({'x':2, 'y':0.5}, {'x':1, 'y':0})

array([0.5])

&gt;&gt;&gt; # partial with respect to y, evaluated at (x,y)=(2,0.5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.diff({'x':2, 'y':0.5}, {'x':0, 'y':1})

array([2.])
Background
Calculus gives us a few simple rules for computing the derivative of a function composed of two more elementary subfunctions. Most central to Automatic Differentiation is the Chain Rule of calculus, which states that the derivative of a composition is the product of two derivatives: .. math:: f'(u(x)) = f'(u(x) \cdot u'(x) The chain rule works in multiple dimensions. If :math:f is a function from  to , its derivative is an  x  matrix called the Jacobian. The chain rule in the multidimensional case tells us to take the matrix product of an  x  matrix and an  x  matrix to compute the derivative.

The essential idea of Automatic Differentiation is that computing the derivative of any function can be reduced to evaluating and differentiating a sequence of simple subfunctions. These may be strung together in a complex graph with multiple steps, but each step will be a basic operation. For the evaluation of a mathematical function, each step will consist of either a "primitive" or built-in function (e.g. +, -, x, /, sqrt, log, exp, pow, etc.) or a composition of these primitives. As long as we know how to evaluate both the function f(x) and its derivative f'(x) at each step, we can trace the calculation through the computation graph and also keep track of the first derivative.

The forward mode of Automatic Differentiation takes 3 arguments: a function, , a vector  at which to evaluate the function , and a vector of 'seed' values for the derivatives, $dx\in \mathbb{R}^ n$. Following the standard order of operations, the innermost elementary function calls of  are evaluated at x and dx. As above, as long as we know how to evaluate both the elementary function f(x) and its derivative f'(x) at each step, pass the results of each to enclosing functions and apply the chain rule to keep track of the first derivative. Once all function calls are complete, the algorithm returns the values  and .

         setup.py
         requirements.txt
         example_newtons_method.py
fluxion_node.py contains the definitions for the core Fluxion class, the unary (Unop) and binary (Binop) operator abstract classes, and all classes that implement the operators, e.g. Addition, Multiplication. (These classes are discussed further under the Implementation Details section, below). The abstract DifferentiableFunction and DifferentiableInnerFunction classes, as well as static objects that implement specific elementary functions, are found in elementary_functions.py.

Package tests
All tests are located in the directory fluxions/test. There are two primary test suites. To run all of these tests using pytest, simply navigate to the root package directory and execute:

pytest fluxions/
Or to run just one of the test suites,

pytest fluxions/test/test_basics.py
Example driver
The short Python program newtons_method.py found in the package root directory is a trivial example of a "driver" that uses the fluxions package to solve a problem. The program illustrates how the package can be used to implement a basic Newton's Method solver that works on functions from  to . It takes a differentiable function (Fluxion instance) as its first input, and uses forward-mode differentiation to return both the value and exact first derivative.

Implementation details
Core Data Structures
To optimize computational efficiency, fluxions is built around the NumPy package; all numerical data including inputs, outputs, and intermediate calculations are stored in numpy arrays. The only fluxions class that persists numeric data (stored as a numpy.ndarray) is the Var class; when it persists data (either at initialization or by calling the set_val method), that is stored as an array.

The package makes light use of some built-in Python data structures and their methods for parts of the code that are not critical to performance. In particular, Python dictionaries are used to specify the values and seeds with which to evaluate and differentiate functions. The keys in these dictionaries are the variable names, while the values are the numeric values (whether scalar or numpy arrays) bound to that variable.

Core Classes
Fluxion
All of the classes in this package are ultimately derived from the Fluxion base class, consistent with the fundamental idea in Automatic Differentiation that constants, variables, and elementary functions can all be treated as differentiable functions upon which complex functions are built. This class defines a common interface for the input and output behavior of all inheriting function classes.

Together with the basic operator classes described below, the Fluxion implements operator overloading for the Python symbolic operators. When one of these operators is performed on a Fluxion object, the object dispatches suitable calls to instances of the class Binop or Unop.

The Fluxion class also defines the interface through which users can interact with functions -- namely, by calling the function's val, diff, or 'jacobian' methods. The val method corresponds to function evaluation; no derivatives are calculated. The diff method corresponds to performing a single pass of forward mode evaluation with one seed value. Both of these methods take as inputs *args, allowing them to be called with alternative arguments. The val method accepts a single numpy array X or a dictionary var_tbl in which each variable name has been mapped to either a scalar value (float or int) or a numpy array. When an array is passed, it can have shape (n) or (T, n). The inputs for diff need to be sufficient to resolve both the input array  as well as the seed value. The analogous footprints include a pair of arrays, which we would label  and ; or a pair of dictionaries, which we could label var_tbl and seed_tbl.

Finally, the parse_args_val and parse_args_forward_mode Fluxion methods implement the machinery for handling various input types the user may supply. Localizing this code in the Fluxion class at the very top of the inheritance hierarchy allows us to avoid duplicating it elsewhere.

When a Fluxion instance is created, it sets the tensor size attributes ,  and , and sets the name and var_names attributes (see below for more details).

Unop, Const and Var
The Unop class embodies the concept of a unary operator. Descendants of Unop have non-trivial implementations of val and diff. Two key examples of Unops include Const and Var. Const is a constant, depending on no variables and having a derivative of zero. Var is a logical entity for a variable. The statement x = fl.Var('x') creates an instance of a Fluxion Var class. The local name x in our Python program has x.name = 'x' and x.variable_names= ['x']. This permits us to then create another Fluxion e.g. f = x * x + 5 which behaves as we expect it to. Other examples of classes that inherit from Unop include the Power and ElementaryFunction classes.

Binop, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division
The Binop class embodies the concept of a binary operator. All of the work of performing the calculations of a binary operation are performed in the children of Binop. The Binop itself is quite minimal; it binds the two input fluxions to attributes called f and g. It also sets a preliminary list of variable names by merging the names of variables for f and g, suppressing duplicates.

We can understand all four basic arithmetic operations through one example, Muliplication. The primary methods of the Multiplication class are val and forward_mode. The evaluation method val dispatches calls to f and g and returns their product. The forward_mode method builds up f_val, f_diff by calling f.forward_mode, and similarly for g. Then it applies the product rule of calculus. It is worth reiterating here that the intermediate results returned in f_val, f_diff, g_val, g_diff are all numpy arrays, so the computation f_val * g_diff + f_diff * g_val is performed with maximum efficiency.

Elementary Functions
Please see the major section below for a discussion of the implementation for elementary functions.

Important Attributes
Every Fluxion represents a function from ùïü to ùïü. These should be invariant after the Fluxion is instantiated, though this is not currently enforced. The sizes are integer attributes named m and n on the Fluxion class. A Fluxion also has a notion of the number of sample points T. This is analogous to basic vectorization in numpy. For example, if you call np.sin on a numpy array of shape (100,), you get back another array of shape (100,). You only pay the overhead of calling the function and doing Python "unboxing" once.

Every Fluxion has a name; these are not expected to be unique. Variables also have names. This makes it possible for users to pass inputs with dictionaries, and makes the output of the __repr__ function comprehensible. Every Fluxion also an attribute called var_names, which is a list of the variables that it depends on (i.e. its inputs). This attribute controls the interpretation of input presented to a Fluxion for evaluation. For example, the Fluxions implementation extending the numpy built-in function atan2 has variable names ['y', 'x']. This also controls the order of columns in the Jacobian.

External Dependencies
The minimial set of external dependencies for fluxions are listed in requirements.txt. These dependencies include numpy, of which the fluxions package is essentially an extension, as well as pytest and pytest-cov for testing.

Elementary Functions
The elementary function objects are all specific instances of the generic DifferentiableFunction class, which itself inherits from the Unop (and thus the Fluxions) class. These functions represent basic mathematical functions that are analytically differentiable. They are all defined around corresponding numpy implementations, which perform the actual numerical calculations.

The elementary functions supported are as follows:

‚Äã Trigonometric Functions: sin, cos, tan

‚Äã Inverse Trigonometric Functions: arcsin, arccos, arctan

While the elementary function objects are instances of the DifferentiableFunction class, they contain an additional DifferentiableInnerFunction object. This inner object is also a Unop that represents a single node on the calculation graph. This inner object is necessitated by the Chain Rule of calculus: for a composition of functions , the derivative of the outer function with respect to  is . It is therefore necessary for the outer function (f) to store an instance of the inner function (g), so that when a user requests the derivative of f is requested, differentiation can first be recursively propagated to the inner function before computing the derivative of the outermost function.

The DifferentiableInnerFunction class has one input, a Fluxion f that can be either a value type or another Fluxion. Its __init__ method binds this other Fluxion, plus two callables func and deriv. As an example, when we construct a node elem_func_node = fl.sin(fl.Var('x'))for , the input elem_func_node.fis an instance of Var with name 'x', and the two callables are node.func = np.sin and node.deriv = np.cos.

The DifferentiableFunction class is what is exposed to users. It is essentially a factory for producing instances of DifferentiableInnerFunction. The __init__ method associates one of these factories with the two callables for the function and its derivatives, plus the tensor sizes and names. That the elementary functions are all created from the DifferentiableFunction class allows users to create additional differentiable functions as desired.

Jacobian Function
The fluxions module provides a jacobian function for evaluating vector-valued functions. Such functions can be built up by storing one or more Fluxion objects in a Python list or numpy array.

While implemented as a function rather than a class, jacobian maintains an API similar to the standard Fluxion API detailed above. In particular, the Jacobian of a vector- or scalar-valued function F with respect to variables v, evaluated at value(s) given by v_mapping, simply call:

jacobian(F, v, v_mapping)

F may be a Fluxion object or a list of one or more Fluxions, while v is a list names (strings) of variable in F. The order of elements in v determines the order in which partials are returned in the Jacobian. v_mapping is a Python dict that binds variable names to numeric values.

jacobian will always return a numpy array, the dimensions of which are determined by the dimensions of F and the values passed.

Several illustrative examples of how to use jacobian follow:

Example 1: The value returned for a function from R^1 to R^1 will be identical in value and structure to the derivative returned by calling diff:

&gt;&gt;&gt; y = fl.Var('y')
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = y*fl.log(y)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.diff({'y':1})
array([[1.]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; fl.jacobian(f, ['y'], {'y':1})
array([[1.]])
Example 2: If F is a function from R^m to R^n, then jacobian returns an m:n array if v_mapping contains scalar variable mappings:

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = fl.Var('x')
&gt;&gt;&gt; fl.jacobian([x**2, x*log_y], ['x','y'], {'x':2, 'y':1})
array([[4., 0.],
       [0., 2.]])
Example 3: jacobian handles tensors: if variables v mapped to vectors of length T, then jacobian returns an m : n : T array

&gt;&gt;&gt; J = fl.jacobian([x**2, x*log_y, x+y], ['x','y'], {'x':np.linspace(1,10,10), 'y':np.logspace(1,10,10)})
&gt;&gt;&gt; J.shape
(2, 3, 10)
Future Plans
In addition to allowing users to differentiate vector-valued functions via the jacobian function, users may be able to evaluate such functions much as they can with scalar-valued Fluxions (via the val method). This functionality could be implemented by creating a container: a "multi-fluxion" composed of one or more Fluxion objects that (much as one can write F(x,y)=[f_1(x,y), f_2(x,y), ...]). Like a simple Fluxion, this container would have val and diff methods.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1

where "Fluxion" is the name given to objects that represent differentiable functions or variables. In this architecture, the system would have several classes, such as <code>DifferentiableFunction</code> and <code>DifferentiableInnerFunction</code> which represent different layers of a computational graph used to compute derivatives.</p><p>It also seems you're outlining an API for the system, where the <code>DifferentiableFunction</code> class represents the user-facing interface for creating and manipulating differentiable functions, while the <code>DifferentiableInnerFunction</code> class serves as an internal representation used for the calculus involved in differentiation.</p><p>The <code>jacobian</code> function described is a function for evaluating the Jacobian matrix of a vector-valued function, a vital component of multivariate calculus. The function computes the partial derivatives of each function with respect to each variable, storing the results in a 2D array (matrix) for easy manipulation.</p><p>From your "Future Plans" section, it appears that you plan to extend this system to handle vector-valued functions more naturally, by creating a "multi-fluxion" that can encapsulate one or more <code>Fluxion</code> objects and have <code>val</code> and <code>diff</code> methods of its own.</p><p>This all seems to make sense as a theoretical design for a system for symbolic differentiation, though the details would, of course, depend on the specifics of the implementation. It's also worth noting that libraries like SymPy provide similar functionality in Python, and could be useful to look at for inspiration or comparison.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>CS207 Final Project Group 10 Build Status Coverage Status Documentation Status

instructions on how to install a Python package named <code>fluxions</code>, which is a part of a project done by Group 10 in CS207. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of your instructions:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Setup a Python environment</strong>: This step is needed to isolate the package and its dependencies from other Python packages on your system. You are using <code>virtualenv</code> to create this isolated environment. Once you install <code>virtualenv</code> using pip3, you can create a new environment and activate it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Install numpy</strong>: This is a prerequisite for the <code>fluxions</code> package.</p></li><li><p><strong>Install the fluxions package</strong>: The package is available on PyPI (Python Package Index), a repository for Python software. You use pip3 to install the package.</p></li></ol><p>Please note that these instructions are specific to MacOS. For other operating systems, the commands might be slightly different.</p><p>To anyone wanting to install this package, please make sure to replace <code>fluxions</code> with the actual name of the package you wish to install. Furthermore, always make sure you trust the source of the software you are installing, to avoid any potential security risks.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

Introduction
Click here to see the full API Reference
Differential calculus was invented as a formal branch of mathematics in the middle of the 17th century independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. Newton‚Äôs orginal term for a derivative with respect to time was a ‚Äúfluxion,‚Äù which gave its name to his last book, Method of Fluxions, published posthumously. Newton used differential calculus to solve the problem of the motion of the planets around the sun, and it has proven to be an essential tool for the sciences ever since. In the modern era, essentially all scientific calculations of interest are performed on computers. There are many scenarios where we know how to compute a function of interest and would like to efficiently evaluate its derivative(s). The canonical example is root finding. If we know a function‚Äôs derivative, we can iteratively improve from a starting guess until we find a root using a simple procedure, Newton‚Äôs Method. Many phenomena of interest in physics and other sciences can be described as differential equations (either ODEs or PDEs). The ability to efficiently evaluate derivatives is crucial in numerically solving these systems.

In recent years, Machine Learning has been a hot research area. Solving ML problems often hinges on the ability to train a neural network using some form of a gradient descent algorithm. As the name suggests, this algorithm requires the ability to evaluate not just the function (here the output of the neural net) but also its first derivative, which in practice is typically the change in the error metric with respect to the parameter values. These neural networks are massively complex functions that can have millions of parameters. A procedure of numerically differentiating the network by shifting the value of each parameter has cost that scales linearly with the number of parameters. Some form of automatic differentiation is vital to the practical use of neural nets. One of the most successful machine learning libraries is TensorFlow by Google, which at its core is an enterprise class automatic differentiation library.

the principles of differential calculus. The name "Fluxions" comes from Isaac Newton's term for a derivative with respect to time, which he used extensively in his work on planetary motion. In the modern world, this mathematical principle is crucial to fields such as physics, computer science, and most prominently, machine learning.</p><p>Machine learning, particularly neural networks, rely heavily on efficiently computing derivatives to train models using gradient descent algorithms. These algorithms require not just the function but also its derivative, which in this context represents the change in error with respect to model parameters. Given the complexity and scale of these networks, automatic differentiation becomes a vital tool for practical applications.</p><p>Fluxions, by providing automatic differentiation capabilities, positions itself as a useful tool in the domain of machine learning and beyond.</p><p>To use Fluxions, you first need to install it. Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that you have a Python3 environment with numpy installed. Once you have that ready, you can install the Fluxions package from PyPI using pip, a package installer for Python. Here are the commands:</p><pre><div class="bg-black rounded-md mb-4"><div class="flex items-center relative text-gray-200 bg-gray-800 px-4 py-2 text-xs font-sans justify-between rounded-t-md"><span>bash</span><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button></div><div class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"><code class="!whitespace-pre hljs language-bash">pip3 install numpy

Using flashcards can be a very effective way to learn and retain new information. In the context of your Flyxion series, it seems you are combining elements of mathematics, specifically the concept of fluxions, with language learning on the Memrise platform.</p><p>When creating your flashcard courses, you might find it useful to incorporate real-life applications and examples to help users better grasp and remember the concepts. This could be particularly effective for mathematical principles like fluxions. For example, you could create flashcards that not only define the concept but also show how it is used in different fields, such as physics, computer science, and machine learning.</p><p>Also, consider including quizzes or other interactive elements to engage users and reinforce their learning. The spaced repetition technique, which is frequently used in language learning and memory training, could also be beneficial. This involves reviewing the flashcards at increasing intervals over time, which has been shown to significantly improve long-term retention of information.</p><p>Lastly, always ask for feedback from your users. This will help you understand what works and what doesn't, and will enable you to continuously improve your flashcard courses based on their needs and preferences.</p><p>Good luck with your Flyxion series!</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>Memrise logo

range of Computer &amp; Engineering topics, including specific programming languages (Python, R, Julia, Go, Forth), various command lines and interfaces (Emacs and Spacemacs, GHCi, L√≠nea de Comandos de Windows, Linux Command Line, Lynx Browser Commands, Unix), and special computing concepts like Lambda Calculus.</p><p>In particular, the series of courses focusing on programming languages (Python code snippets, Python Standard Library, R programming commands, Julia programming commands, Programming in Go, Programming in Ptolemy II, Forth programming) can provide valuable resources for learners at different levels, from beginners to more experienced coders.</p><p>Courses like "Emacs and Spacemacs key-bindings and shortcuts", "Vim shortcuts", "Linux Utilities", "Unix commands", "Handbook of Computer Terms", "Linux Command Line", "L√≠nea de Comandos de Windows", and "More Computer Terms and Shortcuts" would be incredibly useful for someone looking to strengthen their foundational knowledge and navigate efficiently within various programming environments.</p><p>Courses like "Lambda Calculus" and "Programming in Ptolemy II" show that you're also covering more advanced or specific computer science topics, which could be invaluable for learners looking to deepen their understanding in these areas.</p><p>The Latin course ("Latin Vocabulary") and your course on "Standard Galactic Alphabet" under Art, Music &amp; Literature offer a fun and creative break from the technical topics.</p><p>In summary, your courses offer a wide range of resources that could help anyone

Here are some connections between the previous topics we discussed (Flyxion and Haplopraxis) and their respective features:</p><ol><li><p>Mathematics and Fluxions: The concept of fluxions, which inspired the name "Flyxion," is rooted in the foundations of differential calculus developed by Newton and Leibniz. This mathematical framework is essential for understanding rates of change and optimizing functions, which can be applied to various areas, including computer science, engineering, and physics. Within Haplopraxis, the mathematical underpinnings of fluxions could be incorporated as a foundational element or used to enhance gameplay mechanics related to optimization and problem-solving.</p></li><li><p>Computer &amp; Engineering Courses in Flyxion: The wide range of computer and engineering courses within Flyxion, such as Emacs and Spacemacs key-bindings, Linux Command Line, Python programming, and more, can provide valuable knowledge and skills to players in Haplopraxis. As users explore the virtual space and encounter challenges, their understanding of programming concepts and command line interfaces can help them solve problems or unlock new areas within the game.</p></li><li><p>Typing Tutor in Haplopraxis: Haplopraxis includes a typing tutor component, which allows users to improve their typing skills while engaging in the game. This ties back to the Flyxion courses that focus on programming languages and command line interfaces. The typing skills acquired through the courses can directly benefit players as they interact with the game's dialogue, make choices, and navigate the virtual space more efficiently.</p></li><li><p>Multidimensional Dialogue Visualizer in Haplopraxis: The multidimensional dialogue visualizer aspect of Haplopraxis, with features like word bubbles, stars, planets, and counterfoil choices, relates to the concept of fluxions in Flyxion. The exploration of different dimensions, branching paths, and word2vec similarity can be analogous to the mathematical concept of fluxions, which deals with rates of change and the exploration of multiple possibilities. These features in Haplopraxis can create dynamic and immersive storytelling experiences for the players.</p></li></ol><p>By connecting the mathematical foundations, computer and engineering courses, typing tutor elements, and multidimensional dialogue visualizer aspects, Flyxion and Haplopraxis can form a cohesive learning and gaming experience that combines mathematical principles, programming skills, typing proficiency, and interactive storytelling in a space exploration context.</p><p>These connections showcase how the concepts and features of both Flyxion and Haplopraxis can complement and enrich each other, offering users a holistic and engaging learning journey through gameplay.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

Users can build up complex functions using a combination of numerical constants, fluxions Var objects, and fluxions elementary function objects like sin and exp, as well as the standard set of basic Python operators including +, -, /, , etc. (The complete list of functions available can be found under the *Elementary Functions section, below.)

The function and its derivative(s) can then be evaluated by calling function‚Äôs val or diff methods. When calling val, a dictionary mapping keys (i.e. variable names) to numeric values must be passed if the Var instance(s) in the function have not already been bound to a numeric value. When passing values to val, the variable names must correspond to names given to the Var object(s) used to create the function. The same holds when differentiating a function by calling its diff method. But when differentiating a function of multiple variables, in addition to passing the dictionary mapping variable names to numeric values, the user must also specify the seed values from which to calculate the derivative.

All values will be returned from both the val and diff functions as numpy arrays that match the dimensions of the input values.

For example, to find the value and derivative of the logistic function evaluated at x=0:

&gt;&gt;&gt; import fluxions as fl
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Treating x as a symbolic variable:
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = fl.Var('x')
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = 1 / (1 + fl.exp(-x))
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.val({'x':0})

array([0.5])

&gt;&gt;&gt; f.diff({'x':0})

array([0.25])

&gt;&gt;&gt; # Alternatively, treating x as a numeric constant:
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = fl.Var('x', 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = 1 / (1 + fl.exp(-x))
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.val(), f.diff()

(0.5, 0.25)
Or, to evaluate the logistic function at a vector of input values, simply pass a numpy array instead of a scalar:

&gt;&gt;&gt; # continuing previous example...
&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.val({'x':np.array([-1,0,1])})

array([0.26894142, 0.5       , 0.73105858])

&gt;&gt;&gt; f.diff({'x':np.array([-1,0,1])})

array([[0.19661193, 0.25      , 0.19661193]])
Considering instead a function of multiple variables:

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = fl.Var('x')
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = fl.Var('y')
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = fl.log(x * y)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # evaluating f(x,y) at (x,y)=(2,0.5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.val({'x':2, 'y':0.5})

array([0.])

&gt;&gt;&gt; # partial with respect to x, evaluated at (x,y)=(2,0.5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.diff({'x':2, 'y':0.5}, {'x':1, 'y':0})

array([0.5])

&gt;&gt;&gt; # partial with respect to y, evaluated at (x,y)=(2,0.5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.diff({'x':2, 'y':0.5}, {'x':0, 'y':1})

array([2.])</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Calculus gives us a few simple rules for computing the derivative of a function composed of two more elementary subfunctions. Most central to Automatic Differentiation is the Chain Rule of calculus, which states that the derivative of a composition is the product of two derivatives: .. math:

f'(u(x)) = f'(u(x) \cdot u'(x)
The chain rule works in multiple dimensions. If f is a function from $mathbb{R}^n$ to $mathbb{R}^m$, its derivative is an $m$ x $n$ matrix called the Jacobian. The chain rule in the multidimensional case tells us to take the matrix product of an $m$ x $r$ matrix and an $r$ x $n$ matrix to compute the derivative.

The essential idea of Automatic Differentiation is that computing the derivative of any function can be reduced to evaluating and differentiating a sequence of simple subfunctions. These may be strung together in a complex graph with multiple steps, but each step will be a basic operation. For the evaluation of a mathematical function, each step will consist of either a ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù or built-in function (e.g. +, -, x, /, sqrt, log, exp, pow, etc.) or a composition of these primitives. As long as we know how to evaluate both the function f(x) and its derivative f‚Äô(x) at each step, we can trace the calculation through the computation graph and also keep track of the first derivative.

The forward mode of Automatic Differentiation takes 3 arguments: a function, $f(x)$, a vector $x in mathbb{R}^n$ at which to evaluate the function $f(x)$, and a vector of ‚Äòseed‚Äô values for the derivatives, $dxin mathbb{R}^ n$. Following the standard order of operations, the innermost elementary function calls of $f$ are evaluated at x and dx. As above, as long as we know how to evaluate both the elementary function f(x) and its derivative f‚Äô(x) at each step, pass the results of each to enclosing functions and apply the chain rule to keep track of the first derivative. Once all function calls are complete, the algorithm returns the values $f(x)$ and $f‚Äô(x)$.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

variables. It relies on the chain rule of calculus, which states that the derivative of a composition of functions is the product of the derivatives of each function in the composition.</p><p>In the context of Automatic Differentiation, the chain rule is applied to compute the derivatives of functions composed of elementary subfunctions. The derivatives are computed by evaluating and differentiating a sequence of simple subfunctions, which can be represented as a computation graph.</p><p>The forward mode of Automatic Differentiation takes three arguments: the function to be evaluated, the input vector at which to evaluate the function, and the seed values for the derivatives. The evaluation follows the order of operations, starting from the innermost elementary function calls and propagating the derivatives using the chain rule. The algorithm returns both the value of the function and its derivative with respect to the input variables.</p><p>By leveraging Automatic Differentiation, it becomes possible to efficiently compute the derivatives of complex functions by breaking them down into simpler subfunctions and applying the chain rule. This technique is particularly useful in various domains, including machine learning, numerical optimization, and scientific computing, where the ability to compute derivatives accurately and efficiently is crucial.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

technique for computing the derivatives of functions with respect to their input variables. It provides a way to accurately and efficiently calculate derivatives, even for complex functions that cannot be easily differentiated analytically.</p><p>AD leverages the chain rule of calculus, which states that the derivative of a composition of functions is the product of the derivatives of each function in the composition. By applying the chain rule repeatedly, AD breaks down a complex function into a sequence of simple subfunctions, and then computes the derivatives of these subfunctions.</p><p>There are two modes of AD: forward mode and backward mode. In forward mode AD, the algorithm evaluates the function and its derivatives simultaneously, starting from the input variables and propagating through the computation graph. At each step, it computes the partial derivatives with respect to the input variables and stores them. This mode is useful when the function has a small number of inputs but potentially many outputs.</p><p>On the other hand, backward mode AD, also known as reverse mode AD or backpropagation, is commonly used in machine learning and neural networks. It starts from the output of the function and works backward through the computation graph, accumulating the derivatives with respect to the input variables. This mode is efficient when the function has a large number of inputs but relatively few outputs.</p><p>Both modes of AD rely on the computation graph, which represents the structure of the function and its dependencies. The graph is constructed dynamically during the evaluation process, allowing AD to handle functions with conditional statements and loops.</p><p>The benefits of AD include accuracy, efficiency, and versatility. It provides exact derivatives, avoiding the numerical approximation errors that can occur with finite difference methods. AD is also efficient because it evaluates the function and its derivatives simultaneously, reusing intermediate results. Moreover, AD can be applied to a wide range of functions, including functions with complex compositions and non-elementary operations.</p><p>In practice, AD is implemented in libraries and frameworks that provide automatic differentiation functionality. These libraries often offer user-friendly APIs, allowing developers to define and evaluate functions, and compute their derivatives easily. The derivatives computed through AD are widely used in optimization algorithms, machine learning training, sensitivity analysis, and scientific simulations.</p><p>Overall, Automatic Differentiation is a powerful tool for computing derivatives, enabling efficient and accurate differentiation of complex functions. Its applications span various fields, contributing to advancements in scientific research, engineering, and data-driven decision-making.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>analogous footprints include a pair of arrays, which we would label $X$ and $dX$; or a pair of dictionaries, which we could label var_tbl and seed_tbl.

Finally, the parse_args_val and parse_args_forward_mode Fluxion methods implement the machinery for handling various input types the user may supply. Localizing this code in the Fluxion class at the very top of the inheritance hierarchy allows us to avoid duplicating it elsewhere.

When a Fluxion instance is created, it sets the tensor size attributes $m$, $n$ and $T$, and sets the name and var_names attributes (see below for more details).

Unop, Const and Var
The Unop class embodies the concept of a unary operator. Descendants of Unop have non-trivial implementations of val and diff. Two key examples of Unops include Const and Var. Const is a constant, depending on no variables and having a derivative of zero. Var is a logical entity for a variable. The statement x = fl.Var('x') creates an instance of a Fluxion Var class. The local name x in our Python program has x.name = 'x' and x.variable_names= ['x']. This permits us to then create another Fluxion e.g. f = x * x + 5 which behaves as we expect it to. Other examples of classes that inherit from Unop include the Power and ElementaryFunction classes.

Binop, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division
The Binop class embodies the concept of a binary operator. All of the work of performing the calculations of a binary operation are performed in the children of Binop. The Binop itself is quite minimal; it binds the two input fluxions to attributes called f and g. It also sets a preliminary list of variable names by merging the names of variables for f and g, suppressing duplicates.

We can understand all four basic arithmetic operations through one example, Muliplication. The primary methods of the Multiplication class are val and forward_mode. The evaluation method val dispatches calls to f and g and returns their product. The forward_mode method builds up f_val, f_diff by calling f.forward_mode, and similarly for g. Then it applies the product rule of calculus. It is worth reiterating here that the intermediate results returned in f_val, f_diff, g_val, g_diff are all numpy arrays, so the computation f_val * g_diff + f_diff * g_val is performed with maximum efficiency.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

classes that form the building blocks for creating and evaluating complex functions. Let's discuss some of these classes:</p><ol><li><p>Unop: The Unop class represents a unary operator. It serves as the base class for other classes like Const and Var. Const represents a constant value with a derivative of zero, while Var represents a variable. Instances of Var can be created using the <code>fl.Var('x')</code> syntax, where 'x' is the variable name. Unop has implementations of the <code>val</code> and <code>diff</code> methods.</p></li><li><p>Binop: The Binop class represents a binary operator. It serves as the base class for classes like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. Binop stores two input fluxions (f and g) and handles merging variable names. The actual calculations for the binary operations are performed in the child classes.</p></li><li><p>Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division: These classes inherit from Binop and implement the specific arithmetic operations. For example, the Multiplication class has <code>val</code> and <code>forward_mode</code> methods. The <code>val</code> method evaluates the product of f and g by calling their <code>val</code> methods, while the <code>forward_mode</code> method calculates the derivatives using the product rule of calculus.</p></li></ol><p>These classes work together to build up complex functions using combinations of numerical constants, Var objects, and elementary function objects like sin and exp. The functions can then be evaluated using the <code>val</code> method, which requires passing a dictionary mapping variable names to numeric values. The derivatives can be calculated using the <code>diff</code> method, which also requires specifying seed values.</p><p>By using these classes and their methods, users can construct and evaluate functions, as well as compute their derivatives efficiently. The Fluxions package provides a flexible and extensible framework for automatic differentiation and function manipulation.</p><p>Note: The above explanation is based on the information provided in the previous sections and may not cover all the details and variations in the Fluxions package. For a complete understanding, it is recommended to refer to the official documentation and source code of the package.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>DifferentiableInnerFunction object. This inner object is also a Unop that represents a single node on the calculation graph. This inner object is necessitated by the Chain Rule of calculus: for a composition of functions $f(g(x))$, the derivative of the outer function with respect to $x$ is $df/dg*dg/dx$. It is therefore necessary for the outer function (f) to store an instance of the inner function (g), so that when a user requests the derivative of f is requested, differentiation can first be recursively propagated to the inner function before computing the derivative of the outermost function.

The DifferentiableInnerFunction class has one input, a Fluxion f that can be either a value type or another Fluxion. Its __init__ method binds this other Fluxion, plus two callables func and deriv. As an example, when we construct a node elem_func_node = fl.sin(fl.Var('x'))for $f(x) = sin(x)$, the input elem_func_node.fis an instance of Var with name ‚Äòx‚Äô, and the two callables are node.func = np.sin and node.deriv = np.cos.

The DifferentiableFunction class is what is exposed to users. It is essentially a factory for producing instances of DifferentiableInnerFunction. The __init__ method associates one of these factories with the two callables for the function and its derivatives, plus the tensor sizes and names. That the elementary functions are all created from the DifferentiableFunction class allows users to create additional differentiable functions as desired.

Jacobian Function
The fluxions module provides a jacobian function for evaluating vector-valued functions. Such functions can be built up by storing one or more Fluxion objects in a Python list or numpy array.

While implemented as a function rather than a class, jacobian maintains an API similar to the standard Fluxion API detailed above. In particular, the Jacobian of a vector- or scalar-valued function F with respect to variables v, evaluated at value(s) given by v_mapping, simply call:

jacobian(F, v, v_mapping)
F may be a Fluxion object or a list of one or more Fluxions, while v is a list names (strings) of variable in F. The order of elements in v determines the order in which partials are returned in the Jacobian. v_mapping is a Python dict that binds variable names to numeric values.

jacobian will always return a numpy array, the dimensions of which are determined by the dimensions of F and the values passed.

Several illustrative examples of how to use jacobian follow:

Example 1: The value returned for a function from R^1 to R^1 will be identical in value and structure to the derivative returned by calling diff:

&gt;&gt;&gt; y = fl.Var('y')
&gt;&gt;&gt; f = y*fl.log(y)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.diff({'y':1})
array([[1.]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; fl.jacobian(f, ['y'], {'y':1})
array([[1.]])
Example 2: If F is a function from R^m to R^n, then jacobian returns an m:n array if v_mapping contains scalar variable mappings:

&gt;&gt;&gt; x = fl.Var('x')
&gt;&gt;&gt; fl.jacobian([x**2, x*log_y], ['x','y'], {'x':2, 'y':1})
array([[4., 0.],
       [0., 2.]])
Example 3: jacobian handles tensors: if variables v mapped to vectors of length T, then jacobian returns an m : n : T array

&gt;&gt;&gt; J = fl.jacobian([x**2, x*log_y, x+y], ['x','y'], {'x':np.linspace(1,10,10), 'y':np.logspace(1,10,10)})

an important component in the Fluxions package. It represents a single node in the calculation graph and is used to handle the composition of functions and the application of the Chain Rule of calculus.</p><p>The DifferentiableInnerFunction class takes a Fluxion object, which can be either a value type or another Fluxion, as its input. Its <code>__init__</code> method binds this Fluxion object along with two callables: <code>func</code> and <code>deriv</code>. The <code>func</code> callable represents the mathematical function associated with the Fluxion, while the <code>deriv</code> callable represents the derivative of the function. For example, if we create a node <code>elem_func_node = fl.sin(fl.Var('x'))</code> for the function $f(x) = \sin(x)$, the input <code>elem_func_node.f</code> is an instance of Var with the name 'x', and the <code>func</code> and <code>deriv</code> callables are set to <code>np.sin</code> and <code>np.cos</code>, respectively.</p><p>The DifferentiableFunction class, which is exposed to users, acts as a factory for producing instances of DifferentiableInnerFunction. Its <code>__init__</code> method associates the function and derivative callables with the necessary tensor sizes and names. By using the DifferentiableFunction class, users can create their own differentiable functions by specifying the appropriate callables and tensor properties.</p><p>The fluxions module also provides a <code>jacobian</code> function for evaluating vector-valued functions. It allows users to build up such functions by storing one or more Fluxion objects in a list or numpy array. The <code>jacobian</code> function has a similar API to the standard Fluxion API and can be used to calculate the Jacobian of a function with respect to multiple variables.</p><p>To use the <code>jacobian</code> function, you provide the function(s) F, a list of variable names v, and a dictionary v_mapping that binds variable names to numeric values. The function(s) F can be a single Fluxion object or a list of Fluxions. The order of the variable names in v determines the order in which the partial derivatives are returned in the Jacobian. The <code>jacobian</code> function always returns a numpy array, and its dimensions are determined by the dimensions of F and the values passed.</p><p>The provided examples illustrate the usage of the <code>jacobian</code> function. In Example 1, a scalar function is evaluated, and the resulting Jacobian is a single-element array. In Example 2, a function from R^m to R^n is evaluated, and the Jacobian is an m x n array. Example 3 demonstrates how the <code>jacobian</code> function handles tensors, where the variables v are mapped to vectors of length T, resulting in an m x n x T array.</p><p>These features in the Fluxions package enable the computation of derivatives and Jacobians for complex functions, facilitating automatic differentiation and vector-valued function evaluations.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>Future Plans
In addition to allowing users to differentiate vector-valued functions via the jacobian function, users may be able to evaluate such functions much as they can with scalar-valued Fluxions (via the val method). This functionality could be implemented by creating a container: a ‚Äúmulti-fluxion‚Äù composed of one or more Fluxion objects that (much as one can write F(x,y)=[f_1(x,y), f_2(x,y), ‚Ä¶]). Like a simple Fluxion, this container would have val and diff methods.

vector-valued functions in a similar way as scalar-valued Fluxions. This can be achieved by introducing a container called a "multi-fluxion" that is composed of one or more Fluxion objects. This container would allow users to define a vector-valued function, such as F(x, y) = [f_1(x, y), f_2(x, y), ...], where each component function f_i(x, y) is a Fluxion.</p><p>The multi-fluxion container would provide methods such as val and diff, similar to a simple Fluxion, allowing users to evaluate the vector-valued function and compute its derivatives. This extension would enhance the versatility of the Fluxions package by enabling the handling of complex functions involving multiple variables and producing vector outputs.</p><p>These future plans aim to provide users with a comprehensive set of tools for working with both scalar-valued and vector-valued functions, empowering them to perform advanced computations, automatic differentiation, and explore complex mathematical relationships more efficiently.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

Let's revisit the previous topics and discuss their connections with the Fluxions project:</p><ol><li><p>Trigonometric Functions: The Fluxions package includes elementary functions such as sine (sin), cosine (cos), and logarithmic functions (log), which are fundamental components of trigonometry. These functions are implemented in Fluxions and can be used in mathematical expressions and computations involving angles, triangles, and circular functions.</p></li><li><p>Hyperbolic Functions: Fluxions provides hyperbolic functions like sinh, cosh, and tanh, which are essential in hyperbolic trigonometry. These functions find applications in areas such as physics, engineering, and signal processing. By including hyperbolic functions, Fluxions extends its functionality to handle a broader range of mathematical operations.</p></li><li><p>Exponents &amp; Logarithms: Fluxions supports exponential functions (exp) and various logarithmic functions (log, log10, log2). These functions are widely used in mathematical modeling, numerical computations, and data analysis. By incorporating these functions, Fluxions enables users to work with exponential growth, decay, and logarithmic transformations conveniently.</p></li><li><p>Differentiation and the Chain Rule: The Fluxions project is primarily focused on automatic differentiation, which involves computing derivatives of functions using the chain rule of calculus. The inner workings of Fluxions, such as the DifferentiableInnerFunction class and the Unop hierarchy, are designed to propagate derivatives through the computational graph. This connects directly to the concept of differentiation and the chain rule discussed earlier.</p></li><li><p>Numerical Computing: Fluxions leverages numerical libraries like NumPy for efficient computations on arrays and matrices. This connection with numerical computing enables Fluxions to handle vector-valued functions, calculate Jacobians, and perform computations on multi-dimensional data. It aligns with the use of numerical techniques in solving mathematical problems and analyzing data.</p></li><li><p>Machine Learning: While not explicitly mentioned in the Fluxions project description, the automatic differentiation capabilities provided by Fluxions are crucial in machine learning. Gradient-based optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent, rely on the efficient computation of derivatives. Fluxions enables users to differentiate complex functions and train neural networks more effectively, connecting to the field of machine learning.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, the Fluxions project intersects with the discussed topics by incorporating trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions, exponential functions, logarithmic functions, differentiation concepts, numerical computing techniques, and indirect connections to machine learning. These connections demonstrate how Fluxions can be applied in various mathematical, scientific, and computational domains, leveraging the concepts and tools discussed earlier.</p></div></div></div><div

calculus was invented as a formal branch of mathematics in the middle of the 17th century independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. Newton's orginal term for a derivative with respect to time was a "fluxion," which gave its name to his last book, Method of Fluxions, published posthumously.

Then we discussed Flaschard courses and Haplopraxis (simple practice), a hypothetical video game.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

1995 (Starting with a small fleet of ships and one or two planets, players develop their empires, meet other races and conquer the galaxy. Stars! games begin with race design, choosing one of 10 primary racial traits, a selection of lesser racial traits, habitability, growth, economic, and technology settings.[3] The graphics are entirely 2D, and consist of the main map view and static pictures of planets, ship hulls and components. Battles consist of moving static icons around a grid. Because of the high level of micromanagement and diplomacy requirements, many games take place over months between players spread across the galaxy.

Players initially send scouts out to scan for suitable planets which later may be colonized and developed, enlarging the player's empire and providing additional resources. As a player's empire expands the player must balance the management of the population, minerals, research, and ship/infrastructure constructions. When other players' races are encountered, a variety of diplomacy options allow for alliances, trading mineral resources or technology, large-scale wars, and even the destruction of other races. If the random events game option is enabled, players will have to contend with (or take advantage of) the Mystery Trader, comet strikes, wormholes, and environmental changes.)

Here are some additional ideas for the plot and universe construction of Haplopraxis:</p><ol><li><p>Galactic Exploration: Set the game in a vast and uncharted galaxy, where players take on the role of space explorers. The plot revolves around uncovering the mysteries of the galaxy, discovering new planets, encountering alien civilizations, and unraveling the secrets of ancient artifacts.</p></li><li><p>Epic Space Opera: Create an epic narrative that spans across multiple star systems and involves large-scale conflicts, political intrigues, and the struggle for power. Players can choose to align with different factions, each with its own goals and agendas, shaping the course of the galactic history.</p></li><li><p>Technology Advancement: Construct a universe where technological advancements play a crucial role. Players can research and develop new technologies, upgrade their ships and infrastructure, and unlock powerful abilities that give them an edge in exploration, diplomacy, or combat.</p></li><li><p>Interstellar Diplomacy: Emphasize the importance of diplomacy and negotiation in the game's universe. Players can engage in diplomatic interactions with alien races, forge alliances, trade resources and knowledge, and navigate complex interstellar politics to achieve their goals.</p></li><li><p>Procedurally Generated Universe: Implement a procedural generation system to create a vast and diverse universe with unique planets, star systems, and celestial phenomena. This ensures that each playthrough offers a different experience and encourages exploration and discovery.</p></li><li><p>Player-Driven Narrative: Provide players with meaningful choices that shape the narrative and determine the fate of the galaxy. Branching storylines, moral dilemmas, and consequential decisions can create a dynamic and immersive narrative experience, giving players a sense of agency and impact.</p></li><li><p>Ancient Civilizations and Artifacts: Introduce ancient civilizations that have left behind powerful artifacts scattered throughout the galaxy. Players can embark on quests to find and unlock these artifacts, gaining access to advanced technologies, hidden knowledge, or even altering the course of events.</p></li><li><p>Cosmic Threats: Introduce formidable cosmic threats that pose a danger to the entire galaxy. Players must rally factions, gather resources, and strategize to defend against these threats, fostering a sense of urgency and cooperation among players.</p></li><li><p>Space Exploration Mechanics: Design exploration mechanics that allow players to navigate the galaxy, scan for resources, establish colonies, and exploit planetary environments. Incorporate elements of resource management, colonization, and terraforming to add depth and variety to gameplay.</p></li><li><p>Narrative-driven Quests: Populate the universe with a wide range of quests and missions, both main storyline quests and side quests. These quests can involve a mix of combat, diplomacy, puzzle-solving, and exploration, immersing players in engaging narratives and rewarding them with valuable resources, knowledge, or reputation.</p></li></ol><p>These ideas can help shape the plot and universe construction of Haplopraxis, providing a rich and immersive experience for players as they embark on their space exploration journey.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

Then we talked about Spherepop, a hypothetical 3D programming language where programs are written by growing bubbles and evaluated by popping them.

We then shifted to discussing Haplopraxis, a space exploration and typing tutor game. The goal of the game is to explore planets by flying a spaceship and popping bubbles associated with vocabulary words.

You lose all your points if the game is reset, except if you are blinking, which can be enabled with autoblink or super autoblink.

The global reset key is 'g'.

Finally, we clarified some of the details about the game, including the controls for flying the spaceship and the mechanics of popping bubbles and avoiding resets.</div></div></div><div class="flex

we've discussed so far. To further connect these topics, here are some additional details and connections:</p><ol><li><p>Measurement Choice and Performance: The discussion about the impact of a researcher's measurement choice on performance relates to the importance of selecting appropriate metrics and methods for evaluating the effectiveness of different systems or approaches. This understanding can be applied to game development, including Haplopraxis, where the game's performance can be measured and optimized based on specific metrics, such as player engagement, learning outcomes, and user satisfaction.</p></li><li><p>Spherepop and Programming Paradigms: Spherepop, the hypothetical 3D programming language, represents an innovative and unconventional approach to programming. It introduces a unique programming paradigm where programs are constructed by growing bubbles and evaluated by popping them. This concept highlights the flexibility and creativity that can be explored in programming languages and encourages out-of-the-box thinking in game development, such as designing unique gameplay mechanics or implementing unconventional user interfaces.</p></li><li><p>Haplopraxis and Language Learning: Haplopraxis combines space exploration and typing tutoring, creating a gamified learning experience for language learners. The game mechanics of flying the spaceship and popping bubbles are intertwined with vocabulary acquisition and typing skills. By connecting gameplay actions with language learning, Haplopraxis provides an immersive and engaging environment for players to enhance their language proficiency while exploring the universe.</p></li><li><p>Autoblink and Super Autoblink: Autoblink and super autoblink are features in Haplopraxis that allow players to maintain their points even when the game is reset, except during blinking. These features provide a strategic advantage to players by incentivizing them to activate autoblink or super autoblink to protect their progress. This connects with the concept of strategic decision-making and risk management in game design, where players must weigh the benefits and consequences of using certain abilities or features.</p></li><li><p>Global Reset Key: The global reset key 'g' in Haplopraxis serves as a control mechanism for resetting the game. This keybinding allows players to initiate a game reset when needed, providing a sense of control and flexibility in managing their gameplay experience. It also emphasizes the importance of intuitive and accessible controls in game design, enabling players to interact with the game seamlessly.</p></li></ol><p>By considering these connections, we can see how the different topics and concepts intertwine, offering opportunities for innovative game design approaches, programming paradigms, and learning experiences.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>STARTS IN THE YEAR 2400 AD
The levels for the game:
Cognitive Complexity Scale:

Level 1: Basic Cognitive Abilities - Civilizations at this level possess basic cognitive abilities, including perception, memory, and simple problem-solving skills.

Level 2: Pattern Recognition and Learning - Civilizations at this level have developed advanced pattern recognition capabilities and the ability to learn from their environment.

Level 3: Abstraction and Symbolic Representation - Civilizations at this level can abstract concepts and represent them symbolically, allowing for complex communication and the development of language.

Level 4: Reasoning and Logic - Civilizations at this level have advanced logical reasoning and deductive abilities, enabling them to engage in abstract thinking and complex decision-making.

Level 5: Metacognition and Self-Awareness - Civilizations at this level possess metacognitive abilities, including self-awareness, introspection, and the ability to reflect on their own thinking processes.

Level 6: Hyperpersonal Aggregate - Civilizations at this level have developed collective intelligence and interconnected networks of minds, allowing for a shared consciousness and cooperative problem-solving on a massive scale.

Level 7: Boltzmann Brain - Civilizations at this level have reached a highly advanced state of cognitive existence, possibly as Boltzmann Brains, which are hypothetical self-aware entities that arise due to random fluctuations in the universe's energy distribution.

The addition of "Hyperpersonal Aggregate" reflects the concept of collective intelligence and the ability of civilizations to harness the power of networked minds, enabling collaboration and collective problem-solving. "Boltzmann Brain" represents an extremely advanced cognitive state, potentially existing as self-aware entities that emerge from random fluctuations.

It's important to note that the Cognitive Complexity Scale is a speculative construct, and the inclusion of "Hyperpersonal Aggregate" and "Boltzmann Brain" is based on theoretical ideas. Further research and discussion are necessary to refine and validate these concepts within the scale.

Remember, this scale is a conceptual framework designed to stimulate thought and discussion, and it should be subject to scrutiny and refinement by experts in relevant fields.

The game features an element of space exploration, where players visit planets and pop bubbles associated with vocabulary words.

It includes a typing tutor aspect, thus serving as an educational game to help players improve their typing skills.

Haplopraxis aims to simulate the evolution of the universe using Ising synchs.

The game employs a Vygtoskian ladder of proximal graduations, adjusting its gameplay based on the skill level of the player. For infants, it simplifies into a bubble pop game; for elementary schoolers, it becomes a typing tutor; if no viewer is detected, it defaults to a screen saver tutorial.

The game features a guidebot, which automatically plays through the tutorial, demonstrating possible gameplay and controls, and revealing Easter eggs.

There is a global reset function, triggered by pressing the 'g' key, which returns all players to the start of the game, making them lose all progress. However, a setting called autoblink can protect players from a global reset, allowing them to keep their points.

The game incorporates a strategy of finding the most nested bubble (innermost scope), and players are encouraged to blink when passing through the boundary of a bubble to avoid popping it.

These are the key aspects of Haplopraxis that I've gathered from our conversation. If there's anything incorrect or missing, or if you'd like to elaborate more on any of these points, please let me know!</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs

Here's a consolidated overview of the game:</p><p>Haplopraxis is a unique game that combines elements from various games and inspirations, such as Stars!, Descent, Minesweeper, Bubble Pop, logical gate circuits, and more. Its goal is to provide an engaging and educational experience for players while simulating the evolution of the universe using Ising synchs.</p><p>The game revolves around space exploration, where players visit different planets and engage in popping bubbles associated with vocabulary words. This incorporates a typing tutor aspect, allowing players to improve their typing skills as they progress through the game.</p><p>Haplopraxis implements the Vygtoskian ladder of proximal graduations, adapting its gameplay to suit the skill level of the player. It can transform into a bubble pop game for infants, a typing tutor for elementary schoolers, and even serve as a screen saver tutorial if no viewer is detected.</p><p>A guidebot assists players by automatically playing through the tutorial, demonstrating gameplay mechanics, controls, and revealing Easter eggs to enhance the overall experience.</p><p>The global reset function, triggered by pressing the 'g' key, resets the game for all players, resulting in the loss of progress. However, the autoblink setting offers protection from a global reset, allowing players to retain their earned points.</p><p>A strategic element in the game involves finding the most nested bubble (innermost scope), and players are encouraged to blink when passing through the boundary of a bubble to avoid popping it.</p><p>These elements create an immersive and dynamic gameplay experience in Haplopraxis, blending education, exploration, and strategy.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2
