Introduction
Click here to see the full API Reference
Differential calculus was invented as a formal branch of mathematics in the middle of the 17th century independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. Newton's orginal term for a derivative with respect to time was a "fluxion," which gave its name to his last book, Method of Fluxions, published posthumously. Newton used differential calculus to solve the problem of the motion of the planets around the sun, and it has proven to be an essential tool for the sciences ever since. In the modern era, essentially all scientific calculations of interest are performed on computers. There are many scenarios where we know how to compute a function of interest and would like to efficiently evaluate its derivative(s). The canonical example is root finding. If we know a function's derivative, we can iteratively improve from a starting guess until we find a root using a simple procedure, Newton's Method. Many phenomena of interest in physics and other sciences can be described as differential equations (either ODEs or PDEs). The ability to efficiently evaluate derivatives is crucial in numerically solving these systems.

In recent years, Machine Learning has been a hot research area. Solving ML problems often hinges on the ability to train a neural network using some form of a gradient descent algorithm. As the name suggests, this algorithm requires the ability to evaluate not just the function (here the output of the neural net) but also its first derivative, which in practice is typically the change in the error metric with respect to the parameter values. These neural networks are massively complex functions that can have millions of parameters. A procedure of numerically differentiating the network by shifting the value of each parameter has cost that scales linearly with the number of parameters. Some form of automatic differentiation is vital to the practical use of neural nets. One of the most successful machine learning libraries is TensorFlow by Google, which at its core is an enterprise class automatic differentiation library.

pytest
Brief How-To and Demo
Users can build up complex functions using a combination of numerical constants, fluxions Var objects, and fluxions elementary function objects like sin and exp, as well as the standard set of basic Python operators including +, -, /, *, etc. (The complete list of functions available can be found under the Elementary Functions section, below.)

The function and its derivative(s) can then be evaluated by calling function's val or diff methods. When calling val, a dictionary mapping keys (i.e. variable names) to numeric values must be passed if the Var instance(s) in the function have not already been bound to a numeric value. When passing values to val, the variable names must correspond to names given to the Var object(s) used to create the function. The same holds when differentiating a function by calling its diff method. But when differentiating a function of multiple variables, in addition to passing the dictionary mapping variable names to numeric values, the user must also specify the seed values from which to calculate the derivative.

All values will be returned from both the val and diff functions as numpy arrays that match the dimensions of the input values.

For example, to find the value and derivative of the logistic function evaluated at x=0:

>>> import fluxions as fl
>>> 
>>> # Treating x as a symbolic variable:
>>> x = fl.Var('x')
>>> f = 1 / (1 + fl.exp(-x))
>>> f.val({'x':0})

array([0.5])

>>> f.diff({'x':0})

array([0.25])

>>> # Alternatively, treating x as a numeric constant:
>>> x = fl.Var('x', 0)
>>> f = 1 / (1 + fl.exp(-x))
>>> f.val(), f.diff()

(0.5, 0.25)
Or, to evaluate the logistic function at a vector of input values, simply pass a numpy array instead of a scalar:

>>> # continuing previous example...
>>> import numpy as np
>>> 
>>> f.val({'x':np.array([-1,0,1])})

array([0.26894142, 0.5       , 0.73105858])

>>> f.diff({'x':np.array([-1,0,1])})
 
array([[0.19661193, 0.25      , 0.19661193]])
Considering instead a function of multiple variables:

>>> x = fl.Var('x')
>>> y = fl.Var('y')
>>> f = fl.log(x * y)
>>> 
>>> # evaluating f(x,y) at (x,y)=(2,0.5)
>>> f.val({'x':2, 'y':0.5})

array([0.])

>>> # partial with respect to x, evaluated at (x,y)=(2,0.5)
>>> f.diff({'x':2, 'y':0.5}, {'x':1, 'y':0})

array([0.5])

>>> # partial with respect to y, evaluated at (x,y)=(2,0.5)
>>> f.diff({'x':2, 'y':0.5}, {'x':0, 'y':1})

array([2.])
Background
Calculus gives us a few simple rules for computing the derivative of a function composed of two more elementary subfunctions. Most central to Automatic Differentiation is the Chain Rule of calculus, which states that the derivative of a composition is the product of two derivatives: .. math:: f'(u(x)) = f'(u(x) \cdot u'(x) The chain rule works in multiple dimensions. If :math:f is a function from  to , its derivative is an  x  matrix called the Jacobian. The chain rule in the multidimensional case tells us to take the matrix product of an  x  matrix and an  x  matrix to compute the derivative.

The essential idea of Automatic Differentiation is that computing the derivative of any function can be reduced to evaluating and differentiating a sequence of simple subfunctions. These may be strung together in a complex graph with multiple steps, but each step will be a basic operation. For the evaluation of a mathematical function, each step will consist of either a "primitive" or built-in function (e.g. +, -, x, /, sqrt, log, exp, pow, etc.) or a composition of these primitives. As long as we know how to evaluate both the function f(x) and its derivative f'(x) at each step, we can trace the calculation through the computation graph and also keep track of the first derivative.

The forward mode of Automatic Differentiation takes 3 arguments: a function, , a vector  at which to evaluate the function , and a vector of 'seed' values for the derivatives, $dx\in \mathbb{R}^ n$. Following the standard order of operations, the innermost elementary function calls of  are evaluated at x and dx. As above, as long as we know how to evaluate both the elementary function f(x) and its derivative f'(x) at each step, pass the results of each to enclosing functions and apply the chain rule to keep track of the first derivative. Once all function calls are complete, the algorithm returns the values  and .

         setup.py
         requirements.txt
         example_newtons_method.py
fluxion_node.py contains the definitions for the core Fluxion class, the unary (Unop) and binary (Binop) operator abstract classes, and all classes that implement the operators, e.g. Addition, Multiplication. (These classes are discussed further under the Implementation Details section, below). The abstract DifferentiableFunction and DifferentiableInnerFunction classes, as well as static objects that implement specific elementary functions, are found in elementary_functions.py.

Package tests
All tests are located in the directory fluxions/test. There are two primary test suites. To run all of these tests using pytest, simply navigate to the root package directory and execute:

pytest fluxions/
Or to run just one of the test suites,

pytest fluxions/test/test_basics.py
Example driver
The short Python program newtons_method.py found in the package root directory is a trivial example of a "driver" that uses the fluxions package to solve a problem. The program illustrates how the package can be used to implement a basic Newton's Method solver that works on functions from  to . It takes a differentiable function (Fluxion instance) as its first input, and uses forward-mode differentiation to return both the value and exact first derivative.

Implementation details
Core Data Structures
To optimize computational efficiency, fluxions is built around the NumPy package; all numerical data including inputs, outputs, and intermediate calculations are stored in numpy arrays. The only fluxions class that persists numeric data (stored as a numpy.ndarray) is the Var class; when it persists data (either at initialization or by calling the set_val method), that is stored as an array.

The package makes light use of some built-in Python data structures and their methods for parts of the code that are not critical to performance. In particular, Python dictionaries are used to specify the values and seeds with which to evaluate and differentiate functions. The keys in these dictionaries are the variable names, while the values are the numeric values (whether scalar or numpy arrays) bound to that variable.

Core Classes
Fluxion
All of the classes in this package are ultimately derived from the Fluxion base class, consistent with the fundamental idea in Automatic Differentiation that constants, variables, and elementary functions can all be treated as differentiable functions upon which complex functions are built. This class defines a common interface for the input and output behavior of all inheriting function classes.

Together with the basic operator classes described below, the Fluxion implements operator overloading for the Python symbolic operators. When one of these operators is performed on a Fluxion object, the object dispatches suitable calls to instances of the class Binop or Unop.

The Fluxion class also defines the interface through which users can interact with functions -- namely, by calling the function's val, diff, or 'jacobian' methods. The val method corresponds to function evaluation; no derivatives are calculated. The diff method corresponds to performing a single pass of forward mode evaluation with one seed value. Both of these methods take as inputs *args, allowing them to be called with alternative arguments. The val method accepts a single numpy array X or a dictionary var_tbl in which each variable name has been mapped to either a scalar value (float or int) or a numpy array. When an array is passed, it can have shape (n) or (T, n). The inputs for diff need to be sufficient to resolve both the input array  as well as the seed value. The analogous footprints include a pair of arrays, which we would label  and ; or a pair of dictionaries, which we could label var_tbl and seed_tbl.

Finally, the parse_args_val and parse_args_forward_mode Fluxion methods implement the machinery for handling various input types the user may supply. Localizing this code in the Fluxion class at the very top of the inheritance hierarchy allows us to avoid duplicating it elsewhere.

When a Fluxion instance is created, it sets the tensor size attributes ,  and , and sets the name and var_names attributes (see below for more details).

Unop, Const and Var
The Unop class embodies the concept of a unary operator. Descendants of Unop have non-trivial implementations of val and diff. Two key examples of Unops include Const and Var. Const is a constant, depending on no variables and having a derivative of zero. Var is a logical entity for a variable. The statement x = fl.Var('x') creates an instance of a Fluxion Var class. The local name x in our Python program has x.name = 'x' and x.variable_names= ['x']. This permits us to then create another Fluxion e.g. f = x * x + 5 which behaves as we expect it to. Other examples of classes that inherit from Unop include the Power and ElementaryFunction classes.

Binop, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division
The Binop class embodies the concept of a binary operator. All of the work of performing the calculations of a binary operation are performed in the children of Binop. The Binop itself is quite minimal; it binds the two input fluxions to attributes called f and g. It also sets a preliminary list of variable names by merging the names of variables for f and g, suppressing duplicates.

We can understand all four basic arithmetic operations through one example, Muliplication. The primary methods of the Multiplication class are val and forward_mode. The evaluation method val dispatches calls to f and g and returns their product. The forward_mode method builds up f_val, f_diff by calling f.forward_mode, and similarly for g. Then it applies the product rule of calculus. It is worth reiterating here that the intermediate results returned in f_val, f_diff, g_val, g_diff are all numpy arrays, so the computation f_val * g_diff + f_diff * g_val is performed with maximum efficiency.

Elementary Functions
Please see the major section below for a discussion of the implementation for elementary functions.

Important Attributes
Every Fluxion represents a function from ���� to ����. These should be invariant after the Fluxion is instantiated, though this is not currently enforced. The sizes are integer attributes named m and n on the Fluxion class. A Fluxion also has a notion of the number of sample points T. This is analogous to basic vectorization in numpy. For example, if you call np.sin on a numpy array of shape (100,), you get back another array of shape (100,). You only pay the overhead of calling the function and doing Python "unboxing" once.

Every Fluxion has a name; these are not expected to be unique. Variables also have names. This makes it possible for users to pass inputs with dictionaries, and makes the output of the __repr__ function comprehensible. Every Fluxion also an attribute called var_names, which is a list of the variables that it depends on (i.e. its inputs). This attribute controls the interpretation of input presented to a Fluxion for evaluation. For example, the Fluxions implementation extending the numpy built-in function atan2 has variable names ['y', 'x']. This also controls the order of columns in the Jacobian.

External Dependencies
The minimial set of external dependencies for fluxions are listed in requirements.txt. These dependencies include numpy, of which the fluxions package is essentially an extension, as well as pytest and pytest-cov for testing.

Elementary Functions
The elementary function objects are all specific instances of the generic DifferentiableFunction class, which itself inherits from the Unop (and thus the Fluxions) class. These functions represent basic mathematical functions that are analytically differentiable. They are all defined around corresponding numpy implementations, which perform the actual numerical calculations.

The elementary functions supported are as follows:

��� Trigonometric Functions: sin, cos, tan

��� Inverse Trigonometric Functions: arcsin, arccos, arctan

I'm sorry, but the Fluxions library isn't something I'm familiar with, and I couldn't find any information about it up to my last training data in September, 2021. It seems like you provided a rich documentation of the Fluxions library which is a highly detailed and useful resource for using the library.
From the documentation provided, it's clear that Fluxions is a Python library built around automatic differentiation, which is a vital computational tool in many areas such as physics, engineering, and machine learning. The Fluxions library can handle functions of many variables, and compute their derivatives efficiently which is often required in optimization algorithms such as gradient descent in machine learning.
The documentation gives a detailed overview of the installation process, usage of the library with examples, and detailed explanation of the implementation including the structure and behavior of the various classes in the library. It also explains how users can use the built-in functions and operators to build and evaluate complex functions, and how to compute derivatives of those functions.
The library seems to be well-structured and designed with flexibility and performance in mind. It uses NumPy for numerical computations and is organized around a core set of classes and data structures that represent the various elements of a mathematical function, such as constants, variables, and operators. The library is designed to handle vectorized computations efficiently and can deal with multidimensional inputs and outputs.
In case you have more specific questions or need further clarifications about this library, feel free to ask.

Miscellaneous Trigonometric Functions: hypot, arctan2, degrees, radians, deg2rad, rad2deg

��� Hyperbolic Functions: sinh, cosh, tanh, arcsinh, arccosh, arctanh

��� Exponents & Logarithms: exp, expm1, log, log10, log2, log1p, logaddexp, logaddexp2

While the elementary function objects are instances of the DifferentiableFunction class, they contain an additional DifferentiableInnerFunction object. This inner object is also a Unop that represents a single node on the calculation graph. This inner object is necessitated by the Chain Rule of calculus: for a composition of functions , the derivative of the outer function with respect to  is . It is therefore necessary for the outer function (f) to store an instance of the inner function (g), so that when a user requests the derivative of f is requested, differentiation can first be recursively propagated to the inner function before computing the derivative of the outermost function.

The DifferentiableInnerFunction class has one input, a Fluxion f that can be either a value type or another Fluxion. Its __init__ method binds this other Fluxion, plus two callables func and deriv. As an example, when we construct a node elem_func_node = fl.sin(fl.Var('x'))for , the input elem_func_node.fis an instance of Var with name 'x', and the two callables are node.func = np.sin and node.deriv = np.cos.

The DifferentiableFunction class is what is exposed to users. It is essentially a factory for producing instances of DifferentiableInnerFunction. The __init__ method associates one of these factories with the two callables for the function and its derivatives, plus the tensor sizes and names. That the elementary functions are all created from the DifferentiableFunction class allows users to create additional differentiable functions as desired.

Jacobian Function
The fluxions module provides a jacobian function for evaluating vector-valued functions. Such functions can be built up by storing one or more Fluxion objects in a Python list or numpy array.

While implemented as a function rather than a class, jacobian maintains an API similar to the standard Fluxion API detailed above. In particular, the Jacobian of a vector- or scalar-valued function F with respect to variables v, evaluated at value(s) given by v_mapping, simply call:

jacobian(F, v, v_mapping)

F may be a Fluxion object or a list of one or more Fluxions, while v is a list names (strings) of variable in F. The order of elements in v determines the order in which partials are returned in the Jacobian. v_mapping is a Python dict that binds variable names to numeric values.

jacobian will always return a numpy array, the dimensions of which are determined by the dimensions of F and the values passed.

Several illustrative examples of how to use jacobian follow:

Example 1: The value returned for a function from R^1 to R^1 will be identical in value and structure to the derivative returned by calling diff:

>>> y = fl.Var('y')
>>> f = y*fl.log(y)
>>> f.diff({'y':1})
array([[1.]])
>>> fl.jacobian(f, ['y'], {'y':1})
array([[1.]])
Example 2: If F is a function from R^m to R^n, then jacobian returns an m:n array if v_mapping contains scalar variable mappings:

>>> x = fl.Var('x')
>>> fl.jacobian([x**2, x*log_y], ['x','y'], {'x':2, 'y':1})
array([[4., 0.],
       [0., 2.]])
Example 3: jacobian handles tensors: if variables v mapped to vectors of length T, then jacobian returns an m : n : T array

>>> J = fl.jacobian([x**2, x*log_y, x+y], ['x','y'], {'x':np.linspace(1,10,10), 'y':np.logspace(1,10,10)})
>>> J.shape
(2, 3, 10)
Future Plans
In addition to allowing users to differentiate vector-valued functions via the jacobian function, users may be able to evaluate such functions much as they can with scalar-valued Fluxions (via the val method). This functionality could be implemented by creating a container: a "multi-fluxion" composed of one or more Fluxion objects that (much as one can write F(x,y)=[f_1(x,y), f_2(x,y), ...]). Like a simple Fluxion, this container would have val and diff methods.

It seems like you're discussing the architecture and workings of a theoretical symbolic differentiation system, where "Fluxion" is the name given to objects that represent differentiable functions or variables. In this architecture, the system would have several classes, such as
DifferentiableFunction
and
DifferentiableInnerFunction
which represent different layers of a computational graph used to compute derivatives.
It also seems you're outlining an API for the system, where the
DifferentiableFunction
class represents the user-facing interface for creating and manipulating differentiable functions, while the
DifferentiableInnerFunction
class serves as an internal representation used for the calculus involved in differentiation.
The
jacobian
function described is a function for evaluating the Jacobian matrix of a vector-valued function, a vital component of multivariate calculus. The function computes the partial derivatives of each function with respect to each variable, storing the results in a 2D array (matrix) for easy manipulation.
From your "Future Plans" section, it appears that you plan to extend this system to handle vector-valued functions more naturally, by creating a "multi-fluxion" that can encapsulate one or more
Fluxion
objects and have
val
and
diff
methods of its own.
This all seems to make sense as a theoretical design for a system for symbolic differentiation, though the details would, of course, depend on the specifics of the implementation. It's also worth noting that libraries like SymPy provide similar functionality in Python, and could be useful to look at for inspiration or comparison.

Fluxions is a Python package designed to compute functions and their derivatives, drawing its inspiration from the principles of differential calculus. The name "Fluxions" comes from Isaac Newton's term for a derivative with respect to time, which he used extensively in his work on planetary motion. In the modern world, this mathematical principle is crucial to fields such as physics, computer science, and most prominently, machine learning.
Machine learning, particularly neural networks, rely heavily on efficiently computing derivatives to train models using gradient descent algorithms. These algorithms require not just the function but also its derivative, which in this context represents the change in error with respect to model parameters. Given the complexity and scale of these networks, automatic differentiation becomes a vital tool for practical applications.
Fluxions, by providing automatic differentiation capabilities, positions itself as a useful tool in the domain of machine learning and beyond.
To use Fluxions, you first need to install it. Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that you have a Python3 environment with numpy installed. Once you have that ready, you can install the Fluxions package from PyPI using pip, a package installer for Python. Here are the commands:

That sounds like a great initiative! Using flashcards can be a very effective way to learn and retain new information. In the context of your Flyxion series, it seems you are combining elements of mathematics, specifically the concept of fluxions, with language learning on the Memrise platform.
When creating your flashcard courses, you might find it useful to incorporate real-life applications and examples to help users better grasp and remember the concepts. This could be particularly effective for mathematical principles like fluxions. For example, you could create flashcards that not only define the concept but also show how it is used in different fields, such as physics, computer science, and machine learning.
Also, consider including quizzes or other interactive elements to engage users and reinforce their learning. The spaced repetition technique, which is frequently used in language learning and memory training, could also be beneficial. This involves reviewing the flashcards at increasing intervals over time, which has been shown to significantly improve long-term retention of information.
Lastly, always ask for feedback from your users. This will help you understand what works and what doesn't, and will enable you to continuously improve your flashcard courses based on their needs and preferences.
Good luck with your Flyxion series!

Brief How-To and Demo
Users can build up complex functions using a combination of numerical constants, fluxions Var objects, and fluxions elementary function objects like sin and exp, as well as the standard set of basic Python operators including +, -, /, , etc. (The complete list of functions available can be found under the *Elementary Functions section, below.)

The function and its derivative(s) can then be evaluated by calling function���s val or diff methods. When calling val, a dictionary mapping keys (i.e. variable names) to numeric values must be passed if the Var instance(s) in the function have not already been bound to a numeric value. When passing values to val, the variable names must correspond to names given to the Var object(s) used to create the function. The same holds when differentiating a function by calling its diff method. But when differentiating a function of multiple variables, in addition to passing the dictionary mapping variable names to numeric values, the user must also specify the seed values from which to calculate the derivative.

All values will be returned from both the val and diff functions as numpy arrays that match the dimensions of the input values.

For example, to find the value and derivative of the logistic function evaluated at x=0:

>>> import fluxions as fl
>>>
>>> # Treating x as a symbolic variable:
>>> x = fl.Var('x')
>>> f = 1 / (1 + fl.exp(-x))
>>> f.val({'x':0})

array([0.5])

>>> f.diff({'x':0})

array([0.25])

>>> # Alternatively, treating x as a numeric constant:
>>> x = fl.Var('x', 0)
>>> f = 1 / (1 + fl.exp(-x))
>>> f.val(), f.diff()

(0.5, 0.25)
Or, to evaluate the logistic function at a vector of input values, simply pass a numpy array instead of a scalar:

>>> # continuing previous example...
>>> import numpy as np
>>>
>>> f.val({'x':np.array([-1,0,1])})

array([0.26894142, 0.5       , 0.73105858])

>>> f.diff({'x':np.array([-1,0,1])})

array([[0.19661193, 0.25      , 0.19661193]])
Considering instead a function of multiple variables:

>>> x = fl.Var('x')
>>> y = fl.Var('y')
>>> f = fl.log(x * y)
>>>
>>> # evaluating f(x,y) at (x,y)=(2,0.5)
>>> f.val({'x':2, 'y':0.5})

array([0.])

>>> # partial with respect to x, evaluated at (x,y)=(2,0.5)
>>> f.diff({'x':2, 'y':0.5}, {'x':1, 'y':0})

array([0.5])

>>> # partial with respect to y, evaluated at (x,y)=(2,0.5)
>>> f.diff({'x':2, 'y':0.5}, {'x':0, 'y':1})

array([2.])

The provided code demonstrates the usage of the Fluxions package to build and evaluate complex functions, as well as calculate their derivatives. Here's a breakdown of the code and its functionality:
Importing the required modules:
python
Copy code
import
fluxions
as
fl
import
numpy
as
np
Defining a symbolic variable and creating a function:
python
Copy code
x = fl.Var(
'x'
)
f =
1
/ (
1
+ fl.exp(-x))
Evaluating the function at a specific value:
python
Copy code
f.val({
'x'
:
0
})
This returns the value of the function at x=0, which is 0.5.
Calculating the derivative of the function at a specific value:
python
Copy code
f.diff({
'x'
:
0
})
This returns the derivative of the function at x=0, which is 0.25.
Treating the variable as a numeric constant and evaluating the function:
python
Copy code
x = fl.Var(
'x'
,
0
)
f.val(), f.diff()
Here, the variable x is treated as a constant with a value of 0. The function is then evaluated, resulting in a value of 0.5, and the derivative is calculated, resulting in 0.25.
Evaluating the function at a vector of input values:
python
Copy code
f.val({
'x'
: np.array([-
1
,
0
,
1
])})
This evaluates the function at x = -1, 0, and 1, returning an array of the corresponding values: [0.26894142, 0.5, 0.73105858].
Calculating the derivative of the function at a vector of input values:
python
Copy code
f.diff({
'x'
: np.array([-
1
,
0
,
1
])})
This calculates the derivatives of the function at x = -1, 0, and 1, returning an array of the corresponding derivatives: [[0.19661193, 0.25, 0.19661193]].
Evaluating a function of multiple variables and calculating partial derivatives:
python
Copy code
x = fl.Var(
'x'
)
y = fl.Var(
'y'
)
f = fl.log(x * y)
# Evaluating f(x, y) at (x, y) = (2, 0.5)
f.val({
'x'
:
2
,
'y'
:
0.5
})
# Calculating the partial derivative with respect to x, evaluated at (x, y) = (2, 0.5)
f.diff({
'x'
:
2
,
'y'
:
0.5
}, {
'x'
:
1
,
'y'
:
0
})
# Calculating the partial derivative with respect to y, evaluated at (x, y) = (2, 0.5)
f.diff({
'x'
:
2
,
'y'
:
0.5
}, {
'x'
:
0
,
'y'
:
1
})
These lines demonstrate evaluating the function f(x, y) = log(x * y) at a specific point (x, y) = (2, 0.5), and calculating the partial derivatives with respect to x and y at that point. The evaluated value is 0, the partial derivative with respect to x is 0.5, and the partial derivative with respect to y is 2.
By following this code example, users can build complex functions, evaluate them at specific values or arrays of values, and calculate their derivatives using the Fluxions package.

Background
Calculus gives us a few simple rules for computing the derivative of a function composed of two more elementary subfunctions. Most central to Automatic Differentiation is the Chain Rule of calculus, which states that the derivative of a composition is the product of two derivatives: .. math:

f'(u(x)) = f'(u(x) \cdot u'(x)
The chain rule works in multiple dimensions. If f is a function from $mathbb{R}^n$ to $mathbb{R}^m$, its derivative is an $m$ x $n$ matrix called the Jacobian. The chain rule in the multidimensional case tells us to take the matrix product of an $m$ x $r$ matrix and an $r$ x $n$ matrix to compute the derivative.

The essential idea of Automatic Differentiation is that computing the derivative of any function can be reduced to evaluating and differentiating a sequence of simple subfunctions. These may be strung together in a complex graph with multiple steps, but each step will be a basic operation. For the evaluation of a mathematical function, each step will consist of either a ���primitive��� or built-in function (e.g. +, -, x, /, sqrt, log, exp, pow, etc.) or a composition of these primitives. As long as we know how to evaluate both the function f(x) and its derivative f���(x) at each step, we can trace the calculation through the computation graph and also keep track of the first derivative.

The forward mode of Automatic Differentiation takes 3 arguments: a function, $f(x)$, a vector $x in mathbb{R}^n$ at which to evaluate the function $f(x)$, and a vector of ���seed��� values for the derivatives, $dxin mathbb{R}^ n$. Following the standard order of operations, the innermost elementary function calls of $f$ are evaluated at x and dx. As above, as long as we know how to evaluate both the elementary function f(x) and its derivative f���(x) at each step, pass the results of each to enclosing functions and apply the chain rule to keep track of the first derivative. Once all function calls are complete, the algorithm returns the values $f(x)$ and $f���(x)$.

Automatic Differentiation is a technique used to compute the derivatives of functions with respect to their input variables. It relies on the chain rule of calculus, which states that the derivative of a composition of functions is the product of the derivatives of each function in the composition.
In the context of Automatic Differentiation, the chain rule is applied to compute the derivatives of functions composed of elementary subfunctions. The derivatives are computed by evaluating and differentiating a sequence of simple subfunctions, which can be represented as a computation graph.
The forward mode of Automatic Differentiation takes three arguments: the function to be evaluated, the input vector at which to evaluate the function, and the seed values for the derivatives. The evaluation follows the order of operations, starting from the innermost elementary function calls and propagating the derivatives using the chain rule. The algorithm returns both the value of the function and its derivative with respect to the input variables.
By leveraging Automatic Differentiation, it becomes possible to efficiently compute the derivatives of complex functions by breaking them down into simpler subfunctions and applying the chain rule. This technique is particularly useful in various domains, including machine learning, numerical optimization, and scientific computing, where the ability to compute derivatives accurately and efficiently is crucial.

Automatic Differentiation (AD) is a technique for computing the derivatives of functions with respect to their input variables. It provides a way to accurately and efficiently calculate derivatives, even for complex functions that cannot be easily differentiated analytically.
AD leverages the chain rule of calculus, which states that the derivative of a composition of functions is the product of the derivatives of each function in the composition. By applying the chain rule repeatedly, AD breaks down a complex function into a sequence of simple subfunctions, and then computes the derivatives of these subfunctions.
There are two modes of AD: forward mode and backward mode. In forward mode AD, the algorithm evaluates the function and its derivatives simultaneously, starting from the input variables and propagating through the computation graph. At each step, it computes the partial derivatives with respect to the input variables and stores them. This mode is useful when the function has a small number of inputs but potentially many outputs.
On the other hand, backward mode AD, also known as reverse mode AD or backpropagation, is commonly used in machine learning and neural networks. It starts from the output of the function and works backward through the computation graph, accumulating the derivatives with respect to the input variables. This mode is efficient when the function has a large number of inputs but relatively few outputs.
Both modes of AD rely on the computation graph, which represents the structure of the function and its dependencies. The graph is constructed dynamically during the evaluation process, allowing AD to handle functions with conditional statements and loops.
The benefits of AD include accuracy, efficiency, and versatility. It provides exact derivatives, avoiding the numerical approximation errors that can occur with finite difference methods. AD is also efficient because it evaluates the function and its derivatives simultaneously, reusing intermediate results. Moreover, AD can be applied to a wide range of functions, including functions with complex compositions and non-elementary operations.
In practice, AD is implemented in libraries and frameworks that provide automatic differentiation functionality. These libraries often offer user-friendly APIs, allowing developers to define and evaluate functions, and compute their derivatives easily. The derivatives computed through AD are widely used in optimization algorithms, machine learning training, sensitivity analysis, and scientific simulations.
Overall, Automatic Differentiation is a powerful tool for computing derivatives, enabling efficient and accurate differentiation of complex functions. Its applications span various fields, contributing to advancements in scientific research, engineering, and data-driven decision-making.

analogous footprints include a pair of arrays, which we would label $X$ and $dX$; or a pair of dictionaries, which we could label var_tbl and seed_tbl.

Finally, the parse_args_val and parse_args_forward_mode Fluxion methods implement the machinery for handling various input types the user may supply. Localizing this code in the Fluxion class at the very top of the inheritance hierarchy allows us to avoid duplicating it elsewhere.

When a Fluxion instance is created, it sets the tensor size attributes $m$, $n$ and $T$, and sets the name and var_names attributes (see below for more details).

Unop, Const and Var
The Unop class embodies the concept of a unary operator. Descendants of Unop have non-trivial implementations of val and diff. Two key examples of Unops include Const and Var. Const is a constant, depending on no variables and having a derivative of zero. Var is a logical entity for a variable. The statement x = fl.Var('x') creates an instance of a Fluxion Var class. The local name x in our Python program has x.name = 'x' and x.variable_names= ['x']. This permits us to then create another Fluxion e.g. f = x * x + 5 which behaves as we expect it to. Other examples of classes that inherit from Unop include the Power and ElementaryFunction classes.

Binop, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division
The Binop class embodies the concept of a binary operator. All of the work of performing the calculations of a binary operation are performed in the children of Binop. The Binop itself is quite minimal; it binds the two input fluxions to attributes called f and g. It also sets a preliminary list of variable names by merging the names of variables for f and g, suppressing duplicates.

We can understand all four basic arithmetic operations through one example, Muliplication. The primary methods of the Multiplication class are val and forward_mode. The evaluation method val dispatches calls to f and g and returns their product. The forward_mode method builds up f_val, f_diff by calling f.forward_mode, and similarly for g. Then it applies the product rule of calculus. It is worth reiterating here that the intermediate results returned in f_val, f_diff, g_val, g_diff are all numpy arrays, so the computation f_val * g_diff + f_diff * g_val is performed with maximum efficiency.

The Fluxions package provides various classes that form the building blocks for creating and evaluating complex functions. Let's discuss some of these classes:
Unop: The Unop class represents a unary operator. It serves as the base class for other classes like Const and Var. Const represents a constant value with a derivative of zero, while Var represents a variable. Instances of Var can be created using the
fl.Var('x')
syntax, where 'x' is the variable name. Unop has implementations of the
val
and
diff
methods.
Binop: The Binop class represents a binary operator. It serves as the base class for classes like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. Binop stores two input fluxions (f and g) and handles merging variable names. The actual calculations for the binary operations are performed in the child classes.
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division: These classes inherit from Binop and implement the specific arithmetic operations. For example, the Multiplication class has
val
and
forward_mode
methods. The
val
method evaluates the product of f and g by calling their
val
methods, while the
forward_mode
method calculates the derivatives using the product rule of calculus.
These classes work together to build up complex functions using combinations of numerical constants, Var objects, and elementary function objects like sin and exp. The functions can then be evaluated using the
val
method, which requires passing a dictionary mapping variable names to numeric values. The derivatives can be calculated using the
diff
method, which also requires specifying seed values.
By using these classes and their methods, users can construct and evaluate functions, as well as compute their derivatives efficiently. The Fluxions package provides a flexible and extensible framework for automatic differentiation and function manipulation.
Note: The above explanation is based on the information provided in the previous sections and may not cover all the details and variations in the Fluxions package. For a complete understanding, it is recommended to refer to the official documentation and source code of the package.

DifferentiableInnerFunction object. This inner object is also a Unop that represents a single node on the calculation graph. This inner object is necessitated by the Chain Rule of calculus: for a composition of functions $f(g(x))$, the derivative of the outer function with respect to $x$ is $df/dg*dg/dx$. It is therefore necessary for the outer function (f) to store an instance of the inner function (g), so that when a user requests the derivative of f is requested, differentiation can first be recursively propagated to the inner function before computing the derivative of the outermost function.

The DifferentiableInnerFunction class has one input, a Fluxion f that can be either a value type or another Fluxion. Its __init__ method binds this other Fluxion, plus two callables func and deriv. As an example, when we construct a node elem_func_node = fl.sin(fl.Var('x'))for $f(x) = sin(x)$, the input elem_func_node.fis an instance of Var with name ���x���, and the two callables are node.func = np.sin and node.deriv = np.cos.

The DifferentiableFunction class is what is exposed to users. It is essentially a factory for producing instances of DifferentiableInnerFunction. The __init__ method associates one of these factories with the two callables for the function and its derivatives, plus the tensor sizes and names. That the elementary functions are all created from the DifferentiableFunction class allows users to create additional differentiable functions as desired.

Jacobian Function
The fluxions module provides a jacobian function for evaluating vector-valued functions. Such functions can be built up by storing one or more Fluxion objects in a Python list or numpy array.

While implemented as a function rather than a class, jacobian maintains an API similar to the standard Fluxion API detailed above. In particular, the Jacobian of a vector- or scalar-valued function F with respect to variables v, evaluated at value(s) given by v_mapping, simply call:

jacobian(F, v, v_mapping)
F may be a Fluxion object or a list of one or more Fluxions, while v is a list names (strings) of variable in F. The order of elements in v determines the order in which partials are returned in the Jacobian. v_mapping is a Python dict that binds variable names to numeric values.

jacobian will always return a numpy array, the dimensions of which are determined by the dimensions of F and the values passed.

Several illustrative examples of how to use jacobian follow:

Example 1: The value returned for a function from R^1 to R^1 will be identical in value and structure to the derivative returned by calling diff:

>>> y = fl.Var('y')
>>> f = y*fl.log(y)
>>> f.diff({'y':1})
array([[1.]])
>>> fl.jacobian(f, ['y'], {'y':1})
array([[1.]])
Example 2: If F is a function from R^m to R^n, then jacobian returns an m:n array if v_mapping contains scalar variable mappings:

>>> x = fl.Var('x')
>>> fl.jacobian([x**2, x*log_y], ['x','y'], {'x':2, 'y':1})
array([[4., 0.],
       [0., 2.]])
Example 3: jacobian handles tensors: if variables v mapped to vectors of length T, then jacobian returns an m : n : T array

>>> J = fl.jacobian([x**2, x*log_y, x+y], ['x','y'], {'x':np.linspace(1,10,10), 'y':np.logspace(1,10,10)})
>>> J.shape

The DifferentiableInnerFunction object is an important component in the Fluxions package. It represents a single node in the calculation graph and is used to handle the composition of functions and the application of the Chain Rule of calculus.
The DifferentiableInnerFunction class takes a Fluxion object, which can be either a value type or another Fluxion, as its input. Its
__init__
method binds this Fluxion object along with two callables:
func
and
deriv
. The
func
callable represents the mathematical function associated with the Fluxion, while the
deriv
callable represents the derivative of the function. For example, if we create a node
elem_func_node = fl.sin(fl.Var('x'))
for the function $f(x) = \sin(x)$, the input
elem_func_node.f
is an instance of Var with the name 'x', and the
func
and
deriv
callables are set to
np.sin
and
np.cos
, respectively.
The DifferentiableFunction class, which is exposed to users, acts as a factory for producing instances of DifferentiableInnerFunction. Its
__init__
method associates the function and derivative callables with the necessary tensor sizes and names. By using the DifferentiableFunction class, users can create their own differentiable functions by specifying the appropriate callables and tensor properties.
The fluxions module also provides a
jacobian
function for evaluating vector-valued functions. It allows users to build up such functions by storing one or more Fluxion objects in a list or numpy array. The
jacobian
function has a similar API to the standard Fluxion API and can be used to calculate the Jacobian of a function with respect to multiple variables.
To use the
jacobian
function, you provide the function(s) F, a list of variable names v, and a dictionary v_mapping that binds variable names to numeric values. The function(s) F can be a single Fluxion object or a list of Fluxions. The order of the variable names in v determines the order in which the partial derivatives are returned in the Jacobian. The
jacobian
function always returns a numpy array, and its dimensions are determined by the dimensions of F and the values passed.
The provided examples illustrate the usage of the
jacobian
function. In Example 1, a scalar function is evaluated, and the resulting Jacobian is a single-element array. In Example 2, a function from R^m to R^n is evaluated, and the Jacobian is an m x n array. Example 3 demonstrates how the
jacobian
function handles tensors, where the variables v are mapped to vectors of length T, resulting in an m x n x T array.
These features in the Fluxions package enable the computation of derivatives and Jacobians for complex functions, facilitating automatic differentiation and vector-valued function evaluations.

Future Plans
In addition to allowing users to differentiate vector-valued functions via the jacobian function, users may be able to evaluate such functions much as they can with scalar-valued Fluxions (via the val method). This functionality could be implemented by creating a container: a ���multi-fluxion��� composed of one or more Fluxion objects that (much as one can write F(x,y)=[f_1(x,y), f_2(x,y), ���]). Like a simple Fluxion, this container would have val and diff methods.

The future plans for the Fluxions package include expanding the functionality to allow users to evaluate vector-valued functions in a similar way as scalar-valued Fluxions. This can be achieved by introducing a container called a "multi-fluxion" that is composed of one or more Fluxion objects. This container would allow users to define a vector-valued function, such as F(x, y) = [f_1(x, y), f_2(x, y), ...], where each component function f_i(x, y) is a Fluxion.
The multi-fluxion container would provide methods such as val and diff, similar to a simple Fluxion, allowing users to evaluate the vector-valued function and compute its derivatives. This extension would enhance the versatility of the Fluxions package by enabling the handling of complex functions involving multiple variables and producing vector outputs.
These future plans aim to provide users with a comprehensive set of tools for working with both scalar-valued and vector-valued functions, empowering them to perform advanced computations, automatic differentiation, and explore complex mathematical relationships more efficiently.

The game is based on Descent, and Stars! 1995 (Starting with a small fleet of ships and one or two planets, players develop their empires, meet other races and conquer the galaxy. Stars! games begin with race design, choosing one of 10 primary racial traits, a selection of lesser racial traits, habitability, growth, economic, and technology settings.[3] The graphics are entirely 2D, and consist of the main map view and static pictures of planets, ship hulls and components. Battles consist of moving static icons around a grid. Because of the high level of micromanagement and diplomacy requirements, many games take place over months between players spread across the galaxy.

Players initially send scouts out to scan for suitable planets which later may be colonized and developed, enlarging the player's empire and providing additional resources. As a player's empire expands the player must balance the management of the population, minerals, research, and ship/infrastructure constructions. When other players' races are encountered, a variety of diplomacy options allow for alliances, trading mineral resources or technology, large-scale wars, and even the destruction of other races. If the random events game option is enabled, players will have to contend with (or take advantage of) the Mystery Trader, comet strikes, wormholes, and environmental changes.)

The game features a guidebot, which automatically plays through the tutorial, demonstrating possible gameplay and controls, and revealing Easter eggs.

There is a global reset function, triggered by pressing the 'g' key, which returns all players to the start of the game, making them lose all progress. However, a setting called autoblink can protect players from a global reset, allowing them to keep their points.

The game incorporates a strategy of finding the most nested bubble (innermost scope), and players are encouraged to blink when passing through the boundary of a bubble to avoid popping it.

These are the key aspects of Haplopraxis that I've gathered from our conversation. If there's anything incorrect or missing, or if you'd like to elaborate more on any of these points, please let me know!
