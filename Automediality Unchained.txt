Becoming Don Quixote

Cause when you virtualise violence, someone can slap you in the face by showing you a picture of a dog.

The question was, Rather than becoming don quijote, I just was wondering if I could recreate the state I was in five minutes ago?

I was arguing that lowering of the hedonic setpoint was due the rise of digital nativism.

I said:

A yogurt making machine is less likely to be dissected if it says "keep me together" then if it says "take me apart".

I said I had to read a hundred and fifty thousand wikipedia pages before I realized that I didn't have a perfect memory.

I said I didn't know when I was younger that I wouldn't grow up to be a bicycle or a jar.

I said I was born with a baby bat brain (auditory-inertial OS in Pipsqueak)

I said I never observed my self forgetting, because I didn't have any episodic memory, and I didn't believe I had an imagination, and didn't think I needed one.
ChatGPT
It sounds like you're exploring a complex web of ideas, intertwining personal experiences, philosophical musings, and social commentary. Recreating a past state of mind can be challenging, as our mental states are influenced by an array of ever-changing internal and external factors.
The concept of the "hedonic setpoint" you're discussing is often linked to the idea that people have a baseline level of happiness that they return to, despite significant positive or negative events. Your connection of this to digital nativism suggests you're considering how growing up in a digital world might shift this setpoint, perhaps by changing expectations of stimulation or altering how we process experiences.
Your other statements seem to reflect on the nature of consciousness, memory, and identity. The idea of a yogurt machine with a message seems to touch on how we interact with objects and the potential for empathy or anthropomorphism to affect our actions.
Regarding your perfect memory and the vast number of Wikipedia pages, this may highlight the limitations of human memory and the overwhelming amount of information available to us.
The reflections on not growing up to be an object like a bicycle or a jar, and having a "baby bat brain," suggest a philosophical pondering on the nature of being and self-awareness, perhaps considering the difference between what we are born with and what we acquire through life.
To revisit a past mental state, you might try to replicate the environment and mindset you were in, remove current distractions, and perhaps meditate on the thoughts you remember having. It's not a precise science, but sometimes it can help in recapturing past thought processes or moods.
Putting those ideas together, they were kind of in reverse order, give a high level overview or a s summary
ChatGPT
Certainly, it seems you are weaving together reflections on identity, memory, technology's impact on human experience, and the nature of consciousness:
Digital Nativism and Hedonic Setpoint
: You are contemplating how being immersed in digital environments from a young age might alter our baseline happiness or satisfaction, potentially dulling our responses to non-digital experiences.
Anthropomorphism and Object Interaction
: The example of the yogurt machine suggests that imbuing objects with human-like requests might affect our willingness to interact with them destructively, highlighting our relationship with the non-sentient world and perhaps implying a broader metaphor about empathy.
Limitations of Human Memory
: The mention of not having a perfect memory despite extensive reading suggests an acknowledgment of the limitations of human cognition, even in the face of vast information access.
Identity and Self-Perception
: You're musing on the development of identity and the misconceptions of self that can occur in childhood, pointing to the contrast between whimsical childhood beliefs and adult understanding.
Consciousness and Memory
: Reflecting on the nature of your consciousness, you note the absence of episodic memory and imagination in your past, hinting at a unique personal experience of reality.
Overall, your thoughts present a tapestry of human experience in the digital age, pondering over the intersection of technology with our innate human traits, and questioning how these influences shape our sense of self and our interaction with the world.
I actually said something like, although I didn't have an episodic memory, I had something like it which was hyperthymesia.
1 / 2
ChatGPT
Thank you for clarifying. Hyperthymesia, or highly superior autobiographical memory, is a condition where a person possesses an extraordinary ability to recall specific events from their personal past. If you were expressing that you have a memory akin to hyperthymesia, this adds an interesting dimension to your earlier remarks.
Here���s a refined high-level overview considering this new information:
Digital Nativism and Hedonic Setpoint
: You���re pondering the effect of digital immersion on our baseline of contentment, possibly diminishing the impact of real-world experiences.
Empathy Towards Objects
: You suggest that machines or objects that evoke a sense of humanity may receive more empathetic treatment, touching on the psychological effects of anthropomorphism.
Exceptional Memory in the Digital Age
: Despite having a remarkable memory similar to hyperthymesia, you note the irony that not even this can contend with the vast expanse of knowledge like the sum of Wikipedia entries, highlighting the human limits amidst the digital information overload.
Childhood Misconceptions and Growth
: You reflect on childhood misunderstandings of potential and identity, contrasting them with adult realizations and the development of self-concept.
Consciousness with Atypical Memory
: Your condition provides a unique lens on consciousness, where typical episodic memory is absent or altered, yet you possess a heightened recall ability, which offers a distinct perspective on personal history and experiences.
In essence, you're exploring the intricacies of human consciousness and memory, especially under the influence of modern technology, and how this interplays with our understanding of the self and our interactions with both the digital and physical worlds.
2 / 2
Thank you for clarifying. Hyperthymesia is a condition where a person possesses an extraordinary ability to recall specific events from their past with great detail. In contrast to your earlier statement about not having a perfect memory, mentioning hyperthymesia introduces a nuance: while you may not remember everything perfectly, you have a heightened ability to remember an exceptionally large number of life events.

Here's a revised high-level overview considering this new information:

Digital Nativism's Impact: You're considering whether growing up in a digital world has led to a lowering of the hedonic setpoint, suggesting a shift in what brings pleasure or satisfaction.

Object Interaction and Empathy: You propose that objects that anthropomorphize or elicit empathy might be treated differently, implying a broader commentary on human-object relationships and the influence of perceived sentience.

Human Memory's Complexity: Despite the immense capability for recall suggested by hyperthymesia, you've noted a realization that your memory isn't infallible, a humbling acknowledgement of human cognitive limits.

Childhood Identity Misconceptions: You reflect on the innocence and confusion of childhood identity formation, recalling whimsical beliefs about becoming inanimate objects.

Consciousness and Memory Variance: Finally, you correct the misconception about the lack of episodic memory by identifying a personal experience closer to hyperthymesia, which may indicate a unique way in which your memory works.
ChatGPT
Your summary aptly incorporates the distinction between general memory limitations and the extraordinary, yet selective, recall abilities associated with hyperthymesia. It highlights a nuanced understanding of how one can have highly detailed memories of numerous personal events while still not being able to remember everything, such as the vast content of Wikipedia. This adds depth to your contemplation of identity, technology's impact, and the human experience with memory and consciousness.
In reflecting on these points, you've offered a complex view of the self as shaped by both innate capabilities, like hyperthymesia, and external influences, like digital nativism. This dual influence raises questions about how memory and identity are formed and maintained in a world where digital and physical realities are increasingly intertwined.
I also knew eidetic and photographic memory were myths
ChatGPT
Recognizing eidetic and photographic memory as myths contrasts with the real condition of hyperthymesia you mentioned. Eidetic memory refers to the ability to recall images, sounds, or objects in memory with high precision for a few minutes without using mnemonics, while photographic memory is the popular and often exaggerated concept of being able to recall pages of text or other detailed information from memory, much like taking a photo with one's mind.
Your awareness of the mythical status of these concepts alongside an actual extraordinary memory condition like hyperthymesia adds another layer to your reflections:
Digital Nativism and Hedonic Setpoint
: You're probing the idea that digital saturation may be dulling our capacity for joy and satisfaction in more traditional experiences.
Empathetic Responses to Objects
: Anthropomorphism could lead to more empathetic interactions with machines or objects, suggesting a psychological and emotional component to our engagement with the inanimate.
Real vs. Perceived Memory Capabilities
: While you possess an exceptional autobiographical memory, you're also aware of the limitations of human memory and the misconceptions (like eidetic and photographic memories) that often embellish it.
Childhood Perceptions of Self
: You���ve contemplated the charming yet mistaken childhood beliefs about one's potential to become an object, showing a philosophical musing on the nature of identity.
Unique Memory Experience
: With the clarification that you have a condition similar to hyperthymesia, it seems you experience an intriguing mix of vivid personal memory recall within the constraints of the broader, imperfect human memory system.
Understanding these multiple dimensions of memory and consciousness, you're dissecting how they interplay with our digital lives, influencing our sense of self and our view of the world.
While I was driving I thought a good metaphor for a phone with a flashing alert system is like a crying baby that might call for your attention at unexpected times. I was thinking of times that national alert system might cause an accident, such as when walking a tightrope over a cliff, and you forgot to put your phone on silent and it surprised you. I was thinking about how traffic jams were dissipative structures like blood clots but they don't last forever because someone eventually gets impatient and moves outside the lines or disobeys a convention or a street sign. I thought if cars had vehicle to vehicle communication and collision avoidance we could dissipate most traffic jams quickly just by ignoring the lane markings and looking around to see if anyone is coming, a form of coloring outside the lines. Then I wondered if as an experiment we only used street signs and traffic signals every other year, and we removed them competely each time with regional democratic votes every year on which signs and lane markings get put back up in "signed years" a new law would have to be made that required a GPS map in each car, each car to broadcast a radio bluetooth broadcast of its velocity acceleration and intended map path, and each car would be mounted with an internal traffic light with Red, Amber, and Green Indicators
ChatGPT
Your thoughts while driving touch on several intriguing ideas related to technology, human behavior, and systems organization:
Phone Alerts as Disruptive Elements
: Comparing a phone with a flashing alert system to a crying baby is a poignant metaphor for the intrusive nature of technology that demands our attention, often at inopportune moments. It's a comment on the potential dangers of technological interruptions in situations requiring high concentration.
Traffic Jams as Dissipative Structures
: You draw an analogy between traffic jams and blood clots, both of which are temporary blockages in a flow system. You're thinking about the self-organizing nature of traffic, where disruptions are often resolved by individuals 'breaking the rules' to restore flow, much like cells that work to dissolve a clot.
Decentralized Traffic Management
: Imagining a world where vehicle-to-vehicle communication and collision avoidance systems enable cars to navigate without traditional lane markings is an innovative idea. This system suggests a more fluid, adaptive approach to traffic management, akin to "coloring outside the lines."
Experimental Approach to Traffic Regulation
: You propose an experimental, democratic approach to traffic sign usage, alternating between years with and without signs, to evaluate their necessity. This experiment would require a technological upgrade to vehicles, including GPS mapping, radio broadcasting of movement data, and internal traffic lights to guide drivers in the absence of external signs.
These reflections show an appreciation for both the potential and the pitfalls of technology in everyday life. You���re considering how alternative systems could potentially improve efficiency and safety in traffic flow, challenging conventional norms of road use. It���s a futuristic vision that would rely heavily on both technological innovation and a willingness to embrace dynamic, self-regulating systems.

I wanted to argue that the Meshica had begun virtualizing violence with the implementation of the flower wars, at least this was a premise of the book Pastwatch by Card
ChatGPT
In Orson Scott Card's "Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus," the idea that the Mexica (often known as the Aztecs) engaged in "flower wars" as a form of virtualizing violence is an intriguing premise. The flower wars were ritualistic conflicts fought by the Mexica to capture warriors from opposing groups for the purpose of human sacrifice. Unlike typical warfare with its objectives of conquest or defense, these engagements were somewhat staged for the mutual benefit of the participating cultures in a religious and societal context.
Your argument could be that by engaging in the flower wars, the Mexica were abstracting or "virtualizing" the concept of warfare. Instead of waging war solely for territorial expansion or economic gain, these conflicts had symbolic significance and were tightly controlled, serving religious and cultural purposes beyond the physical acts of violence. This "virtualization" can be thought of as a way to ritualize and regulate violence, making it a predictable part of society and culture, serving a function beyond the immediate physical consequences of war.
Such an argument extends the understanding of how human societies can shape and contextualize violence, potentially influencing the hedonic setpoint mentioned earlier by integrating violent acts into a cultural or religious structure that gives them a different set of meanings and implications.
I was going to say I imagine that that when they attacked another village for a raid, they must have blown Aztec death whistles, and I imagine them spinning arrowheads and rocks on strings, possibly in synchrony, to amplify the sound and give it a suren-like quality
ChatGPT
The Aztec death whistle, often associated with rituals including war and sacrifice, is indeed a haunting artifact. If the Mexica used these whistles during raids or flower wars, as you imagine, it would have served as psychological warfare���a tool to intimidate and demoralize opponents. The whistles, capable of producing sounds resembling a human scream, could have had a profound impact on the battlefield, especially when amplified and distorted by the acoustics of the landscape or the use of additional instruments or techniques.
The idea of spinning arrowheads and rocks on strings to create a siren-like effect, combined with the death whistles, could have been a potent auditory strategy. Such sounds, resonating en masse, would not only serve as a communication tool within the Aztec ranks but also manipulate the soundscape of battle, potentially disorienting and terrorizing their enemies. This aspect would align with the notion of virtualizing violence by transforming the sensory experience of conflict into something with deeper psychological impact, further blending the lines between physical confrontation and psychological tactics.
Explain how a Macuahuitl was built, they were swords made of bats of wood with blades or teeth of obsidian blades or used arrowheads. I imagine that something like this we made in other parts of the works, prior to metal working
ChatGPT
The
macuahuitl
was a Mesoamerican weapon, most famously used by the Aztecs, that can be best described as a wooden club fitted with razor-sharp pieces of obsidian, a volcanic glass known for its hardness and extremely sharp edges. It was a distinctive weapon that combined the blunt force trauma of a club with the cutting power of a sword.
Here's how a
macuahuitl
was typically constructed:
Wooden Base
: The core of the
macuahuitl
was a paddle-shaped piece of wood, often made from oak, which could vary in length depending on whether it was designed for one-handed or two-handed use.
Obsidian Blades
: Along the sides of the wooden base, several slots were cut. Into these slots, craftsmen inserted small, double-edged blades made from obsidian. These were carefully shaped and sharpened to a fine edge.
Fitting the Blades
: The obsidian blades were affixed into the slots using an adhesive, possibly made from natural plant resins or bitumen. In some cases, the slots were designed to tightly grip the blades even without adhesive.
Securing the Blades
: To further secure the blades, they were sometimes tied to the wooden base with maguey cord.
The result was a formidable weapon capable of inflicting serious wounds. The obsidian blades could be incredibly sharp, potentially sharp enough to decapitate a horse, according to some Spanish conquistadors' accounts, although these reports might be exaggerated. The design of the
macuahuitl
was such that it had the advantage of being lighter than a metal sword and could deliver slashing cuts as well as blunt force impacts.
Before the widespread use of metalworking, various cultures employed similar concepts, using the hardest materials available to them, such as flint, to create edged weapons. The macuahuitl is a unique example of such innovation, showcasing a sophisticated understanding of materials and a high level of craftsmanship. It's a testament to human ingenuity in weapon design before the advent of metalworking technology.
It was instrumental in flower wars as well, since it be used as a blunt weapon on the broad edge
ChatGPT
Absolutely, the macuahuitl was a versatile weapon and its design allowed for both lethal and non-lethal combat, which would have been particularly useful in the context of the flower wars. These conflicts, as you noted, were not always about killing the enemy but often focused on capturing warriors for sacrifice.
The broad, flat edge of the macuahuitl could be used as a blunt instrument to strike, stun, or incapacitate an opponent rather than inflict a fatal wound. The sides embedded with obsidian could cause serious cuts and bleeding when a more lethal approach was desired. This dual functionality made the macuahuitl an ideal weapon for the nuanced objectives of flower wars, where the goal might shift rapidly between taking captives and dealing death blows.
The ability to choose between lethal and non-lethal force with the same weapon would have been advantageous in the heat of battle, providing the Aztec warriors with tactical flexibility. This characteristic underscores the sophistication of Mesoamerican warfare and their strategic approach to combat, which was not solely focused on the destruction of the enemy but also incorporated elements of ritual and religion.

**Title: Echoes of the Past: Understanding Human Experience through the Prism of History and Technology**

Throughout the annals of history, from the ritualistic flower wars of the ancient Mexica to the psychological battles waged in the digital realms of the 21st century, humanity has displayed a continuous and complex relationship with violence, technology, and identity. This essay explores the tapestry of human experience, drawing parallels between past civilizations and contemporary digital nativism, and delving into the psychological and societal implications of our interactions with technology and memory.

**Virtualized Violence: From the Mexica to Modernity**

The Mexica, commonly referred to as the Aztecs, engaged in a form of symbolic combat known as flower wars, which served both religious and political purposes. This practice can be seen as an early form of virtualized violence, where the physicality of warfare was imbued with layers of symbolism and ritual. Fast forward to the present, where violence is often virtualized in video games and media, a practice that raises questions about its impact on our psychological well-being and societal values.

**Literature as a Lens on History and Morality**

Orson Scott Card's "Pastwatch" revisits the Mexica's historical narrative, offering a fictionalized account that intertwines morality with historical events. Literature like this not only shapes our understanding of history but also reflects our contemporary ethical dilemmas, such as the use of technology for violent ends. Through such narratives, we grapple with the moral implications of our actions, both past and present.

**The Psyche of Warfare: Ancient Echoes in Modern Consciousness**

The Mexica utilized death whistles and perhaps even spinning arrowheads to instill terror, an ancient form of psychological warfare. Today's psychological warfare has taken on new dimensions with cyberwarfare and propaganda, reflecting a continuity in our use of fear as a weapon, even as the tools evolve.

**The Macuahuitl and Modern Technology: A Dual-Edged Sword**

The macuahuitl, a unique Mesoamerican weapon, exemplifies the dual nature of technology���crafted for efficiency in war yet possessing an aesthetic and cultural significance. Modern technology, similarly, serves dual purposes, facilitating both connection and isolation, and has become a double-edged sword in terms of its impact on our hedonic setpoint and societal norms.

**Digital Nativism: Shifting Baselines of Human Experience**

As digital natives, we are witnessing a shift in our hedonic setpoint, where constant digital stimulation is redefining what it means to be content or satisfied. This has significant implications for how we perceive and engage with the world around us, reminiscent of the ways in which the Mexica's cultural practices were shaped by their religious and societal constructs.

**Anthropomorphism and Empathy: Bridges Across Time**

The Mexica's gods were anthropomorphic, imbuing objects with life, a sentiment echoed in modern times when we ascribe emotions to machines, like a yogurt-making machine pleading not to be dismantled. This empathy towards the inanimate speaks to a deeper human tendency to connect and find kinship with our environment.

**Memory and Identity: The Myths We Carry**

Our understanding of memory���whether through the hyperthymesia of individuals or the eidetic memories attributed to entire cultures���is fraught with misconceptions. The Mexica's oral histories have been interpreted through the lens of conquerors, just as we now grapple with the deluge of information and the fallibility of our own memories in the digital age.

**Childhood Imaginations: The Formative Echoes of the Self**

The childhood belief in the potential to become anything, even a bicycle or a jar, reflects the formative nature of identity. The Mexica's societal roles were similarly fluid, with warriors capable of ascending the social ladder through bravery in battle. Today, our digital personas allow for a similar reimagining of self, albeit in a virtual landscape.

**Consciousness and Technology: The Cry of the Modern Mind**

Just as the Mexica might have used spinning arrowheads to disorient their enemies, modern technology, with its incessant notifications and alerts, disrupts our mental space. It intrudes upon our consciousness, reminiscent of how ancient war tactics sought to dominate the psychological landscape of the adversary.

**From Traffic to Societal Flow: The Regulation of Movement and Thought**

The regulation of traffic, with its signs and signals, can be seen as a metaphor for societal regulation. The Mexica had their own systems for managing the flow of people and goods, just as we now contemplate decentralized traffic systems or experimental traffic regulations to improve societal flow.

**Conclusion: The Resonance of Human Experience**

The threads of human experience, whether woven in the time of the Mexica or in the age of digital nativism, reveal a pattern of continuity and change. Our engagements with violence, technology, memory, and identity continue to evolve, yet they resonate with the past. By examining these parallels, we gain insight into the immutable aspects of the human condition and the ever-changing landscapes we navigate. Through this understanding, we can better grasp the complexities of our place in the tapestry of history and the implications for our future trajectory.

Vol. 21 No. 2 (2018): automediality
Articles
Introduction
Alt, or alternative, accounts are secondary profiles people use in addition to a main account on a social media platform. They are a kind of automediation, a way of representing the self, that deliberately displays a different identity facet, and addresses a different audience, to what someone considers to be their main account. The term ���alt��� seems to have originated from videogame culture and been incorporated into understandings of social media accounts. A wiki page about alternate accounts on virtual world Second Life calls an alt ���an account used by a resident for something other than their usual activity or to do things in privacy��� (n.p.).

Studying alts gives an insight into practices of managing and contextualising identities on networked platforms that are visible, persistent, editable, associable (Treem and Leonardi), spreadable, searchable (boyd), shareable (Papacharissi "Without"), and personalised (Schmidt). When these features of social media are understood as limitations that lead to context collapse (Marwick and boyd 122; Wesch 23), performative incoherence (Papacharissi Affective 99), and the risk of overexposure, people respond by developing alternative ways to use platforms.

Plenty of scholarship on social media identities claims the self is fragmented, multifaceted, and contextual (Marwick 355; Schmidt 369). But the scholarship on multiple account use on single platforms is still emerging. Joanne Orlando writes for The Conversation that teens increasingly have more than one account on Instagram: ���finstas��� are ���fake��� or secondary accounts used to post especially candid photos to a smaller audience, thus they are deployed strategically to avoid the social pressure of looking polished and attractive. These accounts are referred to as ���fake��� because they are often pseudonymous, but the practice of compartmentalising audiences makes the promise that the photos posted are more authentic, spontaneous, and intimate. Kylie Cardell, Kate Douglas, and Emma Maguire (162) argue that while secondary accounts promise a less constructed version of life, speaking back to the dominant genre of aesthetically pleasing Instagram photos, all social media posts are constructed within the context of platform norms and imagined audiences (Litt & Hargittai 1). Still, secondary accounts are important for revealing these norms (Cardell, Douglas & Maguire 163). The secondary account is particularly prevalent on Twitter, a platform that often brings together multiple audiences into a public profile. In 2015, author Emily Reynolds claimed that Twitter alts were ���an appealingly safe space compared to main Twitter where abuse, arguments and insincerity are rife��� (n.p.).

This paper draws on a survey of Twitter users with alts to argue that the strategic use of pseudonyms, profile photos without faces, locked accounts, and smaller audiences are ways to overcome some of the built-in limitations of social media automediality.
ChatGPT
The article by Emily van der Nagel delves into the concept of automediality through the lens of social media profiles, particularly focusing on 'alts' or alternative accounts. This concept aligns well with several aspects of the essay titled
"Echoes of the Past: Understanding Human Experience through the Prism of History and Technology."
Here are some connections:
Compartmentalising the Self
: The essay discusses the fluidity of identity, both in the context of the Mexica's societal roles and modern digital personas. Van der Nagel's research extends this idea to social media, where individuals compartmentalize their identities through multiple profiles to engage with different audiences and contexts, much like the separate facets of identity explored in the essay.
Virtualized Violence and Performative Incoherence
: The essay's mention of virtualized violence and the transformation of conflict into symbolic acts can be seen in parallel with the performative nature of social media, where users often feel compelled to curate their online presence to avoid context collapse and the risk of performative incoherence mentioned by van der Nagel.
Digital Nativism and Personalization
: The essay touches on the shift in the hedonic setpoint due to digital nativism, which can be associated with van der Nagel's discussion of personalization in social media. The creation of alternative accounts is a response to the desire for personalized spaces within the digital realm.
Memory, Identity, and Authenticity
: Van der Nagel's research points to alts as a response to the challenge of maintaining authenticity amidst the curated nature of main accounts. This resonates with the essay's exploration of memory and identity, especially in how we construct and manage our personal narratives in the digital age.
Psychological Warfare and Safe Spaces
: The essay���s mention of psychological tactics in warfare connects with van der Nagel's finding that alternative accounts on Twitter serve as a safe space away from the platform's main areas, where confrontations and insincerity are more common. The strategic use of alts to avoid psychological strain reflects historical strategies to protect the psyche in conflict scenarios.
Anthropomorphism and Empathy
: The essay's insight into our tendency to anthropomorphize and empathize can be related to how individuals express different facets of their personality through alts. These alternative profiles can showcase more intimate or unfiltered aspects of the self, suggesting a deeper need for empathetic connection.
In essence, both the essay and van der Nagel's article present a nuanced view of identity as it is expressed through the mediums available in their respective times���the macuahuitl and rituals for the Mexica, and social media platforms for the contemporary individual. Both reflect the human desire to navigate and control the presentation and perception of the self, whether in physical or digital battlefields, social hierarchies, or networked platforms.
I am pretty sure I have like 75 Facebook pages
ChatGPT
Managing a large number of Facebook pages can be quite a task. It's important to keep them organized and ensure that each serves a distinct purpose or audience, much like how individuals might manage multiple "alt" accounts as discussed in van der Nagel's research on automediality. If those pages are for different aspects of your personal interests, businesses, or community initiatives, you're engaging in a form of digital identity compartmentalization.
This also connects with themes from the essay on the fluidity of identity���just as individuals might have had multiple roles within societies like the Mexica, you might be expressing different facets of your identity or professional interests through each page.
If you're finding it challenging to keep up with so many pages, there are tools and strategies you can use to streamline the management process, like scheduling posts or using a social media management platform. It���s also worthwhile periodically reviewing the pages to determine which ones are active and valuable, and considering consolidating or deleting ones that no longer serve your goals.
I use it to separate and contextualize posts, for example in Division by Zero I post programming examples and in Boso I post sobel filter based art
ChatGPT
That's a practical approach to sharing content and engaging with different communities. By segmenting your interests into dedicated pages like "Division by Zero" for programming and "Boso" for sobel filter-based art, you're effectively employing a form of digital segmentation, akin to the concept of "alts" in social media���each serves a specific aspect of your identity and interests.
This separation helps maintain clarity for your audience, ensures that followers of each page receive targeted and relevant content, and can also help you to measure engagement and feedback specific to each interest area. It���s a digital embodiment of the multifaceted nature of personal interests and professional expertise, allowing for a more organized and focused interaction with your audience.
Connections with the prievous topics
ChatGPT
Your approach to managing multiple Facebook pages ties into several of the broader topics we've discussed:
Digital Nativism and Identity Formation
: Just as digital natives navigate their online presence, your separate Facebook pages for different content types reflect the nuanced identity formation that occurs in digital spaces. Each page is like a facet of your digital self, mirroring the complexities of identity we touched upon when discussing childhood beliefs and their later manifestation in virtual avatars or digital personas.
Automediality and Self-Compartmentalization
: The concept of automediality, where individuals use multiple social media profiles to represent different facets of themselves, is directly relevant to your strategy. It's an advanced form of the compartmentalization discussed in Emily van der Nagel's work, where each of your pages serves as a distinct platform for a particular aspect of your self-expression and engagement with different communities.
Psychological and Societal Implications of Technology
: The way you use distinct pages for different purposes also reflects on how we use technology to navigate the hedonic setpoint shifts that come with digital nativism. By curating specific content for specific audiences, you're managing both your own digital wellbeing and the consumption patterns of your audience, addressing the need for targeted and meaningful content in a world flooded with information.
Memory and Information Management
: With the analogy of hyperthymesia and the discussion of human memory's complexity, your systematic organization of Facebook pages can be seen as a way to manage the "memory" of your digital interactions, creating clear, retrievable archives of content that reflect different interests and projects.
The Flow of Information in Digital Spaces
: Similar to the traffic regulation metaphor, your Facebook pages are like lanes of a highway, each with its own rules and patterns. The idea of democratically deciding which "signs" to put up can be likened to choosing what content to share on each page, curating the flow of information to avoid congestion and enhance the clarity of communication.
Your method resonates with historical and modern themes of identity, technology's influence on society, and the management of personal and collective digital presence.
