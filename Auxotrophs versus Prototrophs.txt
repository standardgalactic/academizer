Auxotrophy (Ancient Greek: ������������� "to increase"; ���������� "nourishment") is the inability of an organism to synthesize a particular organic compound required for its growth (as defined by IUPAC). An auxotroph is an organism that displays this characteristic; auxotrophic is the corresponding adjective. Auxotrophy is the opposite of prototrophy, which is characterized by the ability to synthesize all the compounds needed for growth.


This is a visual depiction of what conditions would allow for an auxotroph (top row of media: Colonies Auxotrophic to Arginine) compared to colonies that exhibit prototrophy (bottom row of media).
Prototrophic cells (also referred to as the 'wild type') are self-sufficient producers of all required metabolites (e.g. amino acids, lipids, cofactors), while auxotrophs require to be on medium with the metabolite that they cannot produce.[1] For example saying a cell is methionine auxotrophic means that it would need to be on a medium containing methionine or else it would not be able to replicate. In this example this is because it is unable to produce its own methionine (methionine auxotroph). However, a prototroph or a methionine prototrophic cell would be able to function and replicate on a medium with or without methionine.[2]

Replica plating is a technique that transfers colonies from one plate to another in the same spot as the last plate so the different media plates can be compared side by side. It is used to compare the growth of the same colonies on different plates of media to determine which environments the bacterial colony can or cannot grow in (this gives insight to possible auxotrophic characteristics. The method of replica plating implemented by Joshua Lederberg and Esther Lederberg included auxotrophs that were temperature-sensitive; that is, their ability to synthesize was temperature-dependent.[3] (Auxotrophs are usually not temperature-dependent. They can also depend on other factors.) It is also possible that an organism is auxotrophic to more than just one organic compound that it requires for growth.

Here's a visual depiction comparing auxotrophic and prototrophic bacterial colonies. The top row illustrates auxotrophic colonies to arginine, where growth is sparse or absent due to the lack of arginine in the medium. The bottom row showcases prototrophic colonies, which are lush and abundant, indicating their ability to synthesize all required metabolites for growth, even in media without arginine. This image aims to highlight the contrast in growth patterns based on nutrient presence, emphasizing the dependency of auxotrophs on external sources for certain metabolites.

The terms "auxotrophy" and "phototrophy" refer to distinct biological concepts, primarily related to nutritional requirements and energy acquisition methods in organisms, respectively.
Auxotrophy
refers to the inability of an organism to synthesize a particular organic compound required for its growth. An auxotroph is dependent on its environment to supply the essential compound it cannot produce internally. This term is often used in genetics and microbiology to describe mutants or naturally occurring strains of microorganisms (like bacteria and yeast) that cannot synthesize one or more compounds necessary for their growth, such as amino acids, nucleotides, or vitamins. For instance, an organism that is auxotrophic for leucine cannot synthesize leucine and must obtain it from its environment.
Phototrophy
, on the other hand, describes organisms that obtain their energy from light. Phototrophic organisms, such as plants, some bacteria, and algae, use sunlight to drive the synthesis of organic compounds from carbon dioxide in a process known as photosynthesis. Phototrophy is a method of energy acquisition and does not directly relate to the synthesis of specific organic growth factors, unlike auxotrophy. Phototrophs can be further categorized into photoautotrophs, which convert inorganic substances into organic food using light (like plants), and photoheterotrophs, which require organic carbon sources for growth but also use light as an energy source.
In summary, auxotrophy focuses on the nutritional requirement for specific organic compounds that an organism cannot synthesize, while phototrophy relates to the mode of energy acquisition through light.
