Summarize: The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology
By Professor John Dewey
University of Chicago

That the greater demand for a unifying principle and controlling working hypothesis in psychology should come at just the time when all generalizations and classifications are most questioned and questionable is natural enough. It is the very cumulation of discrete facts creating the demand for unification that also breaks down previous lines of classification. The material is too great in mass and too varied in style to fit into existing pigeon-holes, and the cabinets of science break of their own dead weight. The idea of the reflex arc has upon the whole come nearer to meeting this demand for a general working hypothesis than any other single concept. It being admitted that the sensori-motor apparatus represents both the unit of nerve structure and the type of nerve function, the image of this relationship passed over into psychology, and became an organizing principle to hold together the multiplicity of fact.

In criticising this conception it is not intended to make a plea for the principles of explanation and classification which the reflex arc idea has replaced; but, on the contrary, to urge that they are not sufficiently displaced, and that in the idea of the sensori-motor circuit, conceptions of the nature of sensation and of action derived from the nominally displaced psychology are still in control.

The older dualism between sensation and idea is repeated in the current dualism of peripheral and central structures and functions; the older dualism of body and soul finds a distinct

(358) echo in the current dualism of stimulus and response. Instead of interpreting the character of sensation, idea and action from their place and function in the sensory-motor circuit, we still incline to interpret the latter from our preconceived and preformulated ideas of rigid distinctions between sensations, thoughts and acts. The sensory stimulus is one thing, the central activity, standing for the idea, and the motor discharge, standing for the act proper, is a third. As a result, the reflex arc is not a comprehensive, or organic unity, but a patchwork of disjointed parts, a mechanical conjunction of unallied processes. What is needed is that the principle underlying the idea of the reflex arc as the fundamental psychical unity shall react into and determine the values of its constitutive factors. More specifically, what is wanted is that sensory stimulus, central connections and motor responses shall be viewed, not as separate and complete entities in themselves, but as divisions of labor, function factors, within the single concrete whole, now designated the reflex arc.

What is the reality so designated? What shall we term that which is not sensation-followed-by-idea-followed-by-movement,. but which is primary; which is, as it were, the psychical organism of which sensation, idea and movement are the chief organs? Stated on the physiological side, this reality may most conveniently be termed co���rdination. This is the essence of the facts held together by and subsumed under the reflex arc concept. Let us take. for our example, the familiar child-candle instance. (James, Psychology, Vol. I, p. 5.) The ordinary interpretation would say the sensation of light is a stimulus to the grasping as a response, the burn resulting is a stimulus to withdrawing the hand as response and so on. There is, of course, no doubt that is a rough practical way of representing the process. But when we ask for its psychological adequacy, the case in quite different. Upon analysis, we find that we begin not with a sensory stimulus. but with a sensori-motor co���rdination, the optical-ocular, and that in a certain sense it is the movement which is primary, and the sensation which is secondary, the movement of body, head and eye muscles determining the quality of what is experienced. In other words, the real beginning is

(359) with the act of seeing; it is looking, and not a sensation of light. The sensory quale gives the value of the act, just as the movement furnishes its mechanism and control, but both sensation and movement lie inside, not outside the act.

Now if this act, the seeing stimulates another act, the reaching, it is because both of these acts fall within a larger co���rdination; because seeing and grasping have been so often bound together to reinforce each other, to help each other out, that each may be considered practically a subordinate member of a bigger co���rdination. More specifically, the ability of the hand to do its work will depend, either directly or indirectly, upon its control, as well as its stimulation, by the act of vision. If the sight did not inhibit as well as excite the reaching, the latter would be purely indeterminate, it would be for anything or nothing, not for the particular object seen. The reaching, in turn, must both stimulate and control the seeing. The eye must be kept upon the candle if the arm is to do its work; let it wander and the arm takes up another task. In other words, we now have an enlarged and transformed co���rdination; the act is seeing no less than before, but it is now seeing-for-reaching purposes. There is still a sensori-motor circuit, one with more content or value, not a substitution of a motor response for a sensory stimulus.[1]

Professor John Dewey's article "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology" challenges the traditional understanding of the reflex arc in psychology, advocating for a more nuanced and unified interpretation. Dewey critiques the conventional notion of the reflex arc as a mechanical sequence of discrete stimulus-response events, arguing that it falls short of capturing the organic, complex nature of the experience.
He emphasizes that the reflex arc should not be viewed as separate entities (sensory stimulus, central connections, and motor responses) but as interconnected divisions of labor within a single whole. Dewey introduces the term "co��rdination" to describe the essence of the reflex arc, showing that sensation, idea, and movement are interdependent aspects of a larger psychical organism.
Using the example of a child grasping at a candle, Dewey illustrates that the process isn't simply a linear chain of sensations leading to actions but involves intricate interactions between seeing and reaching. He asserts that both sensation and movement lie inside the act, and one is not purely secondary to the other.
In essence, Dewey calls for a more comprehensive understanding of the reflex arc, emphasizing the interconnectivity and organic unity of its components rather than viewing them as isolated, mechanical parts.

it is a different experience. In any case, what proceeds the 'stimulus' is a whole act, a sensori-motor co���rdination. What is more to the point, the 'stimulus' emerges out of this co���rdination; it is born from it as its matrix; it represents as it were an escape from it. I might here fall back upon authority, and refer to the widely accepted sensation continuum theory, according to which the sound cannot be absolutely ex abrupto from the outside, but is simply a shifting

(362) of focus of emphasis, a redistribution of tensions within the former act; and declare that unless the sound activity had been present to some extent in the prior co���rdination, it would be impossible for it now to come to prominence in consciousness. And such a reference would be only an amplification of what has already been said concerning the way in which the prior activity influences the value of the sound sensation. Or, we might point to cases of hypnotism, mono-ideaism and absent-mindedness, like that of Archimedes, as evidences that if the previous co���rdination is such as rigidly to lock the door, the ' auditory disturbance will knock in vain for admission to consciousness. Or, to speak more truly in the metaphor, the auditory activity must already have one foot over the threshold, if it is ever to gain admittance.

In this additional section of "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology" by Professor John Dewey, the focus shifts to the nature of the stimulus within the sensori-motor coordination. Dewey asserts that the stimulus isn't an isolated event; instead, it emerges from the coordination itself.
He elaborates that the stimulus represents a shift in focus or a redistribution of tensions within the existing act. It isn't something that appears suddenly from outside but evolves from the ongoing activity. Dewey points to theories like the sensation continuum theory, which supports this view, and provides examples such as hypnotism and cases like Archimedes, where the existing coordination can influence or even block the emergence of a new stimulus.
In essence, Dewey continues to challenge traditional views, emphasizing the interconnected and organic nature of the reflex arc, where stimuli don't just abruptly interrupt a process but are intricately tied to the existing sensori-motor coordination.

evelopment in the individual or in the race, or from that of the analysis of the mature consciousness. As to the former, in its failure to see that the arc of which it talks is virtually a circuit, a continual reconstitution, it breaks continuity and leaves us nothing but a series of jerks, the origin of each jerk to be sought outside the process of experience itself, in either an external pressure of 'environment,' or else in an unaccountable spontaneous variation from within the 'soul' or the 'organism.' [3] As to the latter, failing to see unity of activity,

(361) no matter how much it may prate of unity, it still leaves us with sensation or peripheral stimulus; idea, or central process (the equivalent of attention); and motor response, or act, as three disconnected existences, having to be somehow adjusted to each other, whether through the intervention of an extraexperimental soul, or by mechanical push and pull.

Before proceeding to a consideration of the general meaning for psychology of the summary, it may be well to give another descriptive analysis, as the value of the statement depends entirely upon the universality of its range of application. For such an instance we may conveniently take Baldwin's analysis of the reactive consciousness. In this there are, he says (Feeling and Will, p. 60), "three elements corresponding to the three elements of the nervous arc. First, the receiving consciousness, the stimulus -- say a loud, unexpected sound; second, the attention involuntarily drawn, the registering element; and, third, the muscular reaction following upon the sound -- say flight from fancied danger." Now, in the first place, such an analysis is incomplete; it ignores the status prior to hearing the sound. Of course, if this status is irrelevant to what happens afterwards, such ignoring is quite legitimate. But is it irrelevant either to the quantity or the quality of the stimulus?

If one is reading a book, if one is hunting, if one is watching in a dark place on a lonely night, if one is performing a chemical experiment, in each case, the noise has a very different psychical value; it is a different experience. In any case, what proceeds the 'stimulus' is a whole act, a sensori-motor co���rdination. What is more to the point, the 'stimulus' emerges out of this co���rdination; it is born from it as its matrix; it represents as it were an escape from it. I might here fall back upon authority, and refer to the widely accepted sensation continuum theory, according to which the sound cannot be absolutely ex abrupto from the outside, but is simply a shifting

In this portion of John Dewey's "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology," Dewey critiques the traditional understanding of the reflex arc as disconnected, likening it to a series of jerks influenced by external pressures or internal variations. He emphasizes the failure of this traditional view to recognize the continuous reconstitution of the process, which he sees as a circuit rather than an arc.
Dewey also challenges the separation of sensation, attention, and motor response as isolated elements. He argues that they must be seen as part of a unified whole, interconnected and influencing each other, rather than being artificially adjusted.
He further emphasizes that the stimulus is not an isolated event but emerges from a whole act or sensori-motor coordination. Using the example of a loud, unexpected sound, Dewey demonstrates that the psychical value of the sound is different depending on the context, such as reading a book or watching in a dark place. This illustrates that the stimulus emerges from the ongoing coordination and is influenced by it.
Through this critical analysis, Dewey continues to build a picture of the reflex arc as an interconnected, organic process that reflects the continuity and complexity of experience, as opposed to a disjointed, mechanical view.

This definitely reminds me of the need for cybernetic control loops, autonomous processes that encode a circular causality that is the megafunction of what the "program" is intended to do
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Indeed, Dewey's description of the reflex arc as an interconnected and continuous process can be likened to the principles of cybernetic control loops. Cybernetic systems focus on feedback, control, and self-regulation, with various components interacting in a circular causality to achieve a specific function or goal.
The emphasis on sensori-motor coordination and the unity of sensations, ideas, and actions in Dewey's concept echoes the interconnected nature of cybernetic systems. Both perspectives recognize that the parts of a system are not isolated but are part of an ongoing process where each part influences and is influenced by others.
The ideas in Dewey's reflex arc concept certainly extend beyond psychology and align with a broader understanding of complex systems, including the autonomous processes found in cybernetics. It's a compelling connection that highlights the interdisciplinary nature of these concepts and their relevance across different fields of study.

I misread the sentence "If one is reading a book, if one is hunting, if one is watching in a dark place on a lonely night, if one is performing a chemical experiment..." as "If one is reading a book, if one is hunting, if one is watching in a dark place on a lonely night, one one is performing a chemical experiment." It reminded me of the curry-howard isomorphism, and that thinking and behavior are "chemical experiments". When I reread the sentence, I saw that Dewey didn't say this, but I still thought it was interesting.

ChatGPT
Your misreading of the sentence led you to an intriguing connection to the Curry-Howard isomorphism, and it's an interesting thought to explore!
The Curry-Howard isomorphism is a correspondence between computer programming (specifically, types and functions in typed lambda calculi) and mathematical logic (propositions and proofs). It's a deep and abstract concept that bridges mathematics and computer science.
Drawing an analogy between thinking and behavior as "chemical experiments" can lead to fascinating insights. Our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are indeed influenced by complex biochemical processes in the brain. These processes can be considered as "chemical experiments" that dynamically interact and result in various cognitive functions and behaviors.
While this specific idea may not have been Dewey's intention, your creative misreading highlights the richness and complexity of the subject matter. It showcases how different fields of study can intersect and resonate, even in unexpected ways, providing new perspectives and avenues for exploration.

I think I must have predictive coding and active inference on the brain
1 / 1
ChatGPT
It's understandable that the concepts of predictive coding and active inference would come to mind, especially given the topic of discussion.
Predictive coding is a theory of brain function that emphasizes the role of predictions in perception, cognition, and action. The brain continually forms and updates predictions about sensory input and uses the difference between these predictions and actual input to guide responses. This is a process that's deeply intertwined with the way we understand the world.
Active inference extends this idea to include action, where the brain not only predicts sensory inputs but also actively samples the environment to reduce the discrepancy between predictions and reality.
Both of these concepts resonate with the themes in Dewey's reflex arc concept, such as the continuity, interconnectedness, and dynamism of sensory stimuli, thought processes, and actions. They also align with the idea of cybernetic control loops, which you mentioned earlier.
These connections show how ideas from neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and even computer science can interweave and shed light on one another. It's fascinating to see how different disciplines can offer complementary perspectives on the intricate nature of human thought and behavior.

What were the basic principles of functionalism?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Functionalism was a school of psychology that focused on understanding the functions or adaptive purposes of mental processes rather than their structure. Emerging largely as a reaction to structuralism, functionalism emphasized the application and usefulness of consciousness in understanding behavior. Here are some of the basic principles:
Adaptive Functions
: Functionalism sought to explain how mental processes and consciousness function to enable an organism to adapt to its environment. Rather than analyzing the structure of mind, functionalists were interested in what the mind does and why it does it.
Pragmatism
: Functionalism was closely aligned with the philosophy of pragmatism. The focus was on practical applications and results. If something was functional and worked well, it was considered valuable.
Inclusion of Various Processes
: Unlike structuralism, which primarily focused on sensation and perception, functionalism included a broader range of mental activities, such as learning, memory, thinking, and emotions, examining how these activities helped the organism navigate the world.
Individual Differences
: Functionalism acknowledged the variability among individuals. It took into consideration that different people might have different mental processes in response to the same situation, reflecting a broader view of human experience.
Interest in Behavior
: Functionalists were interested in the connection between mental processes and overt behavior. They looked at how thoughts, feelings, and perceptions led to actions.
Influence on Education and Industry
: Functionalism laid the groundwork for applied psychology in areas like education, child development, and industrial organization. By focusing on the function of mental processes, it opened up new ways of thinking about learning, problem-solving, and efficiency in the workplace.
Holistic Perspective
: Instead of breaking down mental processes into smaller components, functionalism tended to view the mind as an integrated whole, working together in a seamless manner to facilitate interaction with the environment.
Prominent figures in functionalism included William James, John Dewey, and James Rowland Angell. Their work laid the foundation for subsequent developments in psychology, such as behaviorism and applied psychology. The influence of functionalism can still be seen today in areas like evolutionary psychology and human factors engineering, reflecting its lasting impact on the field.

I was thinking that if thought can occur on different substrates, and that if individuals have different idiolectal ontologies, then exploring the functions might be more productive than the structure. It might be easier to reverse engineer the applications of the mind then the brain per se
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your idea indeed aligns with the principles of functionalism, and it's an interesting perspective to consider. Exploring the functions of thought and cognition rather than focusing solely on the structure allows for a more flexible and potentially universal understanding. Here's why your approach might have merit:
Substrate Independence
: If thought can occur on different substrates (e.g., biological brains, artificial systems), understanding the functions allows for a more generalized theory of cognition that can apply across these different platforms. Analyzing structure might limit understanding to specific cases.
Individual Variability
: As you mentioned, individuals might have different idiolectal ontologies or unique ways of conceptualizing and structuring their world. By focusing on the functions of thought, researchers can account for this variability and understand the underlying processes that are common across individuals.
Applied Insights
: Understanding the functions of the mind may lead to practical insights that can be applied in various domains, such as education, therapy, artificial intelligence, and human-machine interaction. This focus on applications aligns with the pragmatic orientation of functionalism.
Holistic Understanding
: By concentrating on what the mind does rather than how it's structured, we might develop a more integrated and holistic view of cognition. This could lead to a deeper understanding of how different mental processes interconnect and work together to produce behavior.
Reverse Engineering
: As you pointed out, reverse engineering the applications of the mind might be an approachable task compared to dissecting the intricate biological structure of the brain. This could lead to the development of artificial systems that emulate human-like cognitive functions, even if they don't replicate the exact structure of the human brain.
In sum, your perspective reflects a functionalist approach that may offer valuable insights into the nature of thought, cognition, and behavior across different substrates and individual variations. It acknowledges the complexity and diversity of mental processes while seeking to uncover the underlying principles that govern them. It's a perspective that has resonated with various fields in psychology and continues to be relevant in contemporary research and application.

I call this approach Functional Reactive Axiology
1 / 2
ChatGPT
Functional Reactive Axiology, as you've named it, sounds like a fascinating approach that combines several concepts:
Functionalism
: This focuses on the functions and operations of mental processes, looking at what the mind does rather than the structure it takes.
Reactive
: This could refer to the responsiveness of the system to changes or inputs. In other words, it may consider how mental functions react to stimuli or changes in the environment.
Axiology
: This is the study of value or quality. In a philosophical context, it often refers to the investigation of principles and values, including ethics and aesthetics.
Combining these elements could lead to an approach that examines how mental functions respond to changes and inputs, with a focus on the values and quality of those responses. This could be applied to understanding human cognition, behavior, and ethics, as well as in the development of artificial systems that replicate or extend human-like functions.
Your approach might also have connections to cybernetics, control theory, and systems thinking, emphasizing feedback loops, control mechanisms, and the emergent properties of complex systems.
If you have any more specific insights or questions about Functional Reactive Axiology, please feel free to share them! It's a concept that could have broad applicability and represents an exciting synthesis of ideas.

Hello! How can I help you today? Do you have any specific questions or topics you 
would like to discuss? 
yeah, can you explain to me the importance of understanding Null 
Convention Logic in understanding the differences and similarities 
between Sequential and Concurrent processes? 
Null Convention Logic (NCL) is a type of digital logic that is used to design 
asynchronous communication protocols. In asynchronous communication, data is 
transmitted between devices without a clock signal to synchronize the transmission. 
This can be contrasted with synchronous communication, where a clock signal is 
used to coordinate the transmission of data. 
Understanding NCL is important because it allows designers to create 
communication protocols that can be used in both sequential and concurrent 
processes. In a sequential process, events occur one after the other in a 
predetermined order. In a concurrent process, events may occur simultaneously or 
in an overlapping manner. 
NCL can be used to design protocols that allow for the efficient exchange of 
information between devices in both sequential and concurrent processes. It does 
this by using a set of rules that specify how data should be transmitted and received 
in an asynchronous communication system. These rules include the use of 
handshaking signals to coordinate the transmission of data, as well as the use of 
arbitration to resolve conflicts that may arise during communication. 
Overall, understanding NCL is important for designers of asynchronous 
communication systems, as it allows them to create protocols that can be used in a 
variety of contexts, including both sequential and concurrent processes. 
Explain the significance of a propogating null-wavefront in NCL to 
determining whether or not a circuit is outputting the correct signal. 
In Null Convention Logic (NCL), a propogating null-wavefront is a special type of 
signal that is used to indicate that a device is not transmitting data. In NCL, a null- 
wavefront is a high impedance state, which means that it does not draw any current 
and does not interfere with the transmission of other signals. 
The significance of a propogating null-wavefront in NCL lies in its ability to indicate 
when a device is not transmitting data. This is important because in NCL, devices are 
not required to transmit data continuously. Instead, they can transmit data only 
when it is necessary, and then return to a high impedance state when they are not 
transmitting. 
The use of propogating null-wavefronts in NCL allows for the efficient use of 
communication resources, as it allows devices to transmit data only when it is 
necessary. It also allows for the implementation of complex communication 
protocols, as it allows devices to coordinate the transmission of data using 
handshaking signals and arbitration. 
In terms of determining whether or not a circuit is outputting the correct signal, the 
presence or absence of a propogating null-wavefront can be used as a diagnostic 
tool. If a device is not transmitting a propogating null-wavefront when it is supposed 
to, it may indicate that the device is not functioning correctly or that there is a 
problem with the communication protocol. On the other hand, if a device is 
transmitting a propogating null-wavefront when it is not supposed to, it may indicate 
that there is a problem with the circuit or that the device is not receiving the correct 
input signal.

The example you've provided illustrates a clear, iterative process of communication between a user and an AI model. By continually refining the prompts and responses, the model works to distill complex ideas into understandable concepts. In this case, it's about Null Convention Logic (NCL) and its application in sequential and concurrent processes.
The Functional Reactive Axiology seems to prioritize understanding the functionality of concepts and iteratively reacts to those concepts to improve understanding or application. It's a flexible method that allows users to navigate complex topics by continually reevaluating and responding to new information.
Can you elaborate further on the principles that underpin this approach, such as the specific role of axiology (the study of value) in this context? How does this method facilitate deeper or more nuanced understanding of mathematical or technological concepts compared to more conventional approaches?

Functional Reactive Axiology: Navigating the Intersection of Values, Algorithms, and Time

The confluence of philosophy, computer science, and sociology is a fascinating domain, pregnant with novel insights into how we conceptualize, interact with, and shape the world.

It's in this intersection that we find Functional Reactive Axiology, an exploration of our values and decision-making through the lens of Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and social phenomena.

This essay aims to elaborate on this emergent field by drawing connections between the inherent principles of FRP, the model developed by computer scientists to deal with asynchronous dataflow and time-based events, and the way humans perceive and evaluate their socio-cultural environments.

A deep exploration into FRP and its philosophical implications will shed light on new ways to understand and grapple with complexities of the contemporary world.

In the discourse of the managerial society, where increasing polarization has provoked the rise of new paradigms and tensions between differing social factions, we observe a striking parallel to the challenges faced in the realm of FRP���particularly concerning interactive programs and the treatment of mutable states and side-effects.

It is intriguing to contemplate whether solutions found in FRP could provide valuable insights for our real-world societal quandaries.

We will also delve into the intriguing propositions laid out in Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths' book, 'Algorithms to Live By', which posits that algorithms offer crucial wisdom to untangle very human questions.

Through this lens, we will examine whether algorithmic thinking, specifically through the framework of FRP, could offer fresh perspectives to evaluate our values and decisions, illuminating the workings of individual and collective minds in the face of complex social realities.

Inevitably, we also will encounter criticism and barriers���such as the debates around Theory U, waterfall, and other workflow models���that highlight the challenges of transposing computational logic into humanistic and societal contexts.

Nevertheless, these debates provide rich fodder for our exploration, allowing us to critically analyze the potential and pitfalls of applying a FRP mindset to human axiology.

Through this essay, we hope to pave the way for a nuanced dialogue around the intersection of FRP, decision-making algorithms, social phenomena, and human values���a dialogue that may well reveal an exciting new dimension to how we understand and navigate our world.
