VII. MODIFIED GRAVITY
In February of 1982, Mordehai Milgrom submitted a trio papers to the Astrophysical Journal [214, 215, 216]. These papers, which Milgrom developed at the Weizmann Institute in Israel and while on sabbatical at Princeton's Institute of Advanced Study, provided the foundation for what would become the leading alternative to dark matter. This proposal, known as Modified Newtonian Dynamics, or MOND, was a seemingly simple one, but with extremely far reaching consequences. At the heart of MOND is the recognition that if instead of obeying Newton's second law, F=ma, the force due to gravity scaled as F = m a2 / a0 in the limit of very low accelerations (a ��� a0 ��� 1.2 �� 10���10 m/s2), then it would be possible to account for the observed motions of stars and gas within galaxies without postulating the presence of any dark or otherwise hidden matter. In Milgrom's proposal, there was no dark matter. Instead, what astronomers had discovered was evidence of a new framework for gravity and dynamics, beyond that described by Newtonian physics or even by general relativity.

A. Toward a Realistic Theory of MOND

Milgrom's initial proposal was not intended to represent a realistic theory, but rather was presented as the approximate weak-field limit of some unknown, but more complete framework. In its original form, it was not even clear whether MOND was merely a modification of the behavior of gravity, or was instead a more general correction to Newton's second law, applicable to all forces. Within the context of either interpretation, however, it has proven challenging to embed MOND-like behavior within a realistic theoretical framework. First of all, in its original formalism, MOND does not conserve momentum, angular momentum, or energy. Furthermore, Milgrom did not initially propose any means by which MOND could be embedded within a theory consistent with general relativity. Before MOND could be considered a viable alternative to dark matter, a more realistic version of this theory would have to be developed. And while significant progress has been made toward this goal over the past three decades, this progress has often been accomplished at great expense in terms of economy and simplicity.

A first step in this direction was made in 1984 through the collaboration of Milgrom with Jacob Bekenstein, and their proposal of the AQUAdratic Lagrangian theory (AQUAL) [38]. In AQUAL, Bekenstein and Milgrom began with a modification of the Lagrangian of Newtonian gravity, rather than with a modification of Newton's second law. As a result, this approach automatically preserves the conservation of momentum, angular momentum, and energy, and respects the weak equivalence principle. And while the predictions of AQUAL are identical to those of MOND only in special and highly symmetric cases, the differences between the predictions of these two theories are typically modest (at the ���10% level) [217].

Despite its advantages over the original version of MOND, AQUAL was still a modification of Newtonian dynamics, and is not compatible with the general theory of relativity. In order for any variation of MOND to be taken seriously, it would need to be able to account for the many varieties of relativistic phenomena that have been observed, including those of gravitational lensing and cosmological expansion. The first attempts to embed MOND into a relativistic framework involved theories with more than one metric. In relativistic AQUAL (RAQUAL) [38], for example, the dynamics of matter and radiation are dictated by a metric that is distinct from the standard spacetime metric that applies to the gravitational field. The difference between these two metrics is the result of the presence of an additional scalar field which, along with matter, contributes to the gravitational potential. In this respect, RAQUAL shares some of the features of much earlier scalar-tensor theories of gravity [169, 63]. To avoid causal problems resulting from the superluminal motion of the scalar field, however, RAQUAL had to be further modified [37], and these changes were to the detriment of the theory's consistency with precision solar system tests. Even more problematic was the fact that these early attempts at a relativistic theory of MOND failed to adequately describe the phenomena of gravitational lensing.

Although the deflection of light is predicted to occur in RAQUAL and other relativistic formulations of MOND, the magnitude of such lensing is generally expected to be proportional to the amount of (baryonic) mass that is present in the deflecting system. In contrast, the degree of lensing that is observed around galaxy clusters is much larger than can be accounted for by the mass of the baryons alone. In this respect, RAQUAL cannot address the dark matter problem on cluster scales.

Although other efforts to resolve this issue were attempted [40, 274], it was not until 2004 that Bekenstein proposed the first realistic solution to the problem of gravitational lensing in relativistic theories of MOND [39]. Since its proposal, Bekenstein's TeVeS theory ��� short for Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravity ��� has become the leading theory of MOND, and has received a great deal of attention. Beyond those of general relativity, TeVeS contains two additional fields, three free parameters, and one free function. On the one hand, this freedom makes TeVeS somewhat limited in its predictive power. On the other, it provides TeVeS with enough flexibility to potentially be consistent with gravitational lensing observations and other cosmological considerations, such as those pertaining to structure formation and the cosmic microwave background.

B. Observational Successes and Failures

Early in its history, it was appreciated that MOND was capable of explaining the observed dynamics of many spiral and elliptical galaxies. MOND also, however, made predictions for the behavior of low surface brightness galaxies, whose dynamics had not yet been well measured. The fact that such systems were later found to be compatible with MOND [75, 208] served to bolster interest in the theory. Today, MOND appears to be compatible with the observed rotations curves of hundreds of spiral galaxies [36, 273, 218, 219].

In addition to galactic rotation curves, MOND also provides an explanation for the empirical Tully-Fisher formula [311], which relates the intrinsic luminosities and rotational velocities of spiral galaxies, L ��� Vrot��, where �� ��� 4. If one assumes a common mass-to-light ratio for all galaxies, MOND predicts precisely this relationship, with a value of �� = 4, which is consistent with observations [209].

On the scale of galaxy clusters, MOND has not been nearly as successful. While MOND does reduce the need for additional mass in clusters, significant quantities of dark matter are still required. If the three known species of neutrinos were as heavy as m�� ��� 1-2 eV (near the upper limits from beta decay experiments), it has been suggested that they might be able to account for this discrepancy, essentially acting as dark matter in clusters [275, 26, 276]. Massive neutrinos can also help to reduce to some degree the discrepancy between measurements of the cosmic microwave background and the predictions of TeVeS [295].

In recent years, the debate over MOND has been focused on the use of gravitational lensing to measure the mass profiles of galaxy clusters. The idea that lensing could be used to determine the mass of a galaxy or a galaxy cluster was first proposed by Fritz Zwicky in his famous paper of 1937 (see Chapter III A). It was more than 40 years later that the first gravitational lens was observed [324] ��� two mirror images of a quasar ��� and another decade after that before the first observations were made of lensing by a galaxy cluster [204, 299]. Today, gravitational lensing is frequently used to study the properties of clusters (see e.g. Refs. [155, 211] for recent reviews).

In 2006, a group of astronomers including Douglas Clowe transformed the debate between dark matter and MOND with the publication of an article entitled, ���A direct empirical proof of the existence of dark matter���. In this paper, the authors described the observations of a pair of merging clusters collectively known as the ���bullet cluster��� (and also known as 1E0657-558) [81]. As a result of the clusters' recent collision, the distribution of stars and galaxies is spatially separated from the hot X-ray emitting gas (which constitutes the majority of the baryonic mass in this system). A comparison of the weak lensing and X-ray maps of the bullet cluster clearly reveals that the mass in this system does not trace the distribution of baryons (see Fig. 7). Another source of gravitational potential, such as that provided by dark matter, must instead dominate the mass of this system.

Figure 7

The white bar is shown for scale, and represents a distance of 200 kpc at the location of the cluster. The green contours denote the reconstructed lensing signal, proportional to the projected mass in the system. From Ref. [81].

Following these observations of the bullet cluster (and of other similar systems), many researchers expected that this would effectively bring the MOND hypothesis to an end. In the years since, however, anything but has taken place. Since the introduction of TeVeS, MOND has continued to attract a great deal of attention, despite its failure to address the dynamics of galaxy clusters, and in particular the bullet cluster. In addition to massive neutrinos, some authors have considered the possibility that TeVeS's vector field might source the gravitational potential of the bullet cluster, itself acting much like dark matter on cluster scales. Similarly, the failure of TeVeS to predict the observed ratio of the second and third peaks of the cosmic microwave background's angular power spectrum might be plausibly averted if some of TeVeS's additional degrees-of-freedom behaved much like cold dark matter during the early history of the Universe. And although this possibility goes somewhat against the original spirit of MOND, it is hard to rule out at this time. Taken together, the bullet cluster and other increasingly precise cosmological measurements have been difficult to reconcile with all proposed versions of MOND, and it remains unclear whether TeVeS, in some form, might be compatible with these observations [295, 97, 293]. For reviews, See Refs. [294, 116].

VII. MODIFIED GRAVITY
In 1982, Mordehai Milgrom proposed Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), an alternative to dark matter, suggesting a change in the force of gravity at very low accelerations. Although initially simple, integrating MOND with general relativity has been difficult. A significant step was taken with the AQUAdratic Lagrangian theory (AQUAL), which fixed some conservation issues, but still faced problems with relativity and gravitational lensing. In 2004, Bekenstein's Tensor-Vector-Scalar gravity (TeVeS) became the leading MOND theory, although it also faced issues, including with the famous bullet cluster.
A. Toward a Realistic Theory of MOND
Milgrom's original proposal was not intended as a realistic theory, and the development of a consistent MOND framework has been challenging. Progress has been made over the past three decades, but often at the cost of simplicity. AQUAL was a step forward, but further work was needed to create a relativistic MOND, leading to Bekenstein's TeVeS, which had limited predictive power but greater flexibility.
B. Observational Successes and Failures
MOND has explained many observations at galactic scales but has struggled with galaxy clusters and cosmological measurements. The bullet cluster in particular has been challenging for MOND. Despite failures in certain areas, MOND continues to draw attention, and it remains unclear whether TeVeS or other variations might eventually reconcile with all observations.

VIII. PIECING THE PUZZLE
A. Discrepancies At All Scales

When Fritz Zwicky proposed in 1933 that dark matter might be responsible for the high velocity dispersion of galaxies in the Coma Cluster (see Chapter III A), he was familiar with the concept of dark matter, and with earlier attempts to dynamically measure the density of dark matter in the Galaxy. Over the decades that followed, however, the presence of dark matter in clusters and in galaxies were discussed largely independently of each other. It wasn't until the 1960s that mass discrepancies on multiple scales began again to be considered within a common context.

In his pioneering paper of 1963, Arrigo Finzi cited Zwicky's 1933 work on galaxy clusters, the 1957 observation of M31's rotation curve from van de Hulst et al., as well as more recent determinations of the mass of the Milky Way, and argued in favor of a common interpretation for these phenomena [125]. He then went on to consider various possible forms of what we would today call ���baryonic��� dark matter, ruling them out one-by-one. He even went as far as to suggest that these phenomena might be explained by modifying Newton's gravitational force law, so that it scaled as r���3/2 at large distances.

Despite the highly original and prescient nature of Finzi's work, it was largely ignored by the scientific community [277], attracting only 50 citations over the past 50 years. Although it is impossible to unambiguously identify the precise reasons for this, the very bold nature of Finzi's conclusions may have been difficult for many of his colleagues to accept, or even seriously consider. In any case, this work had little impact, and it would be another decade before other scientists began to pursue similar lines of inquiry.

As mentioned in Chapter IV, two independent groups published groundbreaking papers in 1974, each presenting a strong case for the existence of large amounts of mass in the outer parts of galaxies. The first of these papers, by the Estonian astronomers Jaan Einasto, Ants Kaasik and Enn Saar, was submitted on April 10 and was entitled ���Dynamic evidence on massive coronas of galaxies��� [109]. These authors began with a discussion of galactic rotation curves, citing the work of Roberts that would be eventually published in Ref. [258], and presented an analysis of rotation curve data that included estimates for the contributions from stars for five galaxies of different mass. They argued that the discrepancy between the total mass and the stellar mass implied the existence of a ���corona���, consisting of a ���previously unrecognised, massive population���. They then used 105 pairs of galaxies to estimate the total mass and dimensions of their galactic coronas, concluding that the total mass of galaxies exceeded that in stars by an order of magnitude. Finally, the authors argued that these new mass estimates could also explain the mass discrepancy that had been observed in clusters. Similar arguments had also been sketched earlier by the Einasto, including at the 1972 IAU meeting in Athens [107].

On May 28 ��� about six weeks after Einasto et al. ��� Jerry Ostriker, Jim Peebles and Amos Yahil submitted a paper of similar content and scope, entitled ���The size and mass of galaxies, and the mass of the universe��� [229]. This paper did not present any new observations, but instead compiled existing estimates for the masses of (mostly giant spiral) galaxies. They begin with galactic rotation curves, citing the papers of Roberts and Rots [260] and Rogstad and Shostak [262] as evidence for their flatness in the outer parts of galaxies. The authors then went on to build a case for the existence of large amounts of dark matter in the outer parts of galaxies, based on mass estimates from galaxy pairs, the dynamics of dwarf galaxies, and the so-called timing argument for the Local Group. And although the observations presented in this paper were not new, and were subject to large uncertainties, the authors appear to have been confident in their conclusions, stating that the trend of increasing mass with increasing radius is ���almost certainly real���, and arguing that this trend was in line with the ���virial discrepancy��� that had been observed in clusters and groups of galaxies [264, 124, 265]. The first sentences of this paper's body summarizes well the sentiment of the authors:

���There are reasons, increasing in number and quality, to believe that the masses of ordinary galaxies may have been underestimated by a factor of 10 or more. Since the mean density of the Universe is computed by multiplying the observed number density of galaxies by the typical mass per galaxy, the mean density of the Universe would have been underestimated by the same factor.���
In 1979, Sandra Faber and John Gallagher published an influential review, ���Masses and mass-to-light ratios of galaxies��� [115], which played an important role in crystallizing the opinion among cosmologists and astronomers that dark matter was indeed abundant in the Universe. Interestingly, they chose not to use the terms ���corona��� or ���halo���, as suggested by the two above mentioned papers, but instead adopted the phrase ���massive envelope��� to describe the distribution of dark matter in astrophysical systems 13.

B. Cosmology

As astronomers continued to gather information on the masses of galaxies, and on other observables of cosmological relevance, cosmologists began to increasingly reflect upon the implications of those findings for the formation of structure and the evolution of the Universe. In 1974, the same year as the two key papers described above [109, 229], Richard Gott, James Gunn, David Schramm and Beatrice Tinsley published a paper that provides us with an illuminating snapshot of the status of cosmology at that time [141]. The conclusions of this paper, entitled ���An unbound universe���, appear within the original abstract:

���A variety of arguments strongly suggest that the density of the universe is no more than a tenth of the value required for closure. Loopholes in this reasoning may exist, but if so, they are primordial and invisible, or perhaps just black.���
In this paper, the authors argued that the body of astronomical data indicated that there was simply not enough matter in the Universe ��� even accounting for the large mass-to-light ratios observed among galaxies ��� to equal or exceed the critical density of the Universe. Among other caveats to this conclusion, they considered possible contributions from low-mass neutrinos, as had been suggested by Cowsik and McClelland, but ultimately ruled out this possibility as well.

In the early 1980s, the introduction of the theory of inflation profoundly changed the thinking of the cosmological community, and allowed one for the first time to make specific predictions for the total cosmological density and for the spectrum of density perturbations [145, 198, 302, 151, 151, 147, 34]. This began a decade long struggle to reconcile models of structure formation with what had by then become the ���theoretical imperative��� of a flat Universe [84]. This struggle was exacerbated by estimates of the cosmological matter density arising from galaxy clusters which pointed toward a total abundance of matter ��� including dark matter, by then accepted by most cosmologists ��� that was clearly insufficient to close the Universe [334]. The resolution to this problem had to await the discovery of the accelerating expansion rate of the Universe, and the contribution to the total energy density arising from a cosmological constant or ���dark energy���.

Meanwhile, Jim Peebles had pointed out that the absence of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background at a level of ���10���4 was incompatible with a Universe that was composed of only baryonic matter, and argued that this problem would be relieved if the Universe was instead dominated by massive, weakly interacting particles, whose density fluctuations could begin to grow prior to decoupling [239] (see also, Ref. [79]). This and other papers that will be discussed in the next section received enormous attention from the scientific community, and rapidly led to the establishment of cold dark matter as the leading paradigm to describe the structure and evolution of the Universe at all scales.

C. Numerical Simulations

Much of our current understanding of the structure and evolution of dark matter halos in the Universe is based on the results of computer simulations. Such explorations have a longer history than one might expect. Working in the 1940s, the ingenious Swedish scientist Erik HolmbergHolmberg, Erik|( exploited the fact that light follows the same inverse square law as the gravitational force, and performed the first simulation of the interaction between two galaxies on an analog computer that consisted of 74 light-bulbs, photo-cells and galvanometers. He then calculated the amount of light received by each cell, and manually moved the light bulbs in the direction that received the most light.

Holmberg published his paper in November of 1941, shortly before the United States entered World War II. In the following years, the work of many research institutes ground to a halt, but science meanwhile continued to make progress, thanks in large part to the enormous resources made available to military research, especially at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, at which computers and advanced numerical techniques were developed within the context of the Manhattan Project. The first application of such computers to gravitational systems was arguably performed by John Pasta and Stanislaw Ulam in 1953. Their numerical experiments were performed on the Los Alamos computer, which by then had been applied to a variety of other problems, including early attempts to decode DNA sequences and the first chess-playing program. A number of other pioneering studies exploring the evolution of a system of gravitationally interacting massive particles appeared throughout the 1960s and 1970s, gradually increasing the number of simulated particles from N ��� 100 in the early works to N ��� 1000 [320, 321, 319, 237, 331].

By the early 1970s, it had become possible to numerically simulate the dynamics of galaxies. Simulations carried out by Richard Miller, Kevin Prendergast and William Quirk [220] as well as by Frank Hohl [156] each found rotationally suppored galaxies consisting of a stellar disk to be unstable, in contradition with observations. Instead of reaching an equilibrium configuration, such systems were found to change rapidly, forming bars and evolving toward a more elliptical and pressure supported configuration. The solution to this problem was proposed in 1973 by Jerry Ostriker and Jim Peebles, who recognized that a rotationally supported stellar disk could be stable if embedded within a massive spherical halo [228].

The first attempt to numerically solve the formation and evolution of cosmological structures in an expanding universe was presented in a famous paper published in 1974 by William Press and Paul Schechter [250]. This was followed by a number of developments in the late 1970s and early 1980s that significantly advanced the power of such endeavors (see, for example, Refs. [4, 312, 142, 183, 77, 106, 184]). First, a combination of improvements in processor speed and in numerical techniques made it possible for the first time to simultaneously simulate millions of particles. Second, the newly proposed theory of inflation [146, 199] offered a physical means by which initial density perturbations could be generated, providing the initial conditions for cosmological simulations. And third, the results of the first large 3D survey of galaxies (the CfA redshift survey) were published in 1982, providing a distribution that could be directly compared with the output of simulations.

In some ways, the results of cosmological simulations do not depend much on what the dark matter consists of. In particular, they are largely insensitive to the electroweak or other non-gravitational interactions that may (or may not) be experienced by dark matter particles ��� for the purposes of structure formation, such particles are effectively ���collisionless���. What does impact the results of such simulations, however, is the initial velocity distribution of the dark matter particles [99, 58, 59]. Importantly, this provides cosmologists with a way to discriminate between different classes of dark matter candidates. Standard model neutrinos, for example, decoupled from thermal equilibrium in the early Universe at a temperature that is much greater than their mass, and thus remained highly relativistic throughout the epoch of structure formation. In contrast, supersymmetric neutralinos are predicted to freeze-out of thermal equilibrium at a temperature below their mass, and are thus non-relativistic throughout cosmic history. Axions generated through misalignment production are also predicted to be produced with non-relativistic velocities.

At the largest scales ��� those associated with galaxy clusters and superclusters ��� cosmological simulations predict a pattern of structure that is largely insensitive to the initial velocities of the dark matter. At smaller scales, however, density fluctuations can be washed out by the random thermal motion of individual dark matter particles. As a result, the growth of small scale structure is predicted to be suppressed if the dark matter is relativistic, or ���hot��� [281, 240].

Non-relativistic, or ���cold��� dark matter particles undergo a very different sequence of structure formation. The much shorter free-streaming length of such particles allow them to form very low mass halos; roughly in the range of ���10���3 to ���10���9 M��� for a typical neutralino, for example. These very small halos form very early in the Universe's history, and then go on to merge with one another, gradually building up larger and larger dark matter structures. This bottom-up, or hierarchical, process of structure formation is in stark contrast to the top-down sequence predicted for hot dark matter.

Simulations of large scale structure are, of course, only useful if their results can be compared to the actual patterns of structure found in the Universe. This was made possible with the CfA survey, which was the first extensive 3D survey of galaxies in the local Universe [85]. Among other features, CfA revealed the first indications of the ���cosmic web���, which described the distribution of matter on the largest scales. This survey also identified the presence of significant structure on sub-cluster scales, in conflict with the predictions of hot dark matter simulations [333].

In the wake of the failures of hot dark matter, it was quickly becoming appreciated that cold dark matter could do a much better job of accounting for the observed patterns of large scale structure. To quote the 1984 paper by George Blumenthal, Sandra Faber, Joel Primack, and Martin Rees [54]:

���We have shown that a universe with ��� 10 times as much cold dark matter as baryonic matter provides a remarkably good fit to the observed universe. This model predicts roughly the observed mass range of galaxies, the dissipational nature of galaxy collapse, and the observed Faber-Jackson and Tully-Fisher relations. It also gives dissipationless galactic halos and clusters. In addition, it may also provide natural explanations for galaxy-environment correlations and for the differences in angular momenta between ellipticals and spiral galaxies.���
The first simulations of cold dark matter were carried out by Marc Davis, George Efstathiou, Carlos Frenk, and Simon White, who published their results in 1985 [84]. The resemblance of their simulated distribution of dark matter halos to that of the galaxies in the CfA survey was clear, serving to further elevate the status of cold dark matter within the cosmological community.

By middle of the 1980s, the paradigm of cold dark matter was well on its way to becoming firmly established. And although scenarios involving mixed dark matter (containing significant quantities of both cold and hot dark matter) and warm dark matter (suppressing structure only on the scale of dwarf galaxies and below) would each continue to be discussed in the literature, the possibility that the dark matter was dominated by neutrinos or other relativistic particles was quickly abandoned.

A decade later, the predictions of cosmological simulations had shifted in focus from the distribution of cold dark matter halos to the shapes of those halos. In 1996, Julio Navarro, Carlos Frenk and Simon White published a remarkable result, based on an analysis of the halos generated in their high-resolution cold dark matter simulations [222]:

The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fit over two decades in radius by scaling a simple universal profile. The characteristic overdensity of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way which reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation.
The simple fitting formula derived by the authors became known as the Navarro-Frenk-White profile. This parametrization is still widely used today, and represents the primary benchmark for most dark matter detection studies, despite the fact that it is expected to be inaccurate in the innermost regions of galaxies, where baryons dominate the gravitational potential.

In more recent years, the frontier for cosmological simulations has focused on the implementation of baryonic physics, including the hydroynamical evolution of gas in astrophysical structures, stellar formation, and feedback from supernova explosions and black holes. Current simulations are not yet able to resolve all relevant scales ��� which range between sub-parsec distances for stellar formation to Gpc scales for cosmological structures ��� but implement baryonic physics through the introduction of suitable ���sub-grid��� parameters which attempt to encode the collective behaviour of large amounts of gas and stars. Such parameters are generally tuned to match observable quantities, such as the galaxy mass function and the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, as in e.g. the recent suite of Eagle simulations [279].


13 In the discussions that took place as part of our research for this historical review, we encountered a considerable range of opinions regarding the relative importance of galactic rotation curves in establishing the existence of dark matter. This supports a picture in which different groups of scientists found quite different lines of evidence to be compelling during this period of time. Despite these disagreements regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the various observations and arguments, a consensus nonetheless began to emerge in favor of dark matter's existence.

For some time, there has been an active experimental program searching for dark matter axions, most notably in the form of the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX). The idea behind this effort is to make use of the photon-photon-axion coupling, generically present in axion models, to convert dark matter axions in a strong and static magnetic field into a signal of nearly monochromatic microwave photons. This possibility was first suggested by Pierre Sikivie in 1983 [288], and was later expanded upon by Sikivie [289], along with Lawrence Krauss, John Moody, Frank Wilczek and Donald Morris [188]. As the signal in such an experiment is maximized for a specific cavity frequency (corresponding to a specific axion mass), it is necessary that the resonant frequency of the cavity be tunable, making it possible to scan over a range of axion masses.

The first laboratory constraints on dark matter axions were presented in the late 1980s, by a number of groups [88, 342, 149]. While the frequency range covered by these experiments was well suited to axion masses favored by dark matter abundance considerations (covering approximately ma ��� 4.5���16.3 ��eV), their sensitivity was orders of magnitude below that required to test realistic axion models. In 2003, however, the ADMX Collaboration reported results that constrained realistic axion dark matter models, although only for a relatively narrow range of masses, 1.9���3.3 ��eV [29]. With anticipated upgrades [28, 28], ADMX is expected to be sensitive to a much larger range of axion masses and couplings, significantly constraining the axion dark matter parameter space in the coming years.

The Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) represents a significant effort in the ongoing search for dark matter, particularly focusing on axions, which are hypothetical elementary particles. These particles are very light, electrically neutral, and could account for dark matter if they exist in large enough quantities.
ADMX aims to detect axions by exploiting their interactions with photons in a magnetic field, a phenomenon that was first suggested by Pierre Sikivie and others. Early experiments in the 1980s were pioneering but limited in their sensitivity. The results from ADMX in 2003 were a significant step forward, constraining the possible properties of axions in a realistic model for the first time.
Upgrades to the ADMX experiment are anticipated to greatly increase sensitivity to different axion masses and couplings. This means that the coming years could be very exciting for axion research, either by providing evidence for axions or by ruling out certain models, which will have broad implications for our understanding of dark matter.

The theoretical basis for axions
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The theoretical basis for axions originates from a problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is the theory that describes the strong nuclear force. This problem is known as the strong CP (Charge-Parity) problem.
In the Standard Model of particle physics, there's no reason for the strong force to respect CP symmetry, yet experiments have not found any CP violation in the strong force. This leads to the question of why the strong force appears to conserve CP symmetry when there's no requirement for it to do so.
The Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism was proposed to resolve this issue. This mechanism introduces a new global symmetry that gets spontaneously broken at an energy scale known as the PQ scale. When this symmetry is broken, a new particle called the axion is predicted to emerge as a result.
Axions are very light, electrically neutral, and weakly interacting, making them an excellent candidate for dark matter. Their properties, such as mass and coupling constants, depend on the energy scale at which the PQ symmetry is broken.
The beauty of the axion solution to the strong CP problem is that it not only resolves a deep theoretical issue in the strong force but also provides a compelling candidate for dark matter, a major unsolved problem in cosmology.
Experiments like ADMX aim to detect these elusive particles, and discovering them would confirm this elegant solution to the strong CP problem and simultaneously shed light on the nature of dark matter.

And so there might be an axion cloud around most galaxies?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, it is hypothesized that if axions make up dark matter, there could indeed be a sort of "cloud" or halo of axions surrounding galaxies. This cloud would not be like an ordinary matter cloud but would instead consist of a large number of axions permeating the space around a galaxy.
Because axions are predicted to be incredibly light and weakly interacting, they wouldn't clump together like ordinary matter but would form a diffuse halo. This halo could influence the gravitational dynamics of the galaxy, much like the unseen dark matter that we know must exist through its gravitational effects on visible matter.
Detecting this axion cloud directly is a significant challenge because of the weakly interacting nature of axions. Experiments like ADMX are designed to search for them, and finding evidence of axions would be a groundbreaking discovery in both particle physics and cosmology.

Axion cloud evaporation during inspiral of black hole binaries -- the effects of backreaction and radiation
Takuya Takahashi, Hidetoshi Omiya, Takahiro Tanaka
Download PDF
Ultralight scalar fields such as axions can form clouds around rotating black holes (BHs) by the superradiant instability. It is important to consider the evolution of clouds associated with BH binaries for the detectability of the presence of clouds through gravitational wave signals and observations of the mass and spin parameters of BHs. We re-examine the impact on the axion cloud due to the tidal perturbation from the companion in a binary system taking into account the following points. First, we study the influence of higher-multipole moments. Second, we consider the backreaction due to the angular momentum transfer between the cloud and the orbital motion. This angular momentum transfer further causes the backreaction to the hyperfine split through the change in geometry. Finally, we calculate the particle number flux to the infinity induced by the tidal interaction. As a result, we found that the scalar field is not reabsorbed by the BH. Instead, the scalar particles are radiated away to evaporate during the inspiral, irrespectively of the direction of the orbital motion, for almost equal mass binaries

This abstract discusses the interaction between axion clouds and binary black hole systems. Let me break down the main points:
Axion Clouds and Black Holes
: Ultralight scalar fields, like axions, can form clouds around rotating black holes (BHs). This happens due to a phenomenon known as the superradiant instability. Essentially, certain conditions allow these fields to extract energy and angular momentum from a spinning black hole, leading to the growth of the field around the black hole.
Importance for Gravitational Wave Signals
: The presence of axion clouds around black holes in a binary system (i.e., two black holes orbiting one another) could affect the gravitational waves they emit. Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by the movement of massive objects, and detecting variations in these signals could be a hint towards the existence of axion clouds.
Tidal Perturbations
: When two black holes are in a binary system, they exert tidal forces on each other. This study re-examines how these tidal forces from one black hole affect the axion cloud of its partner.
Backreaction and Angular Momentum Transfer
: The study also examines how the axion cloud affects the motion of the black holes themselves. The interaction between the cloud and the black holes can transfer angular momentum. This not only affects the motion of the black holes but also the axion cloud's structure due to changes in the geometry around the black holes.
Particle Number Flux
: The tidal forces can induce a flow of particles (in this case, axions) from the cloud. The study investigates this phenomenon, quantifying how many axions are effectively "shed" from the cloud due to these tidal interactions.
Main Finding
: Despite the interactions and forces at play, the axion cloud isn't consumed or reabsorbed by the black hole. Instead, axions are radiated away from the cloud, leading to its evaporation during the black holes' inspiral phase, especially in binary systems where the black holes have nearly equal masses.
This research is important as it provides insights into the potential observable consequences of axion clouds in binary black hole systems, which could serve as indirect evidence for the existence of axions.

Birefringence Tomography for Axion Cloud

Download PDF
An axion cloud surrounding a supermassive black hole can be naturally produced through the superradiance process. Its existence can be examined by the axion induced birefringence effect. It predicts an oscillation of the electric vector position angle of linearly polarized radiations. Stringent constraints of the existence of the axion in a particular mass window has been obtained based on the recent Event Horizon Telescope measurement on M87���. The future Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations will be able to measure the vicinity of many supermassive black holes, thus it opens the possibility to search for the existence of axions in a wide mass regime. In this paper, we study how different black hole properties and accretion flows influence the signatures of the axion induced birefringence. We include the impacts of black hole inclination angles, spins, magnetic fields, plasma velocity distributions, the thickness of the accretion flows. We pay special attention to characterize the washout effects induced by the finite thickness of the accretion flows and the lensed photons. Based on this study, we give prospects on how to optimize the axion search using future VLBI observations, such as the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope, to further increase the sensitivity.

Abstract

The presence of sufficiently light particles in the fundamental Lagrangian could trigger instability in rotating black holes, the so-called superradiance instability. In particular, axion and axion-like-particles (ALPs) are good candidates to prompt such an instability. As a result, a high-density axion cloud forms around the black hole. The system of black holes and the axion cloud surrounding it is called a gravitational atom. Examining the evolution of this gravitational atom could lead to the discovery of an axion or introduce new constraints on their parametric space. The axion cloud becomes unstable under certain conditions when axion-photon interactions and axion self-interactions are considered. The nature of these instabilities is the parametric resonance. In this paper, we obtain an upper bound for the rate of this instability. The results show that for the simplest axion models, this instability occurs at a very low rate because, before the resonance becomes effective, self-interactions cause the axion cloud to collapse. But for some exotic models, the resonance rate could be large enough to introduce observable effects. In addition, we will show that the parametric resonance caused by self-interactions never happens at a significant level.

Superradiance Instability
: The authors examine a particular instability in rotating black holes called superradiance instability, which can be triggered by sufficiently light particles in the fundamental Lagrangian. Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) are highlighted as potential candidates that could prompt this instability.
Formation of Axion Cloud
: As a result of this instability, a high-density axion cloud can form around the black hole. The combination of the black hole and surrounding axion cloud is referred to as a gravitational atom.
Study Objective
: By studying the evolution of this gravitational atom, it may be possible to discover axions or place new constraints on their properties.
Nature of Instabilities
: The axion cloud can become unstable under specific conditions, considering axion-photon interactions and axion self-interactions. This instability is described as parametric resonance.
Results
: The paper finds an upper bound for the rate of this instability, showing that for simple axion models, the instability occurs at a very low rate. Before resonance becomes significant, self-interactions cause the axion cloud to collapse. However, some exotic models may have a large enough resonance rate to produce observable effects.
Additional Findings
: The paper also demonstrates that the parametric resonance caused by self-interactions never occurs at a significant level.
The research appears to contribute to our understanding of how axions might behave in the vicinity of black holes and how their interactions can lead to specific kinds of instabilities. This has potential implications for the study of axions as dark matter candidates and can offer new ways to detect or constrain these elusive particles.

The axion objects such as axion miniclusters and axion clouds around spinning black holes induce 
parametric resonances of electromagnetic waves through the axion-photon interaction. In particular, it has 
been known that the resonances from the axion with the mass around 10���6eV may explain the observed 
fast radio bursts (FRBs). Herewe argue that similar bursts of high frequency gravitational waves, which we 
call fast gravitational wave bursts (FGBs), are generated from axion clumps with the presence of 
gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) coupling. The typical frequency is half of the axion mass, which in 
general can range from kHz to GHz. We also discuss the secondary gravitational wave production 
associated with FRB, as well as the possible host objects of the axion clouds, such as primordial black holes 
with typical masses around 10���5M���. Future detections of FGBs together with the observed FRBs are 
expected to provide more evidence for the axion.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The first observation of the gravitational waves has 
started a new era for astrophysics, cosmology and even 
particle physics. Searching for gravitational wave signals in 
the universe at different frequencies from different sources 
has started, from the primordial gravitational waves at 
10���16Hz to the pulsars and binary system signals up to 
104Hz. What is more, the higher frequency up to MHz or 
GHz gravitational wave searches have also been proposed 
[1,2], and those signals can be generated by the axion 
annihilation around the black holes [3���6]. The axion is a 
well-motivated dark matter candidate [7���9], though the 
distribution of such dark matter around the universe 
remains an unknown and interesting topic. Considering 
that in early universe evolution the density variations of 
both matter and dark matter occurred and acted as the seeds 
for cosmic structures today, there are great reasons to 
believe that axion distributes in cosmic space unevenly. 
Theaxionwasproposedasthepseudo-Nambu-Goldstone 
boson from the spontaneous breaking of a U(1) global 
symmetry, the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry, to solve the 
strongCPprobleminQCD[10,11].Itwaslaterrealizedthat 
there can be more axionlike pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone 
bosons related to various global symmetry in UV theories 
[12,13]. If this spontaneous breaking of global symmetry 
happened before or during inflation, then the axion field 
value can be considered homogenous across the observed 
Universe, except for small isocurvature and density pertur- 
bations. In this case, the axion density variation is not 
genericallylarge.Ifthesymmetrywasbrokenafterinflation, 
then the axion field can only be correlated across the local 
horizon size. Later when the temperature dropped to the 
order ofthe axion mass T ��� ma, the axion began to oscillate 
at the bottom of the potential, which is acquired by non- 
perturbative effects such as instanton. At the same time 
axion topological defects decay. The oscillation is not 
coherent across the horizon. Notice that during the universe 
evolution history, the axion mass also depends on the 
temperatureoftheuniverse.Thesedifferenthorizonpatches

The paper titled "Fast gravitational wave bursts from axion clumps" by Sichun Sun and Yun-Long Zhang explores the potential phenomenon of fast gravitational wave bursts (FGBs) induced by axion objects, such as axion miniclusters and axion clouds around spinning black holes. These bursts are generated through axion-photon interactions and the presence of gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) coupling.
The authors highlight that axion objects might be responsible for the observed fast radio bursts (FRBs), and they argue that similar bursts of high-frequency gravitational waves could be explained by axion clumps. The typical frequency of these bursts is linked to the axion mass, ranging from kHz to GHz.
In the study, the axion is explored as a dark matter candidate with unknown distribution across the universe. It's described as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of U(1) global symmetry to address the strong CP problem in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The paper considers the density variations of axion objects in the early universe and their potential to collapse into denser structures, including black holes.
One critical insight includes the possibility that these axion dense objects can undergo Bose-Einstein condensation, leading to the formation of even denser structures, possibly explaining observed FRBs.
The paper���s results offer intriguing possibilities for future detections of FGBs, aligned with observed FRBs, to provide further evidence for the existence of axions. The work contributes to a growing field of research linking particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology and highlights the potential multimessenger signals of axion-like dark matter.

Write a matplotlib jupyter Python animation that can be used to simulate galaxy void distribution using an Ising synchronization.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Sure! The Ising model is a mathematical model in statistical mechanics that describes ferromagnetism. It's a lattice-based model where each site has a binary state. Though traditionally used to model magnetic systems, it can be adapted to represent other systems, like galaxy void distribution, by drawing parallels between the properties of the system.
In the following code, I've set up a 2D lattice where each site can represent either a galaxy (state +1) or a void (state -1), using the Ising model. You can run this code in a Jupyter Notebook to visualize the evolution of the galaxy-void distribution over time.

This code will produce an animation where the lattice evolves over time according to the Ising model. The temperature
T
controls the level of randomness in the transitions between states, and you can experiment with different values to see how it affects the behavior of the system.
Note: This simulation doesn't represent a physically accurate model of galaxy void distribution but rather uses the Ising model's mechanics as a creative way to visualize such a distribution. For more accurate cosmological simulations, specialized algorithms and data would be required.

Write some similar animations to compare ��CDM predictions axion cloud formation.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The Lambda Cold Dark Matter (��CDM) model is the standard model of Big Bang cosmology, describing the existence of cold dark matter (CDM) and a cosmological constant denoted by ��. Simulating the predictions of this model for galaxy formation or axion cloud formation would usually require solving complex cosmological equations and would typically be performed using specialized cosmology simulation software.
However, we can still create a simple, abstract visualization of the ��CDM model vs. a hypothetical axion cloud model by using a 2D grid, similar to the Ising model previously described. This would be an oversimplification and not a realistic portrayal of either the ��CDM or axion cloud models, but it might serve as a visually interesting comparison.
Below, I'm providing two animations, one representing a simplified ��CDM-like galaxy formation, and the other representing a hypothetical axion cloud formation. The differences between these two animations are purely illustrative and do not correspond to any physical principles.
1. Simulating ��CDM-like Galaxy Formation
python
Copy code
import
numpy
as
np
import
matplotlib.pyplot
as
plt
import
matplotlib.animation
as
animation

L =
50
# Grid size
# Initialize grid

# Update function for ��CDM-like formation
def
update_lcdm
(
grid
):
    x, y = np.random.randint(
0
, L,
2
)
if
grid[x, y] ==
0
:
        grid[x, y] =
1
# Animation function
def
animate_lcdm
(
frame
):
    update_lcdm(grid_lcdm)
    im.set_array(grid_lcdm)
return
[im]
# Plot initial grid
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(
8
,
8
))
im = ax.imshow(grid_lcdm, animated=
True
, cmap=
'Blues'
)

ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate_lcdm, frames=
200
, interval=
50
, blit=
True
)

plt.axis(
'off'
)
plt.show()
2. Simulating Hypothetical Axion Cloud Formation
python
Copy code
# Initialize grid
grid_axion = np.zeros((L, L))
# Update function for axion cloud formation
def
update_axion
(
grid
):
    x, y = np.random.randint(
0
, L,
2
)
    r = np.random.randint(
1
,
5
)
for
i
in
range
(-r, r+
1
):
for
j
in
range
(-r, r+
1
):
if
(i**
2
+ j**
2
<= r**
2
)
and
(
0
<= x+i < L)
and
(
0
<= y+j < L):
                grid[(x+i)%L, (y+j)%L] =
1
# Animation function
def
animate_axion
(
frame
):
    update_axion(grid_axion)
    im.set_array(grid_axion)
return
[im]
# Plot initial grid
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(
8
,
8
))
im = ax.imshow(grid_axion, animated=
True
, cmap=
'Reds'
)

ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate_axion, frames=
200
, interval=
50
, blit=
True
)

plt.axis(
'off'
)
plt.show()
The first animation represents a gradual galaxy formation process, with individual galaxies appearing one at a time. The second simulates axion clouds by forming clusters of points simultaneously.
Again, these animations are purely illustrative and do not provide a realistic or accurate portrayal of the physical processes in the ��CDM or axion cloud models. For proper simulations, one would need to refer to specialized cosmology simulation software and models.
