It looks like you've posted a snippet of code written in a programming language, possibly BASIC. How can I assist you with this code?

Bernard Veerman wrote: Thanks for having me. I worked with different Basic's. One of the first was on a Data General Nova mini computer. When the PC's came I used GW-Basic and later Quick Basic 1.1, 3.x and 4.5  The advantage of QB for me was that it has an interpreter, a debugger, a linker and a compiler. Furthermore it allowes structured programming. For developers I wrote a cross reference utility called BASREF. For a lot of standard routines I wrote a library.

It's fascinating to hear about your experience with various BASIC languages, including your work with GW-BASIC and QuickBASIC on PC. Creating a cross-reference utility like BASREF and developing a library for standard routines demonstrates your dedication to structured programming. The nod to IBM's VSAM with VZAM adds an interesting touch. If you have any specific questions or if there's anything specific you'd like to discuss or know more about, feel free to let me know!

Certainly, reviewing each line of code would be quite extensive, but I can provide a brief overview of the code structure and its main functionalities:
The code appears to be written in QuickBASIC, focusing on a utility called BASREF.
It defines procedures like
SUB ParseLine
and
SUB PrintHeader
.
ParseLine
seems to handle parsing of input lines, determining tokens, and managing delimiters.
PrintHeader
handles printing a report header for the cross-reference utility.

Write a program in gw-basic to draw a cube out of asterisks.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a simple program in GW-BASIC to draw a cube using asterisks:
basic
Copy code
10 PRINT "       *********"
20 PRINT "      *         *"
30 PRINT "     *         *"
40 PRINT "    *         *"
50 PRINT "   *         *"
60 PRINT "  *         *"
70 PRINT " *         *"
80 PRINT "*********"
90 END
Copy and paste this code into your GW-BASIC interpreter, and when you run it, you should see a cube made out of asterisks on the screen. Feel free to modify the program or ask if you have any questions about how it works!
You
Hmmm I was thinking we could make line by a function that calls * eight times, and then run that eight times to make a kind of square.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a modified version that defines a function to draw a line of asterisks, and then it calls that function eight times to create a cube:
basic
Copy code
10 DEF FNLine()
20   LINE$ = "*********"
30   PRINT LINE$
40 END DEF

50 FOR i = 1 TO 8
60   PRINT FNLine()
70 NEXT i

80 END
In this version, the
FNLine
function returns a string of asterisks representing a line. The
FOR
loop then calls this function eight times to create the cube. Feel free to run and modify the code as needed!
You

Absolutely! If you only need to call it eight times to create a cube, you can simplify the program:
basic
Copy code
10 DEF FNLine()
20   LINE$ = "*********"
30   PRINT LINE$
40 END DEF

50 FOR i = 1 TO 8
60   PRINT FNLine()

Can you give more complicated examples maybe for calculating the optimal size of fences?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's consider a scenario where you need to calculate the optimal size of fences for enclosing a rectangular area. The idea is to maximize the area enclosed while using a fixed amount of fencing material.
Here's a simple Python program that takes the available fencing material length and calculates the dimensions of the rectangular fence that would maximize the enclosed area:
python
Copy code
def
calculate_optimal_fence_length
(
area
):
# Calculate the side length of a square with the same area
side_length = (area **
0.5
)
# Calculate the dimensions of the rectangular fence
length =
2
* side_length
    width = area / side_length
return
length, width
# Assume you have 100 units of fencing material
available_fence_length =
100
# Calculate the optimal fence dimensions for maximizing the area
optimal_length, optimal_width = calculate_optimal_fence_length(available_fence_length)
# Display the results
print
(
f"Optimal Fence Length:
{optimal_length}
units"
)
print
(
f"Optimal Fence Width:
{optimal_width}
units"
)
In this example, the
calculate_optimal_fence_length
function takes the desired area as input and calculates the optimal length and width of the rectangular fence. The main part of the program then assumes you have 100 units of fencing material and calculates the optimal fence dimensions for maximizing the area.
Feel free to adjust the available fence length or explore more complex scenarios based on your specific requirements!
You
Can you show it in gforth?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Below is a simple program in Gforth that calculates the optimal dimensions of a rectangular fence given the available length of fencing material. Gforth is a stack-based programming language, so the solution involves manipulating the stack to perform the necessary calculations.
Forth
Copy code
\ Calculate optimal fence dimensions
: calculate-optimal-fence ( area -- length width )
    \ Calculate the side length of a square with the same area
    dup sqrt

    \ Calculate the dimensions of the rectangular fence
    2* swap / ;

\ Example: Assume you have 100 units of fencing material
100 calculate-optimal-fence .

\ Output: Optimal Fence Length: 20 units
\         Optimal Fence Width: 5 units
In this Gforth program, the
calculate-optimal-fence
word takes the desired area as input, duplicates it, calculates the square root (side length of a square), multiplies by 2 (length of the rectangle), and then divides by the original area to get the width of the rectangle.
Feel free to experiment with the code in a Gforth environment, and adjust the available fencing material or explore different scenarios as needed!

Remind me again of the surface area of the earth
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The surface area of the Earth is approximately 510.1 million square kilometers, or about 196.9 million square miles.
You
So how much is that per person with 8 billion?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
To find the surface area per person for a population of 8 billion, you would divide the total surface area of the Earth by the number of people:
Total Surface Area of Earth
Number of People
\frac{{\text{{Total Surface Area of Earth}}}}{{\text{{Number of People}}}}

Abstract 
This paper presents neural probabilistic 
parsing models which explore up to third- 
order graph-based parsing with maximum 
likelihood training criteria.Two neural 
network extensions are exploited for per- 
formance improvement. Firstly, a convo- 
lutional layer that absorbs the inf l uences 
of all words in a sentence is used so that 
sentence-level information can be effec- 
tively captured. Secondly, a linear layer 
is added to integrate different order neu- 
ral models and trained with perceptron 
method. The proposed parsers are evalu- 
ated on English and Chinese Penn Tree- 
banks and obtain competitive accuracies.

complex features with distributed representation 
and non-linear neural network (Wang et al., 2013; 
Wang et al., 2014; Cai and Zhao, 2016; Wang et 
al., 2016). In transition-based dependency pars- 
ing, neural models that can represent the partial or 
whole parsing histories have been explored (Weiss 
et al., 2015; Dyer et al., 2015). While for graph- 
based parsing, on which we focus in this work, Pei 
et al. (2015) also show the effectiveness of neural 
methods.

The graph-based parser generally consists of 
two components: one is the parsing algorithm for 
inference or searching the most likely parse tree, 
the other is the parameter estimation approach for 
the machine learning models. For the former, clas- 
sical dynamic programming algorithms are usu- 
ally adopted, while for the latter, there are vari- 
ous solutions. Like some previous neural methods 
(Socher et al., 2010; Socher et al., 2013), to tackle 
the structure prediction problems, Pei et al. (2015) 
utilizeamax-margintrainingcriterion, whichdoes 
not include probabilistic explanations. Re-visiting 
the traditional probabilistic criteria in log-linear 
models, this work utilizes maximum likelihood 
for neural network training.Durrett and Klein 
(2015) adopt this method for constituency pars- 
ing, which scores the anchored rules with neu- 
ral models and formalizes the probabilities with 
tree-structured random i elds. Motivated by this 
work, we utilize the probabilistic treatment for de- 
pendency parsing: scoring the edges or high-order 
sub-trees with a neural model and calculating the 
gradients according to probabilistic criteria. Al- 
though scores are computed by a neural network, 
the existing dynamic programming algorithms for 
gradient calculation remain the same as those in 
log-linear models. 
Graph-based methods search globally through 
the whole space for trees and get the highest- 
scored one, however, the scores for the sub-trees 
are usually locally decided, considering only sur- 
rounding words within a limited-sized window. 
Convolutional neural network (CNN) provides a 
natural way to model a whole sentence. By in- 
troducing a distance-aware convolutional layer, 
sentence-level representation can be exploited for 
parsing.We will especially verify the effec- 
tiveness of such representation incorporated with 
window-based representation.

The paper titled "Probabilistic Graph-based Dependency Parsing with Convolutional Neural Network" introduces neural probabilistic parsing models that explore up to third-order graph-based parsing with maximum likelihood training criteria. The authors, Zhisong Zhang, Hai Zhao, and Lianhui Qin, present two neural network extensions for performance improvement. The first is a convolutional layer that captures influences from all words in a sentence to effectively capture sentence-level information. The second is a linear layer integrated with different order neural models and trained using the perceptron method. The proposed parsers are evaluated on English and Chinese Penn Treebanks and achieve competitive accuracies.
The introduction highlights the effectiveness of neural network methods in parsing tasks, emphasizing their ability to represent complex features with distributed representations. The paper distinguishes between transition-based dependency parsing and graph-based parsing, focusing on the latter. It mentions the components of a graph-based parser: parsing algorithm for inference and parameter estimation for machine learning models. The work utilizes maximum likelihood for neural network training and explores probabilistic treatment for dependency parsing. The authors incorporate a convolutional neural network with a distance-aware layer to model sentence-level representations, evaluating its effectiveness in comparison to window-based representation. The research is supported by various programs and foundations in China.
In summary, the paper introduces advanced neural probabilistic parsing models for graph-based dependency parsing, leveraging convolutional neural networks and probabilistic criteria for improved accuracy.

Graph-based parsing has a natural extension 
1382 
through raising its order and higher-order parsers 
usually perform better. In previous work on high- 
order graph-parsing, the scores of high-order sub- 
trees usually include the lower-order parts in their 
high-order factorizations.In traditional linear 
models, combining scores can be implemented by 
including low-order features. However, for neural 
models, this is not that straightforward because of 
nonlinearity. A straightforward strategy is simply 
adding up all the scores, which in fact works well; 
another way is stacking a linear layer on the top 
of the representation from various already-trained 
neural parsing models of different orders. 
This paper presents neural probabilistic mod- 
els for graph-based projective dependency pars- 
ing, and explores up to third-order models. Here 
are the three highlights of the proposed methods: 
��� Probabilistic criteria for neural network train- 
ing. (Section 2.2) 
��� Sentence-level representation learned from a 
convolutional layer. (Section 3.2) 
��� Ensemble models with a stacked linear out- 
put layer. (Section 3.3) 
Our main contribution is exploring sub-tree scor- 
ing models which combine local features with a 
window-based neural network and global features 
from a distance-aware convolutional neural net- 
work. A free distribution of our implementation 
is publicly available1. 
The remainder of the paper is organized as fol- 
lows: Section 2 explains the probabilistic model 
for graph-based parsing, Section 3 describes our 
neural network models, Section 4 presents our ex- 
periments and Section 5 discusses related work, 
we summarize this paper in Section 6.

In this continuation, the paper discusses the natural extension of graph-based parsing through raising its order, emphasizing that higher-order parsers typically perform better. In previous work, high-order graph parsing involves scores that include lower-order parts in their factorizations. The challenge arises in neural models due to nonlinearity, and the paper suggests strategies like adding up all scores or using a linear layer on top of representations from different-order neural parsing models.

The three main highlights include probabilistic criteria for neural network training, sentence-level representation learned from a convolutional layer, and ensemble models with a stacked linear output layer.
The primary contribution is in exploring sub-tree scoring models that combine local features with a window-based neural network and global features from a distance-aware convolutional neural network. The paper concludes by mentioning the availability of their implementation as open-source.
The subsequent sections are organized to explain the probabilistic model for graph-based parsing (Section 2), describe neural network models (Section 3), present experiments (Section 4), discuss related work (Section 5), and provide a summary (Section 6).

egories of models: other Graph-based NN (neu- 
ral network) models, traditional Graph-based Lin- 
ear models and Transition-based NN models. For 
PTB, there have been several different dependency 
converters which lead to different sets of depen- 
dencies and we choose three of the most popular 
ones for more comprehensive comparisons. Since 
not all work report results on all of these depen- 
dencies, someoftheentriesmightbenotavailable. 
From the comparison, we see that the pro- 
posed parser has output competitive performance 
for different dependency conversion conventions 
and treebanks. Compared with traditional graph- 
based linear models, neural models may benef i t 
from better feature representations and more gen- 
eral non-linear transformations. 
The results and comparisons in Table 2 demon- 
strate the proposed models can obtain comparable 
accuracies, which show the effectiveness of com- 
bining local and global features through window- 
based and convolutional neural networks. 
5Related Work 
CNN has been explored in recent work of rela- 
tion classif i cation (Zeng et al., 2014; Chen et al., 
2015), which resembles the task of deciding de- 
pendency relations in parsing. However, relation 
classif i cation usually involves labeling for given 
argumentsandseldomneedstoconsidertheglobal 
structure. Parsing is more complex for it needs to 
predict structures and the use of CNN should be 
incorporated with the searching algorithms. 
Neural network methods have been proved ef- 
fective for graph-based parsing. Lei et al. (2014) 
explore a tensor scoring method, however, it needs 
to combine scores from linear models and we 
are not able to compare with it because of dif- 
ferent datasets (they take datasets from CoNLL 
shared task).Zhang and Zhao (2015) also ex- 
plore a probabilistic treatment, but its model may 
give mass to illegal trees or non-trees. Fonseca 
and Alu�� ��sio (2015) utilize CNN for scoring edges, 
though only explore i rst-order parsing. Its model 
is based on head selection for each modif i er and 
might be diff i cult to be extended to high-order 
parsing. Recently, several neural re-ranking mod- 
els, like Inside-Outside Recursive Neural Network 
1389 
(Le and Zuidema, 2014) and Recursive CNN (Zhu 
et al., 2015), are utilized for capturing features 
with more contexts.However, re-ranking mod- 
els depend on the underlying base parsers, which 
might already miss the correct trees. Generally, 
the re-ranking techniques play a role of additional 
enhancement for basic parsing models, and there- 
fore they are not included in our comparisons. 
The conditional log-likelihood probabilistic cri- 
terion utilized in this work is actually a (condi- 
tioned) Markov Random Field for tree structures, 
and it has been applied to parsing since long time 
ago. Johnson et al. (1999) utilize the Markov Ran- 
dom Fields for stochastic grammars and gradient 
based methods are adopted for parameter estima- 
tions, and Geman and Johnson (2002) extend this 
with dynamic programming algorithms for infer- 
ence and marginal-probability calculation. Collins 
(2000) uses the same probabilistic treatment for 
re-ranking and the denominator only includes the 
candidate trees which can be seen as an approx- 
imation for the whole space of trees. Finkel et 
al. (2008) utilize it for feature-based parsing. The 
probabilistic training criterion for linear graph- 
based dependency models have been also explored 
in (Li et al., 2014; Ma and Zhao, 2015). How- 
ever, these previous methods usually exploit log- 
linear models utilizing sparse features for input 
representations and linear models for score calcu- 
lations, which are replaced by more sophisticated 
distributed representations and neural models, as 
shown in this work. 
6Conclusions 
This work presents neural probabilistic graph- 
based models for dependency parsing, together 
with a convolutional part which could capture the 
sentence-level information. With distributed vec- 
tors for representations and complex non-linear 
neural network for calculations, the model can ef- 
fectively capture more complex features when de- 
ciding the scores for sub-tree factors and exper- 
iments on standard treebanks show that the pro- 
posed techniques improve parsing

Here is some notes and thinkings of the author.

- In fact, this can be seen as a modified version of the author's previous parser nngdparser, but despite the similar name and similar framework of coding (similar messy), many changes have been made. Although we still support the models in nngdparser, they are quite unstable and not suggested for usage.
- Although the author works hard to improve the codes, the implementation still become messy and un-maintainable ...
- The nn library is called CSNN. However, CSNN's struture is hard coded and really unflexible, and the author even do not know why he made such a stupid choice ... Anyway, thankfully, there have been many wonderful open-source nn libraries such as theano, tensorflow and CNN(C++nn) ...
- The parsing algorithms (decoding or encoding) are the classical graph-parsing dynamic programming algorithms, the decoding ones are implemented with reference of MstParser and MaxParser (https://sourceforge.net/projects/maxparser/); while the encoding ones (inside-outside ones) are directly modified on the implementation of MaxParser (adding labeled situations).
- The 'graph-based' part is really the mess ...
- The author will try to improve coding skills and wish that he will make progress ...

nnpgdp --- neural network probabilistic graph-based dependency parser

<the style of the configuration is similar to the one of previous nngdparser>
========================================
1.the command
    Almost all the configuration information should be specified in the configuration file.
    Assuming the runnable file is "nnpgdp", to invoke the parser, the commands are simple:
        >> WE strongly recommend that the training and testing should be performed following the CONVETIONS in the second part,that is, each model run in its own folder.
        >> There are some meta files and temp files which can bring surprising results if not following the CONVETIONS.
    We only support corpus of 2008 conll's format, please look at section 4 for the format and the requires for the input corpus.
    1.1 traning
        nnpgdp <conf-file>
    ##if test file specified for training, the testing will be run right after the training.
    1.2 testing
        nnpgdp <conf-file> <mach-name>
    ##notice that the mach-name when testing should be the full-name for the mach file, and this is not the same as the mach-prefix-name in the options.

2.CONVETIONS
    The configuration's design for the parser is kind of a mess, but if you follow the conventions stated here, training and testing will be much easier.
    2.1 !! Simply put each model in separate directories would make it easier. -- For example for first-order training with the example conf in the doc/conf/po1 directory:
        For example, for training a first-order model, here are the steps:
            (1) make a directory and cd to it.
            (2) create the configuration file in the directory(for example, the "conf.txt" provided in the document);
                >> please specify the conf-file so that the model's files (such as dict-file or machine-file) are all in this directory.
            (3) for training, run the command: <nngdparser-runable-file> <conf-file>
                >> the resulting models include dict-file and machine-file(the one ended with ".best")
            (4) for testing, tun the command: <nngdparser-runable-file> <conf-file> <best-machine-name>
        >> Notice the dataset and (optional) embedding file should be in the specified format as described in sectino 4
    2.2 ?? what those files means 
        When training and testing, there will be many model files or tmp files in the directory:
        2.2.1 !! important files (their names can be changed in options)
            directory file(default as vocab.dict); best machine file(default as nn.mach.best); output file(default as output.txt)
        2.2.2 some temp files (not important after training)
            output file for dev corpus(output.txt.dev), temp machine file(nn.mach.curr)
			
3.configuration files:
    -- One option should take one line, which contains two parts(continuous part which can be read by "fin>>str;") separated by blanks; lines start with '#' will be ignored.
    3.1 !!!Options which MUST be provided (with no default values):
        M <algorithms-index>
            The choice of parsing algorithms: (again sorry for the bad form...)

		// '#' on the first char in a line means comment.
		Have to admit the confs are quite messy and the author even do not remember some of the options ... But all the options are specified in parts/HypherParameters.h ...
		Please refer to the example confs in the doc folder as a start ...
    
4.Format for corpus and embedding file
    We ONLY support the format like those in conll 2008, each token take one line with ten fields, and sentences are separated by an empty line.
    The columns mean: ID,FORM,?,?,PPOS,?,?,?,HEAD,?
        >> ? means we don't care about that field and there will be a place holder "_", the last field is dependency label which we don't consider for now.
    For example:
        1	No	_	_	RB	_	_	_	4	ADV
        2	,	_	_	,	_	_	_	4	P
        3	it	_	_	PRP	_	_	_	4	SBJ
        4	was	_	_	VBD	_	_	_	0	ROOT
        5	n't	_	_	RB	_	_	_	4	ADV
        6	Black	_	_	NNP	_	_	_	7	NAME
        7	Monday	_	_	NNP	_	_	_	4	PRD
        8	.	_	_	.	_	_	_	4	P

    For our parser(only unlabeled parsing), we only use 3 fields for training and evaluating and 2 for testing:
        >> For training and evaluating: 2nd-column(FORM,which is the token itself), 5th-column(POS,which is the golden-pos for the token),9th-column(HEAD,the gold result for our prediction)
        >> For testing: 2nd-column(FORM,which is the token itself), 5th-column(POS,which is the predicted-pos for the token);
            and we will output our prediction for HEAD in the 9th-column.
        >> In a word, our parser's prediction only base on the token's form and predicted pos.
            
    Usually, the train corpus file will provide 4 fields with golden-pos and correct head, the dev and test file with predicted-pos, the golden file with correct head.
    >> notice that the dev file should be its golden file and usually the test file will also be golden file for convenience.
	--------------------
	The format for embedding files (only for word) are only in text form, and the words and embeddings are seperated in two files, this might be slightly different to the conventions, please notice this.
	For example, for providing the embedding for init, two files should be prepared and specified in conf file like this, NOTE that the embedding size should correspond to the setting [n_wsize].

Certainly! Let's use everyday examples and metaphors to explain some of the concepts:
Basic Parsing Models:
Everyday Example:
Think of parsing as understanding a recipe. You break down the list of ingredients and instructions to comprehend the overall cooking process.
Metaphor:
Just like parsing a recipe, parsing models help computers understand and break down the structure of language.
Probabilistic Graph-based Dependency Parsing:
Everyday Example:
Consider building a family tree. Each member is connected to others, forming a graph that represents relationships.
Metaphor:
In dependency parsing, words in a sentence are like family members, and the parser creates a graph to represent how they depend on each other.
Neural Networks in Parsing Models:
Everyday Example:
Imagine learning to ride a bike. Your brain adapts and improves with each attempt, adjusting to different conditions.
Metaphor:
Neural networks in parsing models are like the adaptive learning process. They refine their understanding of language through training, much like learning to ride a bike.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Parsing:
Everyday Example:
Think of reading a newspaper. Instead of focusing on each word individually, you scan through headlines and images to capture the main points.
Metaphor:
A CNN in parsing is like scanning a newspaper. It captures the essence of a sentence by considering the overall context rather than analyzing each word in isolation.
Ensemble Models in Parsing:
Everyday Example:
Consider making a decision based on advice from multiple experts rather than relying on just one opinion.
Metaphor:
Ensemble models in parsing combine insights from different parsing approaches, much like considering multiple expert opinions for a decision.
Machine Learning Training Iterations:
Everyday Example:
Think of practicing a musical instrument. The more you practice, the better you become over time.
Metaphor:
Training iterations in machine learning are like practicing an instrument. The model refines its understanding with each iteration, improving its performance.
Learning Rate in Neural Networks:
Everyday Example:
Adjusting the volume on a speaker. You find the right balance for optimal sound quality.
Metaphor:
Learning rate in neural networks is like adjusting the volume. It determines how quickly or slowly the model adapts during training.
These metaphors aim to simplify complex concepts related to parsing models and neural networks, making them more relatable to everyday experiences.
