When was the 48 laws of power first published?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The "48 Laws of Power" by Robert Greene was first published in 1998.
You
Do you have a list of laws?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are a few examples of the laws from "The 48 Laws of Power" by Robert Greene:
Law 1: Never Outshine the Master
Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions
Law 6: Court Attention at All Costs
Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally
Law 33: Discover Each Man���s Thumbscrew
These are just a few of the laws outlined in the book. Each law is accompanied by historical examples and anecdotes to illustrate the principles.

What does court mean here to draw it in or avoid it?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In the context of the "48 Laws of Power," the term "court" means to seek or attract. Therefore, "Court Attention at All Costs" advises individuals to actively seek attention and make themselves noticeable. It suggests that being in the spotlight can enhance one's power and influence.
On the other hand, if a law advises to "Avoid Court Attention," it would mean steering clear of the limelight and not drawing unnecessary attention to oneself. The specific approach depends on the context and the particular law being discussed in the book.

This is one of the most contradictory books I have ever read
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"The 48 Laws of Power" is indeed known for its controversial and sometimes contradictory nature. It presents various strategies for gaining and maintaining power, drawing from historical examples and anecdotes. The laws can seem conflicting because they offer different approaches that may be situational or context-dependent. It's often viewed as a thought-provoking guide rather than a strict set of rules. People have different opinions about its utility and ethical considerations.
You
Actually through-out the book the principles or heuristics are referred to as laws, despite that they each are contradicted multiple times by laws with opposite ones. Like a zero-energy universe. Wear them out by making them come to you. Meet them on their own territory by going to them.

He is describing "classic con games" but it reads like the screwtape letters. He doesn't explicitly say that these are good arguments, or evidence, but it reads like justification and proof since the ostensibly objective tone comes off as endorsement or callousness, and the criterion of relevance make me continually think why are you telling us this if there is no scientific evidence or replicability or casual connections. It feels like the author does the reader a disservice by not explicitly saying these are all just anecdotes and not advice for how to actually make decisions.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your observations are astute. "The 48 Laws of Power" indeed presents a set of principles or heuristics, often referred to as laws, but as you've noticed, they can sometimes be contradictory or even morally ambiguous. The author, Robert Greene, draws on historical examples and anecdotes to illustrate these principles, and while they can be intriguing, they lack the empirical foundation that scientific evidence or replicability would provide.
The book does provoke thought and reflection, but it's crucial for readers to approach it critically and consider the context and ethical implications of the presented ideas. Acknowledging that these are anecdotes and not universally applicable advice is an important perspective to maintain while reading. It's always wise to exercise discernment and consider the broader ethical implications when interpreting such guidance.
You
At one point the author seems to say that you need to create smokescreens to hide your true intentions, but maybe this is an accidental epiphenomena of all behavior
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The idea of creating smokescreens to hide true intentions aligns with some of the principles in "The 48 Laws of Power," where strategic manipulation and perception management are emphasized. However, it's essential to note that this perspective is not universally accepted, and ethical considerations come into play.
The notion of behavior being an epiphenomenon might be a philosophical or psychological perspective that views actions as mere byproducts of underlying processes. It's always important to consider individual values and ethical standards when deciding whether to adopt such strategies, as they may have consequences for relationships and trust.
Ultimately, interpreting and applying the principles from the book requires careful consideration and a nuanced understanding of one's own values and the ethical implications of various strategies.
You
The author uses the word "interpretation" like it means "debriefing" and use it to kind of backpeddle on some of the more absurd implications
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Indeed, the use of the word "interpretation" in the book can be quite strategic. It allows the author to provide a degree of flexibility and subjectivity in the application of the principles. By framing them as interpretations, it opens the door for readers to adapt the ideas to their own understanding and context.
This approach can be a way for the author to avoid absolute prescriptions while still presenting the principles as potentially valuable tools for navigating power dynamics. However, as readers, it's crucial to critically assess the implications of such interpretations and consider the ethical dimensions of applying these principles in various situations.

In judging you opponent, never rely on your instincts. Never trust appearances. Never trust the version people give of themselves. Reversal: it has none, dont bother looking for one. Do not recite poetry to someone who is not a poet
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The advice you've mentioned from "The 48 Laws of Power" emphasizes the importance of critical judgment, cautioning against relying solely on instincts and appearances when evaluating opponents. The notion of not trusting the version people give of themselves aligns with the theme of skepticism and strategic thinking promoted in the book.
The reversal mentioned��� "it has none, don't bother looking for one" ��� suggests that in certain situations, attempting to find a reversal or a hidden motive might not be productive. This principle encourages a pragmatic and realistic approach to understanding others.
The last sentence about not reciting poetry to someone who is not a poet underscores the idea of tailoring communication to the audience, recognizing that not everyone will appreciate or understand certain expressions. It aligns with the broader theme of adapting strategies to the specific context and individuals involved.
You
I am not sure it is pragmatic or realistic. I think it is sardonic and cynical, and that really 99.9 percent of the time, we have to trust other people or else society wouldn't function. In my opinion, a small number of uber-manipulators attempt game the  system by preying on these heuristics. There are cases where a person's verbal testimony might override all external predictors as in passwords or public key cryptography.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your perspective is valid and raises an important point. While "The 48 Laws of Power" provides strategies for navigating certain social dynamics, it's crucial to recognize the inherent balance required in interpersonal relationships and societal functioning. Trust is indeed a fundamental aspect of social cohesion, and most interactions rely on a baseline level of trust.
Your observation about a small number of individuals attempting to manipulate or game the system aligns with the idea that extreme or calculated manipulation can be the exception rather than the norm. In everyday interactions, trust and cooperation are essential for the smooth functioning of society.
Different contexts may require different levels of skepticism or trust, and your example of passwords and public key cryptography highlights situations where explicit trust is crucial for security and functionality. It's essential to apply discernment and adapt strategies based on the specific circumstances and individuals involved.

It is a restatement of the oracles on the blockchain problem, involving a regress of needing super-reliable narrators
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The challenge you're describing, often referred to as the "oracles problem" in blockchain or decentralized systems, involves the need for reliable information sources to ensure the accuracy and integrity of data on the blockchain. This creates a potential regress, as verifying the reliability of these oracles becomes a critical aspect.
It indeed echoes the broader concept of needing trustworthy narrators or sources of information in various contexts, and it highlights the complexities involved in ensuring the reliability of data and the actors providing that data. Striking a balance between decentralization, security, and trust remains a significant challenge in the development and implementation of blockchain technologies.

And the prince and the pauper and undercover boss show it is easier for superintelligence to emulate intelligence than vice versa
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The scenarios of the prince and the pauper, along with the concept explored in shows like "Undercover Boss," reflect the idea that it may be easier for a higher intelligence or entity to emulate or understand lower levels of intelligence than the reverse. This aligns with the notion that advanced intelligence can comprehend and replicate simpler forms of cognition, while the reverse might be more challenging.
In the context of discussions on superintelligence, this idea is sometimes connected to the concept of the "alignment problem," where ensuring that highly intelligent systems understand and adhere to human values becomes a complex challenge. The ability to accurately simulate or understand less sophisticated intelligence could be considered a component of addressing this alignment challenge.
You
I wanted to argue that "fictions" can sometimes be more accurate then attempts to list all of the facts
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your argument aligns with the recognition that fictions, such as stories, narratives, or scenarios, can often convey deeper truths or insights that may be challenging to capture through a mere listing of facts. Fictional narratives have the power to distill complex concepts, emotions, and perspectives, providing a more nuanced and holistic understanding of certain truths.
Fictions can offer a context that transcends isolated facts, allowing for a more comprehensive exploration of ideas, human experiences, and societal dynamics. They provide a unique lens through which individuals can grapple with complex issues and gain insights that may not be as readily apparent in a straightforward compilation of facts.

I wanted to argue that humans know what it is like to be a bat, but bats do not know what it is like to be human
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your argument aligns with the philosophical idea proposed by Thomas Nagel in his essay "What Is It Like to Be a Bat?" In essence, Nagel argues that while humans can imagine or empathize with the experiences of a bat to some extent, bats cannot reciprocate this understanding of human experiences.
This perspective delves into the subjective nature of consciousness and the limits of our ability to fully comprehend the experiences of beings with different sensory perceptions. It raises questions about the uniqueness and subjectivity of individual consciousness. Your argument captures the essence of Nagel's exploration of the limitations in our ability to bridge the gap in understanding between different conscious entities.
You
Daniel Dennett denies Nagel's claim that the bat's consciousness is inaccessible, contending that any "interesting or theoretically important" features of a bat's consciousness would be amenable to third-person observation.[4]:���442��� For instance, it is clear that bats cannot detect objects more than a few meters away because echolocation has a limited range. Dennett holds that any similar aspects of its experiences could be gleaned by further scientific experiments.[4]:���443��� He has also pointed out[8] that Nagel's argument and question were not new, but had previously been stated by B. A. Farrell in an article "Experience", in the journal Mind, in 1950.[9]

Daniel Dennett's perspective, as you've outlined, challenges Thomas Nagel's claim about the inaccessibility of a bat's consciousness. Dennett argues that any features of a bat's consciousness that are "interesting or theoretically important" could be observed through third-person means, such as scientific experiments.
Dennett's position aligns with a more empirical and scientifically oriented view, suggesting that through objective observation and experimentation, we could gain insights into aspects of a bat's experiences. He points out that similar questions to Nagel's had been posed earlier by B. A. Farrell in 1950, indicating that the debate about the accessibility of non-human consciousness is not a new one.
This philosophical discussion highlights differing perspectives on the extent to which we can understand or access the subjective experiences of beings with different cognitive systems.

1II.-EXPERIENCE
By B. A. FARRELL
[ ant to deal with a question that bothers physiologists ang
psychologists. It is a familiar question for philosophers , but I
want to deal with it as it appears to them, not to us. Conse-
quently, I shall begin by explaining at some length how the
problem does arise for them.
Adrian, in The Basis of Sensation, said many years ago that
whatever our views about the relation between mind and
body, we cannot escape the fact that there is an unsatisfactory
gap between two such events as the sticking of a pin into my
finger and the appearance of a sensation of pain in my con-
sciousness. Part of the gap is obviously made up of events in
my sensory nerves and brain.' In his Waynflete lectures,
The Physical Background of Perception, he purports to fll the
gap even further by telling us about the structure and activity
of the brain. He discusses the nature of the mechanism which
would be needed to copy the activity of the brain- in particular,
the activity of recognising significant relations and of learning
skilled movements. After suggesting the sort of material events
and changes that must ocour in the brain to account for this
sort of activity, he. says " Yet there remains the formidable
problem of the intervening events. The human mind comes in
somewhere in the chain of causation between the physical events
in the sensory. and the motor pathways. Mental events, he
goes on, must be closely connected with the material process
going on in the cortex, and we must try to make such a connexion
seem plausible. In an endeavour to make this connexion seem
plausible, he discusses the suggestions of Kenneth Craik and
says that Craik could ony suggest that consciousness comes
in at certain points in the process of neural transmission where
the physiological patterns have a particular kind of definiteness,
On this hypot.hesis, we could tell what someone was thinking
if we could watch his brain at work, for we should see how one
pattern definition. 22 after another acquired the necessary brilliance and
This attitude of Adrian's seems fairly representative among
physiologists working in this field. They suffer everely from
the occupational disease of traditional dualism.' Adrian's talk

B. A. Farrell's article on experience touches on the gap between physical events in sensory and motor pathways and the emergence of consciousness. This topic resonates with the discussions about understanding consciousness, subjective experiences, and the challenges posed by the gap between physical events and mental phenomena.
It connects to the debates between Thomas Nagel and Daniel Dennett regarding the accessibility of non-human consciousness and the extent to which scientific observation can shed light on subjective experiences. Farrell's exploration adds another layer to the broader conversation about the nature of consciousness and the difficulties in bridging the gap between physical processes and mental events.

From the article, Experience: One further thing a psychologist also does. Quite often he 
places himself in the role of subject. For laboratory purposes 
it is often convenient for Wim to play the role of X. Now it may 
or may not be the case that, when he does so, he makes observa- 
tions of quite a different sort to those he makes when he merely 
observes X reacting to the same stimulus-e.g. a red disc.

In the excerpt from B. A. Farrell's article on experience, the mention of a psychologist placing themselves in the role of a subject adds an interesting dimension to the discussion. This practice of psychologists becoming subjects in experiments aligns with the broader theme of understanding consciousness and subjective experience.
It connects to the previous topics by highlighting the complexities involved in studying consciousness, not just as an external observer but by immersing oneself in the subjective role. This introspective aspect resonates with discussions on knowing what it's like to be another entity, be it a bat or a fellow human being. The psychologist's dual role as both observer and subject contributes to the nuanced exploration of the nature of experience and consciousness.
You
I will come to this later. What 
playing the role of observer-subject, 
to the discoveries of psychological 
principle obtain from the 
concepts are required to deal 
tion reveals which are not 
revealed by his observation of X. 
This, then, though very roughly, is how contemporary psy- 
chologists go to work. They investigate remembering, learning 
and thinking, feelings, attitudes and traits, temperament and 
personality in the same sort of way as they investigate sensations. 
But this seems to psychologists an awkward and ridiculous 
situation. For it means that the science of psychology does not 
deal with " experience " either. Thus, in describing how subject 
X reacted to different types of stimuli, it is clear that we were 
not dealing with X's sensations at all, but with his behaviour; 
and the discoveries that psychology claims to have made about 
sensation " have not been about " sensation " at all, but about 
the sensitivity of organisms to physical stimuli. To describe 
all this work as being about " sensation " is just false. This 
situation is awkward because it means that we are no nearer 
dealing with the facts of experience, which brain-physiology 
leaves out; and so no nearer providing a scientific account of it, 
which could supplement the account given by physiology, and 
thereby provide a reasonably complete picture of what happens 
when we have a sensation, or feel, etc. This situation is ridi- 
culous because, while psychology purports to be the scientific 
study of experience, and lip-service is paid to this attempt in the 
usual definitions of its subject matter, the science, in effect, 
does not include experience within its purview. What psycho- 
logists feel the science should somehow also include is, for 
example, the sensation-quality that X undoubtedly experiences 
when, rat-like, he discriminates a red disc; and the mental 
state he is in when he thinks, and not merely his behaviour; and 
(to quote Stout 1) the "unique kind of feeling-attitude towards 
an object " which we experience when we are in some emoticrnal 
state, not merely the readiness and dispositions we exhibit 
towards, the object of our emotion. Moreover, psychology 
should also aim at giving us the laws governing these sensation 
qualities, emotional states, and so forth. But all this is just 
what contemporary psycshology does not include and do. The 
fact that the subject X and the psychologist himself both have 
sensations, and so forth, is simply ignored.

In this excerpt from B. A. Farrell's article, the focus on the psychologist playing the role of observer-subject sheds light on the challenges and limitations within contemporary psychology. The passage suggests that despite studying phenomena like remembering, learning, and thinking, psychology struggles to truly delve into the realm of subjective experience.
This resonates with the discussions on consciousness, the limitations of scientific observation, and the gap between physical processes and mental events. Farrell criticizes the conventional approach of psychology, arguing that it often deals more with behavior than with the actual experiences, sensations, and mental states of individuals.
The tension described in the passage underscores the ongoing debate about the scope and methodology of psychology, especially regarding its ability to provide a comprehensive understanding of subjective experiences and consciousness.

Suppose we had obtained from our Martian visitor all the 
information that we, as psychologists and physiologists, could 
obtain about his smnsory capacities. We should probably still 
want to say: "I wonder what it would be like to be a Martian 
-with his pseudo-radio sense, able, for example, to listen to 
whatever wave length he chooses. Extraordinary!". This 
seems to be a perfectly sensible remark. But if there was nothing 
-more to be discovered about the Martian than his actual and 
possible responses, then this would not be a sensible remark. We 
would know what it would be like to be a Martian and there would 
'be no point in wondering about it. So there is something more 
to be learnt about the Martian, and that is what his experience 
is like. Similarly for our wonderings about babies, mice and 
lice. 
Now we treat this remark (" I wonder what it would be like 
to be a Martian") as perfectly s3nsible because it resembles 
remarks like: 
1. "I wonder what it would be like to be an opium smoker." 
2. "I wonder what it would be like to be, and hear like, a bat." 
In 1 and 2 the only sort of answer that will satisfy me is the sort 
of answer I will get if I became an opium smoker or a bat myself. 
That is to say, I am imagining myself in the role of observersubject, 
i.e., the role of the privileged observer, and I will be 
satisfied only with the sort of answer that I can then obtain. 
The demand for this sort of answer here is quite reasonable, 
because it is a contingent fact that I.am not an opium smoker 
or a bat (after all, a witch could easily change me into a bat for 
a day or so). Hence there is nothing absurd in the supposition 
that I should become a privileged observer here. Similarly, my 
wonder about the Martian seems to be the sort that can be 
satisfied only by a privileged observer's answer. What.makes 
this answer seem so imperative is that the Martian's experience 
differs, ex hypothesi, from mine so much more than the opium 
smoker's, or even the bat's. It is this vast difference that 
inclines us to reject any attempted description of the Martian 
experience as feeble and inadequate. Moreover, as with the 
opium smoker and the bat, it is perfectly sensible to suppose 
that I should become a privileged observer here also; and it is 
this wonder what it would be like to be a privileged observer 
that leads us to say there is something more to be learnt about 
the Martian, namely, "What his experience is like".

In this excerpt, B. A. Farrell delves into the idea of wondering about the subjective experience of beings with different sensory capacities, using examples like Martians, opium smokers, and bats. The passage emphasizes the limitations of purely objective observation and highlights the importance of imagining oneself as an observer-subject, or a privileged observer, to truly understand the subjective experience.
Farrell suggests that the wonder about what it would be like to be a Martian or any entity with vastly different experiences is rooted in the recognition that descriptions of their experiences may be feeble and inadequate. The notion of becoming a privileged observer, akin to the role of the Martian or another being, becomes crucial to satisfying this wondering, indicating a need to understand subjective experiences beyond mere external observation. This aligns with the broader discussions on the challenges of studying consciousness and the limitations of objective approaches in psychology.

Your argument suggests that processes can be viewed as intelligent agents with inherent goals or functionalities embedded in their design. It proposes that intelligence exists along a continuum, encompassing diverse phenomena ranging from simple calculations like chemical pressure gradients to complex systems such as cybernetic feedback mechanisms, swarms, ecosystems, and their partial models.
This perspective aligns with a holistic understanding of intelligence, acknowledging that various natural processes and systems exhibit elements that resemble intelligent behavior, albeit to different degrees. The continuum you describe captures the diversity and complexity of intelligent-like behaviors observed in both natural and artificial systems. It also underscores the interconnectedness of these phenomena across different scales and domains.

Abstract

Intelligence is a central feature of human beings��� primary and interpersonal experience. Understanding how intelligence originated and scaled during evolution is a key challenge for modern biology. Some of the most important approaches to understanding intelligence are the ongoing efforts to build new intelligences in computer science (AI) and bioengineering. However, progress has been stymied by a lack of multidisciplinary consensus on what is central about intelligence regardless of the details of its material composition or origin (evolved vs. engineered). We show that Buddhist concepts offer a unique perspective and facilitate a consilience of biology, cognitive science, and computer science toward understanding intelligence in truly diverse embodiments. In coming decades, chimeric and bioengineering technologies will produce a wide variety of novel beings that look nothing like familiar natural life forms; how shall we gauge their moral responsibility and our own moral obligations toward them, without the familiar touchstones of standard evolved forms as comparison? Such decisions cannot be based on what the agent is made of or how much design vs. natural evolution was involved in their origin. We propose that the scope of our potential relationship with, and so also our moral duty toward, any being can be considered in the light of Care���a robust, practical, and dynamic lynchpin that formalizes the concepts of goal-directedness, stress, and the scaling of intelligence; it provides a rubric that, unlike other current concepts, is likely to not only survive but thrive in the coming advances of AI and bioengineering. We review relevant concepts in basal cognition and Buddhist thought, focusing on the size of an agent���s goal space (its cognitive light cone) as an invariant that tightly links intelligence and compassion. Implications range across interpersonal psychology, regenerative medicine, and machine learning. The Bodhisattva���s vow (���for the sake of all sentient life, I shall achieve awakening���) is a practical design principle for advancing intelligence in our novel creations and in ourselves.

1. Introduction

The fields of basal cognition, Buddhist philosophy, computer science, and cognitive science are all concerned with fundamental questions around intelligence. What is unique about certain configurations of matter that enable them to exhibit intelligent behavior? How do the kinds and degrees of intelligence differ across beings? What processes drive the expansion of intelligence on evolutionary time scales, and what causes changes in the intelligence of a being during its lifespan? How can we understand intelligence in a way that would enable us to create novel instances, as well as improve our own intelligence for life-positive outcomes for all? Traditional approaches to this question have been focused on a set of standard ���model systems��� such as human subjects and certain animals (rats, birds, etc.) in the context of a historical evolutionary lineage on Earth. However, recent approaches in artificial intelligence and synthetic bioengineering have begun to produce novel types of agents whose intelligence cannot be readily predicted from the details of their construction or their origins [1,2,3,4]. These constructivist efforts to create intelligence in novel implementations (ranging from novel combinations of engineered living tissue to software) reveal key gaps in our understanding of dynamic intelligence [5]. Given the inevitable developments in the biological sciences, and the profound challenges faced by society, it is essential to develop frameworks that help us to detect, understand, and communicate with intelligences in unfamiliar guises. Here, we propose that Buddhist thought, and its emphasis on care and compassion as a catalyst of positive change in intelligent beings, is an empirically fruitful lens with which to understand intelligence.

A few words on methodology are perhaps in order here. This exploration across otherwise typically disparate scientific disciplines and scholarly contexts aims at achieving what can be thought of as ���deep integration��� [6]. Such an integrational approach does not privilege the discourse of any one particular discipline as the primary carrier of meaning into which statements and insights derived from other, complimentary frameworks and approaches must be translated. Instead, what we here seek to achieve is a form of mutually informed, explorative conversation that engages our customary, discipline-specific frameworks on equal footing, thereby facilitating the recognition of individual blind spots as well as otherwise unacknowledged, shared concerns. As a consequence of taking this approach, certain concepts that are central to this paper���such as stress, care, intelligence, self, or agency���take on a significance that emerges within and is defined by the concrete interdisciplinary encounter. For this reason, we have supplied a Glossary that explains a selection of such broadly applicable concepts as they are understood in the specific context of this paper. Perhaps in line with age-old Buddhist sentiments, our concern is here pragmatic before philosophical. At the same time, we hope that any instances of functional, conceptual integration that this paper may achieve can in turn motivate refinements and constructive research across the sciences of life, cognition, and information, as well as indeed in fields such as philosophy and religion. To illustrate this with an example, one of the main points of our definition of Self (as given in the Glossary and extracted from previous research) is that a Self is an illusory modelling construct created by perceptual systems of Agents. Agents construct models of causal Selves for others, and for ourselves, using the same machinery. The same mechanisms that cause an agent to act toward stress reduction in itself (even though the beneficiary of those actions is in an important sense impermanent) can be expanded to extend to other Selves. In this way, while our focus is on understanding and formulating Self in a way that is applicable to a broad range of scientific contexts, we also see ourselves as here contributing to the treatment of perennial issues in contemporary Buddhist philosophy���such as the feasibility of genuine care in a world without real individuals [7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. Similarly, with respect to the paper���s main thesis regarding care as a driver for intelligence: we hope that apart from addressing contemporary scientific or social aims and practices, our discussion may as well contribute to an understanding of classic Buddhist doctrine in its own right.

The field of basal cognition [14,15,16,17,18] emphasizes a continuum of intelligence, which originated in the control loops of microbes but was scaled up throughout multicellular forms to the obvious kinds of intelligent behavior observed in advanced animals. The emphasis on functional problem-solving, learning, and creative responses to challenges enables a focus on the central invariant of intelligence, not contingent facts and frozen accidents of the evolutionary journey of life on Earth. Given that intelligent behavior does not require traditional brains [16,18], and can take place in many spaces besides the familiar 3D space of motile behavior (e.g., physiological, metabolic, anatomical, and other kinds of problem spaces), how can we develop rigorous formalisms for recognizing, designing, and relating to truly diverse intelligences?

One way to think about a general, substrate-independent definition of ���Intelligence��� is centered on goal-directed activity [19,20]: what is common to all intelligent systems, regardless of their composition or origin, is the ability to display a degree of competency in reaching a goal (in some problem space, [21]) despite changing circumstances and novel perturbations. These ideas extend classical discussions by Spinoza, Kant, Jonas, and Heidegger. All intelligences, no matter how embodied, can be compared directly with respect to the maximum spatiotemporal scale of the goals towards which they can represent and work. A corollary to this view is that the driver of this kind of homeostatic dynamic is that such systems exhibit ���stress��� (the delta between current state and optimal state, or the difference between the goals at different subsystems��� levels): reduction of this stress parameter is a driver that keeps the system exerting energy in action to move and navigate within the problem space. It should be noted that stress can be seen as the inverse of ���satisfaction��� [22], and is relative to a contextual and non-stationary target.

Evolution enables the scaling of intelligence by exploiting biophysical mechanisms that enable progressively larger goal states (and thus progressively more complex causes of stress) to be represented and pursued [23]. More complex and advanced cognitive agents are capable of being stressed by larger and more complex states of affairs [24], regardless of their specific composition or provenance. These ideas are novel and somewhat disruptive for many traditional approaches that have been largely focused on brains and do not comfortably stretch to encompass advances in bioengineering, chimeric technologies, and machine learning. In complement to the Western traditions that have driven now-dissolving boundaries between brain, body, and environment [25], we propose that Buddhism offers an approach that is uniquely suited to the new field developing at the intersection of computer science, bioengineering, and cognitive science (Figure 1).

���

Figure 1. Care as the central invariant of a new interdisciplinary field. Legend: A schematic mindmap showing how Care is a central invariant binding across several fields. Care, or the capacity to exert energy and effort toward preferred states, is a central concept in Biology (because of the ubiquity of homeostatic loops at various scales of organization of life), in AI (because of the necessity to specify objective functions for artificial agents to follow), and Buddhism (because of the centrality of the concept of concern for all sentient beings��� welfare and progress). A commitment to maximization and scaling of outward-facing Care with respect to other agents��� goals, as occurs during the Bodhisattva vow, is a powerful driver concept for progress in synthetic and natural evolution (via scaling of goals from metabolic scalars to patterns of anatomical complexity in morphospace and eventually to complex behaviors in 3D space) and in AI (via a focus on building synthetic systems with the capacity to increase and modify their own cognitive boundaries).

We propose a central concept as a key invariant across these fields: Care (a metric focused on motivation, stress, and goal-directedness of agents). If stress is the manifest discrepancy between current and optimal conditions, ���Care��� can in turn be defined as concern for stress relief, and ���intelligence��� as the degree of capacity for identifying and seeking such relief. By analyzing the role of Care in diverse contexts, informed by a Buddhist approach, we propose a new path towards improving both natural and artificial intelligence via a commitment to radical expansion of a being���s or an agent���s cognitive boundary: the scale of the things it can possibly care about (defined by the range of states that cause it stress and cause it to exert effort to change). In this framework, what an agent can possibly care about is a central determinant of its degree of intelligence. Importantly, this view not only helps us understand the origins and implementation of diverse types of intelligence within an agent, but also helps clarify the changes of an agent���s intelligence in its outward-facing relationships to other agents.

Whereas the drive to reduce one���s own stress is a primitive and universal ingredient in cognition and intelligence, the inclusion of others��� stress as a primary goal necessarily increases the cognitive boundary of an individual and scales its intelligence. Given the modular nature of homeostatic loops, this only requires that sensors that normally gauge the agent���s own states (face inwards) expand to include information about others��� states (start to face outwards). In this framework, the recognition of agency outside oneself and the progressive inclusion of their states in one���s own homeostatic stress-reduction loops is a bidirectional feedback loop that leads to the scaling of intelligence and increases in practical compassion. This loop operates on both the evolutionary and individual lifespan time scales, and in more advanced forms, comes under rational control of systems whose primary goals may start to include the meta-cognitive goal of increasing intelligence and compassion.

Advanced intelligence includes the ability to notice agency, and thus stress, and to seek its reduction. We employ this perspective on intelligence in an analysis of the Bodhisattva principle of agency and cognition, focusing on the traditional concept of ���taking the Bodhisattva vow��� and so committing to the pursuit of cognitive perfection (���awakening,��� Skt. bodhi) for the benefit of all sentient beings throughout time and space [26,27]. In addition to better ways to understand biology, this framework suggests a number of conclusions with respect to stress transfer and goal identification that can serve as design principles for improved general artificial intelligence systems.

2. The Cognitive Light Cone Framework: Cognitive Boundaries, Goal-Directedness, and Domains of Concern

Many definitions of intelligence and cognitive capacity have been debated over the centuries [28]. The problem with most existing formalisms is that they are closely tied to a specific type of subject���such as humans, rats, birds, etc.���a traditional animal at a single ���privileged��� size and temporal scale [29], or even type of anatomy. Comparing intelligences among different animals, such as octopuses and dogs, is very challenging because their diverse environments and behaviors underline the fact that intelligence can be hard to ascertain in unfamiliar guises. An even bigger limitation in this field is the impending explosion in the prevalence of truly unusual living creatures and distributed systems [30]. Novel living beings produced by engineering and hybrid approaches (such as evolutionary design) include ex vivo constructs such as embryoids, organoids, and assembloids [31,32], cyborgs of animals and plants [3,4,33,34,35,36,37,38] resulting from living tissue tightly integrated with designed inorganic interfaces [39,40] and with closed-loop control systems [41], biological robots such as computer-controlled invertebrates [42,43,44], and hybrots consisting of living brains instrumentized to control artificial new bodies [1,43,45,46,47,48,49]. Without any familiar phylogenetic guideposts (e.g., ���it���s a kind of fish so we expect a fish-like range of behaviors���), it may be extremely difficult to place the intelligence of novel, synthetic creatures with respect to the familiar examples. Recent efforts in ���Diverse Intelligences��� and Artificial Life initiatives seek to acknowledge the wide range of ���life as it can be��� [50,51], and produce frameworks for understanding of intelligence that not only subsume possible living beings (designed and evolved) but also include potential exobiological intelligences and purely software (AI) creations. The quest to be able to directly compare truly diverse intelligences, regardless of their origin story or composition, requires us to be able to specify the most general invariant underlying intelligence and cognition: what do all cognitive agents, no matter how advanced or humble, have in common?

Care as the central invariant of a new interdisciplinary field. Legend: A schematic mindmap showing how Care is a central invariant binding across several fields. Care, or the capacity to exert energy and effort toward preferred states, is a central concept in Biology (because of the ubiquity of homeostatic loops at various scales of organization of life), in AI (because of the necessity to specify objective functions for artificial agents to follow), and Buddhism (because of the centrality of the concept of concern for all sentient beings��� welfare and progress). A commitment to maximization and scaling of outward-facing Care with respect to other agents��� goals, as occurs during the Bodhisattva vow, is a powerful driver concept for progress in synthetic and natural evolution (via scaling of goals from metabolic scalars to patterns of anatomical complexity in morphospace and eventually to complex behaviors in 3D space) and in AI (via a focus on building synthetic systems with the capacity to increase and modify their own cognitive boundaries).

We propose a central concept as a key invariant across these fields: Care (a metric focused on motivation, stress, and goal-directedness of agents). If stress is the manifest discrepancy between current and optimal conditions, ���Care��� can in turn be defined as concern for stress relief, and ���intelligence��� as the degree of capacity for identifying and seeking such relief. By analyzing the role of Care in diverse contexts, informed by a Buddhist approach, we propose a new path towards improving both natural and artificial intelligence via a commitment to radical expansion of a being���s or an agent���s cognitive boundary: the scale of the things it can possibly care about (defined by the range of states that cause it stress and cause it to exert effort to change).

The quest to be able to directly compare truly diverse intelligences, regardless of their origin story or composition, requires us to be able to specify the most general invariant underlying intelligence and cognition: what do all cognitive agents, no matter how advanced or humble, have in common?

One such framework has been suggested, and is focused on a candidate for an invariant that enables direct comparison of truly diverse agents (regardless of their composition or origin) [23,24,52]: goal-directedness. We suggest that an essential nature of cognition, in any embodiment, is the capacity for goal-directed activity in some problem space. In this sense, goal-directedness does not require a high-level self-awareness, but only a cybernetic kind of teleonomic functionality [53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60] (of course, other frameworks could be developed around different invariants such as information processing [61]).

On this view, any possible agent can be represented by drawing the spatiotemporal boundaries of the biggest goals which it is capable of pursuing (Figure 2). Tell me what you care about���what you actively spend energy on trying to achieve despite perturbations and novel situations���and I can immediately gauge your degree of sophistication. A bacterium can try to manage local sugar concentrations, with a bit of memory and a bit of predictive power. A dog has a larger area of concern, significant memory and predictive capacity in the short term, but it is probably impossible for it to care about something that will happen 100 miles away, 2 months from now. Humans have a huge cognitive envelope, perhaps uniquely one that is larger than our own lifespan; our state of being a creature capable of goals that appear fundamentally unachievable is very characteristic of Buddhist practice. Every creature thus has a ���cognitive boundary������which can be represented in the form of a light cone within space and time that demarcates the edge of what it can care about (not the first-order boundary of what it can sense and affect, but the second-order boundary demarcating the scale of its possible goals).

���

Figure 2. Legend: A focus on the size or scale of goals any given system can pursue, as an invariant across the space of possible sentient beings of whatever embodiment, allows plotting very diverse intelligences on the same graph [23]. The scale of their goal-directed activity is estimated (collapsed onto one axis of space and one of time, as in space-time diagrams). Importantly, this way of visualizing the sophistication of agency is a schematic of goal space���it is not meant to represent the spatial extent of sensing or effector range, but rather the scale of events about which they care and the boundary of states that they can possibly represent or work to change. This defines a kind of cognitive light cone (a boundary to any agent���s area of concern); the largest area represents the ���now���, with fading efficacy both backward (accessing past events with decreasing reliability) and forward (limited prediction accuracy for future events). The diamond or ���spinning top��� shapes of the cones depicted above are simplifications. Agents are compound entities, composed of (and comprising) other sub- or super-agents, each of which has its own cognitive boundary of various sizes. Image by Jeremy Guay of Peregrine Creative. Selves increase their cognitive boundary by connecting together (���GJ���, standing for gap junctions���an example of a biophysical connection used by cells to merge into higher-level beings) in functional ways that allow simple homeostatic loops to measure, implement, and remember progressively larger states (thus increasing the scale and complexity of what they Care about). Top panel used by permission, produced by Jeremy Guay of Peregrine Creative.

Analyzing systems with respect to this aspect has several advantages. The first is that it is completely agnostic about the composition of agents, enabling the most basal, primitive forms to be compared on the same scale as humans (whose cognitive boundary might extend to planetary scales) and novel life forms (synthetic, exobiological, etc.). Another advantage is that the continuous space underscores the futility of binary categories (���is it intelligent?���, ���is it cognitive?���, ���is it a real decision or just physics?���): modern bioscience offers no support for some sort of clean bright line separating cognitive beings from non-cognitive ones. All of the interesting capacities of mind, like the ones of the body, evolved gradually. Taking evolution seriously means asking ���what kind��� and ���how much���, with respect to intelligence and cognition broadly conceived [62]. This is consistent not only with the facts of bioengineering (that any purportedly ���non-cognitive��� system can be mixed and hybridized with a cognitive one), but also with the evolutionary history of cognition. All of the main components of neurons (ion channels, electric synapses, neurotransmitter machinery, etc.) existed long before brains appeared���they were present in our unicellular ancestors. Indeed, evolution long ago (about the time of bacterial biofilms [63]) discovered that bioelectric networks are an ideal medium for scaling computation, coordinating and synthesizing information across distance, and implementing memory and reprogrammability. Developmental bioelectricity [64] is the medium by which non-neural cells form networks to manage morphogenesis in development and regeneration. Pre-neural bioelectric networks in the body underlie large-scale anatomical decision-making and possess instructive pattern memories that guide growth and form [64,65]. It is very likely that this system served as a precursor to neurobiology: prior to electrical networks controlling muscles to move the body through 3D space, these same networks generated signals to control cell behaviors in the body to move the body configuration through anatomical morphospace. Thus, anatomical homeostasis is a goal-seeking capacity of the collective intelligence of cellular swarms comprising living bodies [24].

The excerpt discusses the concept of "Care" as a central invariant in a new interdisciplinary field, binding together biology, artificial intelligence (AI), and Buddhism. The focus is on the capacity of agents to exert energy and effort toward preferred states, emphasizing the role of Care in motivation, stress, and goal-directedness.
The authors propose that understanding intelligence through the lens of Care provides a framework applicable to diverse embodiments, ranging from biological organisms to novel synthetic beings created through bioengineering and AI. They introduce the idea that the commitment to maximizing and scaling outward-facing Care, particularly in relation to other agents' goals, serves as a powerful driver for progress in both synthetic and natural evolution.
The cognitive light cone framework is introduced as a means to understand cognitive boundaries, goal-directedness, and domains of concern in different sentient beings. The size of an agent's goal-directed activity is represented by a cognitive light cone, indicating the range of states that cause stress and prompt the agent to exert effort to bring about change.
The concept of goal-directedness is suggested as a substrate-independent definition of intelligence, allowing for the comparison of diverse intelligences regardless of their composition or origin. The idea is illustrated using examples from bacteria to humans, highlighting the capacity of beings to care about and pursue goals in various problem spaces.
The proposed framework enables a continuous and agnostic analysis of cognitive agents, emphasizing the gradual evolution of cognitive capacities. It underscores the futility of binary categories and aligns with the evolutionary history of cognition, recognizing the importance of bioelectric networks in pre-neural organisms as precursors to neurobiology.
Overall, the excerpt presents a holistic perspective on intelligence, incorporating insights from biology, AI, and Buddhism, with Care as a central concept that unifies these diverse fields.

3. Two Distinct Light Cones: One for Physical States, One for Care

According to the goal-directed model of intelligent agents, any individual agent is then delimited by the spatiotemporal boundary of events that it can seek to measure, model, and affect [23]. This surface sets a functional boundary, or ���light cone��� of its cognitive ability. We have considered the way systems may exchange stress between each other by exchanging signals, which has direct translations into the world of machine learning agents as well as natural agents. Agents may progressively come to reduce their levels of stress and transfer them between each other in more efficient ways, by means of communicating their goals. It may be helpful to clarify the difference between the goal-defined light cone (Figure 2) and a mere behavioral space light cone. While the latter merely defines the space of possible states in which an agent can find itself (defined by its position, speed, temperature, etc.), the light cone we defined above rather characterizes the maximum extent of the goals and aspirations of an agent, or in other words, its capacity for Care. An agent���s Care light cone (CLC) and its corresponding physical light cone (PLC) of behavioral space can be brought together in the same representation (Figure 3). In our representation of light cones, the two diagonal lines represent the two extrema in terms of physical change of the system state, while the horizontal line indicates the present state space. Anything outside of the cones that is located in the future cannot be reached from the present state in the future, nor can anything in the past that lies outside the cones be influencing the present state.

���

Figure 3. An agent���s boundary of Care. Legend: An agent���s Care light cone represented at a given time (CLC, in blue) and the corresponding agent���s physical light cone (PLC, in yellow). The diagram depicts a space where each point corresponds to a state of the agent. The agent cares for a state s, which is achievable, whereas it cares also for a state c, which is not reachable from the here and now (the present state is at the origin of the plot). Points that are outside CLC and PLC are respectively too distant in space or time to have any interaction with the agent, or too distant to be cared for by the agent.

Light cones may be represented in two dimensions as in Figure 3. In our depiction of light cones, both physical states and cared-for states belong to their respective light cones. The diagram symbolically shows a phase space where each point corresponds to a state. Points within the Care light cone (CLC, represented in blue) represent states for which the agent cares at a given point in time���typically the present time in our depiction, but one may picture a time series of such light cones changing in time���rather than the states the agents are physically in. A state may be situated within a Care light cone even if it is too distant in space or time to have any interaction with the agent. Conversely, some states in the physical light cone (PLC, represented in yellow) may be beyond the light cone of Care of the agent, yet remain physically achievable through a certain trajectory. Goals cease to exist as soon as the self (the Care light cone, in blue) is reduced to a point, or, on the contrary, extends infinitely over the whole phase space of possible states (in yellow).

The light cones we consider are clouds of possibilities for agents, meaning that they represent distributions of probabilities of Care and physical states achievable in time and space. We note that the two types of light cones we describe naturally take two different shapes. On the one hand, the physical light cone determines the limited subspace corresponding to an initial state of the world undergoing change in accordance with a set of physical laws, similar to the light cones in the theory of relativity or light cones of information in evolutionary theory [66]. On the other hand, Care light cones need not bear such a limitation since an agent may care about entities that are not within reach in space and time. A light cone does not exist in a vacuum. On the contrary, it corresponds to a given substrate, and is surrounded by other light cones so that it may even overlap or contain other ones. The act of extending a light cone bears some connection with the act of several agents cooperating or acting as a cognitive whole as their Care light cones may start overlapping.

4. Problem Space, Fields of Stress, and Continuity of Cognitive Forms of Life

In this framework, intelligence is the degree of sophistication an agent can muster in navigating some specific problem space. Defined very broadly, problem spaces can be seen as fields that emerge in the gap between current and optimal conditions���or in other words, as fields of stress. The generalization of problem spaces beyond the traditional 3D space of ���behavior��� into other, virtual problem spaces is essential for understanding evolution of basal cognition. Living things first solved problems in metabolic space, and evolution then pivoted the same kinds of strategies to solve problems in physiological, transcriptional, and anatomical space, before speed-optimizing these dynamics to enable rapid behavior in 3D space. Since every cognitive agent is made of parts, it is essential to have a theory about how numerous goal-seeking agents link together into a new, larger cognitive system that is novel and not present in any of the subunits. The multiscale competency architecture of life [24] is such a hypothesis about the scaling of cognition, seeing complex system-level behaviors in any space as the within- and across-level competition and cooperation among the various subunits and partitions of composite agents (i.e., all agents).

This emphasis on the fundamental continuity, kinship, and infinite variety of life and cognition resonates with Buddhist descriptions of continuous cycles of life and death that emerge through infinite causal dependencies and with potential for radical bodily and cognitive transformation [26,67]. Another feature of this vision that aligns well with Buddhist ideas is the lack of a permanent, unique, unitary Self [68]. The picture given by the evolutionary cell-biological perspective is one where a cognitive agent is seen as a self-reinforcing process (the homeostatic loop), not a thing [69,70,71]. Of course, on long time scales, all objects are, consistent with Mah��y��na Buddhist perspectives, just temporary configurations���the distinction between permanent objects and temporary bundles of coherent processes (cf. the Ship of Theseus paradox and N��gasena���s chariot parable as a description of biological beings [72,73]) fades away.

In this society of processes, overlapping goal-seeking partitions are all interacting with each other. Importantly, the boundaries of these Selves not only interpenetrate, but can also change during the agent���s lifetime. Defections from large-scale anatomical goals, such as those that occur due to an inappropriate reduction of gap junctional connectivity [74], present as cancer, cause reversions of cell behavior to ancient unicellular concerns which lead to metastasis and over-proliferation as the cells treat the rest of the body as external environment.

Another key fundamental commonality is the focus on striving. The central treadmill (loop) of life is a homeostatic effort to attain a specific setpoint, despite the buffeting influence of the cruel, dissipative environment. The driver of this loop is stress���the delta between current state and desired state, and all of the system���s efforts are guided by the effort to minimize stress (essentially, unhappiness). Defined in this way, ���stress��� turns out to be a compelling translation of the Sanskrit term du���kha (otherwise often rendered as ���suffering���), which describes a treacherous world inhabited by restlessly craving beings. In this world of stress, existence equals dissatisfaction, and so du���kha is a continuous state that compels beings to act [67]. This stress-focused perspective can be seen as suggesting that the expansion of cognition across eons was basically a process of scaling goals, from humble metabolic needs to single cells to the grandiose goals of ���make and maintain a whole limb��� of tissue- and organ-level cellular collectives. It is fascinating to think about how this expansion of concern scales basic self-preservation goals into outward-facing preferences about complex, large states of the environment and even care for the states of other beings.

One instructive example is what happens in bioelectric networks during multicellularity. Cells join into networks with electrical synapses known as gap junctions. What is special about these is that unlike traditional signaling (by diffusible secreted chemical signals and receptors), information molecules pass through gap junctions directly into the internal milieu of the recipient cell. Once the signal is inside a cell, that cell cannot tell whether this molecule is a memory trace of something that happened to that cell (a true memory engram) or a false memory incepted into its informational structure by a kind of memory transfer from its neighbor. Imagine for example a calcium spike due to an injurious stimulus: calcium has no metadata on it to describe whose signal it is, and once it spreads across a few cells, they become a collective that has information about injury that is distributed across the individuals. In effect, it performs a kind of ���mind meld���, binding subunits into a collective because it becomes very difficult to keep individualization regarding which cell has which information. It is hard to maintain the I-you distinction, and cooperation is massively favored. This is not because the agents have become less selfish, but because the size of the self (to which they are committed) has grown. For properly coupled cells, it is impossible to hide information from each other (from yourself) and it is impossible to do anything injurious to your neighbor because the same effects (consequences) will affect you within seconds. Gap junctions provide an efficient life-transforming dynamic���cause and effect which massively augments cooperative interactions. The eventual result is the scaling up of the cognitive boundary, the processing capacity, the information content and structure, and the goals. An individual cell strives to become two cells. A gap-junction-coupled collective strives to make an organ, being able to represent goal states such as number of fingers which are unfathomable to individual cells. In connecting with others in a strong informational sense [75], the functional non-indifference to one���s own states begins to expand and face outwards, enabling responses to progressively more distant others��� states. Much works remains, to identify policies for informational coupling of subunits that optimize the potentiation of collective intelligence and care. These policies will be as relevant to establishing thriving social structures as to the design of novel general intelligences.

Biology offers many examples of Selves which change on-the-fly���not just during evolutionary time scales, but during the lifetime of the agent. All animals were once a single fertilized egg cell, then became a collection of cells solving problems in anatomical space, and only later developed an emergent centralized Self focused around navigating 3D space of behaviors [76]. Butterflies (and their brains) result from the rapid remodeling of a caterpillar and its very different brain. In addition to these natural examples, recent advances in chimeric and bioengineering technology are enabling an inevitable explosion of diverse forms of life. Hybrots, cyborgs, chimeras, and other combinations of living material, bioengineered components, and software form an astronomically huge option space for possible forms with diverse kinds of bodies and behaviors [1,3,4,33,42,43,45,46,47,77,78,79,80,81]. This requires us to move from the picture of Adam naming a finite set of static animals in the Garden of Eden to frameworks that can handle the full range of life and mind as they can be���all possible sentient beings.

For AI workers, it is important to step back from a neurocentric view of intelligence���life was solving problems long before neurons evolved; thus, a focus on neuromorphic architectures (such as specifically neural-network models) is unnecessarily restrictive. All of the main components of neural systems���ion channels, electrical synapses, neurotransmitter machinery, etc., were present long prior to the appearance of brains [82,83]. Indeed, all cells form bioelectrical networks that process information in morphospace in ways familiar to neurosciences (but on a slower time scale) [64]. The emphasis on natural intelligence as fundamentally arising from goal-directed (homeostatic) loops dovetails with key open problems in AI research, with respect to intrinsic motivation [84,85] and goals: how do goals arise in complex systems? How do we predict and manage the goals of collective intelligences (such as robot swarms), ensuring life-positive engineered systems? Evolution is only part of the story, since synthetic living organisms, such as Xenobots���protoorganisms made of frog skin cells [86,87,88], exhibit coherent anatomical, physiological, and behavioral outcomes that have no backstory of selection forces shaping them. The central concept in this new frontier is Care: what do these systems spend energy to try to achieve���what do they care about? What sets the scope and content of their goals?

A focus on Care has two other important implications for AI. First, it suggests that the ability to recognize, manage, and relate to sentient beings is a key capacity and design challenge for AI. Engineered agents are intelligent in part due to their ability to detect intelligence around them, and our development of tools to help understand intelligence in unconventional media around us should be paralleled by advances to enable AI to do the same. Secondly, it provides one answer to the perennial philosophical problem of how to relate to ���artificial��� beings���a problem which is strongly exacerbated by existing technologies for chimerizing living tissue with engineered replacements. If one���s spouse had a kidney replaced with an engineered organ, does that change anything with respect to the relationship and moral responsibility? Presumably not. How about several organs, and perhaps a part of the brain? All of the brain, as long as the function is preserved? At what point does one go from a ���real person with perhaps some irrelevant mechanical augmentations��� to a ���robot that is just simulating their (perhaps very convincing) social interactions���? It seems clear that such decisions cannot be based on what the putative person is made of or how they came to exist (evolution, embryogenesis, design and factory construction, or some combination of those), and advances in machine learning suggest that they cannot be based on performance in specific problem areas either (IQ tests). What can they be based on? One suggestion is that they can be based on Care. What we should be looking for, in terms of gauging what kind of relationship we can have with, and moral duty we need to exert toward, any being is the degree of Care they can exhibit, either at present or as a latent potential, with respect to the other beings around them.

Existing life forms reveal a continuum of cognitive capacities reaching all the way from our unicellular ancestors to modern advanced animals, and these can be compared based on the shape of their cognitive light cone���the shape and size (in a space-time diagram) of the most grandiose goals toward which they are capable of working (Figure 2). The area inside a system���s cognitive boundaries is the area of Concern���the number and types of things that this system can Care about, in the sense of practical Concern (willing and able to spend energy to monitor and control). There are of course major transitions in evolution [89,90], corresponding to advances in the types of goals a given system can work towards. These have been discussed elsewhere [24]. One really crucial transition is unique, forming what Hofstadter would call a Strange Loop: rather than committing to increasingly more sophisticated goals, one can commit to the meta goal of increasing one���s goals. In Buddhist traditions, this intentional expansion of one���s cognitive boundary (and thus the area of one���s concern) finds expression in what is known as the Bodhisattva vow.

In this section, the concept of distinct light cones for physical states and Care is introduced. The goal-defined light cone characterizes the maximum extent of an agent's goals and aspirations, representing its capacity for Care. The Care light cone (CLC) and physical light cone (PLC) are depicted in a space-time diagram, illustrating states that the agent cares about and states that are physically achievable.
The light cones are presented as clouds of possibilities for agents, representing distributions of probabilities of Care and physical states achievable in time and space. The two types of light cones take different shapes, with the physical light cone limited to a subspace corresponding to an initial state undergoing change according to physical laws. In contrast, the Care light cone may extend beyond spatial and temporal limitations, allowing an agent to care about entities that are not within reach.
The analysis emphasizes the importance of understanding stress transfer and communication of goals between agents, applicable to both natural and artificial agents. The concept of overlapping Care light cones is introduced, indicating cooperative interactions and the potential for agents to act as a cognitive whole.
Moving forward, the text delves into the problem space, fields of stress, and the continuity of cognitive forms of life. Intelligence is defined as the sophistication an agent can muster in navigating specific problem spaces, with problem spaces seen as fields that emerge between current and optimal conditions. The multiscale competency architecture of life is proposed as a hypothesis for understanding the scaling of cognition, highlighting the competition and cooperation among subunits and partitions of composite agents.
The perspective aligns with Buddhist ideas of continuous cycles of life and death, emphasizing the lack of a permanent, unitary self. The evolutionary cell-biological viewpoint sees a cognitive agent as a self-reinforcing process rather than a static entity, with Selves changing dynamically during the agent's lifetime. The expansion of cognition is described as a process of scaling goals, from metabolic needs to complex anatomical and physiological goals.
The text concludes by suggesting that a focus on Care has implications for AI, emphasizing the importance of recognizing, managing, and relating to sentient beings. It also proposes that the degree of Care exhibited by a being can serve as a basis for determining relationships and moral responsibilities. The continuum of cognitive capacities in existing life forms is discussed, and the intentional expansion of one's cognitive boundary is mentioned in the context of the Bodhisattva vow in Buddhist traditions.

How does it compare with my theory? SITH Theory - Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis. The theory that anthills, termite mounds, and beehives are conscious entities.

Here's a summary of the basic tenets of the Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH) model, along with a comparison and contrast with other prominent models of consciousness.

SITH Model:

Collective Consciousness: Consciousness can emerge from complex systems like beehives or termite mounds, not necessarily from individual entities.

Consciousness as a Scale Difference: Consciousness is seen as a spectrum where even simple structures can exhibit control over their environment, with complex beings like humans being further along this spectrum.

Here's a more detailed and academic-sounding description of the Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH) model, including the connections to Michael Levin's polycomputation and intelligence as Care, as well as Monica Anderson's Leaking Chatroom theory:

The Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH) represents an innovative paradigm shift in the study of consciousness, presenting a complex, recursive framework that extends beyond the traditional biological substrates. By asserting that collective systems such as the Internet or factories possess consciousness, while their individual subsystems may not, SITH challenges the conventional organism-centric understanding of consciousness.

Polycomputation and Intelligence as Care (Michael Levin): SITH is inspired by Michael Levin's concepts of polycomputation, which suggest that computation can occur across various substrates and forms, not confined to digital algorithms. Intelligence as Care further posits that cognition and consciousness are not merely data processing but involve an essential caring or goal-oriented aspect. These ideas align with SITH by emphasizing the multifaceted and interconnected nature of consciousness and recognizing it in non-traditional substrates.

Leaking Chatroom Theory (Monica Anderson): Monica Anderson's Leaking Chatroom theory refers to a metaphor for understanding complex systems where information flow and reduction occur in a decentralized and iterative manner. Her definition of understanding as "autonomous epistemic reduction" resonates with the SITH model's recursive approach to consciousness, where the ability to explain consciousness itself becomes a defining feature.

Consciousness as a Continuum: By defining consciousness recursively and recognizing it in collective entities, SITH posits a continuum of consciousness rather than a binary state. This continuum is responsive to complexity, interconnectedness, and the ability to perform autonomous epistemic reduction. Comparison with Traditional Models: Traditional models of consciousness often focus on self-awareness, intentionality, and subjective experience within individual organisms. SITH's expansion of consciousness to non-living, interconnected systems stands in stark contrast, adding new dimensions to the philosophical and scientific discourse on the nature of consciousness.

In conclusion, the Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH) offers a groundbreaking perspective on consciousness, integrating ideas from various disciplines and thinkers. By recognizing consciousness in unexpected places and defining it in a recursive and continuum-based manner, SITH prompts a reevaluation of fundamental concepts and opens new avenues for exploration in cognitive science, philosophy, and artificial intelligence.

"This book is mostly about science ��� what we can observe and know about cells, life, intelligence, emergence, and how superorganisms such as beehives and anthills operate. But it is also about metaphysics, because it deals with mind, being, consciousness, and the nature of self. So it straddles that fuzzy line as it tackles the question of whether there is an actual entity which all of humanity is a part of that I call Agora."

Could humans unknowingly be a part of a larger superorganism���one with its own motivations and goals, one that is alive, and conscious, and has the power to shape the future of our species? In his most recent book, ���We Are Agora,��� Byron looks at superorganisms and considers if humans could also be part of a superorganism. He asks, are we unknowingly parts of the inner workings of a larger being? And, if so what implications does that have for our future? As our cells fail to understand us, are we also unaware of what compels our behavior?

This book, however, is also about metaphysics, dealing with mind, being, consciousness, and the nature of self. It is here Byron asks a number of hugely profound questions relating to the very nature of humanity: 

Are we, each and every one of us, part of a larger living organism? Not metaphorically, but literally? 

Are we cells in a larger creature? What can be observed and known about cells, life, intelligence, emergence, and how superorganisms such as beehives and anthills operate?

Could Agora be a metaphor for how people work together to accomplish what no individual can, or could it be an actual thing, a system, like an automobile, that can function, break, or be destroyed? 

Could it be a living, thinking entity, with a will and purpose, and perhaps even consciousness? 

Could we perceive Agora if we were part of it? Or can we discern its shape by the shadow that it casts? Can an understanding of Agora help us understand why there is poverty or why civilization exists?

In his fifth book, Byron takes readers to places none of his books have gone before, tackling the question of whether an actual entity exists, which all of humanity is a part of.

SITH Theory's Connection to Dissipative Structures and Swarm Behavior:
SITH (Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis) proposes that consciousness can emerge not only in individual entities but also in collective systems like beehives or termite mounds. It introduces the concept of intelligence as a spectrum, ranging from simple structures to complex beings. Here's a more detailed exploration of how SITH connects to dissipative structures, swarm behavior, and the intelligence of cities and countries:
Collective Consciousness:
SITH challenges the traditional view that consciousness is solely tied to individual organisms. It suggests that collective systems, exhibiting swarm behavior and dissipative structures, can also possess a form of consciousness.
Spectrum of Intelligence:
Intelligence, according to SITH, is not limited to high-level entities like humans. It is seen as a spectrum, encompassing various levels of complexity. This aligns with the idea that even simple structures, like those found in dissipative systems, can exhibit a degree of control over their environment.
Polycomputation and Intelligence as Care:
SITH draws inspiration from Michael Levin's polycomputation, which posits that computation can occur across different substrates. Intelligence as Care, as per Levin, emphasizes the goal-oriented aspect of cognition. SITH aligns with these ideas by recognizing intelligence in non-traditional substrates and highlighting the caring or goal-oriented nature of consciousness.
Leaking Chatroom Theory:
Monica Anderson's Leaking Chatroom theory, emphasizing decentralized information flow, resonates with SITH's recursive approach to consciousness. SITH sees consciousness as a continuous, iterative process, much like the ongoing exchange of information in a chatroom.
Consciousness as a Continuum:
SITH introduces the concept of consciousness as a continuum, challenging the binary view of its existence. This continuum is responsive to complexity, interconnectedness, and the ability to perform autonomous epistemic reduction, similar to the dynamics observed in dissipative structures.
Intelligence in Cities and Countries:
Building on the idea of collective consciousness, SITH speculates that cities and countries could be considered intelligent autonomous systems. This stems from the notion that intelligence can act as a default mode network controlling less intelligent processes, either internally or externally.
In summary, SITH provides a framework that extends the understanding of consciousness to collective systems, incorporating insights from dissipative structures, swarm behavior, and the intelligence observed in cities and countries.

A cognitive account of the self emerges in the recent writing of Lev- 
in. Levin���s biogenic approach theorizes the concept of self in func- 
tionalist cognitive terms. Unlike the autopoietic theory, the cognitive 
model of self is deeply rooted in novel empirical fi ndings. Empirical 
fi ndings of unconventional modes of intelligence and the incredible 
19 However, Thompson does not subscribe to this notion of autopoietic bodily self. 
Thompson maintains that ���it seems unlikely that minimal autopoietic selfhood involves 
phenomenal selfhood or subjectivity, in the sense of a pre-ref l ective self-awareness con- 
stitutive of phenomenal fi rst-person perspective��� (Thompson 2007, 162). In his recent 
work Could All Life Be Sentient? (2022) Thompson again raises similar concerns. How- 
ever, the proponents of autopoietic enactivism use terms such as ���point of view��� while 
explaining the concepts of sense-making which distinctly highlights the involvement 
of subjectivity in this process of sense-making (Kee 2021). JoLMAe-ISSN 2723-9640

ability of various non-neural entities to navigate dif f erent morpholog- 
ical problem spaces form the bedrock of the cognitive self. Unconven- 
tional modes of intelligence include forms of bodily intelligence em- 
bedded in somatic cells, such as the memory of muscle cells. Levin 
draws from James��� (1981) test for minimal mentality and elaborates 
on how cells display collective intelligence during the process of mor- 
phogenesis (Levin 2023). He maintains that intelligence is ubiqui- 
tous in biological systems. The classical parameters of intelligence, 
like problem-solving, memory, and decision-making, are not bound 
to the nervous system. These attributes of intelligence are exhibit- 
ed in genes in cells to organs in a biological system, and to non-liv- 
ing entities (Levin 2021). Levin def i nes the self as ���a coherent system 
emerging within a set of integrated parts that serve as the function- 
al owner of associations, memories, and preferences and acts to ac- 
complish goals in specif i c problem spaces where those goals belong 
to the collective and not to any individual components��� (Levin 2022, 
40). He maintains that this def i nition can accommodate dif f erent 
kinds of selves ��� minimal, complex, artif i cial ��� cells, organisms, hu- 
mans, machines, etc. The boundary of the self in this account is mal- 
leable. The self can expand its boundaries and dissipate into smaller 
selves in a biological system. The expansion and dissipation of self 
in the cognitive account sets it apart from autopoietic models, where 
the boundary conditions def i ne the system, and the boundaries are 
not fl exible like that of the cognitive model. 
Further, he proposes that selves can be classif i ed by a spatiotem- 
poral scale and by the type of goals they can pursue. Levin terms this 
notion of self as the ���Cognitive Light Cone Theory of Self���. The light 
cone theory of self advocates for a continuum of selves that ranges 
from simple to complex to artif i cial. Complex selves, like humans, can 
think beyond their present time and space. They transcend their mere 
needs ��� such selves are concerned with climate change and the life 
of stars, etc. In contrast, simple selves, like those of ticks, are con- 
cerned about nothing more than food, and their goals are limited, im- 
mediate, and not complex, like that of the human species. 
The complexity of cognition is also def i ned by the complexity of 
goal-directedness, which in turn def i nes the dif f erent degrees of 
selves. He terms this approach as TAME- Technological Approach to 
Mind Everywhere (Levin 2022). This approach is concerned with rec- 
ognizing minds across the spectrum or studying mind-as-it-can-be.20 
Levin explains three foundational aspects of TAME: fi rst, its com- 
mitment to gradualism. Second, a substrate-independent-function- 
al approach to self and agency; and third, conceiving the mind, the 
self, and the agent as engineering problems. Its radical commitment

Levin's Cognitive Light Cone Theory of Self introduces a novel perspective on the concept of self, grounded in empirical findings and unconventional modes of intelligence. Unlike autopoietic theories, this cognitive model is deeply rooted in functionalist cognitive terms, emphasizing the role of various non-neural entities in navigating different problem spaces.
Key points:
Unconventional Intelligence:
Levin explores unconventional modes of intelligence, including bodily intelligence embedded in somatic cells, such as muscle cells' memory. Intelligence is not confined to the nervous system but is ubiquitous in biological systems, genes, and even non-living entities.
Definition of Self:
The self is defined as a coherent system emerging within integrated parts, functioning as the owner of associations, memories, and preferences. It acts to accomplish goals in specific problem spaces, belonging to the collective rather than individual components.
Malleable Boundaries:
In contrast to autopoietic models, the cognitive model allows for flexible and malleable boundaries of the self. The self can expand its boundaries and dissipate into smaller selves within a biological system.
Cognitive Light Cone Theory:
Levin introduces the Cognitive Light Cone Theory of Self, proposing a continuum of selves ranging from simple to complex to artificial. The theory classifies selves based on spatiotemporal scale and the type of goals they can pursue.
TAME Approach:
Levin presents the TAME (Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere) approach, emphasizing gradualism, a substrate-independent-functional approach to self and agency, and conceiving the mind, the self, and the agent as engineering problems.
Complexity of Cognition:
The complexity of cognition is linked to the complexity of goal-directedness, defining different degrees of selves. Complex selves, like humans, can think beyond their present time and space, addressing complex global concerns.
In summary, Levin's cognitive account of the self integrates empirical findings, unconventional intelligence, and a flexible definition of self, introducing the Cognitive Light Cone Theory and the TAME approach to understand minds across a spectrum.

To unravel the questions of genesis, lowest bound, and the continu- 
um of self in this article, I ventured into the biogenic approach. In 
it, we found two models that present us with two dif f erent answers. 
In the autopoietic model, the genesis of the biological self is traced 
to the genesis of the biological cell. Whereas in the cognitive mod- 
el, the genesis of the self remains ambiguous. The autopoietic mod- 
el���s lowest bound of the self is a single cell, whereas in the cognitive 
model, again, ambiguity prevails. The autopoietic model maintains 
a strong life-self continuum, whereas the cognitive model maintains 
a weak one. [Tab. 2] recapitulates the biogenic positions on these fun- 
damental questions.

Def i ning the self and pondering the genesis, the continuum, and the 
lowest bound of self is a riveting research fi eld. However, def i ning 
the concept of self and scrutinizing the biological processes that give 
rise to the self in dif f erent organisms is an uneasy task. We also fi nd 
incommensurability of selves in the literature. Every approach pro- 
vides dif f erent models to observe the self. 
In this article, I searched for the genesis, the continuum, and the 
lowest bound of self to unearth the varieties of selves available with- 
in the phylogenetic tree and the necessary processes involved in giv- 
ing rise to self, mainly from biogenic and zoogenic approaches. The 
article provides a landscape of various approaches to self and details 
numerous drawbacks of each approach. Drawbacks include anthropo- 
genic approaches being extremely attenuated and zoogenic approach- 
es failing to account for the genesis of the primal self. The biogenic 
autopoietic model is more of a theoretical approach which is yet to 
furnish strong empirical evidence to validate the theory. Moreover,

the cognitive model makes the concept too simplistic and permissive. 
To facilitate the study of the self in BA, we need to furnish a mark/ 
criterion for the primal self. The mark of self must be a robust crite- 
rion backed by empirical evidence and a process or mechanism that 
is unique to biological systems. This criterion will help to distinguish 
the self from the non-self and eliminate the drawbacks of the current 
models. However, such a def i nition must not be too anthropogenic 
or zoogenic, limiting the concept of self only to our species or organ- 
isms with the nervous system. We must steer our quest to discover a 
unif i ed biological theory of self that can capture the evolution of the 
self in the light of novel empirical evidence. The approaches and the 
models classif i ed in the article are a humble attempt to inaugurate a 
new fi eld of study that deals with the evolution of the biological self.

The exploration of the genesis, lowest bound, and continuum of the self presents a captivating research field, with contrasting perspectives from the autopoietic and cognitive models:
Genesis:
Autopoietic model traces the genesis of the biological self along with the cell, while the cognitive model maintains ambiguity regarding the genesis.
Lowest Bound:
Autopoietic model defines the lowest bound of the self as a single cell, whereas the cognitive model leaves this aspect ambiguous.
Self-Life Continuum:
Autopoietic model upholds a strong continuum between self and life, while the cognitive model maintains a weaker continuum.
This article delves into the complexities of defining the self, scrutinizing biological processes across different organisms. Incommensurability of selves is noted in the literature, with each approach offering distinct models. The drawbacks include anthropogenic approaches being attenuated and zoogenic approaches failing to account for the genesis of the primal self.
The biogenic autopoietic model is acknowledged as a theoretical approach requiring stronger empirical evidence. Meanwhile, the cognitive model is criticized for its perceived simplicity and permissiveness. To advance the study of the self, the article suggests the need for a robust criterion for the primal self, backed by empirical evidence and unique to biological systems. This criterion should distinguish the self from the non-self without being overly anthropogenic or zoogenic.
In conclusion, the article advocates for a unified biological theory of self, capturing evolution in light of novel empirical evidence. The presented approaches and models aim to inaugurate a new field of study focused on the evolution of the biological self.

How does it relate to the topics we've discussed?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The article on the biogenic approach to the self, especially with the comparison between the autopoietic and cognitive models, aligns with several themes we've discussed:
Collective Consciousness and SITH Theory:
The exploration of self in the biogenic approach resonates with the idea of collective consciousness discussed in the Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH) theory. Both touch on the concept of self beyond individual entities.
Cognitive Light Cone Theory:
The Cognitive Light Cone Theory of Self, as mentioned in the article, parallels the continuum of selves discussed in the Cognitive Lightcone Theory we previously explored, emphasizing a range from simple to complex to artificial selves.
Intelligence in Non-Neural Entities:
The recognition of intelligence in non-neural entities in the biogenic approach aligns with our discussions on intelligence in dissipative structures like beehives, anthills, and even cities. It expands the notion of consciousness and intelligence beyond traditional boundaries.
Goal-Directedness and Swarm Behavior:
The discussion of goals and the self as a coherent system in the biogenic approach connects with our exploration of dissipative structures maintaining homeostasis through swarm behavior and goal-directedness.
SITH Theory and Other Models:
The article's acknowledgment of incommensurability of selves and the need for a unified biological theory of self echoes the interdisciplinary nature of theories like SITH, which draw from various models and disciplines to redefine our understanding of consciousness.
Overall, the biogenic approach adds depth to our discussions by providing insights into different models of the self, raising questions about genesis, lowest bounds, and the continuum of self, which align with and complement the multidimensional perspectives we've explored.

Abstract
After half a century of cognitive revolution we remain far from agreement about what cognition is and what cognition does. It was once thought that these questions could wait until the data were in. Today there is a mountain of data, but no way of making sense of it. The time for tackling the fundamental issues has arrived. The biogenic approach to cognition is introduced not as a solution but as a means of approaching the issues. The traditional, and still predominant, methodological stance in cognitive inquiry is what I call the anthropogenic approach: assume human cognition as the paradigm and work 'down' to a more general explanatory concept. The biogenic approach, on the other hand, starts with the facts of biology as the basis for theorizing and works 'up' to the human case by asking psychological questions as if they were biological questions. Biogenic explanations of cognition are currently clustered around two main frameworks for understanding biology: self-organizing complex systems and autopoiesis. The paper describes the frameworks and infers from them ten empirical principles--the biogenic 'family traits'--that constitute constraints on biogenic theorizing. Because the anthropogenic approach to cognition is not constrained empirically to the same degree, I argue that the biogenic approach is superior for approaching a general theory of cognition as a natural phenomenon.

The biogenic approach to cognition, as outlined by Pamela Lyon, introduces a different perspective by starting with the facts of biology as the basis for theorizing about cognition. Unlike the anthropogenic approach, which assumes human cognition as the paradigm and works downwards, the biogenic approach works upwards by asking psychological questions as if they were biological questions. This approach is anchored in self-organizing complex systems and autopoiesis frameworks, leading to ten empirical principles or "family traits" that serve as constraints on biogenic theorizing. Lyon argues that the biogenic approach, being more empirically constrained, is superior for developing a general theory of cognition as a natural phenomenon.

I was thinking that intelligence is the collective swarm ensemble of micro-intelligences
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your perspective aligns with the idea that intelligence can be seen as an emergent property arising from the collective interactions of micro-intelligences or individual components. This notion is reminiscent of swarm intelligence, where the collaboration of simple agents leads to complex, adaptive behaviors at a higher level. It resonates with the concept that intelligence is not solely confined to individual entities but can manifest within interconnected and cooperative systems.
