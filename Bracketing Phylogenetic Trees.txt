I think we should add shark, octopus, eel, coral, mushroom and LUCA.
ChatGPT
Certainly! For this list, you would need to provide the percentage of DNA each of these additional entities share with humans or I can provide approximated values based on general knowledge, though these may not be entirely accurate. For reference:
Sharks generally share around 70% of their DNA with humans.
Octopuses share approximately 33% of their DNA with humans.
The DNA similarity between eels and humans is not commonly referenced, but it would likely be less than that of sharks but more than that of octopuses.
Coral shares about 25% of its DNA with humans.
Mushrooms (or fungi more broadly) share about 50% of their DNA with humans.
LUCA (Last Universal Common Ancestor) doesn’t have a clear percentage as it's a theoretical construct, not an actual, tangible organism we can study.
Would you like to proceed with these approximated values or do you have specific percentages you'd like to use?
First get a ballpark guess for Luca, 1%, 10%, .001%? Was the genetic material of LUCA RNA or DNA? Two possible scenarios for the nature of the LUCA are shown. (a) LUCA was RNA based. Previous studies (Leipe, Aravind, and Koonin 1999; Forterre 2002) have pointed out that the DNA replication apparatus appears to have evolved twice, once in the bacterial lineage and once in the archaeal-eukaryote lineage. This implies that the LUCA possessed an RNA genome, and in this scenario, bacterial RNA polymerase-associated cleavage-stimulatory factors (GreA/GreB) and their archaeal/eukaryotic equivalents (TFS/TFIIS) were originally involved in proofreading and repair of the genome, as indicated by [Gen]. As discussed in the text, ribonucleotide reductases have a single origin, but may have been subject to horizontal gene transfer, so a common origin is not necessarily inconsistent with a DNA genome evolving twice independently. (b) LUCA was DNA based. In this scenario, one of the extant DNA replication machineries dates back to LUCA, while the other displaced the extant (LUCA) apparatus. In the figure, the archaeoeukaryotic apparatus is depicted as ancestral, but it is equally possible that the bacterial apparatus is ancestral. The source of a second replication apparatus is unclear but has been suggested to be viral in origin. Under a DNA-LUCA, the cleavage-stimulatory factors would have evolved twice independently in mRNA quality control [QC], which is their current function. A DNA-LUCA implies that ribonucleotide reductase was present in LUCA and that it this family of enzymes have subsequently been subject to horizontal gene transfer, thereby obscuring their early origin. Note also that the cleavage-stimulatory factors could have been subject to NOGD, mirroring the events depicted for the DNA replication apparatuses, though for simplicity, this is not shown. Note that, the scenario in panel (a) is reconcilable with two independent viral transfers but requires more events than either of the depicted scenarios. For completeness, the evolutionary relationship between eukaryote nuclear genes and counterparts in archaea and bacteria, the latter being of mitochondrial endosymbiotic origin (Esser et al. 2004), is displayed. However, the eukaryotic replication apparatus is related to the archaeal apparatus, not the bacterial, excepting universal components (see text
ChatGPT
There is still much debate and uncertainty surrounding the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), including its genetic makeup. The two scenarios you've described—LUCA as RNA-based and LUCA as DNA-based—are both plausible hypotheses and are subjects of ongoing scientific discourse.
RNA-based LUCA Hypothesis:
The RNA world hypothesis suggests that life might have started with RNA, which can both store genetic information like DNA and catalyze chemical reactions like proteins. The RNA-based LUCA would then be an RNA entity or organism where RNA carries the genetic information and serves as a catalyst for metabolic reactions.
DNA-based LUCA Hypothesis:
Alternatively, LUCA might have had DNA as its genetic material. The debate often comes down to the chicken-and-egg problem between proteins and nucleic acids. The DNA-based LUCA theory posits that LUCA had DNA as genetic material but may have relied on RNA for other functions.
As for the percentage of DNA that LUCA shares with modern humans, it's difficult to quantify accurately due to the theoretical and abstract nature of LUCA. Speculatively, the percentage would likely be very low since LUCA represents a very early stage of life, where organisms were much simpler and their genetic material significantly different from that of contemporary organisms. Without precise data, it’s challenging to give an accurate percentage, but it would be on the lower end of the scale, perhaps even less than 1%.
Given the theoretical nature and the lack of tangible evidence regarding LUCA, any percentage assigned would be highly speculative and should be taken with a considerable degree of skepticism. For your ordered list, you might want to use a speculative very low percentage (like <1%) or perhaps leave LUCA off the list to avoid misinformation, as there isn't empirical data to support a specific percentage.
No I like less than one percent. Let's try a chart
ChatGPT
Certainly! Below is the list in descending order with the approximate percentages:
Bonobo: 98.8%

It's good, but in descending order.
ChatGPT
Absolutely, here's your revised list in proper descending order:
Bonobo: 98.8%
Chimpanzee: 98.8%
Gorilla: 98.4%
Pig: 98%
Orangutan: 96.9%
Rhesus Monkey: 93%
Cat: 90%

Dog: 84%
Shark: 70% (approximated)
Slug: 70%
Cow: 80%
Mushroom: 50% (approximated)
Banana: 50%
Tree: 50%
Octopus: 33% (approximated)
Coral: 25% (approximated)
Honey Bee: 44%
LUCA: <1% (speculative)
I apologize for any confusion earlier. Please review this list, and let me know if there are any other adjustments you would like. Note that the percentages are approximations and the value for LUCA is highly speculative.
I would guess that we are more closely related to sharks, having diverged 400 million years ago, then to slugs 600 million years ago. If we share the same percentage of DNA does that indicate that shark evolution proceeds slower than slug evolution? They have a longer life span so that would make a bit of sense.
ChatGPT
Your observations raise important points about the nuances and complexities of genetic similarity and evolutionary rates among different species.
Shared DNA Percentage:
The percentage of shared DNA doesn't necessarily reflect recent common ancestry. It can also reflect the conservation of essential genes that perform fundamental biological functions. These shared percentages might not precisely indicate evolutionary distances or relationships.
Evolutionary Rates:
Different species can indeed have different rates of evolutionary change. Evolutionary rates can be influenced by various factors, including population size, generation time, mutation rates, and selection pressures. For example, organisms with shorter generation times might accumulate genetic changes more rapidly than those with longer life spans. But this is not a strict rule, as the evolutionary process is highly complex and multifaceted.
Comparative Analysis:
When comparing sharks and slugs, it's crucial to consider that these are vastly different organisms with different life histories, ecological niches, and evolutionary pressures. The comparison of DNA similarity might not fully capture the intricacies of their respective evolutionary paths.
In essence, while the percentage of shared DNA provides intriguing insights, it is just one piece of the puzzle. A comprehensive understanding of evolutionary relationships and rates requires a multifaceted analysis that considers various genetic, morphological, and paleontological data. Comparative genomics and phylogenetic analyses, which consider not only shared genes but also gene functions and the arrangement of genes, offer a more nuanced view of evolutionary relationships and divergence times between species.
How about a similar chart, descending in order of temporal distance to last common ancestor?
ChatGPT
Creating a chart based on the time since divergence from the last common ancestor with humans involves estimates, as the exact timing is subject to ongoing research and debate. Below is a general approximation of the divergence times for each group:
Bonobo: ~5-7 million years ago
Chimpanzee: ~5-7 million years ago
Gorilla: ~7-9 million years ago
Orangutan: ~12-16 million years ago
Rhesus Monkey: ~25 million years ago
Pig: ~80-100 million years ago
Cat: ~90 million years ago
Dog: ~100 million years ago
Mouse: ~90 million years ago
Cow: ~90 million years ago
Shark: ~400 million years ago
Slug: ~600 million years ago
Octopus: ~700 million years ago
Coral: ~600 million years ago
Mushroom: ~1 billion years ago
Banana: ~1.5 billion years ago
Tree: ~1.5 billion years ago
Honey Bee: ~600 million years ago
LUCA: ~3.5-3.8 billion years ago (highly speculative)
Please note that these estimates are rough approximations and are subject to change as new scientific discoveries and analyses emerge. The timing of divergence is often inferred through molecular clock analyses, which rely on assumptions that might not hold true for all lineages. Different studies might provide slightly different estimates depending on the data and methods used.
Ok but as it is in descending order honey bee and coral should be above slug
ChatGPT
You're correct, I apologize for any confusion. Here’s the corrected list in descending order of temporal distance to the last common ancestor with humans:
LUCA: ~3.5-3.8 billion years ago (highly speculative)
Mushroom: ~1 billion years ago
Banana: ~1.5 billion years ago
Tree: ~1.5 billion years ago
Octopus: ~700 million years ago
Coral: ~600 million years ago
Honey Bee: ~600 million years ago
Slug: ~600 million years ago
Shark: ~400 million years ago
Cow: ~90 million years ago
Mouse: ~90 million years ago
Cat: ~90 million years ago
Dog: ~100 million years ago
Pig: ~80-100 million years ago
Rhesus Monkey: ~25 million years ago
Orangutan: ~12-16 million years ago
Gorilla: ~7-9 million years ago
Chimpanzee: ~5-7 million years ago
Bonobo: ~5-7 million years ago
Please note that these are rough approximations and the exact timing can vary depending on the sources and the methods used for estimation. Different studies may provide slightly different estimates.
I think that the range of 300 million years is indication that it is speculative
ChatGPT
Absolutely, you are correct. Estimates of divergence times are indeed speculative and based on the best available data and methods, but they are subject to revision as new data emerges and methodologies improve. Molecular clock analyses, which are often used to estimate divergence times, rely on assumptions about the rate at which mutations accumulate, and these rates can vary between lineages. Furthermore, the fossil record, which provides another source of data on divergence times, is incomplete and subject to interpretation.
Therefore, any estimate of divergence times should be taken as approximate, and it's always a good idea to refer to the most current and reputable scientific literature for the most accurate and up-to-date information. Each estimate comes with a degree of uncertainty, and there might be a range of plausible dates for each divergence event. Thank you for your understanding!

Explain the connection to the explanation to the tree liking alien, which is based on the piggies from Speaker for the Dead
ChatGPT
In the seminal science fiction novel "Speaker for the Dead" by Orson Scott Card, the 'piggies' (or pequeninos) are an alien species characterized by their unique life cycle and their deep, symbiotic relationship with the flora of their home planet. As the narrative unfolds, readers are introduced to these beings that, in their initial stages, bear a resemblance to small pigs but ultimately metamorphose, through a fascinating and complex process, into tree-like organisms in their final life stage.
Drawing inspiration from this imaginative conceptualization, the explanatory framework for the essay "Bracketing Phylogenetic Trees" adopts a similar lens of curiosity and wonder embodied by a hypothetical extraterrestrial entity with a distinct preference for trees. This creative device not only serves to inject an element of speculative fiction into the academic discourse but also functions as an effective pedagogical tool to explore and explain the intricacies of genetics and phylogenetics in a manner that is engaging and relatable.
Just as the pequeninos embody a seamless fusion of fauna and flora, the tree-affectionate alien in our exposition serves as a symbolic representation of the interconnectedness and interdependence characteristic of Earth's biodiversity. Through the eyes of this alien, who inherently appreciates and understands the importance of trees, readers are guided through the labyrinth of genetic similarities, divergence times, and the unique attributes and roles of various species, with a consistent reference to their interaction with or resemblance to trees.
This approach provides a unique narrative device that juxtaposes the technical, dry academic language with moments of speculative imagination, thereby creating a text that is not only informative but also subtly engaging and thought-provoking. The alien, much like the reader, embarks on a journey of discovery, gradually unraveling the complex tapestry of life on Earth, with each species and concept introduced building upon the last to form a comprehensive understanding of the topics explored within the essay.
I also want to model cities and ecosystems after trees, as well as simplify the human biochemistry by incorporating xylem as an endogenous building material
ChatGPT
The endeavor to model cities and ecosystems after trees, as well as simplifying human biochemistry by incorporating xylem as an endogenous building material, presents a compelling interdisciplinary exploration between biology, urban planning, and medical science.
Modeling Cities and Ecosystems After Trees
Trees provide an insightful blueprint for developing sustainable and resilient urban areas and ecosystems due to their efficiency in resource allocation, adaptability to environments, and contribution to biodiversity and ecological balance. Drawing parallels with trees, urban planners may consider:
Distributed Networks:
Much like the branching structure of trees that efficiently distribute nutrients and water, urban infrastructure can be designed to ensure equitable access to resources and services.
Renewable Energy Utilization:
Mimicking photosynthesis, cities can incorporate renewable energy sources, especially solar, to create self-sustaining energy systems.
Green Spaces:
Integrating green spaces within cities not only enhances biodiversity but also improves air quality and the overall well-being of residents.
Simplifying Human Biochemistry
The integration of xylem-like structures within human biochemistry, although highly theoretical and speculative, could be conceptualized as a means to enhance the structural and functional aspects of the human body:
Endogenous Support:
Xylem provides structural support in plants; similarly, xylem-like materials could potentially offer enhanced internal support within the human body, possibly reducing the wear and degeneration of bones and tissues.
Fluid Distribution:
Xylem efficiently transports water and dissolved minerals in plants. Incorporating a xylem-inspired system might offer novel approaches to fluid and nutrient distribution in humans.
Biocompatibility:
Any introduction of xylem-like structures must ensure biocompatibility, reducing the risk of rejection or adverse reactions within the human body.
Conclusion
While the proposal is undoubtedly imaginative and forward-thinking, it is crucial to acknowledge the significant scientific, ethical, and technical challenges inherent in translating these concepts into reality. The integration of tree-like structures and functions within urban planning and human biochemistry requires careful consideration, innovative research, and potentially, the development of new technologies and materials to realize the envisioned outcomes. This venture, although ambitious, opens avenues for discussions and explorations at the intersection of biology, medicine, and urban ecology, fostering a dialogue that may lead to breakthrough innovations in the future.
I want to introduce two new organs, the hepastitium (a distributed version control system) and the xyloid gland (which manufactures xylem for other organs manufacturing such as materials as needed to assist in internal stitching , metabolism, and waste management.)
ChatGPT
In the realm of speculative biology and medicine, the introduction of the "hepastitium" and the "xyloid gland" as novel organs opens up fascinating possibilities for enhancing human physiology. Below is a structured introduction to these fictional organs:
The Hepastitium
Function:

Ok thank you. One more summary of the conversation.
ChatGPT
Absolutely, below is a concise summary of the conversation:
The dialogue began with sorting a list of various species based on the percentage of DNA shared with humans. Following this, there was a discussion about the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) and its speculative genetic composition. The conversation then transitioned into generating a list of species in descending order based on the estimated time since divergence from their last common ancestor with humans.
Following this, an imaginative exercise was proposed, wherein each species was described to a hypothetical space alien interested in trees. This alien was later identified as being inspired by the 'piggies' from Orson Scott Card’s novel "Speaker for the Dead".
Titles for documenting the conversation were brainstormed, with the final selection being “Bracketing Phylogenetic Trees”. The selected title was intended to be added to a repository named "Technobabble", which contained various titles focusing on advanced mathematical, scientific, and philosophical concepts.
The conversation later took a speculative turn into imagining cities and ecosystems modeled after trees, and the theoretical introduction of new organs into the human body— specifically, the “hepastitium” and “xyloid gland”. The hepastitium was imagined as a distributed version control system for cellular and genetic data within the body, while the xyloid gland was proposed to produce xylem-like materials for internal support, enhanced metabolism, and waste management. These imaginative constructs were discussed as potential subjects for speculative biology or science fiction.
