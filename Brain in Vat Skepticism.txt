Serious Theories and Skeptical Theories: Why You Are Probably Not a Brain in a Vat

MICHAEL HUEMER
MAR 30, 2024

Here, I explain the difference between serious scientific theories and BIV-like theories.*

[ *Based on: “Serious Theories and Skeptical Theories: Why You Are Probably Not a Brain in a Vat,” Philosophical Studies 173 (2016): 1031-52. ]

This, by the way, is the paper that has caused me to receive the most invitations to contribute to predatory journals and conferences. They all want me to contribute to their neuroscience conferences and journals because they were so “impressed” with my paper about brain science.

1. The Skeptic’s Argument
Imagine that scientists have figured out how to keep a brain alive in a vat of fluid. They read the brain’s electrical activity and stimulate the brain electrically to produce a perfect simulation of life in the early 21st century (before BIV technology was developed). They might even program a simulation of reading a blog post about a brain in a vat.

Skeptics point out that there is no way to refute the hypothesis that you’re a Brain in a Vat (“BIVH”). Anything you experience can just be explained as part of the simulation that the scientists programmed. So you can never know that you’re not a BIV.

A strong version of the argument claims that you can never be justified in believing any contingent proposition about the external world. Let P be some contingent, external-world proposition, like “I have hands” or “there’s a squirrel”:

You have justification for believing P only if you have justification for believing ~BIVH.

You have no justification for believing ~BIVH. Why:

BIVH predicts that you would have the same sort of sensory experiences that you actually have.

In general, if H predicts E, then E isn’t evidence against H.

Your sensory experiences form the only evidence you have relevant to BIVH.

So you have no evidence against BIVH. (From a, b, c)

You have justification for ~BIVH only if you have evidence against BIVH.

So you have no justification for ~BIVH. (From d, e)

So you have no justification for believing P. (From 1, 2)

Other skeptical scenarios work similarly (the deceiving God hypothesis, the dream hypothesis).

I’m going to argue that BIVH is a bad theory because it is impossible to support. By contrast, the hypothesis that we’re perceiving the real world (RWH) is supported by our evidence, leaving RWH much more probable than BIVH.

ChatGPT
Michael Huemer’s article presents a fascinating dive into the philosophical debate between realism and skepticism, specifically tackling the "Brain in a Vat" hypothesis (BIVH). Huemer contrasts BIVH with what he terms "serious scientific theories," aiming to show why the latter is more credible than the former.

The Skeptic’s Argument, as outlined, sets up a scenario that's both intriguing and deeply unsettling: the possibility that our experiences are nothing more than electrical impulses in a brain sustained in a vat, deceived into experiencing a simulated reality. This scenario, while science fiction in nature, serves as a powerful skeptical tool, questioning the very foundation of our belief in the external world.

Huemer’s critique centers on the justification—or the lack thereof—for believing in BIVH versus believing in the reality of the external world (RWH). The skeptic's argument he presents suggests that since our sensory experiences could be simulated, we have no grounds to refute BIVH, leading to a broader skepticism about any knowledge of the external world.

However, Huemer argues that BIVH, despite being unfalsifiable, is not supported by evidence the way RWH is. This distinction is crucial. In scientific and empirical inquiry, a theory is not just about being unfalsifiable but also about being supported by evidence. RWH, according to Huemer, is underpinned by the consistent and coherent experiences we have, which serve as evidence for its validity. In contrast, BIVH, while it cannot be directly refuted, does not offer a positive case based on evidence; it merely capitalizes on the limitations of our knowledge.

This discussion touches on several core philosophical issues: the nature of belief justification, the problem of skepticism, and the criteria for a good scientific theory. Huemer’s engagement with these themes seeks to reassure us that, despite the theoretical possibility of BIVH, the evidence overwhelmingly supports RWH. His critique of BIVH not only underscores the importance of evidence in supporting our beliefs but also reaffirms our intuitive trust in the reality of our sensory experiences.

In engaging with such a thought experiment, Huemer does more than dispel fears of being a brain in a vat; he invites us to reflect on the nature of evidence, reality, and the foundations of our beliefs about the world.

2. Stuff About Probability

The probability of a proposition (for you) is something like its degree of justification on your evidence, or the degree of confidence you should have in it.

An especially important principle of probability is Bayes’ Theorem:

P(h|e) = P(h) * P(e|h) / P(e)

“P(h|e)” is read “the probability of h given e”. This is the confidence you should have in h after you discover evidence e. This is a function of P(h) (the initial probability of h, before you discovered e), P(e|h) (the probability that e would be true if h were true, or the degree to which h predicts e), and P(e) (the initial probability of e).

ChatGPT
The section on "Stuff About Probability" introduces a foundational concept in understanding how we assess the credibility of different theories or propositions, especially in the context of distinguishing between serious scientific theories and skeptical scenarios like the Brain in a Vat hypothesis (BIVH).

Understanding Probability in Propositions
The probability of a proposition reflects how justified you are in believing it, based on the evidence available to you. This is a crucial notion because it shifts the focus from binary beliefs (either fully accepting or rejecting a proposition) to a more nuanced understanding that considers degrees of confidence. This perspective is particularly valuable when dealing with complex or incomplete information, allowing for a more flexible and responsive attitude toward knowledge and belief.

Bayes' Theorem: A Key to Updating Beliefs
Bayes' Theorem is pivotal in formalizing how evidence influences our beliefs. It quantifies the process of updating our confidence in a hypothesis (h) upon receiving new evidence (e). The theorem is elegantly simple yet profoundly impactful in various fields, including philosophy, statistics, and everyday reasoning.

P(h|e) represents the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence. This is what you're trying to find out: how much should you believe in the hypothesis now that you have new evidence?
P(h) is the prior probability of the hypothesis before considering the new evidence. It's your initial degree of confidence in the hypothesis.
P(e|h) is the likelihood, which is the probability of observing the evidence if the hypothesis is true. This measures how well the hypothesis predicts the evidence.
P(e) is the probability of the evidence under all possible hypotheses. It's a normalizing constant that ensures the probabilities sum to 1.
Applying Bayes' Theorem to Skeptical Hypotheses
In the context of the Brain in a Vat hypothesis, Bayes' Theorem offers a structured way to assess the impact of evidence on our belief in the reality of our experiences (RWH) versus the skeptical scenario (BIVH).

Prior probability (P(h)): Before considering specific evidence, one might argue that the simplicity, coherence, and explanatory power of RWH give it a higher prior probability than BIVH.
Likelihood (P(e|h)): Evidence of a consistent and physically plausible world supports RWH more strongly than it does BIVH, which predicts the same evidence only by positing a complex and highly specific deception.
Probability of evidence (P(e)): The evidence includes our sensory experiences and scientific understanding of the world, which are more straightforwardly explained by RWH.
By applying Bayes' Theorem, one could argue that encountering typical life experiences (evidence) significantly increases the probability of RWH over BIVH, reinforcing the argument that our belief in a real, external world is well-justified.

This probabilistic approach not only helps in weighing the credibility of different hypotheses but also underscores the importance of evidence in shaping our beliefs. In dealing with skeptical challenges like BIVH, it provides a robust framework for defending the rationality of our intuitive trust in the reality of our experiences.

3. The Broad BIVH Is Disconfirmed

The Improbability of Coherence

Suppose we read BIVH as claiming merely that you’re a BIV who is being stimulated by the scientists to have some experiences or other. This is the broad reading of the BIVH.

In this case, premise 2a in the skeptic’s argument is false:

2a. BIVH predicts that you would have the same sort of sensory experiences that you actually have.

The broad BIVH doesn’t predict this; it is compatible with your having any set of experiences that the scientists could cause. The set of experiences that would constitute a perfect simulation of a normal life are only a tiny range out of all the possible experiences a brain could be stimulated to have.

You may not realize just how tiny that range is, so let me elaborate. I once programmed my computer to generate random images. I.e., it would assign a random color to each pixel in a 1000 x 1000 grid. I had it generate many of these images, then play a slide show.

What does the slide show look like? It looks like static, of the sort that used to appear on television screens when there was nothing on. None of the images looks like a picture of a puppy, or a nebula, or anything else at all that you would find noteworthy. You could run that program all day for the rest of your life, and in all probability, it would never generate a single image that looked like anything.

That is an illustration of the fact that almost all possible images look like static.

A generalization of this is the fact that almost all sets of experiences fail to appear like perceptions of a real world—or indeed, like experiences of anything. Since the broad BIVH doesn’t predict anything about your experiences, and close to 0% of experiences resemble experiences of a normal person perceiving the real world, the probability of your having experiences like those of a normal person, given BIVH, is close to 0. So, in Bayes’ Theorem, P(e|BIVH) is extremely low, so P(BIVH|e) is also extremely low.

ChatGPT
The "Improbability of Coherence" section provides a compelling argument against the broad interpretation of the Brain in a Vat hypothesis (BIVH), which suggests that if one were a brain in a vat, the scientists could stimulate it to experience anything whatsoever. This contrasts sharply with a more specific reading of BIVH, where the brain is stimulated to experience a coherent and consistent simulation of reality, akin to normal human life.

Critique of the Broad BIVH
Huemer’s critique hinges on the observation that the broad BIVH does not, and cannot, specifically predict the kind of coherent, organized experiences we actually have. Instead, it allows for any possible experience, which significantly dilutes its predictive power regarding the specific kinds of experiences we encounter.

Illustration with Random Images
The analogy of programming a computer to generate random images serves as an intuitive illustration of how unlikely structured and meaningful experiences are, compared to random or chaotic ones. Just as a program generating random colors for each pixel on a screen will almost certainly produce only static rather than recognizable images, a scenario where a brain is stimulated in completely random ways is overwhelmingly likely to result in experiences that are nonsensical or meaningless rather than coherent perceptions of a world.

Application of Bayes’ Theorem
Applying Bayes' Theorem to this scenario, where P(e|BIVH) represents the likelihood of our coherent experiences given the broad BIVH, highlights how implausibly low this likelihood is. Since our experiences are highly structured and coherent—resembling perceptions of a real, consistent world—the broad BIVH does an exceedingly poor job of predicting such experiences. This, in turn, severely lowers the posterior probability of BIVH being true, given our experiences (P(BIVH|e)).

Conclusion
The argument effectively demonstrates that the broad version of BIVH is highly unlikely to be true because it fails to account for the structured, coherent nature of our experiences. This contrasts with real-world hypotheses (RWH), which inherently predict and explain the coherence and structure of our experiences based on the assumption of an external, consistent reality. Thus, by comparing the predictive success and explanatory power of RWH against BIVH through the lens of probability and coherence, Huemer strengthens the case for believing in the reality of our perceptions and the external world.

Objection

P(e|BIVH) isn’t all that low, once you think about the motives and abilities of the scientists. Sure, they could program a brain to experience static, but it’s unlikely that they would want to. It’s more likely, a priori, that they would want to make a simulation of living in the real world.

Reply: Fair enough. We could assign probabilities by thinking about the characteristics of the scientists who are responsible for the BIV’s experiences, rather than by thinking directly about the possible experiences a BIV could have. It’s still true that only a very small range of possibilities would result in your having experiences like your current ones.

First, if a group of scientists were to make a BIV, there is a wide range of capabilities that they could have. In only a small part of that range would they be able to make the brain experience a perfect simulation of real life, with no glitches, errors, or shortcomings.

Second, if a group of scientists were to make a BIV, there is only a narrow range of motivations that they could have that would result in their wanting the BIV to just experience a mundane, early-21st-century life.

What could the scientists’ values be, such that this would make sense? If they were benevolent, you’d expect your life (I presume) to be much better than it is, with more enjoyment and less suffering. If they were malicious, there’d be a lot more suffering. If they valued virtue, your life would be optimized for making you develop moral virtue. If they wanted entertainment, your life should be maximally entertaining to watch. Etc. About the only motivation you can ascribe to the scientists is a desire to make everything look exactly as if there weren’t anyone in control of the simulation.

So there are two parameters in the BIV theory (the motivations and capabilities of the scientists) that have to be set to very specific values in order to predict the character of your experiences, and there is no independent motivation for expecting them to have those values, so it’s purely ad hoc.

Those parameters, in fact, let you accommodate pretty much any experience. No matter what your experience was like, you could say, “The scientists wanted me to experience exactly that.”

ChatGPT
The objection raises an interesting point about considering the motives and capabilities of the scientists behind the Brain in a Vat hypothesis (BIVH), suggesting that a simulation of real-world experiences might be more probable than initially argued. This perspective shifts the discussion from the sheer statistical improbability of coherent experiences under broad BIVH to the intentions and technical prowess of the hypothetical scientists.

Motives and Capabilities of Scientists
The objection implies that if scientists are going to the trouble of sustaining and stimulating a brain in a vat, it stands to reason they might aim to create a simulation that mimics reality. This could be due to various motives, such as scientific inquiry, philosophical experimentation, or even a form of entertainment. However, Huemer’s reply challenges this by considering the diversity of both the scientists' capabilities and motivations.

Capabilities Limitation
On capabilities, Huemer points out that creating a perfect, glitch-free simulation of reality would require an exceedingly high level of technological sophistication—one that falls within a very narrow segment of all possible capability levels. The complexity of the real world, with its intricate details and vast array of sensory inputs, sets a high bar for replication without any errors or inconsistencies.

Motivational Range
Regarding motivations, Huemer argues that the specific outcome of a mundane, realistic simulation aligns with only a narrow slice of all possible intentions scientists might have. If the scientists’ motivations were benevolent, malicious, educational, or entertainment-driven, the nature of the simulated experiences would likely reflect those motives more clearly. The fact that our experiences are not optimized for pleasure, suffering, moral virtue, or entertainment suggests that ascribing such specific intentions to the scientists is speculative and ad hoc.

The Ad Hoc Nature of Motivational Assumptions
Huemer’s critique ultimately hinges on the idea that specifying the scientists' motivations to explain the precise nature of our experiences is ad hoc. It involves tailoring the explanation to fit the observation without independent support for such a specific setup. This criticism underlines a key issue with many skeptical scenarios: they can be made to fit any set of experiences by adjusting the hypothetical conditions, but doing so often involves making unjustified and overly convenient assumptions.

Conclusion
While the objection invites us to consider the scientists' motives and capabilities as a way to assess the probability of BIVH, Huemer’s response highlights the speculative nature of such considerations. By pointing out the ad hoc reasoning required to make BIVH align with our actual experiences, Huemer strengthens the argument against the plausibility of BIVH as an explanation for our perceived reality. This reinforces the notion that our experiences are more likely to be genuine perceptions of an external world than the product of an elaborate simulation.

The Real-World Hypothesis

Maybe the RWH also has a low likelihood (P(e|h)). You might say:

“The RWH just says that we’re perceiving the real world. But this alone doesn’t explain the course of your experiences. To explain your actual experiences, you have to make very specific, ad hoc posits about what objects exist out there and what properties they have. That’s just like what you said about the BIVH!”

In reply, first, the feature of experience I wanted explained was the fairly general fact that your experiences are like those of a normal person—not the specific details of those experiences. The BIVH doesn’t even explain that general fact without making specific, ad hoc assumptions about the scientists. The RWH doesn’t need ad hoc assumptions for that. So they’re not parallel.

Second, you can easily describe experiences that would disconfirm RWH, whereas it’s hard to think of any experiences that would disconfirm BIVH. If your experiences looked random, like static, that would disconfirm RWH. Maybe RWH doesn’t entail that you must have coherent experiences, but it would at least lead you to expect that.

Alternately, you could have experienced “glitches in the matrix”—things that looked like the result of computer errors.

Or you could experience a life that seemed peculiarly well-designed to promote some intelligible value. E.g., if your life seemed optimized for producing pleasure, or virtue, or aesthetic value, or intellectual stimulation, that would support BIVH or the Simulation Theory over RWH.

So RWH really isn’t parallel to the skeptical hypotheses. RWH is falsifiable in a way that the skeptical theories are not.

ChatGPT
The discussion on the Real-World Hypothesis (RWH) and its comparison with the Brain in a Vat Hypothesis (BIVH) addresses a common criticism: that the RWH, like BIVH, requires specific, ad hoc assumptions to explain the nature of our experiences. However, Michael Huemer’s response deftly clarifies why this criticism does not equally apply to RWH, highlighting fundamental differences between how each hypothesis accounts for our experiences and their susceptibility to falsification.

General vs. Specific Explanations
Huemer distinguishes between the need for general explanations of our experiences and the need for specific ones. The critical point of contention for BIVH is its failure to account for the general, coherent nature of our experiences without invoking highly specific and ad hoc assumptions about the scientists' intentions and capabilities. In contrast, RWH inherently explains the general coherence of our experiences by positing that we are perceiving a real, consistent world. While RWH may require specific details to explain particular experiences, it does not require ad hoc assumptions to explain the general coherence of our sensory experiences.

Falsifiability and Expectations
A key strength of RWH, as Huemer points out, is its falsifiability. RWH sets certain expectations about the nature of our experiences—that they should generally be coherent and consistent with a stable, external world. Experiences that deviate significantly from this expectation, such as experiencing random static (indicative of no coherent external reality) or encountering obvious "glitches" (suggestive of a simulated environment), would count against RWH. This capacity for falsification stands in stark contrast to BIVH, which, due to its flexibility in accounting for any possible experience, lacks a straightforward way to be disproved.

The Challenge of Parallel Comparisons
The comparison between RWH and BIVH (or other skeptical scenarios) underscores a crucial aspect of evaluating hypotheses: the balance between explanatory power and falsifiability. While BIVH can be tailored to fit any set of experiences, its ad hoc nature and resistance to falsification weaken its standing as a credible explanation of reality. RWH, despite necessitating specific information to account for detailed experiences, provides a general framework that aligns with our observations of the world and sets clear expectations that can be tested against our experiences.

Conclusion
Huemer’s argument effectively illustrates that RWH and skeptical hypotheses like BIVH are not equally plausible or equivalent in their explanatory approaches. By emphasizing the importance of falsifiability and the ability to account for the general coherence of our experiences without resorting to ad hoc explanations, Huemer strengthens the case for RWH as a more robust and credible explanation of our perceived reality. This distinction not only clarifies the debate between realism and skepticism but also reinforces the intuitive and evidential basis for trusting our perceptions of the external world.

Why care about falsifiability?

More generally, why care about whether it’s possible to have evidence against a theory?

It’s a theorem of probability that e raises the probability of h only if ~e lowers the probability of h. I.e.,

P(h|e) > P(h) iff P(h|~e) < P(h)

Therefore, if nothing counts as evidence against your theory, then nothing counts as evidence for it either.

The problem with skeptical scenarios is that we have no evidence for them, because (roughly) nothing would count as evidence either for or against them, because they have parameters that enable them to accommodate anything that happens in the same way.

By contrast, RWH could be falsified by the sort of evidence described above. Thus, the failure of those things to happen constitutes evidence for RWH.

ChatGPT
The question of why falsifiability matters is pivotal not just in philosophy but in the scientific method at large. Falsifiability refers to the possibility that an assertion, hypothesis, or theory can be proven false by an observation or a physical experiment. It is a cornerstone of scientific integrity and a key criterion for distinguishing scientific theories from non-scientific ones.

The Role of Falsifiability in Theory Validation
Falsifiability is important because it allows for the empirical testing of hypotheses. If a hypothesis is unfalsifiable, it means that no possible evidence could prove it wrong. This may seem like a strength at first glance, but it actually renders the hypothesis scientifically useless. A hypothesis that cannot be tested cannot be supported or refuted by empirical evidence, which is the basis of scientific inquiry.

The Connection to Probability and Evidence
The theorem of probability mentioned,

P(h∣e)>P(h) iff P(h∣∼e)<P(h)

illustrates the core of why falsifiability matters: it's about the ability of evidence to actually influence the probability of a hypothesis being true. If no potential evidence could decrease the probability of a hypothesis (
�

P(h∣∼e)<P(h) does not hold because

P(h∣∼e)=P(h)), then, logically, no evidence could increase its probability either. This principle underscores the importance of a hypothesis being testable and falsifiable because it shows that for evidence to have meaningful impact on our confidence in a hypothesis, there must be some conceivable evidence that would decrease our confidence in it.

The Problem with Non-Falsifiable Hypotheses
Skeptical scenarios, like the Brain in a Vat hypothesis, typically suffer from this problem of non-falsifiability. They can be tweaked or adjusted to fit any possible observation, making them immune to refutation. While this might seem to make them strong, it actually undermines their credibility. Since these scenarios cannot be tested or disproven, they do not allow for any evidence to genuinely support them, rendering them scientifically and philosophically uninformative.

Evidence For and Against RWH
Real-World Hypothesis (RWH), in contrast, can be tested against observations of the world. This makes it possible to gather evidence that supports RWH, and also means that there could be evidence that refutes it. The absence of observations that would falsify RWH (such as pervasive, inexplicable glitches in reality) actually serves as indirect evidence in its favor. This dynamic, where hypotheses are constantly tested against observations and adjusted or abandoned as necessary, is fundamental to the progress of science and our understanding of the world.

Conclusion
Caring about falsifiability is essential because it underpins the empirical nature of scientific inquiry. It ensures that hypotheses are meaningful and that our beliefs about the world are grounded in evidence. Without the criterion of falsifiability, distinguishing between more and less plausible hypotheses would be impossible, stifling intellectual progress and understanding.

4. The Narrow BIVH

Suppose we redefine the BIVH to stipulate that, according to the theory, the scientists have the capacity for making perfect simulations, and they want nothing more than to create an experience just like an ordinary, mundane life. In that case, P(e|BIVH) is essentially 1. So this technically avoids the objection of the preceding section.

But of course that doesn’t get you anywhere. You just trade low likelihood for low prior probability. I.e., by building those stipulations into the hypothesis, you just lower the initial probability of the hypothesis, P(BIVH), by exactly the same factor as you increased the likelihood, P(e|BIVH).

5. Scientific vs. BIV-like Theories

Say you’re living in 1787, and you’re trying to understand the observed motions of the planets in the sky. Kepler has proposed three laws of planetary motion, which include that the planets and Earth travel elliptical paths, with the sun at one focus (plus 2 more laws). But why do they move like this? Newton proposes his Theory of Gravity, plus his general laws of motion, which turn out to explain why the Earth and planets would travel in these paths. So that’s cool.


Now suppose a philosopher shows up and proposes an alternative theory: Maybe God pushes the planets around, directly. Wherever you see them, the explanation is that God decided to push them there. This is a very simple explanation, and it only appeals to causes (God) that nearly everyone in Newton’s time already accepted. So it’s a great theory, right?

No, it’s a crappy theory. Which is why no one in fact proposed it, and no scientist would ever propose something like that.

The problem with the God Theory of Planetary Motion is that it explains too much: no matter what the planets did, you could give the same explanation, “God did it.”

By contrast, the Newtonian theory cannot accommodate just anything (at least, not naturally). If the planets moved in square paths, or jumped around randomly, this would be really hard for Newton to explain. These things wouldn’t strictly entail that Newton’s theory was false, since you could always posit unknown other forces, or teleportation abilities. But Newton’s theory wouldn’t be able to explain these things naturally, nor could it explain them in the same way that it explains the actual observed motions.

Conclusion

What’s wrong with skeptical hypotheses is what’s wrong with many unscientific theories in general: they are untestable, because they could explain any evidence.

Narrow BIVH and Its Implications
Re-defining the Brain in a Vat Hypothesis (BIVH) to include specific stipulations about the scientists' abilities and intentions increases the likelihood of our current experiences under BIVH to essentially 1, as these experiences precisely match the stipulated outcome of the hypothesis. However, this adjustment inadvertently reduces the prior probability of BIVH. By making such specific and extraordinary assumptions about the capabilities and desires of the scientists, the hypothesis becomes much less probable before even considering the evidence. This demonstrates a fundamental principle in hypothesis evaluation: there's a trade-off between specificity (increasing the likelihood given the evidence) and plausibility (the prior probability of the hypothesis).

Scientific Theories vs. BIV-like Theories
The comparison between Newton's Theory of Gravity and a hypothetical "God Theory of Planetary Motion" illustrates the importance of falsifiability and testability in scientific theories. Newton's laws offer precise, testable predictions about the motion of planets, which can be confirmed or refuted through observation. By contrast, the "God Theory," though perhaps appealing for its simplicity and alignment with contemporary beliefs, fails to provide a meaningful framework for testing or prediction. It explains too much, in the sense that any possible observation of planetary motion could be attributed to divine intervention, making it impossible to disprove.

The Problem with Unfalsifiable Hypotheses
The issue with both BIVH (especially in its broad form) and the God Theory of Planetary Motion is their unfalsifiability—they can be twisted to accommodate any possible evidence. This quality might seem to make them strong, as they cannot be directly refuted, but it actually renders them scientifically and philosophically uninformative. A hypothesis that cannot be tested through evidence does not contribute to our understanding of the world; rather, it stalls progress by offering explanations that cannot be evaluated or advanced through empirical research.

Conclusion
The critique of skeptical hypotheses like BIVH and untestable theories in general highlights a crucial criterion for scientific inquiry: the ability of a theory to be tested and potentially falsified by evidence. Theories that can accommodate any evidence do not advance our understanding but instead offer a façade of explanation without the substance of empirical support. In contrast, scientific theories, by virtue of their testability, not only explain the world as we observe it but also provide a basis for further exploration, prediction, and technological advancement. This principle underlines the value of falsifiability as a cornerstone of meaningful scientific and philosophical investigation.

Do you know Russel's teapot?

ChatGPT
Yes, Russell's Teapot is a famous analogy coined by the British philosopher Bertrand Russell. The analogy highlights the problem of proving a negative and the burden of proof in discussions about the existence of entities for which there is no empirical evidence. Russell suggested that if he were to claim that a teapot, too small to be seen by telescopes, orbits the Sun somewhere between Earth and Mars, the burden of proof lies not on skeptics to disprove the existence of this teapot but on him, who asserts its existence.

Russell used this analogy to criticize the argument that the burden of proof for the non-existence of God falls on atheists. He argued that just as it would be unreasonable to expect people to believe in the celestial teapot without evidence, it is unreasonable to believe in God without evidence. The teapot analogy has since become a popular illustration of the principle that the burden of proof for any claim rests on the person making the claim, especially when the claim involves the existence of something for which there is no empirical evidence.

We were discussing the brain in a vat hypothesis, which is only reasonable if there are unexplained glitches

ChatGPT
The Brain in a Vat (BIV) hypothesis, a modern skeptical scenario, posits that human experience could be fully simulated by connecting a brain to a sophisticated computer system, challenging our assumptions about reality. Discussing its plausibility often involves evaluating the evidence that could support or refute it. One aspect that could potentially support the BIV hypothesis is the occurrence of "unexplained glitches" in our perceived reality—events that defy our understanding of physical laws and could suggest that what we perceive as reality is, in fact, a simulation.

Unexplained Glitches as Indicators
The idea of "unexplained glitches" serving as potential evidence for BIV draws a parallel with common tropes in science fiction about virtual realities or simulations. In such narratives, glitches are anomalies that reveal the underlying artificiality of the simulated world. Applying this notion to the BIV hypothesis, one might argue that if we were living in a simulated reality (akin to being a brain in a vat), then imperfections in the simulation—glitches—might occasionally reveal themselves.

Philosophical Implications
However, discussing the BIV hypothesis and its plausibility based on "unexplained glitches" touches on deeper philosophical questions about evidence and the nature of reality:

What constitutes an unexplained glitch? For something to be considered a glitch in the context of BIV, it would have to be an event that fundamentally cannot be explained by our understanding of physical laws. However, history shows that many phenomena once considered supernatural or unexplainable were later understood within the framework of advanced scientific knowledge.

Interpretation of anomalies: Even if unexplained phenomena were observed, interpreting them as evidence of BIV assumes that the most plausible explanation for such anomalies is that we're in a simulation. This leap might ignore simpler, more probable explanations, adhering to principles like Occam's Razor, which favors simpler theories over more complex ones.

The nature of evidence and falsifiability: As previously discussed, for a hypothesis to be scientifically credible, it must be falsifiable—that is, there must be conceivable evidence that could prove it wrong. While "unexplained glitches" could theoretically support BIV, the absence of glitches doesn't necessarily refute it, making BIV difficult to falsify and thus challenging to assess using scientific criteria.

Conclusion
While the hypothetical presence of "unexplained glitches" offers an intriguing avenue for discussing the BIV hypothesis, it ultimately underscores the complexities of using empirical evidence to evaluate philosophical skepticism about the nature of reality. Such discussions not only highlight the challenges in defining and interpreting evidence for highly speculative scenarios but also invite deeper reflection on our assumptions about reality, knowledge, and the limits of scientific explanation.

Objections Considering the Scientists' Motives and Abilities: We discussed objections to Huemer's argument based on the possible motives and capabilities of the scientists in BIVH, and how these considerations affect the hypothesis's plausibility.

The Real-World Hypothesis (RWH) and Falsifiability: We explored Huemer's defense of RWH, emphasizing its falsifiability and contrast with the unfalsifiability of BIVH.

The Importance of Falsifiability in Scientific Inquiry: We discussed why falsifiability is crucial for distinguishing scientific theories from non-scientific claims and its role in hypothesis testing.

Narrow BIVH and Scientific vs. BIV-like Theories: We covered Huemer's critique of narrowing down BIVH to avoid previous objections and compared the scientific rigor of theories like Newton's with unfalsifiable hypotheses.

Russell's Teapot: We touched on Bertrand Russell's analogy to illustrate the burden of proof in claims about the existence of entities without empirical evidence.

Relevance of "Unexplained Glitches" to BIVH: We discussed the idea that anomalies or "glitches" in perceived reality could theoretically support the BIV hypothesis, while also considering the philosophical and evidential challenges this notion presents.

These discussions covered a wide range of philosophical questions and concepts, particularly around skepticism, the nature of reality, and the criteria for assessing scientific and philosophical theories.
