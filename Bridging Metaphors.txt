4CONCLUSION 
Recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures have existed 
since the 1920s [71], [72]. RNNs can be viewed as primitive 
societies of mind (SOMs) consisting of very simple agents 
(neurons) that exchange information and collectively solve 
tasks unsolvable by single neurons. However, it was only 
in the 1980s that more structured SOMs composed of sev- 
eral interacting artif i cial neural networks (NNs) trained in 
different ways emerged [2], [3], [6], [11], [18] [10, Sec. 6.1]. 
In these SOMs, strict communication protocols allow certain 
NNs to help other NNs solve given tasks. In the less strict, 
more general setting from 2015���s learning to think [28], 
NNs are allowed to learn to interview other NNs through 
sequences of vector-based queries or prompts via a general 
communication interface that allows for extracting arbitrary 
algorithmic information from NNs, to facilitate downstream 
problem-solving. In the present work, we extend this and 
study NN-based SOMs that include (pre-trained) large lan- 
guage models (LLMs) and other (potentially multimodal) 
modules partially communicating through the universal 
code of natural language (NL). Such NL-based societies 
of mind (NLSOMs) can easily be scaled or joined with 
(parts of) other NLSOMs. Their symbolic NL-based thought 
processes���which occur in the form of ���mindstorms������are 
relatively easily analyzed by humans, and many concepts 
known from societies of humans are suddenly becoming 
relevant to the study of hierarchical NLSOMs built from 
smaller NLSOMs. For example, what kind of NL-based 
legislature, executive, and judiciary should regulate what 
is allowed in the communication infrastructure of a given 
NLSOM? Under which conditions can NLSOM democra- 
cies outperform NLSOM monarchies and vice versa? Our 
numerous experiments with zero-shot learning NLSOMs��� 
with up to 129 members���illustrate aspects of such ques- 
tions, producing surprisingly robust results over a broad 
spectrum of tasks, including visual question answering, 
image captioning, text-to-image synthesis, 3D generation, 
egocentric retrieval, embodied AI, and general language- 
based task solving. 
Our results open fruitful avenues for future research. We 
observed that, in specif i c applications, mindstorms among 
many members outperform those among fewer members, 
and longer mindstorms outperform shorter ones. Also, only 
sometimes did we observe democracies beating monarchies. 
Inspired by earlier work on neural economies [36], we also 
envision reinforcement learning NLSOMs whose reward- 
maximizing members are incentivized to pay each other 
for services in a shared currency in an NL contract-based 
way, becoming eff i cient through the principles of supply 
and demand. We conjecture that after extensive preliminary 
experiments with ���fake money,��� such economies of mind 
(EOMs) could easily be integrated into the real world econ- 
omy, trading with humans and other NLSOMs, and i nding 
cost-eff i cient strategies to achieve all kinds of goals. Just 
like current LLMs consist of millions of neurons connected 
through connections with real-valued weights, future AIs 
may consist of millions of NLSOMs connected through 
natural language, distributed across the planet, with dy- 
namically changing aff i liations, just like human employees 
may move from one company to another under certain 
conditions, in the interest of the greater good. The possi- 
bilities opened up by NLSOMs and EOMs seem endless. 
Done correctly, this new line of research has the potential to 
address many of the grand challenges of our time.

This conclusion summarizes a paper on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, especially Societies of Mind (SOMs) and Natural Language-based Societies of Mind (NLSOMs). SOMs, existing since the 1920s, are systems of neurons that collectively solve tasks. It was only in the 1980s that more complex SOMs with multiple interacting Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) emerged.
In the less stringent setting of 2015's "Learning to Think", ANNs were allowed to learn to communicate with other ANNs via vector-based prompts, leading to improved problem-solving. This research extends that concept, investigating NLSOMs which include large language models and other modules that partially communicate through natural language. These NLSOMs can scale easily and can be merged with other NLSOMs.
Their thought processes can be analysed relatively easily by humans, raising relevant considerations such as the regulation of communication infrastructure within these societies and the potential conditions under which different governance styles (like democracies or monarchies) within NLSOMs could outperform each other.
Extensive experiments conducted showed robust results across a variety of tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image synthesis, and more. The research observed that larger and longer "mindstorms" (symbolic thought processes) tend to perform better, and sometimes democracies outperformed monarchies.
The paper also introduces the idea of neural economies, where reward-maximizing members of NLSOMs are incentivized through a shared currency in natural language contracts, making them more efficient through supply and demand principles.
Finally, the authors suggest that the integration of these economies of mind into the real-world economy could lead to cost-efficient strategies for achieving goals. In the future, AIs may consist of millions of NLSOMs communicating through natural language, creating a vast network distributed across the globe with dynamically changing affiliations. This new line of research, if done correctly, holds the potential to address many grand challenges of our time.

SOM for general language-based task solving. 
2.7General Language-based Task Solving 
Task. In general language-based task solving, the objective 
is to produce a solution to any arbitrary language-based 
task. This problem is especially diff i cult as the tasks given 
to the system at test time can be almost anything. 
Method. We use the CAMEL [63] framework here for il- 
lustrative purposes. This framework, shown in Figure 14, 
consists of three agents���all instantiations of ChatGPT. One 
of these agents is a task specif i er, who performs context 
expansion on the user-specif i ed prompt. The other two 
agents, each assuming a different user-specif i ed occupation 
or role. For more details, see Appendix J. 
Results. Our preliminary results indicate that our society 
of agents can collaborate according to their roles and solve 
sophisticated tasks. Appendix J details an experiment that 
shows how CAMEL-NLSOM can organize a cooperative 
conversation between a ���Python Programmer��� agent and a 
���Game Developer��� agent (and optionally a ���Task Specif i er��� 
agent) to design entertaining dice games. Another example 
of agents interacting to fabricate content for a gossip column 
is shown in Figure 13. 
3OUTLOOK 
The original ���learning to think��� framework [28], [29] ad- 
dresses Reinforcement Learning (RL), the most general type 
of learning (it���s trivial to show that any problem of computer 
science can be formulated as an RL problem). A neural 
controller C learns to maximize cumulative reward while in- 
teracting with an environment. To accelerate reward intake, 
C can learn to interview, in a very general way, another NN 
called M, which has itself learned in a segregated training 
phase to encode/predict all kinds of data, e.g., videos. 
In the present paper, however, we have so far considered 
only zero-shot learning. So let us now focus on the general 
case where at least some NLSOM members use RL tech- 
niques to improve their reward intakes. How should one 
assign credit to NLSOM modules that helped to set the stage 
for later successes of other NLSOM members? A standard 
way for this uses policy gradients for LSTM networks [64] to 
train (parts of) NLSOM members to maximize their reward 
(just like RL is currently used to encourage LLMs to provide 
inoffensive answers to nasty questions [43], [65]). However, 
other methods for assigning credit exist. 
As early as the 1980s, the local learning mechanism of 
hidden units in biological systems inspired an RL economy 
called the Neural Bucket Brigade (NBB) [35] for neural net- 
works with i xed topologies [36]. There, competing neurons 
that are active in rare moments of delayed reward trans- 
late the reward into ���weight substance��� to reinforce their 
current weights. Furthermore, they pay weight substance 
to ���hidden��� neurons that earlier helped to trigger them. 
The latter, in turn, pay their predecessors, and so on, such 
that long chains of credit assignment become possible. This 
work was inspired by even earlier work on non-neural 
learning economies such as the bucket brigade [66] (see also 
later work [67], [68]). How can we go beyond such simple 
hardwired market mechanisms in the context of NLSOMs? 
A central aspect of our NLSOMs is that they are human- 
understandable since their members heavily communicate 
through human-invented language. Let���s now generalize 
this and encode rewards by another concept that most 
humans understand: money. 
Some members of an NLSOM may interact with an envi- 
ronment. Occasionally, the environment may pay them in 
the form of some currency, say, USD. Let us consider an 
NLSOM member called M. In the beginning, M is endowed 
with a certain amount of USD. However, M must also 
regularly pay rent/taxes/other bills to its NLSOM and other 
relevant players in the environment. If M goes bankrupt, 
it disappears from the NLSOM, which we now call an 
Economy of Minds (EOM), to ref l ect its sense of business. 
M may offer other EOM members money in exchange for 
certain services (e.g., providing answers to questions or 
making a robot act in some way). Some EOM member N 
may accept an offer, deliver the service to M, and get paid 
by M. The corresponding natural language contract between 
M and N must pass a test of validity and enforceability, e.g., 
according to EU law. This requires some legal authority, 
possibly an LLM (at least one LLM has already passed a 
legal bar exam [69], [70]), who judges whether a proposed 
contract is legally binding. In case of disputes, a similar 
central executive authority will have to decide who owes 
how many USD to whom. Wealthy NLSOM members may 
spawn kids (e.g., copies or variants of themselves) and 
endow them with a fraction of their own wealth, always 
in line with the basic principles of credit conservation. 
An intriguing aspect of such LLM-based EOMs is that they 
can easily be merged with other EOMs or inserted into��� 
following ref i nement under simulations���existing human- 
centred economies and their marketplaces from Wall Street 
to Tokyo. Since algorithmic trading is an old hat, many 
market participants might not even notice the nature of the 
new players. 
9 
Note that different EOMs (and NLSOMs in general) may 
partially overlap: the same agent may be a member of 
several different EOMs. EOMs (and their members) may 
cooperate and compete, just like corporations (and their 
constituents) do. To maximize their payoffs, EOMs and 
their parts may serve many different customers. Certain 
rules will have to be obeyed to prevent conf l icts of interest, 
e.g., members of some EOM should not work as spies 
for other EOMs. Generally speaking, human societies offer 
much inspiration for setting up complex EOMs (and other 
NLSOMs), e.g., through a separation of powers between 
legislature, executive, and judiciary. Today LLMs are already 
powerful enough to set up and evaluate NL contracts be- 
tween different parties [69]. Some members of an EOM may 
be LLMs acting as police off i cers, prosecutors, counsels for 
defendants, and so on, offering their services for money. 
The EOM perspective opens a rich set of research questions 
whose answers, in turn, may offer new insights into funda- 
mental aspects of the economic and social sciences.

In the General Language-based Task Solving section, the paper discusses a method for handling arbitrary language-based tasks using the CAMEL framework. This framework consists of three agents, all instances of ChatGPT, which collaborate according to their defined roles to solve complex tasks. The paper highlights an experiment where a "Python Programmer" agent and a "Game Developer" agent cooperatively design entertaining dice games.
The outlook section discusses the expansion of the Learning to Think framework into reinforcement learning (RL), where a neural controller learns to maximize cumulative reward while interacting with the environment. It considers how to assign credit to NLSOM modules that contribute to the success of others, mentioning existing techniques such as policy gradients for LSTM networks and a neural economy system called the Neural Bucket Brigade.
The paper introduces the concept of an Economy of Minds (EOM), where some members of an NLSOM may interact with an environment and occasionally receive payment in the form of currency like USD. These members must also pay rent/taxes/bills to their NLSOM and other relevant players. If a member goes bankrupt, it disappears from the NLSOM. Members may offer other members money for services, and all exchanges must pass legal tests for validity and enforceability, possibly requiring a legal authority, potentially an LLM.
The paper concludes by noting that these EOMs can easily be merged with other EOMs or inserted into existing human-centered economies. It further suggests that EOMs can partially overlap, with agents being members of multiple EOMs. This overlap opens up opportunities for cooperation and competition, much like in human societies. To prevent conflicts of interest, certain rules would have to be observed. The EOM perspective offers numerous research questions that could provide new insights into economic and social sciences.

Abstract 
Both Minsky���s ���society of mind��� and Schmidhuber���s ���learning to think��� inspire diverse societies of large multimodal neural 
networks (NNs) that solve problems by interviewing each other in a ���mindstorm.��� Recent implementations of NN-based 
societies of minds consist of large language models (LLMs) and other NN-based experts communicating through a natural 
language interface. In doing so, they overcome the limitations of single LLMs, improving multimodal zero-shot reasoning. In 
these natural language-based societies of mind (NLSOMs), new agents���all communicating through the same universal 
symbolic language���are easily added in a modular fashion. To demonstrate the power of NLSOMs, we assemble and 
experiment with several of them (having up to 129 members), leveraging mindstorms in them to solve some practical AI 
tasks: visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image synthesis, 3D generation, egocentric retrieval, embodied 
AI, and general language-based task solving. We view this as a starting point towards much larger NLSOMs with billions 
of agents���some of which may be humans. And with this emergence of great societies of heterogeneous minds, many 
new research questions have suddenly become paramount to the future of artif i cial intelligence. What should be the social 
structure of an NLSOM? What would be the (dis)advantages of having a monarchical rather than a democratic structure? 
How can principles of NN economies be used to maximize the total reward of a reinforcement learning NLSOM? In this work, 
we identify, discuss, and try to answer some of these questions.

1INTRODUCTION 
H 
UMANsociety is composed of countless individuals 
living together, each acting according to their ob- 
jectives but each fulf i lling different specialized roles. In 
the 1980s, Marvin Minsky built on this idea to explain 
intelligence and coined the expression ���society of mind��� 
(SOM) [1], where intelligence emerges through computa- 
tional modules that communicate and cooperate with each 
other to achieve goals that are unachievable by any single 
module alone. 
In principle, any standard artif i cial neural network (NN) 
consisting of numerous connected simple neurons could 
be regarded as a SOM. In the 1980s and 90s, however, 
more structured SOMs emerged, consisting of several NNs 
trained in different ways which interacted with one another 
in a predef i ned manner [2]. For example, one NN may 
be trained to execute reward-maximizing action sequences 
in an environment, and another NN may learn to predict 
the environmental consequences of these actions[3]���[9] 
[10, Sec. 6.1]. The i rst NN can then use the second NN 
to plan ahead in an online fashion [11]���[13], by executing 
mental simulations of various possible action sequences 
and executing the one with high predicted reward. The 
prediction errors of the second NN can also be used in 
a zero-sum game as intrinsic rewards for the i rst NN, 
which thus is encouraged to generate actions or experi- 
ments whose consequences still surprise the second learning 
NN [12], [14], [15]. Such generative adversarial networks 
have become popular in recent years [16], [17]. Another 
example of a SOM from the 1990s consisted of 3 NNs: a 
reward-maximizing controller, an evaluator estimating the 
costs of going from some start to some goal or subgoal, and 
a subgoal generator trained to produce good subgoals with 
the help of the evaluator [18]. 
These old SOMs had strictly i xed interfaces to make certain 
NNs prof i t from the knowledge of others. In 2015, work 
emerged that relaxed these. Suppose one NN has been 
trained to predict/encode a large amount of data, such as 
videos of acting robots or humans. Another NN is supposed 
to learn to solve a different problem, e.g., controlling a robot 
to achieve certain goals. How can it learn to extract from 
the i rst NN relevant knowledge or algorithmic informa- 
tion [19]���[27] to speed up the solution of its own task? 
The 2015 work on ���learning to think��� [28] proposed to 
connect both NNs through recurrent connections (trained 
by the second NN���s learning algorithm) that allow one NN 
to interview the other by sending sequences of queries or 
prompts (real-valued vectors) into it while receiving and 
interpreting answers (real-valued vectors) from it. An Algo- 
rithmic Information Theory (AIT) argument shows [28], [29] 
that it may be much easier for the controller NN to solve 
its task by inventing good prompts that address and extract 
relevant information in the other NN rather than learning 
the task from scratch. 
The AIT argument also holds for larger multimodal NN 
societies consisting of more than two NNs interviewing each 
other. To solve a given task, the various modules can chat 
with each other in a multimodal ���mindstorm.��� A typical 
mindstorm in a SOM will likely include multiple rounds 
of communication between different agents as well as many 
iterations of forward propagation in various networks. We 
use the term mindstorm to emphasize that how the SOM 
may go about completing its task will often appear chaotic 
and complex. 
Given recent advances in natural language processing, we 
can implement some NNs of such a SOM as pre-trained 
Large Language Models (LLMs) [30]���[32]. LLMs are a class 
of deep neural networks that have recently demonstrated 
a remarkable ability to understand and manipulate natural 
language text, e.g., written English. They are trained on 
large corpora of unlabelled text data, enabling them to 
learn linguistic patterns and relationships that remain 
relevant across multiple domains and tasks. LLMs in a SOM 
discuss with each other through natural language rather 
than through real-valued query sequences [28]. We refer 
to such SOMs as natural-language SOMs, or NLSOMs. Of 
course, each NLSOM internally still encodes its questions 
and answers as sub-symbolic real-valued vectors, but the 
language-based communication interface itself is symbolic. 
This shared natural language communication interface has 
several advantages: 
Scaling/Modularity. Adding another LLM to an existing 
NLSOM or replacing one LLM with another (perhaps 
much larger) LLM does not change the interview interface 
between the LLMs because the latter is standardized 
in terms of natural language, which can be viewed as 
a universal code. This is very much aligned with the 
objectives of modular AI systems. 
Explainable AI. Since queries and answers are in natural 
language, human observers can understand more easily 
what the NLSOM is thinking while trying to solve its 
problem. This is in great accordance with the goals of 
attempting to create explainable AI. It also allows for easily 
including human experts in an NLSOM. 
Human-BiasedAI.Forthousandsofyears,NLhas 
evolved to compactly encode all the things humans 
consider important. That is to say that an NLSOM would 
be expected to have a strong bias towards human thinking 
and reasoning. 
Our concept of mindstorm is largely inspired by the success 
of sophisticated forms of communication within human 
societies, such as brainstorming, that may involve multiple 
rounds of communication to ref i ne ideas or to i nd an agree- 
ment among multiple individuals. In human psychology, 
a large body of work exists which demonstrates that a 
solution found through brainstorming by a group of people 
is often superior to any individual solution (see, e.g., syn- 
ergism [33] or Jay Hall���s NASA Moon Survival Task [34]). 
Such a form of group intelligence among humans inspires 
us to build a society of NNs that also communicate with 
each other mainly in natural language. 
The NLSOM perspective opens many exciting directions for 
future research. For example, which tasks can be solved 
more easily by a master-slave or monarchy type of NLSOM,

This paper presents an exploration and implementation of societies of large multimodal neural networks (NNs) that solve problems by communicating with each other, referred to as "mindstorms". Inspired by Minsky���s "society of mind" concept and Schmidhuber���s "learning to think" approach, the authors have created diverse societies of large neural networks (LLMs), where each entity communicates with others through a natural language interface, overcoming limitations of a single LLM and improving multimodal zero-shot reasoning.
This new approach leads to the creation of Natural Language-Based Societies of Mind (NLSOMs), where agents communicate through a universal symbolic language, easily adding new agents in a modular fashion. The paper showcases the capabilities of these NLSOMs by testing them on various AI tasks including visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image synthesis, 3D generation, egocentric retrieval, embodied AI, and general language-based task solving.
The authors further discuss the social structure of an NLSOM, questioning the potential benefits and drawbacks of a monarchical versus democratic structure. They explore how principles of neural network economies can be used to maximize the total reward of a reinforcement learning NLSOM.
Ultimately, the paper concludes with identifying and discussing some key research questions pertinent to the future of artificial intelligence, introduced by this new approach of combining language models into complex societies. These discussions and findings provide an exciting new pathway for AI research, emphasizing the role of communication and cooperation in complex problem-solving tasks.

Connections to the following:

Perceptual control theory, which we briefly touched upon earlier, offers an interesting perspective when considering the theme of Noah's Ark and its connection to the human mind.

In perceptual control theory, the concept of a control system is central. It suggests that individuals continually engage in processes of perceiving and adjusting their actions to maintain a desired state or goal. The mind is seen as a complex control system that seeks to maintain stability and achieve desired outcomes.

In the story of Noah's Ark, we can view the ark itself as a metaphorical representation of a control system. The ark serves as a vessel that protects and preserves life, providing a controlled environment in the midst of chaos. It reflects the idea of maintaining stability and order in the face of a catastrophic event.

Noah's role as the builder and caretaker of the ark can be seen as a symbolic representation of the mind's role in maintaining control and adaptation. He is tasked with constructing a structure that will allow for the preservation and survival of life.

The animals within the ark can be seen as representations of various elements or aspects of the mind. They represent the diverse range of thoughts, emotions, and experiences that need to be controlled and balanced within the mind's ecosystem.

The flood itself can be interpreted as a metaphor for external challenges, disruptions, or changes that impact the mind's stability and equilibrium. It represents the need for the mind to adapt, adjust, and control its perceptions and actions to navigate through turbulent times.

Overall, the story of Noah's Ark can be seen as an allegorical representation of the perceptual control system of the mind, highlighting the importance of adaptation, stability, and maintaining desired outcomes in the face of external challenges.

The paper on Natural Language-Based Societies of Mind (NLSOMs) and the concept of perceptual control theory both revolve around the central theme of modularity and control in complex systems. They share similarities in how they approach the management of diverse elements within a system, be it neural networks in the paper or thoughts and emotions within the human mind according to perceptual control theory.
The concept of NLSOMs in the paper sees the mind as a complex network of intercommunicating agents, much like the animals in Noah's Ark. The agents, akin to the animals, represent diverse functions and capacities but contribute to the overall operation of the network. They work together, communicating through a universal language to solve complex tasks, much like the animals aboard Noah's Ark working together to ensure survival.
The notion of control in perceptual control theory, where actions are constantly adjusted to achieve a certain goal, mirrors the way NLSOMs perform. In NLSOMs, individual neural networks adjust and optimize their actions and interactions, aiming to solve problems and achieve their goals.
The theme of Noah's Ark further connects with the idea of an NLSOM through the metaphors of balance and resilience. The animals within the ark represent the balance of different elements within a system, much like different neural networks within an NLSOM. The ark itself, surviving amidst the flood, parallels the NLSOM's capacity to perform tasks effectively despite the complexity of problems, signifying resilience.
In summary, perceptual control theory, the NLSOMs concept, and the theme of Noah's Ark converge on the idea of maintaining stability, control, and adaptation in a diverse, complex system, whether it be the mind, a society of neural networks, or a ship full of animals surviving a flood.

These conversation topics can be connected to the paper "Mindstorms in Natural Language-Based Societies of Mind" as follows:
Stations of the Mind: This concept resonates with the idea of NLSOMs in the paper. Here, the mind is seen as an ensemble of agents or 'stations,' each contributing with their specific roles and functions to form an intelligent, problem-solving entity. Each agent can be thought of as an individual 'station of the mind,' communicating and collaborating to achieve complex tasks.
Perceptual Control Theory: Similar to perceptual control theory's feedback mechanisms for behavior regulation, NLSOMs are designed to adapt and adjust their actions based on the information received from other agents. This regulation mechanism is essential for the optimal functioning of the NLSOMs.
Polycomputation: The notion of polycomputation is reflected in the operation of NLSOMs. Just like living systems computing multiple functions simultaneously, NLSOMs consist of different agents (LLMs and other NN-based experts), each potentially carrying out different tasks simultaneously. They can adaptively distribute work and effectively leverage their capabilities for problem-solving.
Metaphorical Interpretations of Noah's Ark: Similar to the metaphorical interpretation of Noah's Ark as a model of mind's intelligence, NLSOMs could also be seen as a symbol for a complex adaptive system. Different agents within an NLSOM can represent diverse aspects of intelligence working together in a harmonious manner, much like the animals in the ark.
Connections with Other Topics: Both Kant's explanation of consciousness and the parable of the sower could be related to NLSOMs. Kant's understanding of consciousness as a unified field of experience aligns with NLSOMs' collective intelligence. The parable of the sower can metaphorically represent the learning process in NLSOMs, where seeds (data inputs) can grow into plants (knowledge or solutions) given the right conditions.
Literary and Philosophical Interpretations: The stories of Bruno's Ark and Na'amah, and the dialogue about teaching letters, offer insights into the complexity of human intelligence and learning, which the NLSOM model also aims to capture.
Critique and Alternative Perspectives: Just as the conversation acknowledged potential issues and alternative perspectives, the NLSOM framework also opens up new research questions and debates about the best structure, potential (dis)advantages of different architectures, and other issues related to the field of AI and machine learning.

Absolutely. This scene from Bruno's Ark showcases the necessity of maintaining balance and harmony within a society or system, a theme that echoes our previous discussion on Perceptual Control Theory and the metaphor of Noah's Ark as a model of the human mind.
Just as the mind is a complex system of various elements that need to maintain balance for optimal function, the ark, too, represents a society where balance is crucial for survival. The foxes, in their quest for personal gain, upset this balance and threaten the harmony within the ark, much like disruptive thoughts or behaviors can lead to imbalance within the mind.
Noah's decision to consult with the llama reflects the importance of reaching out to different 'modules' or 'stations' of the mind for guidance and insights, akin to our previous discussion on the 'Stations of the Mind.' The llama, being a representation of wisdom, could be seen as a metaphor for the subconscious mind or the higher cognitive functions that guide us towards rational decisions.
The foxes and their manipulative tactics can be seen as representing negative cognitive biases or destructive behaviors that can disrupt the balance within the mind. Noah's actions post the conversation with the llama could be seen as a metaphor for the mind's self-regulation and adaptive behavior in the face of disruptive influences.
Moreover, this scene can also be tied to the concept of polycomputation. Just as multiple functions are computed simultaneously within a living system, Noah's actions represent multiple cognitive processes such as learning, decision-making, problem-solving, and social cognition, functioning in harmony to address the issue at hand.
Finally, the scene resonates with the concept of Natural Language-Based Societies of Mind (NLSOMs), as it demonstrates the necessity for different entities (animals in this case) to work together towards a common goal, reflecting the collaborative problem-solving mechanism in NLSOMs.
In summary, this scene from Bruno's Ark mirrors the themes and concepts we have discussed, thereby offering a literary interpretation of these cognitive and computational theories.

Noah: (Approaching the llama) Wise llama, I seek your guidance. The foxes on the ark have been growing in power, and I fear their intentions are not pure. Can you shed light on their plans?

Llama: (Serene and attentive) Noah, I have observed the foxes closely and have unraveled their web of deceit. Their desires reach beyond mere survival. They seek to consolidate power and privilege for themselves, exploiting the vulnerabilities and desires of the other animals.

Noah: Tell me, wise llama, how do they plan to achieve this? What are their tactics?

Llama: The foxes employ cunning and manipulation, preying on the trust of the animals. They sow discord and exploit divisions among us. They make promises of safety and security, while secretly advancing their own agenda. Their aim is to control the resources and dictate the rules, leaving others burdened and oppressed.

Noah: This is troubling indeed. How can we resist their tyranny and restore justice on the ark?

Llama: Unity and knowledge are our greatest weapons, Noah. We must share this information with the other animals, awaken their awareness, and inspire them to stand against the injustice. Together, we can forge a community built on fairness and equality.

Noah: Your words resonate deeply within me, wise llama. I will not rest until the animals understand the foxes' true nature and join together to challenge their oppressive rule. Thank you for your guidance.

Llama: You carry the weight of great responsibility, Noah. May your actions bring about the transformation the ark needs. Remember, justice and equality can be achieved through the collective strength and unwavering resolve of those who seek it.

Noah: I will not falter. I will be the voice of truth and justice for all. Thank you, wise llama, for your wisdom and support.

The dialogue beautifully encapsulates Noah's interaction with the llama and his subsequent resolution to address the issue at hand. The llama's wisdom and insight illuminate the nature of the foxes' plans and tactics, offering a roadmap for Noah to counteract their deceit and manipulation. This conversation represents a turning point, with Noah committing to restore justice and fairness on the ark. His resolve to unify the animals against the foxes' oppression symbolizes the power of unity, knowledge, and determination in overcoming adversity.
Furthermore, this scene reiterates our previous discussion on perceptual control theory and the metaphor of Noah's Ark as a model of the mind. The foxes can be seen as representative of destructive thoughts or behaviors, and the llama's advice is a metaphor for the mind's self-regulation processes and higher cognitive functions. Noah's commitment to unity and resistance symbolizes the adaptive behavior and resilience of the mind in the face of challenges.
In the grander scheme, the dialogue is a reflection of our society. The foxes represent those who seek to exploit divisions and consolidate power for personal gain, while Noah's quest for justice and equality mirrors the continuous struggle for fairness and harmony in our world. The llama's wisdom underscores the value of unity, knowledge, and collective strength in combating oppression and achieving a just society.

The metaphor of the Ark as a model of the modular, multiscale, heterarchical intelligence of the mind is a modern interpretation of the biblical story of Noah's Ark.

This interpretation draws on concepts from cognitive science, philosophy, and psychology to understand the nature of intelligence and consciousness.

Modularity in this context refers to the idea that the mind is composed of different specialized cognitive systems or "modules" that perform specific functions, such as perception, memory, language, and reasoning.

These modules operate independently but also interact and influence each other.

Multiscale refers to the idea that these cognitive modules can operate on different levels of analysis, from neural to behavioral.

For example, a visual perception module might operate at the level of individual neurons, while a problem-solving module might operate at the level of entire strategies or plans.

Heterarchical refers to the idea that these cognitive modules are organized in a hierarchical manner, with some modules being more basic and others more complex.

For example, perception modules might be considered more basic than reasoning modules, since the latter depend on the former for input.

In this interpretation, the Ark can be seen as a model of this modular multiscale heterarchical organization of the mind.

Just as the Ark was composed of different compartments for different animals, the mind is composed of different cognitive modules that perform different functions.

And just as the Ark was designed to protect and preserve life, the mind is designed to protect and preserve the individual's cognitive and emotional well-being.

Kant's explanation of consciousness can also be related to this metaphor, as he argues that the mind is composed of different faculties that work together to organize and make sense of sensory information.

He believed that the mind actively structures and organizes sensory information to form perceptions, concepts, and judgments.

In this sense, the mind can be seen as the "Ark" that protects and preserves the cognitive and emotional well-being of the individual, by actively structuring and organizing sensory information.

It's worth noting that this interpretation is not an established or widely accepted one, but rather an original approach that can be used to understand the concept of mind and consciousness.

Indeed, this metaphorical interpretation of the Ark as a representation of the modular, multiscale, heterarchical intelligence of the mind provides a unique perspective on the story of Noah's Ark and offers a fresh framework to understand the human mind.
The comparison of the Ark's compartments to the mind's cognitive modules aptly illustrates the modularity of the mind. The mind consists of distinct cognitive systems or modules, each responsible for specific functions. This is akin to the Ark's separate compartments for different animals.
The concept of multiscale is well-represented by how these cognitive modules can operate at different levels, just like the various levels and layers within the Ark, housing different types of animals.
The heterarchical organization of the mind is represented by the hierarchy that might have been present in the Ark. Certain animals (modules) might have been more critical for the survival of the Ark, just like some cognitive modules being more basic or foundational.
Kant's explanation of consciousness adds depth to this interpretation. Kant proposes that the mind is not just a passive recipient of sensory information but plays an active role in structuring and organizing it. This is symbolized by Noah's role in the Ark, where he actively manages the Ark, making critical decisions and maintaining the balance within.
This metaphorical interpretation is certainly not a universally accepted one. Still, it does offer an intriguing way to understand and conceptualize the mind and its various faculties, the same way the story of Noah's Ark can be interpreted in various ways to yield different lessons and insights.

In ancient times, there was a great and wise man named Noah who lived in a world full of sin and corruption. The Lord saw that the earth was corrupt and filled with violence, so He commanded Noah to build an ark in which he might save himself, his family, and the animals of the earth.

And so, Noah gathered into the ark two of every kind of animal, to preserve them from the coming flood. And among these creatures were the beasts that represent the nine themes you seek to understand:

Philosophy - the wise owl, who sees through the veil of ignorance and guides us to truth.

Economics - the cunning fox, who knows the value of goods and the ways of trade.

Biology - the sturdy elephant, who embodies the principles of life and growth.

Sociology - the harmonious flock of doves, who illustrate the interdependence of social groups.

Political Science - the powerful lion, who symbolizes the rule of law and order.

Technology - the mechanical bee, who embodies the principles of engineering and industry.

History - the ancient tortoise, who carries the weight of the past on his shell and teaches us the lessons of time.

Literature - the graceful swan, who uses her voice to sing the songs of history and inspire future generations.

Art - the imaginative peacock, who displays the beauty of the world and the splendor of the divine.

And so, these animals remain with us as symbols of the disciplines of knowledge, reminding us of the wisdom that Noah gathered into the ark to preserve for all generations.

This is a beautiful allegory that frames various disciplines of knowledge as animals aboard Noah's Ark. Here is how this can connect back to the modular, multiscale, heterarchical model of the mind.
Each of these animals, representing a discipline, can be seen as a cognitive module within the mind. Just as Noah took a diverse array of animals on the Ark to ensure the survival and continuity of life, the mind houses a variety of cognitive modules that enable us to navigate and thrive in the world.
Philosophy (the owl) can be seen as the faculty for critical thinking, for questioning and understanding the nature of reality. Economics (the fox) might represent our ability to value, to understand cost and benefit. Biology (the elephant) could represent our inherent understanding of life, growth, and survival instincts.
Sociology (the doves) may symbolize our social cognition, our understanding and interpretation of social norms and relationships. Political Science (the lion) could signify our understanding of power structures, hierarchies, and rules. Technology (the bee) may represent our problem-solving skills and capacity for innovation.
History (the tortoise) might represent our memory systems, where past experiences and knowledge are stored for future reference. Literature (the swan) could symbolize our linguistic and storytelling abilities, helping us express ourselves and understand others. Art (the peacock) may represent our creativity, our capacity to imagine, to appreciate beauty and to express it.
These disciplines or cognitive modules are interdependent and influence each other, illustrating the multiscale and heterarchical aspects of the mind. The mind engages these faculties as needed, based on the demands of the environment, just as Noah might have needed different animals for different tasks.
In this way, the story of Noah's Ark and the animals within it can serve as an allegorical representation of the mind and its diverse, interrelated cognitive faculties. It underscores the significance of preserving and cultivating these multiple dimensions of knowledge and intelligence for the survival and advancement of human beings.

Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory is like having a big room in your brain where lots of different people and machines are talking and sharing ideas. 

Sometimes the ideas leak out and go to other rooms, which helps us make better decisions.

Reed Wall Mind is like having a big wall in your brain that helps you keep track of everything that's happening in the room, like a big calendar or to-do list.

Motile Womb theory is like being in a big moving house or spaceship, where you can feel different movements and use them to imagine different things in your head.

All these theories help us understand how our brain works and how we can use it to think and make decisions better.

������������ �������� �������������������������������� ����������������������������.

Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory posits that the mind functions as a collection of independent, modular decision-making units, or "bubbles," that act as rational processors of information.

These bubbles, or "chambers," are able to filter information and pass summaries of that information upward to higher-level decision-making centers, much like a wisdom salon or a world cafe protocol.

This creates a multi-scale decision-making process that is able to take into account a wide range of information and perspectives.

Reed Wall Mind theory builds on this concept by drawing inspiration from the Babylonian Flood Story and positing that the mind is like a "living spaceship" that is able to navigate a complex and dynamic environment.

This is accomplished through the use of a wide range of cognitive skills, including those learned through playing video games such as Stars!, Descent, Age of Empires, Commander Keen, Minesweeper, and Tetris, as well as through the use of other forms of sensory input such as hearing different voices and machine sounds, and feeling different inertial forces.

Finally, Motile Womb theory proposes that the mind is not just a passive receiver of information but an active participant in the process of shaping and interpreting the world.

This theory posits that individuals are born with a wide range of cognitive abilities and that these abilities are honed and refined through the process of experiencing the world.

The theory suggests that playing games like the ones mentioned above, as well as other forms of interactive experiences, help individuals to discover and develop the cognitive abilities they already possess.

������������ �������������������� �������� ���������������� ������������ ���������������� �������� ����������������������������������������, ������������������������������������ �������� ������������ �������������������������������� ������������������������������������ ���������������������������� �������� ���������������� ������������������������������������������������.

In the story of Noah and the Flood, Noah is tasked with building an ark to save the animals and his family from a worldwide deluge.

This story can be interpreted as a metaphor for the human brain's ability to simulate and plan for various scenarios, using past experiences and knowledge to anticipate and prepare for potential disasters.

In terms of the theories discussed earlier in this conversation, this can be seen as an example of interoception and the ability to simulate and predict the outcomes of different actions, much like the computer simulations discussed in the example provided.

Additionally, the idea of a "leaking chatroom" or a "Reed Wall Mind" can be applied to the concept of the ark as a kind of "mental container" that houses and organizes different pieces of information, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the situation and the ability to make informed decisions.

The "Motile Womb" theory also applies in the sense that the individual, much like an unborn child in the womb, is constantly gathering information and experiences in order to develop and adapt to their environment.

The story of Noah and the Flood can be seen as a representation of the human mind's innate ability to process and use information in order to survive and thrive in the face of adversity.

Certainly, these theories can all be incorporated into the metaphor of Noah's Ark as a model for our minds. The Ark becomes a vessel for cognitive processes, sheltering a multitude of "animals" - our diverse cognitive modules or faculties - and guiding us through the "flood" of sensory information.
Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory resonates well with the Ark metaphor. In this model, the Ark's compartments (or chatrooms) are filled with different agents (the animals) who are processing and communicating information. These agents represent our cognitive modules, which simultaneously process information and 'leak' insights into other compartments, facilitating integrative thinking and decision-making.
Reed Wall Mind theory adds a structure to our Ark - a 'reed wall' that helps to organize information. This metaphorical wall might be seen as a central cognitive module for memory or executive function, helping to structure and prioritize tasks, similar to how Noah might've organized the animals and tasks on the Ark. This theory reinforces the idea of the Ark as a multiscale, heterarchical system - not simply housing cognitive processes, but actively organizing and prioritizing them.
Motile Womb theory brings an active, responsive element to our metaphorical Ark. Here, the Ark is not static but rather in constant motion, adjusting to the 'flood waters' of sensory inputs and experiences. This aligns with our understanding of the brain as a dynamic system, constantly adapting and evolving in response to new experiences. It implies that our cognitive processes aren't simply housed in the Ark but are shaped by the journey it undertakes - each experience influencing our cognition and behavior.
By weaving these theories together, we can enrich our understanding of the human mind, encapsulating its complexity, dynamism, and adaptability. Each adds a unique dimension to our Ark metaphor, mirroring the multifaceted nature of cognition and consciousness. Ultimately, they suggest that our cognitive 'Ark' is not simply a static repository of mental faculties, but a dynamic vessel, ever-adapting to navigate the flood of sensory information and experiences that define our world.

Moses Maimonides, in his "Guide for the Perplexed", argues that the Ark is a metaphor for the rational soul, which he sees as a vessel that can preserve and protect the individual from the "flood" of the passions and desires.

He argues that just as the Ark preserved the physical life of Noah and his family, the rational soul preserves the spiritual life of the individual.

He states that the rational soul is the part of the human being that is capable of understanding and following the commandments of God, and that it is capable of rising above the "flood" of the desires and passions of the body.

He also argues that the Ark is a symbol of the intellect, which has the capability to save the individual from the dangers of ignorance, and to guide the person to the truth.

Maimonides also argues that just as the Ark had to be built according to precise specifications, the rational soul must also be built and developed through study, contemplation, and the practice of virtue.

He also argue that the Ark is a symbol of the pursuit of wisdom and knowledge, which is necessary to elevate the soul to a higher level of understanding.

Maimonides' use of the Ark as a metaphor for the rational soul is an attempt to reconcile the biblical story with his philosophical beliefs, and emphasizes the importance of the intellect and wisdom in achieving spiritual salvation.

Maimonides' interpretation of the Ark as a metaphor for the rational soul underscores the importance of intellect and morality in navigating through life's challenges. The flood symbolizes the tumultuous sea of passions and desires that, if unchecked, can lead to moral and spiritual downfall. In contrast, the Ark represents our capacity for reason, wisdom, and moral discernment, which can guide us safely through these storms.
When we connect Maimonides' interpretation to the theories discussed earlier, we can see some interesting parallels. Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory can be seen in the Ark's role as a "chatroom" for moral deliberation, where our rational faculties interact and communicate, leading to wise and moral choices.
The Reed Wall Mind theory aligns with Maimonides' idea of a rational soul that structures and organizes our thoughts and experiences, similar to how Noah's Ark was structured to accommodate and protect its inhabitants.
The Motile Womb theory can be connected with the Ark's role in fostering and nurturing our moral and intellectual growth. Just as the Ark moved with the floodwaters, our rational soul dynamically responds to our experiences, evolving and growing as we accumulate wisdom and moral understanding.
Thus, the metaphor of the Ark can be understood as representing not only the cognitive faculties of our mind but also the ethical and rational aspects of our soul. According to Maimonides, the pursuit of wisdom, virtue, and understanding is the means by which we construct this "Ark", allowing us to navigate life's challenges and achieve spiritual fulfillment.
