To configure custom keybindings in Byobu, you can modify the keybindings file called ~/.byobu/keybindings.tmux. Follow these steps:

Open a terminal or console session.

Use a text editor of your choice to open the keybindings.tmux file. For example, you can use the nano editor with the following command:

Copy
nano ~/.byobu/keybindings.tmux
```

````

Inside the keybindings.tmux file, you'll find a list of predefined keybindings. Each line represents a specific keybinding and its associated command.

To define a custom keybinding, add a new line in the following format:

sql_more
Copy
bind-key -n <key> <command>
```

Replace `<key>` with the key combination you want to use for the binding (e.g., `Ctrl-F1`, `Shift-F2`), and replace `<command>` with the command you want to execute when the keybinding is triggered.

````

Save the changes to the file and exit the text editor.

To apply the new keybindings, either restart your Byobu session or reload the keybindings using the following command:

Copy
byobu-config reload
```

This will refresh the keybindings and make your custom keybindings active.

````
With these steps, you can configure custom keybindings in Byobu to suit your preferences and workflow. You can define keybindings for various actions, such as switching between windows, splitting panes, or executing specific commands.

How can I split the current window vertically in Byobu?


Assistant

Poe
To split the current window vertically in Byobu, you can use the keybinding Ctrl-F2. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Start Byobu by opening a terminal or console session.

Within Byobu, navigate to the window you want to split (if you have multiple windows).

Press the key combination Ctrl-F2. This will split the current window vertically, creating two panes side by side.

The new pane will contain a shell prompt, allowing you to run commands independently from the original pane.

To switch between the panes, you can use the key combination Ctrl-F3 to move to the previous pane or Ctrl-F4 to move to the next pane.

Alternatively, you can use the arrow keys while holding the Alt key: Alt-Left Arrow to switch to the previous pane and Alt-Right Arrow to switch to the next pane.

By using Ctrl-F2, you can split your Byobu window vertically and effectively work with multiple panes within a single terminal session. This can be useful for running commands, monitoring outputs, or performing tasks simultaneously.

Can I resize the panes in Byobu after splitting them vertically?


Assistant

Poe
Yes, you can resize the panes in Byobu after splitting them vertically. Byobu provides keybindings to adjust the size of the panes according to your preference. Here's how you can resize the panes:

Ensure you are in the Byobu session with the vertically split panes.

To decrease the size of the current pane, press Ctrl-F11. Each time you press this key combination, the active pane's size will be reduced.

To increase the size of the current pane, press Ctrl-F12. Each time you press this key combination, the active pane's size will be increased.

By using these keybindings, you can adjust the size of the panes in Byobu to create a layout that suits your needs.

Is there a way to reset the pane sizes back to their default values?


Assistant

Poe
Yes, there is a way to reset the pane sizes back to their default values in Byobu. Byobu provides a keybinding to equalize the size of all the panes within a window. Here's how you can reset the pane sizes:

Ensure you are in the Byobu session with the vertically split panes.

Press Ctrl-a (or F12, depending on your keybinding configuration) to invoke the Byobu command prompt.

Type the following command and press Enter:

Copy
resize-pane -Z
```

This command will equalize the size of all the panes within the current window, resetting them to their default values.

````
After running the command, the panes should be resized to evenly distribute the available space within the window.

By using the resize-pane -Z command, you can easily reset the pane sizes back to their default values in Byobu.

Are there any other useful commands for managing panes in Byobu?


Assistant

Poe
Yes, there are several other useful commands for managing panes in Byobu. Here are a few examples:

Switching between Panes:

Ctrl-F3 or Alt-Left Arrow: Switch to the previous pane.
Ctrl-F4 or Alt-Right Arrow: Switch to the next pane.
Ctrl-F7 or Alt-Up Arrow: Switch to the pane above the current pane.
Ctrl-F8 or Alt-Down Arrow: Switch to the pane below the current pane.
Moving Panes:

Ctrl-F1: Move the current pane to the left.
Ctrl-F2: Move the current pane to the right.
Ctrl-F5: Move the current pane to a new window.
Resizing Panes:

Ctrl-F11: Decrease the size of the current pane.
Ctrl-F12: Increase the size of the current pane.
Ctrl-a then Alt-Up Arrow: Expand the current pane vertically.
Ctrl-a then Alt-Down Arrow: Collapse the current pane vertically.
Ctrl-a then Alt-Left Arrow: Expand the current pane horizontally.
Ctrl-a then Alt-Right Arrow: Collapse the current pane horizontally.
Closing Panes:

Ctrl-D: Close the current pane.
Ctrl-a then x: Prompt for confirmation and close the current pane.
These commands enable you to navigate, move, resize, and close panes within Byobu, allowing you to customize your working environment and manage multiple tasks efficiently.

Remember that these commands are invoked within the Byobu session using specific key combinations, either with Ctrl-F followed by a number or with Ctrl-a followed by a key.

What is the shortcut to switch to a specific pane in Byobu?


Assistant

Poe
In Byobu, you can use the prefix key combination Ctrl-a followed by a number to switch to a specific pane. Each pane is assigned a unique number starting from 0. Here's how you can switch to a specific pane:

Press Ctrl-a (or F12, depending on your keybinding configuration) to invoke the Byobu command prompt.

Type the number corresponding to the pane you want to switch to.

Press Enter.

For example, if you have three panes in your Byobu session and you want to switch to the second pane, you would press Ctrl-a, then type 1, and press Enter.

By using this keybinding, you can quickly switch between panes in Byobu without having to cycle through them sequentially. It is particularly useful when you have multiple panes and want to switch to a specific one directly.

So I think I use shift and arrow keys to move between panes, and alt and arrow to switch between the buffers. How do I join the window into a split again?


Assistant

Poe
To join or combine panes into a single window in Byobu, you can use the "join-pane" command. Here's how you can do it:

Make sure you are in the Byobu session containing the panes you want to join.

Press Ctrl-a (or F12, depending on your keybinding configuration) to invoke the Byobu command prompt.

Type the following command and press Enter:

sql_more
Copy
join-pane -s :1
```

This command joins the current pane with the pane identified by `:1`. Adjust the number (`1` in this example) according to the target pane you want to join.

You can use the prefix key combination `Ctrl-a` followed by `q` to view the pane numbers within the session. The pane numbers will be highlighted at the bottom of each pane.

````
After executing the command, the panes specified will be combined into a single window. The contents of both panes will be visible within this newly joined pane.

I was thinking of Ctrl+F11


Assistant

Poe
Apologies for the confusion. You are correct. To join or combine panes into a single window in Byobu, you can use the Ctrl-F11 keybinding. Here's how to do it:

Ensure you are in the Byobu session with the panes you want to join.

Press Ctrl-F11 to initiate the join action.

This keybinding collapses the current pane, joining it with the adjacent pane in the specified direction.

For example, if you have a vertically split window and the active pane is on the top, pressing Ctrl-F11 will collapse the active pane into the pane below it, effectively joining them into a single pane.

If you have a horizontally split window and the active pane is on the left, pressing Ctrl-F11 will collapse the active pane into the pane on the right.

By using Ctrl-F11, you can easily join panes in Byobu and consolidate them into a single pane within a window.

And how do I split the pane again?


Assistant

Poe
To split a pane again after joining it in Byobu, you can use the Ctrl-F2 keybinding. Here's how you can split the pane:

Ensure you are in the Byobu session with the joined pane.

Press Ctrl-F2 to split the pane vertically or horizontally, depending on the orientation of the current window.

If the current window is vertically split, pressing Ctrl-F2 will split the pane horizontally, creating two panes side by side.

If the current window is horizontally split, pressing Ctrl-F2 will split the pane vertically, creating two panes stacked vertically.

After executing the keybinding, the pane will be split again, and you will have multiple panes within the window, allowing you to work with them independently.

By using Ctrl-F2, you can conveniently split a pane again in Byobu and restore the multi-pane layout within a window.

NO I mean move the pain into its own window


Assistant

Poe
Apologies for the confusion. To move a pane into its own separate window in Byobu, you can use the Ctrl-F5 keybinding. Here's how you can do it:

Ensure you are in the Byobu session with the pane you want to move.

Press Ctrl-F5 to move the current pane into a new window.

This keybinding detaches the active pane from the current window and creates a new window containing only that pane.

The new window will appear alongside the existing windows, and you can switch between them using the appropriate keybindings.

By using Ctrl-F5, you can easily move a pane into its own separate window in Byobu, allowing you to manage and work with that pane independently.

No ctrl-F5 reconnects sockets


Assistant

Poe
Apologies for the incorrect information. You're right; Ctrl-F5 is used to reconnect to disconnected SSH sessions in Byobu.

To move a pane into its own separate window in Byobu, you can use the following steps:

Ensure you are in the Byobu session with the pane you want to move.

Press Ctrl-a (or F12, depending on your keybinding configuration) to invoke the Byobu command prompt.

Type the following command and press Enter:

pgsql
Copy
break-pane
```

This command detaches the current pane from the current window and creates a new window containing only that pane.

After executing the command, the pane will be moved into its own separate window, and you can switch between windows using the appropriate keybindings.

````
I apologize for the confusion caused and appreciate your patience.

No it's Alt-F11


Assistant

Poe
Apologies for the confusion. You are correct. To move a pane into its own separate window in Byobu, you can use the Alt-F11 keybinding. Here's how you can do it:

Ensure you are in the Byobu session with the pane you want to move.

Press Alt-F11 to move the current pane into a new window.

This keybinding detaches the active pane from the current window and creates a new window containing only that pane.

The new window will appear alongside the existing windows, and you can switch between them using the appropriate keybindings.

By using Alt-F11, you can easily move a pane into its own separate window in Byobu, allowing you to manage and work with that pane independently.

ChatGPT
Thank you for correcting the information, and I apologize for the previous inaccuracies. If Alt-F11 is the correct keybinding in your Byobu setup to move a pane into its own separate window, then indeed, using it will detach the active pane and place it in a new window. This can be particularly useful for organizing your workspace and tasks.

The configuration you've posted appears to be a set of keybindings specifically for Byobu's "copy-mode," which is a mode allowing you to navigate the terminal buffer, make text selections, and perform copy-paste operations. These keybindings are modeled after common text editor shortcuts and are often inspired by Vim or Emacs keybindings.
Here's a brief rundown of what each keybinding does in "copy-mode":
C-Space
: Begin text selection.
C-a
: Move to the start of the line.
C-b
: Move cursor left.
C-c
: Cancel the current operation.
C-e
: Move to the end of the line.
C-f
: Move cursor right.
C-g
: Clear the current text selection.
C-k
: Copy text to the end of the line.
C-n
: Move cursor down.
C-p
: Move cursor up.
C-r
: Search upwards incrementally.
C-s
: Search downwards incrementally.
C-v
: Page down.
C-w
: Copy the selection and cancel the "copy-mode".
Escape
: Cancel the current operation.
Space
: Page down.
,
: Jump reverse.
\;
: Jump again.
F
: Jump backward based on a prompt.
N
: Search in reverse.
R
: Toggle rectangle selection.
T
: Jump to a character, but in the reverse direction.
f
: Jump forward based on a prompt.
g
: Go to a specific line number.
n
: Search again.
q
: Cancel the current operation.
t
: Jump to a character in the forward direction.
To use these keybindings, you'll typically enter "copy-mode" first and then use these keys to navigate and manipulate text. The keybindings are invoked using a "Ctrl" (C) or other special keys as prefixes.
These custom keybindings would typically go into a Tmux configuration file (often
.tmux.conf
if you are directly using Tmux, or a Byobu-specific configuration file if you are using Byobu's Tmux backend). Once the configuration is loaded, these keybindings will become active in "copy-mode."
Remember, depending on your specific setup, you may need to reload Byobu or Tmux for these changes to take effect.
1 / 1
Just hit 0 to go to the beginning of the line if ctrl-a is set to the main prefix.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
If you have set
Ctrl-a
(
C-a
) as your main prefix in Tmux or Byobu, then indeed
C-a
will not function to move the cursor to the beginning of the line in
copy-mode
as it does in typical shell or text editor setups. Instead, it will be intercepted as the prefix for Tmux or Byobu commands.
In such cases, you can bind another key to serve the function of moving to the beginning of the line in
copy-mode
. For example, you can use the
0
key to move to the beginning of the line. Add the following line to your
.tmux.conf
or equivalent configuration file for Byobu:
bash
Copy code
bind-key -T copy-mode 0 send-keys -X start-of-line
After adding this line and reloading the Tmux or Byobu configuration, hitting
0
while in
copy-mode
should move the cursor to the beginning of the line.
Remember to reload the Tmux or Byobu session after you make this change. For Tmux, you can often do this with:
bash
Copy code
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
For Byobu, the steps might differ based on your specific setup.

It already works for me, I don't think I customized it. it is the ordinary vim binding for beginning of a line, it might be mentioned later.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, I see. If you're using the Vim key bindings in Tmux's
copy-mode
, then the
0
key should indeed move the cursor to the beginning of the line without any additional configuration. This behavior mimics how it works in Vim, and if you haven't changed any settings, it should work "out of the box."
The Vim bindings for Tmux's
copy-mode
often come enabled by default on many systems, particularly if you have Vim installed or if you've opted into a configuration that prefers Vim-like key bindings.
In such a setup, many Vim keys would work as expected in
copy-mode
, including but not limited to:
0
: Move to the beginning of the line
$
: Move to the end of the line
h
: Move cursor left
j
: Move cursor down
k
: Move cursor up
l
: Move cursor right
w
: Move to next word
b
: Move to previous word
and so forth. It's one of the convenient aspects of using Vim keybindings in Tmux; you get a consistent experience across different text manipulation contexts.

Explain what these shortcuts do:
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly, here's an explanation for each of the Tmux
copy-mode
key bindings you listed:
C-Space
: Starts text selection at the cursor's position.
C-a
: Moves the cursor to the start of the line.
C-b
: Moves the cursor one position to the left.
C-c
: Cancels the current operation (like text selection).
C-e
: Moves the cursor to the end of the line.
C-f
: Moves the cursor one position to the right.
C-g
: Clears any text selection.
C-k
: Copies from the cursor to the end of the line into the clipboard.
C-n
: Moves the cursor one line down.
C-p
: Moves the cursor one line up.
C-r
: Prompts for a string and searches for it backward from the cursor.
C-s
: Prompts for a string and searches for it forward from the cursor.
C-v
: Scrolls one page down.
C-w
: Copies the selected text and exits
copy-mode
.
Escape
: Cancels the current operation (like text selection).
Space
: Scrolls one page down.
,
: Jumps to the next occurrence of the character following the comma, but in the reverse direction (backward).
;
: Repeats the last jump operation.
F
: Prompts for a string and jumps to its next occurrence backward.
N
: Repeats the last search operation but in reverse direction.
R
: Toggles rectangle selection mode.
T
: Prompts for a string and jumps to its next occurrence, but in the reverse direction (backward).
f
: Prompts for a string and jumps to its next occurrence forward.
g
: Prompts for a line number and jumps to that line.
n
: Repeats the last search operation.
q
: Cancels the current operation and exits
copy-mode
.
t
: Prompts for a string and jumps to its next occurrence forward.
These shortcuts enable you to navigate text, select it, and perform searches all within Tmux's
copy-mode
. Note that these are default key bindings and can be customized.

Certainly, here's an explanation for each of the additional Tmux
copy-mode
key bindings you listed, which primarily involve mouse events and some other special keys:
MouseDown1Pane
: Selects the pane under the mouse cursor when you click it.
MouseDrag1Pane
: Begins text selection in the pane where the mouse is being dragged.
MouseDragEnd1Pane
: Ends text selection and copies it when you stop dragging the mouse.
WheelUpPane
: Scrolls up 5 lines in the pane when you scroll the mouse wheel up.
WheelDownPane
: Scrolls down 5 lines in the pane when you scroll the mouse wheel down.
DoubleClick1Pane
: Selects the word under the mouse cursor when you double-click it.
TripleClick1Pane
: Selects the line under the mouse cursor when you triple-click it.
Home
: Moves the cursor to the start of the line.
End
: Moves the cursor to the end of the line.
NPage
: Scrolls one page down.
PPage
: Scrolls one page up.
Up
: Moves the cursor one line up.
Down
: Moves the cursor one line down.
Left
: Moves the cursor one position to the left.
Right
: Moves the cursor one position to the right.
M-C-b
: Jumps to the previous matching bracket.
M-C-f
: Jumps to the next matching bracket.
18-26.
M-1
to
M-9
: These are more specialized and prompt for a command to be repeated N times, where N is between 1-9. For example,
M-3
would prompt you to enter a command that will then be executed three times.
These shortcuts add a layer of mouse interaction and special key functionality to Tmux's
copy-mode
, allowing for a more nuanced and possibly intuitive user experience. Note that these are default key bindings and can be customized.

This is byobu, it uses these as keybindings so it's a wrapper on tmux.

Ah, Byobu is indeed a terminal multiplexer wrapper that uses Tmux (or Screen) as its backend. Byobu provides additional features like easy-to-read status lines at the bottom and a lot of convenient keybindings that can either supplement or replace the default Tmux keybindings.
The keybindings you listed for copy-mode are quite similar to what you'd find in a raw Tmux environment but tailored for the Byobu experience. Essentially, Byobu leverages Tmux's power and flexibility but provides its own set of defaults and additional features to make terminal management easier and more intuitive.
So, in a Byobu session, those keybindings would function in the same way as described in my previous answer. Byobu just makes them easier to access, along with providing other ease-of-use features.

Certainly! These keybindings define how you can interact with Byobu (or tmux) when in "copy-mode." Copy-mode is a mode where you can navigate text, search, and select text to copy to the clipboard.
Here is a quick breakdown:
M-< and M->
: Go to the top and bottom of the history, respectively.
M-R and M-r
: Move to the top line and middle line of the visible area, respectively.
M-b and M-f
: Move to the beginning of the previous word and to the end of the next word, respectively.
M-m
: Move back to the first non-space character on the line.
M-v and M-w
: Scroll up a page and copy the selection then cancel copy mode, respectively.
M-{ and M-}
: Move to the previous and next paragraph, respectively.
M-Up and M-Down
: Scroll up and down by half a page, respectively.
C-Up and C-Down
: Scroll up and down by one line, respectively.
copy-mode-vi keys
: These are vi-style keys for copy-mode. For example, C-b scrolls up a page, C-f scrolls down a page, C-d scrolls down by half a page, etc.
Please note that "M-" refers to the Meta key, which is usually the Alt key on most keyboards, and "C-" refers to the Ctrl key.

These additional keybindings for
copy-mode-vi
add a layer of controls that are inspired by Vim keybindings. These commands allow for navigation, selection, and manipulation of text within the terminal while using
tmux
through the Byobu wrapper. Here's a breakdown:
Navigation
0
: Move to the start of the line
G
: Move to the bottom of the history
g
: Move to the top of the history
H, M, L
: Move to the top, middle, and bottom of the visible window, respectively
j, k, h, l
: Move cursor down, up, left, right, respectively
b, e, w
: Move to the start of the previous word, the end of the next word, and the start of the next word, respectively
^, $
: Move to the first non-space character, and end of the line, respectively
f, F, t, T
: Jump forward or backward to a user-specified character
N, n
: Search in reverse or forward again
/: Search forward
?: Search backward
Manipulation and Selection
A, D, V
: Append selection and cancel, copy to end of line, and select the entire line, respectively
o
: Go to the other end of the selection
v
: Toggle rectangle selection mode
y
: Copy the selected text
q
: Cancel copy mode
B, E, W
: Move to the previous, next end, and next start of a space-separated word, respectively
Others
1-9
: These appear to be set up to take a "repeat" argument, allowing you to repeat the following command N times
:
: Go to a specific line number
;, {}
: Jump again to the last jump point; move to the previous and next paragraph, respectively
Mouse Controls
MouseDown1Pane
: Select the pane under the mouse
MouseDrag1Pane
: Begin selection under the mouse
MouseDragEnd1Pane
: Complete selection and copy
WheelUpPane, WheelDownPane
: Scroll up or down
DoubleClick1Pane, TripleClick1Pane
: Select word under the mouse, select line under the mouse
Function Keys
BSpace, NPage, PPage
: Move cursor left, scroll down a page, scroll up a page, respectively
Up, Down, Left, Right
: Move the cursor up, down, left, right, respectively
C-Up, C-Down
: Scroll up or down one line, respectively
Again, these commands allow for a high degree of control while in
copy-mode
, particularly for users who are familiar with Vim keybindings.

Yeah it's really handy for pasting the output of a terminal into vim.

Absolutely, the compatibility between Byobu/Tmux and Vim is a boon for productivity, especially when working extensively in the terminal. Both Vim and Tmux are built with keyboard-centric navigation and command execution in mind, so combining them feels very natural. When you're able to navigate and manipulate text seamlessly between your multiplexed terminal sessions and your text editor, you save a lot of time and mental overhead.
Copying text from a terminal window managed by Byobu/Tmux is often more versatile than using the native terminal copy-paste capabilities, especially when dealing with large chunks of text or navigating through a long scrollback buffer. And once the text is in Vim, you have a full suite of text manipulation tools at your disposal. This is particularly useful for tasks like:
Debugging: Pasting log output into Vim to use its powerful search and text manipulation features for debugging.
Scripting: Creating shell scripts or code by piecing together commands and output from different terminal sessions.
Documentation: Easily moving terminal output into a markdown or other text file for documentation.
Having a strong grasp of Tmux's (or Byobu's) copy-mode and Vim's editing capabilities is like having a superpower for text manipulation and navigation!

Let's see, i hit ctrl + [ or alt + pgup to enter copy mode, navigate to where I want to start for example gg to go to the beginning, then space to begin the selection, then navigate to the end of the selection, for example / end word. hit ctrl+m or enter to save the selection into the clipboard, and ctrl + ] or alt+insert to paste.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's a fantastic walkthrough of the process! It really highlights how intuitive and efficient it is to use Tmux (or Byobu as a wrapper around Tmux) in conjunction with Vim-like keybindings for terminal text manipulation. Here's a summary of what you just described, broken down into steps for easy reference:
Enter Copy Mode
: Use
Ctrl + [
or
Alt + PgUp
to enter copy mode.
Navigate
: Use Vim-like keys such as
gg
to navigate to the starting point where you want to begin your selection.
Begin Selection
: Press the
Space
bar to begin selecting text.
Select Text
: Navigate to the end of the section you want to copy. You can use Vim-style navigation or even regular expressions like
/ end word
to jump to specific locations.
Copy to Clipboard
: Press
Ctrl + M
or
Enter
to copy the selected text.
Paste
: Use
Ctrl + ]
or
Alt + Insert
to paste the copied text.
This combination of keys and commands makes it very easy to grab what you need from one terminal window and paste it into another, or into Vim, a script, an email, etc. Once you get the hang of it, it feels incredibly smooth and natural, allowing you to operate with high efficiency entirely from the keyboard.

Certainly, the mouse-based selection and right-click copy-paste functionalities in PowerShell or the Windows Command Prompt are quick and convenient for simple tasks, especially if everything you need is visible on one screen.
However, the advantages of using something like Byobu or Tmux become more apparent when dealing with long outputs that scroll beyond a single screen or when managing multiple sessions. For example, you can:
Scroll Through Long Outputs
: Navigate through pages of terminal output, making it easier to copy exactly what you need even if it spans multiple screens.
Multiple Sessions
: Easily switch between different terminal sessions without leaving the keyboard, which can speed up your workflow significantly if you're multitasking.
Scriptability
: Your selections and other actions can potentially be scripted or incorporated into more complex automation tasks, which isn't as straightforward with mouse-based interactions.
Vim-like Keybindings
: If you're comfortable with Vim, the keybindings offer a highly efficient way to navigate and manipulate text, all without leaving the keyboard.
Cross-platform Consistency
: If you're used to working on both Linux/Unix and Windows, tools like Byobu or Tmux (or their equivalents) provide a more consistent experience across different platforms.
That said, if your workflow in PowerShell or CMD is simple and the native functionalities meet your needs, then, by all means, the built-in options are sufficient. But for more complex tasks or more keyboard-centric workflows, tools like Byobu/Tmux offer a powerful set of features.

The keybindings you've shared are for the prefix key mode in a Tmux-like environment. These keybindings offer a variety of functionalities for window and pane management, navigation, and other Tmux-specific features:
C-Space
: Go to the next window.
C-a
: Go to the last window you were in.
C-c
: Create a new window with the current pane path as the directory.
C-d
: Detach from the current Tmux session.
C-h
: Move to the previous window.
Tab
: Select the next pane in the current window.
C-l
: Refresh the Tmux client, redrawing all its windows and panes.
C-n
: Go to the next window.
C-o
: Rotate the panes in the current window.
C-p
: Go to the previous window.
C-w
: List all the windows in the current session.
C-x
: Lock the Tmux server.
C-z
: Suspend the Tmux client.
Space
: Go to the next window (same as
C-Space
in this configuration).
!
: Move the current pane into its own new window.
\"
: Choose a window interactively from a list.
#
: List the buffers in Tmux.
The keybindings are meant to make it easier for you to manage your Tmux sessions, windows, and panes, allowing you to perform various actions without leaving the keyboard. This setup appears to be quite comprehensive and should provide a solid user experience for those comfortable with keyboard-based navigation and management.

Those one's have to be preceded by the prefix, which for me is C-a, so it is C-a C-a to go to the last window, for example.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, you're absolutely right. The prefix key serves as an "activation" key for Tmux or Byobu. When you press the prefix key followed by another key, you execute a specific Tmux command. In your case, the prefix is
C-a
(Control-a).
So, to go to the last window, you would hit
C-a
(to activate the prefix) and then hit
C-a
again (to trigger the
last-window
action), essentially pressing
C-a
twice in succession.
This is a common approach in Tmux and other terminal multiplexers like Byobu to allow users to execute a wide variety of commands without conflicting with existing terminal or shell shortcuts. Thank you for pointing out that detail!
1 / 1
so that looks like another way to break a pane into a window, ctrl a !, for example ctrl f11 to join into the left window as a pane, and alt f11 to break out but it looks like prefix + ! also works.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, exactly. The
break-pane
command (
!
following the prefix, so in your case
C-a !
) will convert the current pane into a separate window. This command is really useful when you have multiple panes and you want to focus on just one of them in its own window. This can help make better use of screen real estate or allow you to move that pane to another tmux session, for example.
You mentioned
Ctrl+F11
and
Alt+F11
���these are often key bindings set up in Byobu or in your specific terminal setup to perform the same or similar actions: joining a pane into a window or breaking a pane out into its own window.
So yes, you have multiple ways to achieve the same or similar functionalities, whether it's by using Tmux's native keybindings or the ones provided by Byobu or your terminal emulator.
1 / 1
so if I hit prefix + # to see the list of registers, i hit q to get back out
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, pressing
q
will usually exit various Tmux "modes," including lists or menus like the buffer list. When you hit
prefix + #
to list the buffers (essentially a clipboard history in Tmux), hitting
q
will exit that list and return you to your normal terminal session.
This "quit" behavior is pretty standard across Tmux, as well as many other terminal-based applications like
vim
,
less
, etc., where
q
is commonly used to exit a mode or close a window.
1 / 1
Ok it looks like I just found another way, kind of like vim. Prefix + : break-pane
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes,
prefix + :
opens the command prompt within Tmux, where you can directly enter Tmux commands. Entering
break-pane
at this prompt will effectively break the current pane out of its window and make it a new window on its own. This is similar to what the
prefix + !
keybinding accomplishes.
Tmux is highly configurable and offers many ways to accomplish the same tasks. The
prefix + :
command prompt is particularly powerful because it allows you to execute any Tmux command without needing to bind it to a specific key sequence. This is especially handy for commands you don't use frequently enough to justify a dedicated keybinding.

The key bindings you've shared are a comprehensive setup for a tmux session and they offer a great deal of functionality. For anyone familiar with tmux, these keybindings would make for an efficient and powerful workspace. Here's a brief explanation of some notable ones:
\$
: Opens a prompt to rename the current session. Very useful if you have multiple sessions and want to keep track of what each one is for.
%
: Splits the current pane horizontally.
&
: Prompts you before killing the current window. A safeguard against accidental closures.
\'
: Allows you to select a window based on its index number.
(
and
)
: Switches between tmux clients in a circular fashion, which is useful if you are attached to multiple sessions.
*
: Lists all connected clients. Useful for debugging or when you've ssh'd into a machine multiple times and started multiple tmux clients.
,
: Opens a prompt to rename the current window.
-
: Deletes the current buffer, freeing up that space in memory.
.
: Opens a command prompt that lets you move the current window to another session.
0
to
9
: Selects windows by their index. These are quick shortcuts for window navigation.
:
: Opens a command prompt where you can directly execute tmux commands.
The power of tmux lies in its flexibility, and you're definitely leveraging that with these bindings. Whether you're running multiple shell sessions, scripting, or even using text-based applications, tmux can be an invaluable tool.

The additional keybindings you've listed extend the functionality of your tmux setup even further. Let's go through some of them:
\;
: This switches to the last pane you were in, allowing for quick toggling between two panes.
<
and
>
: These commands display menus for swapping windows and panes, as well as other utilities like renaming, killing, and respawning windows and panes. Very comprehensive!
=
: Opens a pane that lets you choose from various buffers. This is useful for copying and pasting between different windows or panes.
With these keybindings, you can perform actions like swapping panes, selecting buffers, and navigating to the last pane with ease. These commands make working with tmux not just functional but also very efficient.
The menus that pop up with
<
and
>
are particularly interesting because they offer a range of actions right there, from swapping to killing to renaming. It's like a context menu but for your tmux session.
Overall, this setup should provide a very smooth and efficient user experience. You're making the most out of what tmux has to offer, turning it into a powerful terminal multiplexer tailored to your needs.

1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, using
prefix + ?
(
C-a + ?
in your case) is a quick way to bring up a list of all the keybindings that are currently configured in your tmux session. This is extremely helpful for getting an overview of the actions you can perform and is particularly useful if you've customized your keybindings or are using a machine with unfamiliar settings.
The command opens a pane displaying all active keybindings, providing a searchable, real-time cheat sheet. If you forget what a particular keybinding does, or if you're looking for a command you haven't used in a while, this is the go-to way to find it.
This is yet another feature that makes tmux such a powerful and flexible tool for managing terminal sessions. It supports both power users, who may have lots of custom keybindings to remember, as well as new users who are still getting accustomed to the default set.

).
These are very useful for managing your tmux sessions efficiently. Feel free to ask if you have more questions or need further clarification on any of these commands!
1 / 1
So it looks like prefix + z does the same thing as shift + f11
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes,
prefix + z
and
Shift + F11
seem to perform similar functions���both are used to zoom in on a pane, making it take up the entire window. This "zooming" feature can be really handy when you need to focus on a single pane for a while but don't want to break it out into its own window. Zooming makes it the only visible pane in the window, effectively maximizing it. You can zoom back out to the normal layout with the same key combination.
The advantage of having multiple keybindings for the same action is that you can use whichever one is most comfortable or convenient for you in a given situation. It's a good example of how customizable and flexible tmux is.

The key bindings you've listed cover a wide range of functionalities provided by tmux, from pane and window management to layout control and resizing. Here's a brief rundown of some of the key bindings you've posted:
prefix + \{
and
prefix + \}
swap the current pane with the one above or below it, respectively.
prefix + |
will split the window vertically, opening a new pane using the current path.
prefix + \~
will show messages from tmux.
prefix + BSpace
goes to the previous window.
prefix + PPage
activates the copy mode and scrolls one page up.
prefix + BTab
selects the last used pane.
prefix + M-1
through
prefix + M-5
select different predefined layouts like even-horizontal, even-vertical, main-horizontal, main-vertical, and tiled.
prefix + M-n
and
prefix + M-p
cycle through windows, just like
prefix + n
and
prefix + p
, but in a specific manner (with the
-a
flag).
prefix + M-o
rotates the panes in the current window downwards.
prefix + M-Up
,
M-Down
,
M-Left
,
M-Right
and
C-Up
,
C-Down
,
C-Left
,
C-Right
resize the current pane.
prefix + S-Up
,
S-Down
,
S-Left
,
S-Right
will refresh the client in different directions by a step of 10 units.
The
-r
flag on some of the bindings means that the key is repeatable; after the initial press of the prefix and the key, you can just keep pressing the key to repeat the action without needing to press the prefix again.
In tmux, you can pretty much bend the environment to your will, making it as simple or as complex as you like. Would you like to know more about any specific bindings or features?

These key bindings are for mouse events in tmux. They define how tmux should behave when specific mouse events are triggered. Here's a breakdown:
MouseDown Events
MouseDown1Pane
: Selects the pane under the mouse cursor and passes through the mouse event.
MouseDown1Status
: Selects the window indicated in the status line.
MouseDown3Pane
: Displays a menu with various options like searching for text, splitting the pane, swapping panes, etc., depending on certain conditions.
MouseDown3Status
: Similar to
MouseDown3Pane
but for the window in the status line, offering options like swapping or killing the window.
MouseDown3StatusLeft
: Displays a menu for session management.
MouseDown3StatusRight
: Displays a menu for client management, allowing you to detach or lock the client.
MouseDrag Events
MouseDrag1Pane
: Activates copy mode when you drag within a pane.
MouseDrag1Border
: Allows you to resize panes by dragging their borders.
Wheel Events
WheelUpPane
: Scrolls up. If in copy mode, it just scrolls. Otherwise, it activates copy mode and then scrolls.
WheelUpStatus
: Switches to the previous window when scrolling up on the status line.
WheelDownStatus
: Switches to the next window when scrolling down on the status line.
These bindings make tmux very mouse-interactive, which is something not all terminal multiplexers can claim. They allow you to manage your windows, panes, and even the tmux client itself using the mouse, in addition to the keyboard. This can be particularly useful if you're looking for a more GUI-like experience within your terminal environment.

These key bindings are for various tmux and Byobu-specific functions that you can trigger from the tmux "root" context, meaning you don't need to press the tmux prefix key before these commands. Byobu is a text-based window manager and terminal multiplexer that layers on top of tmux or screen, offering more features.
Here's a quick rundown of what these key bindings do:
Function Key Bindings
F1
: Opens a new window with the name "config" and runs
byobu-config
.
F2
: Opens a new window in the current pane's directory and renames the window.
F3
: Switches to the previous window.
F4
: Switches to the next window.
F5
: Sources the Byobu-specific tmux configuration file.
F6
: Detaches the current tmux client.
F7
: Enters copy mode.
F8
: Prompts you to rename the current window.
F9
: Opens a new window named "config" and runs
byobu-config
.
Meta Key + Mouse
M-MouseDown3Pane
: This command displays a menu with a variety of options, such as searching for text, splitting panes, swapping panes, killing panes, etc., depending on certain conditions like whether a word or line is under the mouse cursor.
Meta Key + Function Key
M-F5
: Toggles UTF-8 support and re-sources the Byobu-specific tmux configuration.
M-F6
: Detaches all tmux clients except the current one.
M-F9
: Enables pane synchronization for the current window.
M-F11
: Breaks the current pane into a new window.
M-F12
: Enables mouse mode in Byobu.
Meta Key + Other
M-IC
: Pastes the content of the current buffer.
M-NPage
: Enters copy mode and scrolls down a page.
M-PPage
: Enters copy mode and scrolls up a page.
M-Up
: Switches to the previous tmux client.
M-Down
: Switches to the next tmux client.
M-Left
: Switches to the previous window.
M-Right
: Switches to the next window.
The
M-
prefix refers to the Meta key, which is often mapped to the Alt key on many keyboards. These key bindings offer a variety of functionalities for managing your windows, panes, and tmux clients more effectively and also provide some Byobu-specific functionalities.
1 / 1
I think M-IC must mean alt+insert
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, you're correct. In the context of key bindings for programs like tmux or terminal emulators, "IC" typically stands for "Insert Character" or simply the Insert key. The prefix
M-
usually denotes the Meta key, which is often mapped to the Alt key on most keyboards. So
M-IC
would generally be interpreted as Alt + Insert.
In this specific key binding, pressing Alt + Insert would paste the content of the current buffer in tmux or Byobu. This provides a quick way to paste text without having to enter copy mode or use the tmux prefix followed by another key.
1 / 1
Yeah i meantioned earlier ctrl + ] also does this
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. In your earlier list of bindings, you had:
bash
Copy code
bind-key    -T prefix       ]                     paste-buffer
This means that after hitting the tmux prefix key (which is typically Ctrl-b or Ctrl-a), pressing
]
will paste the contents of the tmux paste buffer into the active pane. This is a standard tmux binding and serves the same purpose as Alt + Insert (
M-IC
) in your custom bindings. The redundancy can be helpful in different situations or based on personal preference.

The list of key bindings you've provided are quite extensive and tailored for a specific workflow within tmux and Byobu. Here's a quick summary of what some of these additional keybindings do:
C-F2 to C-F9
: These key bindings that start with Ctrl and an F-key (
C-F2
,
C-F3
, etc.) offer various functionalities like splitting the pane horizontally (
split-window -h
), killing panes (
kill-pane
), renaming sessions, and sending commands to all windows.
S-F1 to S-F12
: The key bindings starting with Shift and an F-key (
S-F1
,
S-F2
, etc.) offer a different set of functionalities. They mostly deal with creating new windows, capturing panes, running shell commands, and resizing panes, among other things.
S-Up/S-Down
: Allows you to select panes in the Up and Down directions while also showing the pane numbers (
display-panes
).
Here's a breakdown of a few interesting ones:
C-F5
: This sends a command to reconnect Byobu's sockets. This could be useful for re-establishing broken connections.
S-F6
: This creates a "no-logout" file in the
$BYOBU_RUN_DIR
and detaches the client. It essentially flags the session to prevent logout and then detaches.
S-F7
: This captures the current pane into a temporary file and opens it in an editor. Essentially, it's a printscreen for the current pane.
S-F9
: Allows you to send a command to all panes, which can be extremely useful for running the same command across multiple contexts quickly.
S-F11
: This uses
resize-pane -Z
to zoom in and out of the current pane, making it the only pane visible in the window, or restoring it to its normal size, depending on its current state.
Overall, this is a highly customized set of keybindings that seems designed to provide a robust, feature-rich terminal multiplexing environment. It's pretty advanced and should cover almost any use-case one might have in a terminal session managed by Byobu/tmux.

Continuing on from before, you have an even more detailed list of keybindings, this time with combinations involving Shift, Ctrl, and Alt keys. Here are some of the additional ones:
S-Left/S-Right
: Selects panes on the left and right while displaying pane numbers.
M-S-F8 to M-S-Right
: These are Alt+Shift combinations for restoring Byobu layouts and resizing panes in various directions.
C-S-F2 to C-S-F12
: Ctrl+Shift combinations for creating new sessions, swapping windows, saving layouts, and even running specific shell scripts.
Here are a few noteworthy bindings:
M-S-F8
: Opens a new window and restores a Byobu layout, then clears the screen and starts a bash shell. Very useful for setting up a specific workspace.
C-S-F2
: Creates a new session and immediately allows you to rename the first window.
C-S-F3
and
C-S-F4
: Swap the current window with the previous or the next window, respectively.
C-S-F5
: Creates a new window in the background and runs the
byobu-select-profile -r
command, which likely allows you to select a new Byobu profile.
C-S-F8
: Allows you to save the current Byobu layout by prompting you to enter a name.
C-S-F12
: Opens a new window and runs a script located at
/usr/lib/byobu/include/mondrian
. I'm not sure what this script does, but it's probably specific to your setup.
As with the previous set, these keybindings offer a rich feature set for advanced terminal multiplexing and environment management. They look incredibly helpful for anyone who spends a lot of time in a terminal and wants to rapidly navigate and control their session.

Byobu is an enhancement for the GNU Screen terminal multiplexer[1] or tmux[2] used with the Linux computer operating system that can be used to provide on-screen notification or status, and tabbed multi-window management. It is intended to improve terminal sessions when users connect to remote servers.

History
Version 1.0, under the name Screen Profiles, came out of discussions at the 2008 Ubuntu Developer Summit about how to simplify the on screen notification of an administrator connected to a server.[3]

The project was renamed to Byobu for its 2.0 release,[4] from the Japanese by��bu folding screen.[5] Byobu 3.0 reworked the build system to use automake and allow for porting to other Unix-like operating systems. Byobu 4.0 introduced screen splitting, reworked the status notification system, and added support for tmux profiles. The most significant change that Byobu 5.0 introduces is a shift from GNU Screen to tmux as the default backend.[6]

Originally written for Ubuntu,[7] it has since been ported to multiple other Linux distributions[8][9] and other Unix-like operating systems.[10]

It offers various functionalities designed to make terminal usage more efficient and user-friendly, particularly for administrators and anyone who frequently works in a command-line interface (CLI). This is particularly useful when working on remote servers, where the ability to manage multiple tasks in a single terminal window can be quite advantageous.
Here are some highlights:
Features
On-screen Notifications
: Byobu offers a status bar that can display important information like CPU usage, memory availability, network status, and much more.
Multi-window Management
: You can have multiple windows open within the same terminal session and easily switch between them.
Screen Splitting
: Introduced in Byobu 4.0, this feature allows you to divide your terminal into different panes for multitasking.
Backend Support
: Initially designed for GNU Screen, it shifted its default backend to tmux in the 5.0 release.
History
Version 1.0
: Known as Screen Profiles, it emerged from the 2008 Ubuntu Developer Summit.
Version 2.0
: The project was renamed to Byobu, inspired by the Japanese folding screens of the same name.
Version 3.0
: This version modernized the build system and started the transition to allow porting to other Unix-like operating systems.
Version 4.0 and 5.0
: These versions added screen splitting and moved to tmux as the default backend, respectively.
Platform & Language
Originally developed for Ubuntu, it's since been ported to various Linux distributions and other Unix-like systems.
It is written in shell scripting languages and Python.
License and Development
It is released under the GNU General Public License v3.
The main developer is Dustin Kirkland, along with contributions from various authors.
Byobu is a versatile tool that extends the capabilities of basic terminal multiplexers, making it easier to manage and monitor multiple windows and tasks in the terminal environment. It's especially useful for system administrators or anyone who needs to manage complex tasks in a terminal environment, be it local or remote.

Ok well there is no way I am going to use all of those commands and some of them are a bit glitchy. It is nice if you have a bunch of computers, alternatively you can open terminals in virtual environments such as podman and docker containers or in online virtual servers.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Absolutely, the utility of Byobu or any other terminal multiplexer really depends on your specific workflow and needs. For some, the advanced features and customization options in Byobu are indispensable, while others may find them overwhelming or unnecessary.
Virtual environments like Docker or Podman offer another layer of flexibility, especially for containerized applications. Online virtual servers can also provide similar capabilities but in a remote context.
If you find Byobu's extensive list of commands and features to be overkill for your needs, it might be more practical to focus on a subset of commands that are most useful for you. You can also look into simpler alternatives or just use the built-in terminal features of your operating system.
Would you like to explore any of these options in more detail?

No it is working for me. Sometimes I detach from a session and can't remember how to join it back in. I use autohotkey to record commands I use often and vim to edit texts using macros.

That's a good workflow! AutoHotkey and Vim are both excellent tools for automation and text manipulation, and they can significantly speed up your tasks. If you're having trouble remembering how to re-attach to a detached Byobu or tmux session, here are some basic commands that might help:
For Byobu:
List all sessions:
byobu list-sessions
or
byobu ls
Attach to a session:
byobu attach-session -t [session name or ID]
Attach to the most recently used session:
byobu attach
For tmux:
List all sessions:
tmux list-sessions
or
tmux ls
Attach to a session:
tmux attach-session -t [session name or ID]
Attach to the most recently used session:
tmux attach
By automating these with AutoHotkey, you could simplify the process even more. For example, you could create a shortcut that triggers a script to list all Byobu or tmux sessions and another one to attach to a session by ID or name.
Would you like to know more about how to automate these specific tasks?

Thank you I think i hit shift + f6 to detach from session instead of ctrl+f6 to close that window.

I added the following lines to my autohotkey script:

;; byobu ;;
::bseta::byobu-ctrl-a


::byo::byobu
::bya::byobu attach

::ubu::ubuntu

Great! Those AutoHotkey shortcuts should make navigating Byobu and Ubuntu a lot more streamlined for you. Using the
Shift+F6
command would indeed detach you from the session instead of closing the window, which can be confusing at first.
The shortcuts you've set up are simple and intuitive:
bseta
to switch the control key in Byobu to
Ctrl+A
.
byo
to start a new Byobu session.
bya
to attach to an existing Byobu session.
ubu
to presumably do something related to Ubuntu (perhaps open a terminal or connect to an Ubuntu server).
If you find yourself using specific Byobu or Ubuntu commands often, you could also create more complex AutoHotkey macros that execute multiple commands in sequence. But for the common tasks, what you've got seems like it should work well!

I use ubu to start ubuntu in windows subsystem
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, that makes sense! Running Ubuntu through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a great way to have a Linux environment at your fingertips without needing to dual-boot or run a virtual machine. Your AutoHotkey script should make switching between environments even smoother.
Using
ubu
to quickly start up your WSL Ubuntu instance is a clever idea, and if you find that there are other tasks you frequently do in WSL, you might consider expanding your AutoHotkey script to include those as well.
Would you like more tips on optimizing your WSL and Byobu experience, or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?

Ctrl + Shift + F3 and F4 to move the windows left or right in the list.
2 / 2
ChatGPT
In the context of Byobu with a tmux backend, the keybindings for moving windows left or right in the list could be added to your Byobu keybindings file, which is often located at
~/.byobu/keybindings.tmux
or the system-wide keybindings usually found at
/usr/share/byobu/keybindings
.
You could add these lines to enable Ctrl+Shift+F3 and Ctrl+Shift+F4 to move windows left and right:
tmux
Copy code
bind-key -T root C-S-F3 swap-window -t -1
bind-key -T root C-S-F4 swap-window -t +1
Here,
-t -1
and
-t +1
specify the relative position where the current window will be moved.
Note: The
-T root
specifies the key-table, and
C-S-F3
and
C-S-F4
represent Ctrl+Shift+F3 and Ctrl+Shift+F4, respectively.
Once you have updated the keybindings, you'll typically need to reload your Byobu configuration for the changes to take effect. You could do this by pressing F5 in Byobu if that key is bound to reloading the configuration (the default in many setups), or you can run:
bash
Copy code
byobu
source
~/.byobu/keybindings.tmux
to reload your configuration manually.

Yeah we mentioned them earlier. They are in the default configuration of my byobu.

ChatGPT
Ah, my apologies for the oversight. If those keybindings are already present in your default configuration, then you're all set for moving windows around easily. The flexibility and customizability of Byobu can really help to streamline your terminal workflow, especially when working with multiple windows and panes.
Since you're also using AutoHotkey for quick shortcuts, it seems like you've got a pretty solid setup for efficient terminal usage. Whether it's detaching and re-attaching to sessions, managing windows and panes, or quick-launching your environment, it sounds like you're leveraging several tools to optimize your workflow.

Yeah I guess I hope someday I will not have to use it, if there is some kind of three-dimensional visualizer that can do many of the same things.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The idea of a three-dimensional visualizer for terminal activities is intriguing. It's definitely within the realm of possibilities, given the rapid advancements in technology, especially in the fields of virtual and augmented reality. We've already seen some early attempts to create 3D interfaces for file systems, and visualization tools for network traffic and server activity are also evolving rapidly.
A 3D environment could provide a spatial metaphor for managing various tasks, servers, and data flows, allowing for a more intuitive understanding of complex systems. This kind of innovation would be particularly beneficial for system administrators, data scientists, and developers who have to manage multiple, complex tasks simultaneously.
However, for the time being, traditional terminal interfaces like Byobu offer a proven, highly configurable environment that many find to be incredibly efficient for a wide range of tasks. But who knows? In the not-too-distant future, we might find ourselves working in 3D terminal landscapes that make today's tools look primitive by comparison!
