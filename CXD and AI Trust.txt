Ron Itelman: "Cognitive Experience Design (CXD): Designing AI Systems for Trust"

A fundamental challenge in active inference is observing and verifying beliefs when designing intelligent systems composed of human and machine learners.This talk presents an approach that makes AI decision-making processes transparent and verifiable, similar to how git makes code changes visible. 

As protocols for integrating LLMs with applications emerge (e.g., Anthropic's Model-Context-Protocol), we now have opportunities to combine deterministic and probabilistic components in a control systems approach. By introducing a clear design framework for capturing and verifying both human and AI intent, this talk introduces how to enable continuous, real-time belief updating with clear lineage. 

Through practical examples and reference implementations, this talk shows how to create feedback mechanisms that capture problem-solving processes and enable real-time recommendations for knowledge and decision-making.

Thought about cognitive experience design and AI for 8 seconds
Summary of the Talk
In
ActInf GuestStream #096.1
, Ron Itelman discusses the concept of
Cognitive Experience Design (CXD)
and how it can be used to create AI systems that humans can trust. Below are the main ideas covered in the talk:
1. The Core Challenge: Observing and Verifying Beliefs
Active Inference Context
: In active inference systems, both humans and machines maintain evolving ���beliefs��� about the environment. The challenge lies in making these beliefs visible, updatable, and verifiable.
Git Analogy
: As git provides transparency over code changes and facilitates collaboration, we need mechanisms that similarly expose and track AI decision-making processes and belief revisions.
2. Combining Deterministic and Probabilistic Components
Model-Context-Protocol Emergence
: Anthropic���s approach (and similar frameworks) illustrates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be integrated into broader applications. This opens the door to combining:
Deterministic Components
(e.g., rule-based or explicit logic)
Probabilistic Components
(e.g., LLMs or Bayesian updates)
Control Systems Approach
: By thinking of the human-AI interaction as a control loop, engineers can continuously refine and update beliefs or ���states of knowledge��� based on new evidence.
3. Designing for Trust via CXD
Capturing and Verifying Intent
: CXD sets out a method for clarifying
why
certain decisions are made by both humans and AI components. This includes:
Storing
human intent
(e.g., business rules, preferences)
Storing
AI inferences
(e.g., LLM reasoning steps)
Lineage and Provenance
: Just as version control logs code changes, CXD aims to track the lineage of all changes in the AI���s ���mental model,��� showing how beliefs shift over time.
4. Real-Time Belief Updating
Continuous Feedback Loop
: By capturing inputs (human interventions, new data sources, context changes) and outputs (inferences, recommended actions) in real-time, systems can continuously learn and adapt.
Visible Reasoning Trails
: Instead of ���black box��� outputs, the system would expose how it arrived at a recommendation. This is key to building trust with end-users.
5. Practical Implementations and Reference Architectures
Feedback Mechanisms
: To reinforce trust and continual learning, Itelman proposes:
User Interfaces
that prompt for user rationale and capture those inputs in structured form.
Backend Logging Systems
that record each step of AI/human decision-making processes.
Automated Recommendations
that arise from analyzing both the system���s logs (machine inferences) and user-provided context (human judgement).
Control System Loop
: These reference architectures often resemble a ���sense ��� interpret ��� decide ��� act��� cycle, with explicit logging at each stage and the possibility to roll back or adjust in real-time.
6. Key Takeaways
Transparency as a Design Requirement
: Just as code transparency aids debugging and collaboration, the ability to see
why
an AI system believes something is essential for trust.
Hybrid AI Systems
: Future AI architectures benefit from incorporating both deterministic rules and probabilistic models, supervised by real-time feedback loops.
Traceable Belief Updates
: Effective CXD ensures that each update in AI or human reasoning can be traced back, validated, and (when necessary) contested or revised.
User and Machine Co-Adaptation
: By exposing the system���s ���train of thought��� and capturing user intent, both machines and humans evolve their mental models together, leading to more accurate and trustworthy outcomes.
In essence, Ron Itelman���s talk highlights how a clear design framework���combining transparent AI reasoning, human oversight, and continuous feedback���can overcome the biggest hurdle in real-world AI systems:
how to trust what the machine is thinking and why it is recommending certain actions
.

Here is the updated list now: The leading page
First two decades
Top-100 list
edit
(December 1, 2007 ��� January 1, 2023).

COVID-19 appeared on the all-time list in June 2020; the page did not exist in the beginning of the year. In this respect, COVID-19 is the biggest phenomenon Wikipedia has ever known.

Donald Trump became the first person to reach 200 million views and overall second only after his country. On January 20, 2021, the day he left office and refused to attend Biden's inauguration, he surpassed the United States for the all-time lead among the ranked pages in what we know as the first change of the leading page. The 2021 storming of the United States Capitol gave him the decisive push. By notable contrast, his predecessor Barack Obama could not reach the U.S. in two terms. Joe Biden debuted on the list on November 12, 2020.

In 2021, Manchester United became the first sports team to enter the list.

In the first trimester of 2022, Vladimir Putin debuted on the list. Among the non-English speaking politicians, he became the first active state leader, the first living political leader, and overall second only to Adolf Hitler. Synchronously, Russia progressed 14 places and Will Smith 12 places.

Below is an
overview and commentary
on the updated top Wikipedia page statistics covering December 1, 2007 ��� January 1, 2023, as presented in your list. These observations focus on
major shifts
,
record-breaking pages
, and
notable newcomers
.
1. Key Historical Context in the Update
COVID-19 as a Record Phenomenon
COVID-19
(and related pages) surged onto Wikipedia in early 2020, quickly amassing enough views to join the all-time most-viewed pages���despite not existing at the year���s start.
This trajectory marks COVID-19 as
���the biggest phenomenon Wikipedia has ever known,���
highlighting just how rapidly public interest drove traffic.
Donald Trump vs. the United States
Historically, the
United States
article had been the undisputed top-ranked page for years.
Donald Trump became the
first person
to reach 200 million views, and���briefly around January 20, 2021 (the day he left office)���he
surpassed
the U.S. page.
His page views spiked during major events like the
2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol
and his refusal to attend Joe Biden���s inauguration.
In the
new snapshot
, the list shows the U.S. retaking the #1 spot (254M) and Trump at #2 (243M) for this cumulative period. The text implies there was a brief moment he led���but overall, after additional data, the U.S. stands at #1 again.
Joe Biden���s Debut
Joe Biden
enters the top list
on November 12, 2020, reflecting surging interest leading into his presidency.
Manchester United F.C.
In 2021,
Manchester United
became the first
sports team

This underscores the global popularity of football (soccer) and the club���s fan base.
Vladimir Putin Appears
Putin���s page joined the top list in early 2022, marking him as:
The first
active
state leader (other than U.S. presidents) to appear on the list.
The first
living
non-English-speaking political leader on the list.
Overall, second politician from outside the English-speaking world after
Adolf Hitler
in absolute view count.
Simultaneously, the
Russia
page gained 14 places���likely reflecting surging interest during heightened international tensions���and
Will Smith
moved up by 12 places around the same timeframe.
2. Highlights from the Current Rankings
Dominance of Wikipedia Utility Pages

Manchester United
blazing the trail for sports teams.
In Closing
The
updated cumulative data
for Wikipedia page views from December 1, 2007, through January 1, 2023, reflects
how major news events, geopolitical shifts, celebrity culture, and universal interests
shape large-scale online reading. While the

That last one was what inspired my essay on null convention logic.
ChatGPT
Thought about null convention logic for a few seconds
That���s intriguing!
Null convention logic (NCL)
is not something you see mentioned every day���especially in the same context as balloon-floating Lamborghinis or giant 3D-printed ice cream cones. Yet, if one of these imaginative MrBeast-style scenarios somehow sparked the inspiration for your essay on NCL, it���s a great reminder of how creativity in one domain can stimulate fresh perspectives in another.
Quick Overview of Null Convention Logic
Definition
Null Convention Logic
is an approach to
asynchronous circuit design
���meaning it does not rely on a global clock signal.
Instead, NCL circuits use data-valid and data-null states to signal the presence or absence of valid data, enabling components to operate only when needed rather than at discrete clock pulses.
Key Features
Handshaking Protocols
: Circuits communicate ���I have data��� / ���I���m ready��� rather than following a uniform clock edge.
Low Power Consumption
: Since parts of the circuit can remain inactive (���null��� state) unless actively processing data, there can be significant power savings.
Robustness to Variability
: Because timing isn���t governed by a single clock, NCL can be more tolerant to variations in voltage, temperature, and fabrication processes.
Why It���s Innovative
Traditional synchronous logic forces all components to toggle in lockstep, even when not processing valid data, which can waste energy.
NCL
inherently handles concurrency and can be more efficient, especially in systems where data arrives at unpredictable intervals.
Potential Use Cases
Low-Power Devices
: Great for IoT gadgets or battery-operated sensors that need to conserve power by processing data only on demand.
High-Variability Environments
: Systems where temperature or voltage fluctuates.
Cutting-Edge Research
: Some research labs are exploring NCL for advanced computing architectures, possibly even quantum or neuromorphic computing contexts (though those are still early days).
Connecting the Dots
Creative Sparks
: Sometimes, out-of-the-box thinking���like MrBeast���s over-the-top stunts���can offer metaphorical insights. Perhaps reading about balloon lifts or giant 3D printers spurred thoughts on concurrency, signal timing, or ���asynchronous��� processes in your writing.
Cross-Disciplinary Fertilization
: It���s common for an unrelated spark (e.g., comedic or imaginative content) to fuel new angles in technical essays, especially when it opens your mind to different perspectives on timing, triggers, or system constraints.
In short,
while MrBeast-inspired hot sauce pools or giant 3D-printed contraptions might seem worlds apart from
null convention logic
, creativity often thrives on unexpected collisions of ideas. If that wacky MrBeast idea was the nudge you needed, all the better���your essay on NCL probably benefitted from a uniquely playful viewpoint!

I mean this essay: 
I Hired Elon Musk to Be My Personal Space Guide

In the realm of computing and AI, there exist enigmatic concepts like null convention logic (NCL) and Markov blankets.

It might seem as if these concepts are reserved for the academically initiated, but imagine hiring Elon Musk, the renowned visionary of space and tech, as your personal guide through these terrains. 

His guidance might help you appreciate how these concepts are akin to the wondrous interstellar journeys he has been pioneering.

First, let's embark on the journey of understanding null convention logic. NCL is a form of asynchronous logic that has the advantage of lower power consumption, fewer timing constraints, and higher tolerance to process variations than conventional synchronous logic.

In NCL, computations are performed in waves, separated by null or empty information. These empty or null cycles are represented as propagating null wavefronts.

Imagine a spacecraft traveling from Earth to Mars, and then back again. The journey to Mars could be considered as a 'data' cycle, where meaningful work is being done.

The return journey, on the other hand, could be likened to the 'null' cycle. During this period, no productive task is performed, but the system prepares for the next wave of data.

This back-and-forth cycle reflects the NCL's operation, where the propagating null wavefront acts as a resetting mechanism between computation cycles.

Now, let's shift our gaze to Markov blankets. In the field of probability theory and statistics, a Markov blanket for a node in a graphical model contains all the variables that shield the node from the rest of the network.

This means that the Markov blanket of a node is the only knowledge needed to predict the behavior of that node and its children.

This could be likened to our spacecraft, surrounded by a protective heat shield as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere. This heat shield, or Markov blanket, provides all the necessary protection (or in our statistical model, information) needed for the spacecraft to safely navigate re-entry.

Anything outside of this shield is rendered irrelevant, just as in our statistical model, where only the information within the Markov blanket is necessary for prediction.

Thus, guided by Elon Musk, we can see these complex concepts in a new light. The propagating null wavefront in NCL becomes a necessary reset journey, preparing the system for the next cycle of computation.

The Markov blanket transforms into a protective shield, containing all the necessary information for predicting a node's behavior.

These seemingly abstract concepts, when translated into the language of interstellar travel, become tangible and easier to grasp, furthering our appreciation for the intricacies of both space exploration and computational intelligence.

In systems engineering, simplified models using the principles of Markov blankets focus on capturing the essential interactions within a system while ignoring less relevant details. This reduces complexity, making analysis, design, and control easier. Here are a few examples:

**1.  Simplified Aircraft Flight Control Model:**

A full flight control system model would involve thousands of variables:  engine parameters, aerodynamic forces, sensor readings, actuator responses, etc.  A simplified model using Markov blankets might focus on a specific subsystem, such as pitch control.  The Markov blanket for the pitch angle would include:

* **Direct Inputs:**  Elevator deflection angle, airspeed, angle of attack.
* **Direct Outputs:**  Pitch rate, pitch acceleration.

Variables like engine thrust (unless a significant malfunction affects it), detailed wing aerodynamics, or the position of the landing gear would be excluded from this simplified model because they have only indirect or negligible effects on the pitch angle within the normal operating range.  This allows engineers to design and analyze the pitch control system independently, simplifying the control design process.


**2.  Simplified Power Grid Model:**

A complete model of a large power grid is enormously complex, involving numerous generators, transmission lines, loads, and control systems.  A simplified model focusing on a specific region or a critical component could use Markov blankets.  For instance, a model focusing on a particular substation might include:

* **Direct Inputs:**  Power generation from connected generators, power demand from connected loads.
* **Direct Outputs:**  Voltage levels at the substation bus, power flow on connected transmission lines.

Factors like the detailed internal workings of distant generators or the precise load characteristics of individual households would be outside the Markov blanket, as their direct influence on the substation's operation is minimal.  This simplification allows for local control strategies and stability analysis without needing to model the entire grid.


**3.  Simplified Chemical Process Model:**

In a chemical plant, a complete model of the entire process would be incredibly complex.  A simplified model of a particular reactor might include:

* **Direct Inputs:**  Feed flow rates, temperatures, pressures of input streams.
* **Direct Outputs:**  Reactor temperature, pressure, product concentration.

Variables like the detailed kinetics of side reactions or the precise composition of the feedstock (unless significant impurities are present) might be excluded from the Markov blanket.  This simplified model allows engineers to design and optimize the reactor's control system without needing to model the entire plant's intricate chemical reactions.


**Key Considerations in Building Simplified Models:**

* **Context Matters:** The definition of the Markov blanket depends heavily on the specific question being addressed and the desired level of accuracy. A model suitable for analyzing stability might be too simplistic for detailed performance optimization.
* **Validation is Crucial:**  Simplified models must be validated against real-world data or more detailed simulations to ensure they accurately capture the essential system behavior.
* **Iterative Refinement:**  Simplified models are often refined iteratively.  Initially, a very coarse model might be used, and then the model is gradually expanded by including more variables in the Markov blanket as needed.


By strategically selecting the relevant variables included in the Markov blanket, systems engineers can create simplified models that are tractable, insightful, and useful for design, analysis, and control.  The key is to balance model simplicity with sufficient accuracy to meet the engineering objectives.

Reduce computational load
,
Enable faster analysis and control design
.
This approach not only makes systems more manageable but also ensures they remain precise enough for practical application, striking a critical balance between
simplicity and accuracy

While Markov blankets originate from probabilistic graphical models in statistics, their core concept���isolating a system from irrelevant influences to focus on relevant factors for prediction or analysis���finds applications in diverse fields beyond pure statistics.  Here are some examples:

**1.  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:**

* **Reinforcement Learning:**  Markov blankets are implicitly used in many reinforcement learning algorithms.  The agent's "state" is essentially defined by its Markov blanket���the aspects of the environment directly influencing its actions and rewards.  The agent only needs to consider this subset of information to make decisions.
* **Bayesian Networks and Inference:**  In building Bayesian networks, identifying the Markov blanket of a node is crucial for efficient inference.  It allows for focusing computational resources on the directly relevant variables, improving speed and scalability.
* **Causal Inference:**  The concept of a Markov blanket is closely related to causal reasoning.  Identifying the variables that shield a target variable from external influences helps to isolate causal relationships and avoid spurious correlations.

**2.  Systems Engineering and Control Theory:**

* **Fault Detection and Isolation:**  In complex systems, identifying the Markov blanket of a component allows engineers to focus on the variables most relevant to detecting faults in that component. This simplifies diagnostics and reduces the complexity of troubleshooting.
* **System Modeling and Simplification:**  By identifying the Markov blanket of a subsystem, engineers can create simplified models that capture the essential interactions without unnecessary detail. This is particularly useful for large-scale systems where full modeling is intractable.

**3.  Biological and Medical Sciences:**

* **Gene Regulatory Networks:**  In studying gene regulatory networks, the Markov blanket of a gene represents the set of genes and environmental factors directly influencing its expression.  Understanding these blankets helps in predicting gene behavior and identifying potential drug targets.
* **Neural Networks:**  The concept of a Markov blanket can be applied to understanding the interactions between neurons in neural networks.  Identifying the blanket for a given neuron allows for a simplified analysis of its behavior and its role in the network's overall function.

**4.  Social Sciences:**

* **Social Network Analysis:**  The Markov blanket of an individual in a social network could represent the immediate connections and influences shaping their behavior.  This can be used to understand information diffusion, opinion formation, and other social phenomena.
* **Economic Modeling:**  In economic models, the Markov blanket of a specific economic variable might include the factors directly influencing its value, allowing for more focused analysis and prediction.


It's important to note that the application of Markov blankets in these fields often isn't explicitly labeled as such. 

The underlying principle of focusing analysis on a relevant subset of variables, isolating it from irrelevant influences, is what's being utilized. 

The specific implementation and terminology may vary depending on the field and context.

1. Markov Blankets: Think of a Markov blanket as the shell of a turtle. The shell separates the turtle from the outside environment, protecting it and allowing it to interact with the world through specific, controlled interfaces (its head, legs, and tail).

In a similar way, a Markov blanket in a system delineates the boundaries between the internal states of a system and the external environment, mediating the interactions between them.

2. Minimizing Free Energy: Imagine you are trying to adjust the temperature in your house to be comfortable but also energy efficient. You might adjust your thermostat settings based on the weather forecast (external information) and how warm or cool your house currently feels (internal state).

In this way, you're trying to minimize the "energy cost" or discomfort. Similarly, systems minimize free energy by adjusting their states to better predict and cope with environmental changes, reducing uncertainty.

3. Bayesian Mechanics and Updating Beliefs: Consider how you might navigate a familiar path in the fog. Even though visibility is poor, you use your knowledge of the path (prior belief) and any faint landmarks you can see (new evidence) to update your understanding of where you are and adjust your direction.

This continuous process of updating your belief about your location based on new sensory data is akin to how Bayesian mechanics describe systems updating their states based on new information.

4. Sparseness and Thingness: Think of a crowded room where everyone is moving randomly versus a dance performance where each dancer has a clearly defined space and set of movements.

In the crowded room, it's hard to distinguish individual patterns or predict movements (like a gas), while in the dance, each dancer's role and space (sparseness) make it easy to identify and follow them (like a rock). This analogy helps explain how sparseness in a system allows us to define and recognize "things" as distinct entities.

5. Strange Inversions in Explanation: The traditional view might say a plant grows towards the light because it needs light to grow (a straightforward cause-effect relationship).

The FEP inversion would say, if we see a plant, we can infer it must have successfully optimized its interaction with its environment (including light) to minimize free energy, indicating an ongoing, successful adaptation rather than a simple causal response.

These analogies should help clarify some of the foundational concepts of the FEP and make them more relatable by connecting them to everyday experiences or observable phenomena.

(or uncertainty) by aligning their internal states (e.g., temperature) with external influences (e.g., weather).
This process reduces discrepancies between predictions and reality, optimizing the system���s functionality and adaptability.
3. Bayesian Mechanics: Updating Beliefs
Analogy
: Navigating a foggy path by combining
prior knowledge
(the route) with
new evidence
(faint landmarks).
Concept
:
Bayesian mechanics describe how systems
continuously update their states
based on new information, refining predictions about the environment.
This dynamic interplay between prior beliefs and sensory input ensures systems remain aligned with changing conditions.
4. Sparseness and Thingness: Recognizing Patterns
Analogy
: A
dance performance
is easier to parse than the chaos of a crowded room because each dancer has a defined role and space.
Concept
:
Sparseness
in a system allows for distinct patterns or entities to emerge.
By reducing randomness (e.g., noise), systems can define and recognize "things" as discrete units, enabling prediction and interaction.
5. Strange Inversions in Explanation: Inferring Adaptation
Analogy
: Instead of saying a
plant grows toward light
because it needs it, FEP suggests the plant���s growth reflects its successful adaptation to minimize free energy in its environment.
Concept
:
This inversion shifts focus from simple cause-effect relationships to an
inference-driven perspective
, where observed behaviors indicate successful optimization processes within the system.
Key Takeaways
Everyday Relevance
: These analogies show that even abstract concepts like the
Free Energy Principle
can be grounded in relatable examples, from thermostats to turtles.
Systemic Perspective
: The FEP emphasizes the
interconnectedness of systems
and their continuous effort to reduce uncertainty, adapt, and maintain equilibrium.
Dynamic Adaptation
: Through Bayesian updating and free energy minimization, systems remain
resilient
and adaptable to their environments.
Recognizing Boundaries
: Markov blankets underscore the importance of
defining system boundaries
, ensuring focus on relevant interactions and variables.
In summary,
these analogies effectively demystify the FEP and its related principles, making them accessible by tying abstract ideas to familiar experiences. This clarity not only aids understanding but also underscores the universality of these concepts across disciplines.
