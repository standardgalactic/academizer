Write an essay Care Bear Cult and Rationality where people become obsessed with sharing their "feelings" which just usually means their grievances and personal traumas. This endorses a pneumatic theory of emotions where they are bottled up and need to be expressed in order for there be to cathartic releases. In reality emotions are regulated by feedback loops, where focusing on any emotion creates an amplifying filter or lense.  I argue that humans are intelligent because of indignation hiding or else they would be crying all the time.

The Care Bear Cult and Rationality: A Critique of Emotional Obsession
In an age dominated by self-expression and emotional exhibitionism, society appears to have entered an era that could aptly be described as the "Care Bear Cult." Like the saccharine cartoon characters whose primary mode of problem-solving was to radiate emotional energy from their chests, many modern individuals seem to believe that feelings must be externalized, shared, and dissected to achieve personal catharsis and social harmony. This cultural fixation assumes a pneumatic theory of emotions, wherein emotions are imagined as pressurized gases trapped in a psychological container that must be vented lest they explode. However, this theory is not only scientifically tenuous but also leads to counterproductive behavior patterns. Emotions, in reality, operate more like feedback loops, shaped and amplified by our attention. A society obsessed with "sharing feelings" risks perpetuating its own emotional dysfunction, undermining the very rationality that makes humans intelligent.
The Pneumatic Theory of Emotions: A Fallacy
The pneumatic model of emotions assumes that emotions are bottled up and accumulate like steam in a pressure cooker. Advocates of this model often argue that failure to "release" emotions, particularly negative ones, will lead to psychological breakdowns, akin to an overfilled container bursting at its seams. While this metaphor may feel intuitive, it grossly oversimplifies the complex dynamics of emotional regulation.
Modern neuroscience reveals that emotions are not static entities that require evacuation. Instead, they are transient states shaped by neural processes, environmental stimuli, and cognitive interpretations. The act of focusing on an emotion���whether anger, sadness, or joy���can amplify its intensity and duration. Far from achieving catharsis, constant expression of grievances often reinforces negative emotions, creating self-perpetuating cycles of dissatisfaction. This suggests that emotional regulation is less about expelling feelings and more about managing one's focus and perspective.
The Amplification Effect: Focusing Versus Regulating
When individuals fixate on their emotions, they effectively create an amplifying filter through which all experiences are interpreted. This is particularly evident in the context of grievance-sharing. By repeatedly recounting personal traumas or frustrations, individuals may reinforce neural pathways associated with those negative emotions, making them more likely to recur. What began as an attempt to "release" pent-up feelings often results in deeper entrenchment of emotional distress.
This feedback loop undermines rationality. Emotional fixation narrows cognitive bandwidth, reducing an individual's capacity for logical analysis and problem-solving. A person obsessed with airing their grievances may be so consumed by their emotional state that they are unable to consider alternative perspectives or solutions. This has implications not only for individual well-being but also for societal discourse, where emotional reasoning increasingly supplants rational deliberation.
Indignation Hiding: The Hallmark of Intelligence
One of the most striking features of human intelligence is its capacity for restraint. Unlike other animals, humans can suppress immediate emotional reactions to pursue long-term goals. This ability to "hide indignation" or mask emotional responses is not a sign of inauthenticity, as some proponents of the Care Bear Cult might argue, but a cornerstone of social and cognitive sophistication.
The suppression or strategic modulation of emotions allows humans to navigate complex social environments and engage in cooperative problem-solving. A society in which every individual constantly broadcasts their emotional states would be paralyzed by perpetual grievance, unable to sustain the rational discourse necessary for progress. Intelligence, in this view, is less about the free expression of emotions and more about their judicious management.
The Risks of the Care Bear Cult
The cultural shift toward emotional exhibitionism carries several risks. First, it fosters a victimhood mentality, where individuals compete to display their grievances in a bid for social validation. This not only stifles personal growth but also erodes collective resilience. Second, it diminishes the value of rational discourse. When feelings take precedence over facts, the ability to engage in meaningful debate is compromised. Finally, it risks creating a society of emotional amplifiers, where the obsessive focus on feelings exacerbates collective anxiety and discord.
Toward a Rational Emotional Culture
To counter the excesses of the Care Bear Cult, society must cultivate a more rational approach to emotions. This begins with recognizing that emotions are not inherently virtuous or in need of constant expression. Instead, they are signals that provide information about our internal states and external environments. Like any signal, they must be interpreted critically and managed strategically.
Encouraging emotional restraint and perspective-taking can help individuals break free from destructive feedback loops. By focusing less on airing grievances and more on developing solutions, individuals can redirect their emotional energy toward constructive ends. This shift requires a cultural revaluation of rationality, where emotional regulation is seen not as repression but as an essential skill for personal and collective flourishing.
Conclusion
The Care Bear Cult's emphasis on emotional expression reflects a well-meaning but misguided attempt to address human suffering. By embracing a pneumatic theory of emotions, it perpetuates the very emotional dysfunction it seeks to alleviate. In contrast, a rational approach to emotions���rooted in the recognition of feedback loops and the value of indignation hiding���offers a path toward greater intelligence and resilience. Humans do not need to "cry all the time" to be authentic; they need to think critically about their feelings and use them as tools for navigating the complexities of life. Only by tempering emotional obsession with rationality can society move toward a healthier and more intelligent future.
