Title:
Generative AI���s Act Two - From Sequoia
Summary:
A year after Sequoia hypothesized about the significant impact of generative AI, the rise of ChatGPT sparked an unprecedented wave of innovation, reminiscent of the early internet days. This led to a surge in AI enthusiasm, with AI researchers gaining rockstar status and a boom in AI-related ventures. However, this excitement soon bordered on hysteria. Every business began branding itself with an "AI" prefix, leading to a frenzy of fundraising, talent wars, and hardware demands. As the hype grew, criticism arose. Concerns about machine-generated intellectual property, ethical debates, and doubts about generative AI's practicality surfaced. Many started to believe that generative AI might be just another overhyped tech trend, as reflected by poor user retention and dwindling demand for many AI applications. However, Sequoia suggests that the industry may be underestimating the long-term impact of generative AI, citing Amara���s Law. They remain optimistic about the technology's future and emphasize careful investment decisions that focus on genuine value creation.

The Model Development Stack

Emerging reasoning techniques like chain-of-thought, tree-of-thought and reflexion are improving models��� ability to perform richer, more complex reasoning tasks, closing the gap between customer expectations and model capabilities. Developers are using frameworks like Langchain to invoke and debug more complex multi-chain sequences.
Transfer learning techniques like RLHF and fine-tuning are becoming more accessible, especially with the recent availability of fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 and Llama-2, which means that companies can adapt foundation models to their specific domains and improve from user feedback. Developers are downloading open-source models from Hugging Face and fine-tuning them to achieve quality performance.
Retrieval-augmented generation is bringing in context about the business or the user, reducing hallucinations and increasing truthfulness and usefulness. Vector databases from companies like Pinecone have become the infrastructure backbone for RAG.
New developer tools and application frameworks are giving companies reusable building blocks to create more advanced AI applications and helping developers evaluate, improve and monitor the performance of AI models in production, including LLMOps tools like Langsmith and Weights & Biases 
AI-first infrastructure companies like Coreweave, Lambda Labs, Foundry, Replicate and Modal are unbundling the public clouds and providing what AI companies need most: plentiful GPUs at a reasonable cost, available on-demand and highly scalable, with a nice PaaS developer experience.
Together, these techniques should close the expectations vs reality gap for models as the underlying foundation models simultaneously improve. But making the models great is only half the battle. The playbook for a generative AI-first user experience is evolving as well:

Emerging Product Blueprints

Generative interfaces. A text-based conversational user experience is the default interface on top of an LLM. Gradually, newer form factors are entering the arsenal, from Perplexity���s generative user interfaces to new modalities like human-sounding voices from Inflection AI. 
New editing experiences: from Copilot to Director���s Mode. As we advance from zero-shot to ask-and-adjust (h/t Zach Lloyd), generative AI companies are inventing a new set of knobs and switches that look very different from traditional editing workflows. Midjourney���s new panning commands and Runway���s Director���s Mode create new camera-like editing experiences. Eleven Labs is making it possible to manipulate voices through prompting.
Increasingly sophisticated agentic systems. Generative AI applications are increasingly not just autocomplete or first drafts for human review; they now have the autonomy to problem-solve, access external tools and solve problems end-to-end on our behalf. We are steadily progressing from level 0 to level 5 autonomy. 
System-wide optimization. Rather than embed in a single human user���s workflow and make that individual more efficient, some companies are directly tackling the system-wide optimization problem. Can you pick off a chunk of support tickets or pull requests and autonomously solve them, thereby making the whole system more effective?

Here���s what we got wrong:

Things happened quickly. Last year, we anticipated it would be nearly a decade before we had intern-level code generation, Hollywood-quality videos or human quality speech that didn���t sound mechanical. But a quick listen to Eleven Labs��� voices on TikTok or Runway���s AI film festival makes it clear that the future has arrived at warp speed. Even 3D models, gaming and music are becoming good, quickly. 
The bottleneck is on the supply side. We did not anticipate the extent to which end user demand would outstrip GPU supply. The bottleneck to many companies��� growth quickly became not customer demand but access to the latest GPUs from Nvidia. Long wait times became the norm, and a simple business model emerged: pay a subscription fee to skip the line and access better models. 
Vertical separation hasn���t happened yet. We still believe that there will be a separation between the ���application layer��� companies and foundation model providers, with model companies specializing in scale and research and application layer companies specializing in product and UI. In reality, that separation hasn���t cleanly happened yet. In fact, the most successful user-facing applications out of the gate have been vertically integrated.
Cutthroat competitive environment and swiftness of the incumbent response. Last year, there were a few overcrowded categories of the competitive landscape (notably image generation and copywriting), but by and large the market was whitespace. Today, many corners of the competitive landscape have more competition than opportunity. The swiftness of the incumbent response, from Google���s Duet and Bard to Adobe���s Firefly���and the willingness of incumbents to finally go ���risk on������has magnified the competitive heat. Even in the foundation model layer, we are seeing customers set up their infrastructure to be agnostic between different vendors. 
The moats are in the customers, not the data. We predicted that the best generative AI companies could generate a sustainable competitive advantage through a data flywheel: more usage ��� more data ��� better model ��� more usage. While this is still somewhat true, especially in domains with very specialized and hard-to-get data, the ���data moats��� are on shaky ground: the data that application companies generate does not create an insurmountable moat, and the next generations of foundation models may very well obliterate any data moats that startups generate. Rather, workflows and user networks seem to be creating more durable sources of competitive advantage.
Here���s what we got right:

Generative AI is a thing. Suddenly, every developer was working on a generative AI application and every enterprise buyer was demanding it. The market even kept the ���generative AI��� moniker. Talent flowed into the market, as did venture capital dollars. Generative AI even became a pop culture phenomenon in viral videos like ���Harry Potter Balenciaga��� or the Drake imitation song ���Heart on My Sleeve��� by Ghostwriter which has become a chart-topping hit.
The first killer apps emerged. It���s been well documented that ChatGPT was the fastest application to reach 100M MAU���and it did so organically in just 6 weeks. By contrast, Instagram took 2.5 years, WhatsApp took 3.5 years, and YouTube and Facebook took 4 years to reach that level of user demand. But ChatGPT is not an isolated phenomenon. The depth of engagement of Character AI (2 hour average session time), the productivity benefits of Github Copilot (55% more efficient), and the monetization path of Midjourney (hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue) all suggest that the first cohort of killer apps has arrived.
Developers are the key. One of the core insights of developer-first companies like Stripe or Unity has been that developer access opens up use cases you could not even imagine. In the last several quarters, we have been pitched everything from music generation communities to AI matchmakers to AI customer support agents.
The form factor is evolving. The first versions of AI applications have largely been autocomplete and first drafts, but these form factors are now growing in complexity. Midjourney���s introduction of camera panning and infilling is a nice illustration of how the generative AI-first user experience has grown richer. Across the board, form factors are evolving from individual to system-level productivity and from human-in-the-loop to execution-oriented agentic systems.
Copyright and ethics and existential dread. The debate has roared on these hot-button topics. Artists and writers and musicians are split, with some creators rightfully outraged that others are profiting off derivative work, and some creators embracing the new AI reality (Grimes��� profit-sharing proposition and James Buckhouse���s optimism about becoming part of the creative genome come to mind). No startup wants to be the Napster or Limewire to the eventual Spotify (h/t Jason Boehmig). The rules are opaque: Japan has declared that content used to train AI has no IP rights, while Europe has proposed heavy-handed regulation. 
Where do we stand now? Generative AI���s Value Problem
Generative AI is not lacking in use cases or customer demand. Users crave AI that makes their jobs easier and their work products better, which is why they have flocked to applications in record-setting droves (in spite of a lack of natural distribution). 


But do people stick around? Not really. The below chart compares the month 1 mobile app retention of AI-first applications to existing companies. 


User engagement is also lackluster. Some of the best consumer companies have 60-65% DAU/MAU; WhatsApp���s is 85%. By contrast, generative AI apps have a median of 14% (with the notable exception of Character and the ���AI companionship��� category). This means that users are not finding enough value in Generative AI products to use them every day yet.


In short, generative AI���s biggest problem is not finding use cases or demand or distribution, it is proving value. As our colleague David Cahn writes, ���the $200B question is: What are you going to use all this infrastructure to do? How is it going to change people���s lives?��� The path to building enduring businesses will require fixing the retention problem and generating deep enough value for customers that they stick and become daily active users.

Let���s not despair. Generative AI is still in its ���awkward teenage years.��� There are glimpses of brilliance, and when the products fall short of expectations the failures are often reliable, repeatable and fixable. Our work is cut out for us. 

Act Two: A Shared Playbook
Founders are embarking on the hard work of prompt engineering, fine tuning and dataset curation to make their AI products *good*. Brick by brick, they are building flashy demos into whole product experiences. And meanwhile, the foundation model substrate continues to brim with research and innovation.

A shared playbook is developing as companies figure out the path to enduring value. We now have shared techniques to make models useful, as well as emerging UI paradigms that will shape generative AI���s second act

Generative AI���s Act Two

BY SONYA HUANG, PAT GRADY, AND GPT-4
ANIMATION: JAMES BUCKHOUSE, MIDJOURNEY AND RUNWAY
PUBLISHED SEPTEMBER 20, 2023
One year ago, we published a hypothesis that generative AI would become a profound platform shift in technology. Then came the firestorm.
Scientists, historians and economists have long studied the optimal conditions that create a Cambrian explosion of innovation. In generative AI, we have reached a modern marvel, our generation���s space race.

This moment has been decades in the making. Six decades of Moore���s Law have given us the compute horsepower to process exaflops of data. Four decades of the internet (accelerated by COVID) have given us trillions of tokens��� worth of training data. Two decades of mobile and cloud computing have given every human a supercomputer in the palm of our hands. In other words, decades of technological progress have accumulated to create the necessary conditions for generative AI to take flight.

ChatGPT���s rise was the spark that lit the fuse, unleashing a density and fervor of innovation that we have not seen in years���perhaps since the early days of the internet. The breathless excitement was especially visceral in ���Cerebral Valley,��� where AI researchers reached rockstar status and hacker houses were filled to the brim each weekend with new autonomous agents and companionship chatbots. AI researchers transformed from the proverbial ���hacker in the garage��� to special forces units commanding billions of dollars of compute. The arXiv printing press has become so prolific that researchers have jokingly called for a pause on new publications so they can catch up.

But quickly, AI excitement turned to borderline hysteria. Suddenly, every company was an ���AI copilot.��� Our inboxes got filled up with undifferentiated pitches for ���AI Salesforce��� and ���AI Adobe��� and ���AI Instagram.��� The $100M pre-product seed round returned. We found ourselves in an unsustainable feeding frenzy of fundraising, talent wars and GPU procurement. 

And sure enough, the cracks started to show. Artists and writers and singers challenged the legitimacy of machine-generated IP. Debates over ethics, regulation and looming superintelligence consumed Washington. And perhaps most worryingly, a whisper began to spread within Silicon Valley that generative AI was not actually useful. The products were falling far short of expectations, as evidenced by terrible user retention. End user demand began to plateau for many applications. Was this just another vaporware cycle?

The AI summer of discontent has sent critics gleefully grave dancing, reminiscent of the early days of the internet, where in 1998 one famous economist declared ���By 2005, it will become clear that the Internet���s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine���s.���

Make no mistake���despite the noise and the hysteria and the air of uncertainty and discontent,  generative AI has already had a more successful start than SaaS, with >$1 billion in revenue from startups alone (it took the SaaS market years, not months, to reach the same scale). Some applications have become household names: ChatGPT became the fastest-growing application with particularly strong product-market fit among students and developers; Midjourney became our collective creative muse and was reported to have reached hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue with a team of just eleven; and Character popularized AI entertainment and companionship and created the consumer ���social��� application we craved the most���with users spending two hours on average in-app.

Nonetheless, these early signs of success don���t change the reality that a lot of AI companies simply do not have product-market fit or a sustainable competitive advantage, and that the overall ebullience of the AI ecosystem is unsustainable.

Now that the dust has settled for a bit, we thought it would be an opportune moment to zoom out and reflect on generative AI���where we find ourselves today, and where we���re possibly headed. 

Towards Act Two
Generative AI���s first year out the gate������Act 1������came from the technology-out. We discovered a new ���hammer������foundation models���and unleashed a wave of novelty apps that were lightweight demonstrations of cool new technology. 

We now believe the market is entering ���Act 2������which will be from the customer-back. Act 2 will solve human problems end-to-end. These applications are different in nature than the first apps out of the gate. They tend to use foundation models as a piece of a more comprehensive solution rather than the entire solution. They introduce new editing interfaces, making the workflows stickier and the outputs better. They are often multi-modal.

The market is already beginning to transition from ���Act 1��� to ���Act 2.��� Examples of companies entering ���Act 2��� include Harvey, which is building custom LLMs for elite law firms; Glean, which is crawling and indexing our workspaces to make Generative AI more relevant at work; and Character and Ava, which are creating digital companions. 

Market Map
Our updated generative AI market map is below. 

Unlike last year���s map, we have chosen to organize this map by use case rather than by model modality. This reflects two important thrusts in the market: Generative AI���s evolution from technology hammer to actual use cases and value, and the increasingly multimodal nature of generative AI applications.


In addition, we have included a new LLM developer stack that reflects the compute and tooling vendors that companies are turning to as they build generative AI applications in production.

Multi-view Fuzzy Representation Learning with Rules based Model
Wei Zhang, Zhaohong Deng, Te Zhang, Kup-Sze Choi, Shitong Wang
Download PDF
Unsupervised multi-view representation learning has been extensively studied for mining multi-view data. However, some critical challenges remain. On the one hand, the existing methods cannot explore multi-view data comprehensively since they usually learn a common representation between views, given that multi-view data contains both the common information between views and the specific information within each view. On the other hand, to mine the nonlinear relationship between data, kernel or neural network methods are commonly used for multi-view representation learning. However, these methods are lacking in interpretability. To this end, this paper proposes a new multi-view fuzzy representation learning method based on the interpretable Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system (MVRL_FS). The method realizes multi-view representation learning from two aspects. First, multi-view data are transformed into a high-dimensional fuzzy feature space, while the common information between views and specific information of each view are explored simultaneously. Second, a new regularization method based on L_(2,1)-norm regression is proposed to mine the consistency information between views, while the geometric structure of the data is preserved through the Laplacian graph. Finally, extensive experiments on many benchmark multi-view datasets are conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method

Summary
:
This research delves into the challenges of unsupervised multi-view representation learning, which is used to process and analyze multi-view data. Two main issues are identified:
Existing techniques often don't analyze multi-view data thoroughly. They tend to focus on finding commonalities between different views, overlooking the unique information contained within each view.
To identify nonlinear relationships in the data, current methods use kernel or neural network techniques. While effective, these methods lack interpretability.
To address these challenges, the authors introduce a novel multi-view fuzzy representation learning approach. This method is based on the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy system, known as MVRL_FS. The methodology has two primary components:
Transforming multi-view data into a high-dimensional fuzzy feature space, enabling the simultaneous exploration of both shared information between views and the unique details of each view.
Proposing a new regularization method leveraging L_(2,1)-norm regression. This helps in recognizing consistency between views while also maintaining the data's inherent geometric structure with the assistance of the Laplacian graph.
The authors validate their method with experiments on several benchmark multi-view datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority over existing techniques.

We discuss the emerging new opportunity for building feedback-rich computational models of social systems using generative artificial intelligence. Referred to as Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs), such individual-level models utilize large language models such as ChatGPT to represent human decision-making in social settings. We provide a GABM case in which human behavior can be incorporated in simulation models by coupling a mechanistic model of human interactions with a pre-trained large language model. This is achieved by introducing a simple GABM of social norm diffusion in an organization. For educational purposes, the model is intentionally kept simple. We examine a wide range of scenarios and the sensitivity of the results to several changes in the prompt. We hope the article and the model serve as a guide for building useful diffusion models that include realistic human reasoning and decision-making

Generative Agent-Based Modeling: Unveiling Social System Dynamics through Coupling Mechanistic Models with Generative Artificial Intelligence
Authors
: Navid Ghaffarzadegan, Aritra Majumdar, Ross Williams, Niyousha Hosseinichimeh
Summary
:
This paper highlights the promising potential of integrating generative artificial intelligence with computational models designed to study social systems. These integrated models, named Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs), incorporate individual-level details and use large language models like ChatGPT to emulate human decision-making in social contexts.
The authors present a GABM case focusing on the simulation of social norm diffusion within an organization. The unique aspect of this model is its coupling of a mechanistic model, which represents human interactions, with a pre-trained large language model. This fusion aids in mimicking human behavior more authentically.
Although the presented model is deliberately simplified for educational clarity, it provides insights into the dynamics of social norm diffusion under various conditions. By analyzing diverse scenarios and adjusting the prompts fed to the AI model, the researchers assess the sensitivity of the outcomes.
The primary aim of this study is to furnish a blueprint for developing advanced diffusion models, which more accurately encompass real-world human reasoning and decision-making processes.

3. What is GABM? 
In a nutshell, GABM is an individual-level modeling approach in which each individual (agent) is 
connected to an LLM and, therefore, makes LLM-informed decisions. The GABM structure includes a 
cycle between the computational model built by modelers and the LLM. 
To illustrate, consider a conventional agent-based models (ABMs) in which agents��� decisions are 
formulated based on a group of predefined decision rules set by the modeler. A market diffusion model 
provides a good example: in such a model, agents are more likely to adopt a product if they contact an 
adopter, based on a preset rule. The parameter values (here the probability of adoption given contact 
with an adopter) is set by the modeler too. 
Now imagine a model in which the modeler does not get involved in setting decision rules and related 
parameters. The only mechanisms modeled are the mechanics of interactions (such as the network 
structure of contacts). Agents��� reasoning and decision-making are empowered by an LLM (in our case, 
ChatGPT). This requires coupling an LLM (the model of reasoning and decision) with an ABM (the model 
of interactions), as Figure 1 shows. In this paradigm, agents can generate reasoning and decisions. They 
are generative agents, and we call the coupled model a GABM. 
Figure 1: A conceptual diagram of a generative agent-based model coupling a model of reasoning and 
decision (LLM) and a mechanistic model of agents��� interactions 
GABM provides decision-making ability for individual agents as they interact. It includes a lot of back- 
and-forth between ChatGPT and the mechanistic model of agent interactions (Figure 1). For example, in 
Williams et al.���s [48] GABM of an epidemic, the mechanistic model informs all agents each "morning" 
about the prevalence of the virus (as if they listen to a daily news report or read the newspaper) and 
whether they have a mild cough or fever. ChatGPT then reasons and makes the decision about whether 
an agent goes to work or stays home. Then, based on the mechanistic model, agents that decide to 
leave their homes have contact with other agents and possibly transmit the disease. 
In summary, the idea behind GABM is to combine the mechanistic modeling with the data-driven 
decision-making provided by LLM. In this paper, our case study is simpler and more general; we develop 
a simple GABM of diffusion dynamics.

ChatGPT
Generative Agent-Based Model (GABM) Explained
:
Basic Definition
: GABM stands for Generative Agent-Based Model. It's a modeling approach where each individual, termed an agent, is linked to a Large Language Model (LLM) and makes decisions informed by that LLM.
Comparison with Traditional ABMs
: Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) rely on predefined decision rules set by modelers. For instance, in a market diffusion model, agents might decide to adopt a product based on predefined rules (like adopting a product if they meet an adopter). The parameters, such as the probability of adoption upon meeting an adopter, are set by the modeler.
GABM's Distinction
: GABM differs in that it doesn't rely solely on predefined rules set by modelers. Instead, while the mechanics of interactions (like network structure) are modeled, the actual reasoning and decision-making are handed over to an LLM, such as ChatGPT. This coupling of an LLM with an ABM results in a GABM, where agents have the ability to generate their own reasoning and decisions.
Conceptual Framework
: A GABM consists of two main components:
Model of Reasoning and Decision
: This is typically an LLM like ChatGPT that provides the reasoning and decision-making capabilities.
Mechanistic Model of Agents��� Interactions
: This defines how agents interact with each other within the model.
There's significant interaction between the LLM and the mechanistic model. For example, in a GABM simulating an epidemic, agents are updated daily about the virus's prevalence and then, based on that information, ChatGPT determines individual decisions such as whether an agent goes to work or stays home.
Main Advantage
: GABM merges traditional mechanistic modeling with the advanced, data-driven decision-making capabilities of LLMs. This blend allows for more realistic simulations where agents' decisions aren't just based on pre-set rules but are dynamically generated based on rich data and sophisticated reasoning models.
Case Study Mentioned
: The paper introduces a basic GABM model focusing on diffusion dynamics, which serves as a foundational example of the concept.

6. Discussions and conclusion 
This study articulates the concept of GABM as a new way of modeling complex social systems. We make 
a case that generative AI can empower simulation models and offer a new way to develop models that 
endogenously represent human behavior and decision. In this individual-level approach, a mechanistic 
model of agents��� interactions is coupled with an LLM (such as ChatGPT) and each agent makes decisions 
after communicating with the LLM. This innovative approach minimizes reliance on modelers' 
assumptions about human decision-making and instead leverages the vast data within large language 
models to capture human behavior and decision-making. 
We illustrate the processes of developing a GABM model by showcasing a simple example involving a 
norm diffusion in an office, where workers must make a daily decision on their choice of shirt color 
between green and blue. In each time step, we provide feedback to each agent about the number of 
people who wore green or blue on the previous day. In contrast to conventional models, we do not set 
any decision rule for the agents regarding their choice of color; rather, they communicate with ChatGPT 
and reason and decide based on a prompt that informs them of their personality profile and provides 
information about the office. 
A sample of simulation runs shows bifurcation based on initial conditions and an emerging office norm 
regarding shirt color. Specifically, agents��� decisions of shirt color are influenced by their colleagues��� shirt 
color on a previous day. While it may not be surprising that a norm emerges, as this has been shown 
previously in conventional models, the fact that these agents conform to an office norm without the 
modelers asking them to do so (i.e., there is no imposed decision model) is quite interesting. The norm 
emerges as they reason and make decisions after consulting with ChatGPT. In the supplementary 
analysis with the new CEO, it is of further interest to observe how generative agents who initially did not 
deviate from their peers note and adapt their choice to that of a new CEO. 
This study contributes to the literature of computational social science and system dynamics modeling 
by offering a new method to model human decision-making that provides four distinct benefits. First, 
human decision-making is inherently complex, which makes it very challenging to incorporate human 
behavior in dynamic models. Simplifying human decision-making by assuming humans are rational does 
not provide reliable models for many applications. Previous research has demonstrated that the 
assumption of humans as purely rational decision-makers does not align with real-world decision- 
making behavior [28, 29]. By drawing upon the extensive dataset within an LLM, GABMs facilitate 
representation of human decision-making in computational models. This study thus contributes to the 
literature by articulating a different style of informing models about human decision-making rules. 
17 
Second, one of the criticisms of traditional agent-based modeling is that the mental model of modelers 
affects decision rules set in dynamic models. Agents act according to the mathematical formulations (or 
logic-rules) within the parameter values (e.g., probability of adoption given contact with an adopter) 
created by the modeler. In the GABM approach, modelers do not set any rules, and thus the model is 
not affected by their mental models; it appears as if the agents are autonomous. This provides several 
feedback loops, some of which the modeler would have not expected. For example, in our model we see 
that some agents decided to reject the norm, and thus an increase in one color results in the reaction of 
the population to a subset choosing to wear the other color. 
Third, by connecting a mechanistic model to an LLM, the model uses much more data in representing 
human decisions than in other models. As the role of data becomes more important in parameter values 
and mathematical representation of the relations between the variables, GABM leverages data as a 
built-in feature, allowing the model to benefit from an extremely vast amount of data. Thus, the GABM 
approach resonates with the current emphasis on data-informed modeling, and yet uses a different 
approach for incorporating data on human decision-making in models. 
Fourth, GABM can define different personality traits for generative agents; as a result, this new 
approach allows for capturing variations in decision-making in dynamic models. Modelers can create 
personas by indicating age, gender, personality, occupation, and other information. Different 
approaches have been used to define generative agents��� personas, ranging from inferring demographic 
characteristics from data on social media [47], to use of data and relying on pretrained LLMs [45, 46], 
and to using the Big Five traits [49] from the field of psychology [48]. Agents��� personas influence their 
behavior, underscoring the need for creating accurate characteristics to facilitate the precise and 
believable emulation of their actions. Our study shows the importance of personas in creating realistic 
outcomes. In this respect, our study resonates with others that suggest a more systematic ways of 
defining personalities [48]. When the purpose is to replicate a real-world setting, it is important to 
define the demographics and personality traits consistent with their real-world distributions. 
This paper also provides educational contributions by illustrating how to build a GABM. The norm 
diffusion model presented here is intentionally kept simple for pedagogical purposes. Each step of 
building the model is explained, and various simulation tests are offered that help students and 
modelers learn by modifying the prompts. We hope the model can work as a starting point for 
computational social scientists to build GABMs.

GABM Discussion and Conclusion Summary
:
GABM Overview
: GABM introduces a fresh approach to modeling intricate social systems by leveraging generative AI. This approach fuses a mechanistic model of agent interactions with a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT, empowering agents to make decisions using the LLM.
Key Distinction
: Instead of relying heavily on modelers' preconceived assumptions about human decision-making, GABMs tap into the vast data within LLMs to capture and simulate human behavior.
Model Illustration
: The paper describes a simple model that simulates norm diffusion in an office, where employees choose between green and blue shirts daily. Agents decide shirt color based on feedback about the previous day's color choices and reasoning provided by ChatGPT. A noticeable observation was the emergence of a norm without explicit programming���a testament to the LLM's power.
Benefits of GABM
:
Realistic Human Behavior
: Traditional models often simplify human behavior, assuming complete rationality. But LLM-powered GABMs present a more accurate representation of human decision-making.
Mitigating Modeler Bias
: Traditional agent-based modeling is influenced by the modeler's perspective. With GABM, agents appear autonomous, making decisions without preset rules. This can lead to unexpected outcomes, such as agents defying an emerging norm.
Data-driven Decision-making
: By integrating LLMs, GABMs inherently use vast amounts of data for decision-making, aligning with the current focus on data-informed modeling.
Diverse Agent Personas

Educational Contributions
: The study also aims to instruct by offering a basic GABM model. The intentional simplicity aids learning, guiding computational social scientists in building their own GABMs.
In essence, GABMs mark a paradigm shift in computational modeling, offering a more data-driven and realistic representation of human decision-making, which can have wide applications in various fields.
1 / 1
Although models with generative agents address some of the limitations of prior approaches for 
capturing human decision-making, there are limitations that need to be considered. First, generative 
agents may reproduce training data when faced with recalled inquiries [35]. To address this limitation, 
researchers need to rephrase questions in a novel way, and dynamic modelers must define the 
environment with caution (e.g., to model a general pandemic, it would be necessary to use a 
pseudonym for the virus). Second, our results indicate that the output of the model is sensitive to some 
changes in the prompts. Thus, modelers need to run various sensitivity analyses. Third, generative 
agents are often limited by the patterns they have learned from training data and might be biased due 
to biases present in that training data. Modelers need to think carefully about and address such biases. 
In our example here, we tried to avoid this giving common names to the generative agents. 
In conclusion, this article offers a novel approach, GABM, by combining the mechanistic modeling with a 
data-driven approach to model human decision-making powered by an LLM. The study provides a step- 
18 
by-step guide to building such models using a simple example of norm diffusion in an organization. By 
defining human personas in GABM, such models have the potential to incorporate human behavior 
dynamics more realistically.

ChatGPT
Limitations and Conclusion of GABM
:
Recall of Training Data
: Generative agents may often simply reproduce training data when they encounter familiar queries. To circumvent this, it's essential for modelers to frame questions innovatively and define environments with caution. For instance, if simulating a pandemic, using a pseudonym for the virus can help.
Sensitivity to Prompts
: The model's outputs can be significantly affected by slight changes in the prompts. This necessitates thorough sensitivity analyses by modelers to ensure robustness.
Bias from Training Data
: Like any AI model, generative agents are only as good as their training data. If biases exist in the data they've been trained on, the agents might reproduce these biases. Modelers should be aware of these potential biases and take measures to mitigate them. In the presented study, this was done by assigning common names to the generative agents.
Conclusion
:
The GABM method, as presented in the article, offers a pioneering merger of mechanistic modeling with a data-driven approach to simulate human decision-making, all powered by LLMs. By illustrating the process with a simple norm diffusion model, the study showcases the potential of GABM to realistically incorporate human behavioral dynamics, emphasizing the importance of defining human personas. It underscores the potential of AI-augmented modeling in understanding and predicting complex human behaviors in various systems.

Could you explain the GABM method a bit better.

ChatGPT
Of course! Let's delve deeper into the
Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM)
method:
GABM at a Glance
:
GABM is a novel approach to agent-based modeling (ABM) where individual agents (representative of entities in a system, like humans in a social system) are empowered with decision-making abilities informed by large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.
Traditional ABM vs. GABM
:
Traditional ABM
: Agents follow predefined rules set by the modeler. For instance, in a model depicting market diffusion, an agent might adopt a product with a certain probability if they come in contact with another agent who has adopted it. The rules and probabilities are set based on the modeler's assumptions or data.
GABM
: Instead of predefined rules, agents in GABM interact with an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT) to make decisions. The modeler defines the mechanics of interactions, like how agents interact with each other, but does not explicitly define how each agent decides. The agents "consult" with the LLM to reason and make decisions based on their environment and any provided context.
How GABM Works
:
Coupling with LLM
: Each agent in GABM is connected to an LLM. When faced with a decision, the agent interacts with the LLM to determine the best course of action based on the information at hand.
Generative Decisions
: Instead of following a set rule, agents generate their decisions using the LLM. This means they can reason, adapt, and decide in a manner that is influenced by the vast data and patterns the LLM has been trained on.
Feedback Loop
: There's a continuous feedback loop between the agents' decisions (informed by LLM) and the mechanistic model of interactions. In one example, agents receive updates about a virus's prevalence and then consult with ChatGPT to decide whether to go to work or stay home.
Key Advantages of GABM
:
Data-Driven Decision Making
: GABM leverages the vast amount of data encapsulated in LLMs, allowing for more realistic and data-informed decision-making.
Minimized Modeler Bias
: Traditional ABM can be influenced by the modeler's assumptions about behavior. In GABM, agents decide based on LLM interactions, reducing the influence of a modeler's assumptions.
Dynamic & Responsive
: GABM agents can respond dynamically to changes in their environment, providing more adaptability and realism.
Example
:
In the paper you provided, the GABM approach was used to model norm diffusion in an office setting regarding shirt color choice. Instead of setting a rule for agents on their shirt color choice, each agent communicated with ChatGPT, taking into account feedback about colleagues' choices and other context, to decide on its shirt color.
In essence, GABM offers a powerful blend of traditional modeling with advanced AI reasoning, providing a new frontier for simulating complex systems with more realism and adaptability.

Field
:
Computer Science > Artificial Intelligence
Abstract Summary
:
Context
: As Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and beyond become more sophisticated, they also introduce new challenges. One such challenge is "LLM hallucination", which refers to the model producing output that is not grounded in reality or its training data.
Problem Statement
: Many mitigation techniques are being developed to handle LLM hallucination, but it's also essential to understand why it occurs in the first place.
Objective
: The paper aims to investigate how specific linguistic elements of the prompts given to an LLM influence the likelihood of hallucination. The linguistic factors they're looking into are:
Readability
: How easy is the prompt to read and understand?
Formality
: Is the prompt written in a formal or informal manner?
Concreteness
: Does the prompt use specific and tangible language?
Findings
:
Formality & Concreteness
: The research indicates that when prompts are more formal and concrete, LLMs are less likely to produce hallucinations. This suggests that clear, specific, and formal language might help in eliciting more accurate and grounded responses from the model.
Readability
: The results concerning readability are not clear-cut. This might mean that the ease with which a prompt is read and understood does not consistently influence whether an LLM will hallucinate in its response.
Implication
:
Understanding these linguistic nuances can aid in better utilizing LLMs by crafting prompts that minimize hallucinations and increase the reliability of the model's outputs. It provides a more nuanced view into how LLMs process input and how specific linguistic elements can affect their output quality.

5Our i ndings 
To investigate how the linguistic characteristics of 
prompts affect the generation of hallucinations in 
LLMs, we initially def i ne the ranges for three spe- 
cif i c scores, as outlined in Table 5. A comprehen- 
sive analysis of these i ndings is presented in the 
following sections. 
Range ��� 
Linguistic Aspect ���LowMidHigh

Concreteness1-2.52.5-3.53.5-5 
Table 5: Range(s) for three linguistic aspects of the

5.1Effects of readability on hallucination in 
LLMs 
The i gure (see Fig. 3) illustrates our empirical 
i ndings and the following are the main insights 
that address the research questions posed earlier in 
Section 4.1. 
EFFECTS OF READABILITY ONLLM���S HALLU- 
CINATION: 
���Prompts that are easier to read tend to have fewer 
instances of hallucinations. 
���Some diff i cult-to-read prompts, but more formal also 
hallucinate less. 
���Hence, the results regarding readability are somewhat 
uncertain, displaying a combination of i ndings. 
5.2Effects of formality on hallucination in 
LLMs 
Fig. 4 represents our empirical i ndings.The follow- 
ing points outline the primary insights that respond 
to the research queries introduced in Section 4.2. 
EFFECTS OF FORMALITY ONLLM���S HALLUCI- 
NATION: 
���Formal language prompts typically exhibit a lower 
propensity for generating hallucinatory content. 
���Our i ndings demonstrate how utilizing more formal 
prompts can address hallucinations in the Name and 
Location categories. 
���The linguistic impacts of the prompts become more 
evident in LLMs such as GPT-4, OPT, and subsequent 
versions. 
5.3Effects of concreteness on hallucination in 
LLMs 
Fig. 5 shows our experimental results. The follow- 
ing section highlights the core insights that address 
the research inquiries introduced in Section 4.3. 
EFFECTS OF CONCRETENESS ONLLM���S HAL- 
LUCINATION: 
���Prompts that use clearer and more specif i c language 
tend to generate fewer hallucinations. 
���Our results show that incorporating more specif i c and 
concrete terms into the prompts effectively reduces 
hallucinations in the Number and Acronym categories. 
���Just as we observed with our formality i ndings, the 
impact of concrete prompts becomes increasingly 
apparent in advanced LLMs like GPT-4, OPT, and 
their later iterations. 
6Conclusion 
In this preliminary research study, we begin by cate-

ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the findings and conclusions presented in the given extract about the relationship between linguistic characteristics of prompts and hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs):
1. Classification of Linguistic Aspects
:
The researchers first defined the ranges for three linguistic dimensions:
Readability
: (Low: 0-30, Mid: 31-70, High: 71-100)
Formality
: (Low: 0-30, Mid: 31-70, High: 71-100)
Concreteness
: (Low: 1-2.5, Mid: 2.5-3.5, High: 3.5-5)
2. Effects of Readability on Hallucination
:
Prompts that are easier to read generally have fewer instances of hallucinations.
However, some prompts that are difficult to read but are formal might also experience fewer hallucinations.
This means the impact of readability on hallucinations is mixed.
3. Effects of Formality on Hallucination
:
Formal language prompts typically have a lower tendency to generate hallucinatory content.
Using more formal prompts specifically reduces hallucinations in areas like Name and Location.
This influence becomes more pronounced in newer LLMs like GPT-4, OPT, and their subsequent versions.
4. Effects of Concreteness on Hallucination
:
Clearer and more specific language prompts tend to result in fewer hallucinations.
Incorporating more specific and concrete terms, especially in the Number and Acronym categories, can reduce hallucinations.
The impact of using concrete prompts is especially evident in advanced models like GPT-4, OPT, and later versions.
5. Conclusion
:
The study started by categorizing different types of hallucinations present in LLMs.
Their dataset for the study was compiled using New York Times news tweets, which they aligned with their established hallucination categories.
Given the central role of language intricacies in understanding language, they examined the three key linguistic dimensions: readability, formality, and concreteness.
The primary goal was to understand how these dimensions influence the occurrence of hallucinations in LLMs.
Takeaway
:
The linguistic characteristics of the prompts given to LLMs play a vital role in the generation of hallucinations. By understanding the nuances of readability, formality, and concreteness, users can potentially craft prompts that yield more accurate outputs and fewer hallucinations, especially in advanced LLMs.

The problems they mentioned not being able to do ocr on pdfs and that the videos needed to be broken into parts are big problems still, they might be more difficult to implement than they anticipate
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Absolutely, implementing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on PDFs and processing videos in a meaningful way are complex challenges in AI, especially in an educational context. Let's dissect these issues a bit:
OCR on PDFs
:
Variability
: PDFs can have a range of layouts, fonts, images, and other elements, making them more challenging to process compared to plain text documents.
Accuracy
: OCR is prone to errors, especially with complex layouts or low-quality scans. Misinterpretation of characters or words can lead to incorrect or misleading information being provided to students.
Efficiency
: OCR can be resource-intensive. Processing large volumes of PDFs in real-time or within a reasonable timeframe can be challenging.
Video Processing
:
Segmentation
: Breaking videos into meaningful parts requires understanding the content at a semantic level. While AI can detect scene changes, understanding the context or significance of a segment is more challenging.
Transcription Accuracy
: Automatically transcribing spoken words in videos can be error-prone, especially with varying accents, speech rates, or background noises.
Integration
: Seamlessly integrating video content with other learning materials, like text or interactive modules, can be complex.
While these challenges are significant, the continuous advancements in AI and NLP offer hope that such limitations will be reduced over time. However, as you rightly pointed out, it's crucial to manage expectations and not underestimate the complexity of these tasks. The ideal approach is iterative, where developers progressively refine and enhance the system based on feedback and new technological breakthroughs.

Ok well what do you think about the article stating that more formal sounding prompts lead to less hallucination?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The finding that more formal prompts lead to fewer hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is intriguing and does align with some observations. Here's a perspective on it:
Training Data Composition
: LLMs like GPT-4 are trained on vast amounts of text data, much of which may come from formal sources such as scientific papers, technical documents, news articles, etc. Therefore, the model might be more attuned to providing accurate and coherent responses when faced with formal prompts, as it mirrors a significant portion of the training data.
Clarity and Precision
: Formal language tends to be clearer and more specific, reducing ambiguity. When a model receives a precise prompt, it might be less likely to generate "hallucinatory" or irrelevant content because the prompt guides it more directly.
Bias and Training Data
: It's possible that informal or colloquial language might be associated with a wider variety of contexts in the training data, leading to a broader range of potential responses, some of which might be perceived as hallucinations in specific contexts.
Expectations and Perception
: Users might also have a different threshold for what they consider a "hallucination" when they use a formal vs. informal prompt. They might be more critical and expectant of accurate responses when using formal language.
That said, while the findings are compelling, it's important to approach them with some caution. As with any research, it would be beneficial to see replication studies and further experiments that delve deeper into this phenomenon. Additionally, it might be interesting to understand how "formality" was quantified in the research and ensure that other confounding factors weren't influencing the results.
1 / 1
Yeah maybe it is a bit helpful but you can write pretty convincingly in formal language about some pretty nonsensical topics
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Absolutely, that's a valid point. Formal language doesn't inherently guarantee the accuracy or sensibility of content. One can write in a very scholarly and formal manner about completely fictitious or illogical ideas. The structure, vocabulary, and syntax might sound credible, but the content could still be baseless or fallacious.
The key takeaway from such findings might be more about the behavior and predictability of LLMs in response to different linguistic cues, rather than an endorsement of formality as a guarantor of truth or sensibility. It underscores the importance of always critically evaluating the content, regardless of the language's formality or source.

For example

Yeah maybe there is a great filter event in the year 3,495. The only way to stop it is for a player to visit 150,000 star systems in a year

The concept of a "Great Filter" event is compelling and could serve as a central narrative or end-goal for players. By setting such a high requirement (visiting 150,000 star systems), you'd likely be targeting dedicated players or encouraging cooperative gameplay. Here are a few ideas and considerations based on this concept:

1. **Collaborative Effort**: Instead of requiring a single player to visit 150,000 star systems, you could make it a collective goal for all players. This would promote community collaboration and shared experiences.

2. **Temporal Anomalies**: Given that you mentioned unique time mechanics earlier, perhaps players can use these time mechanics strategically to visit more star systems within the in-game year.

3. **Star System Variety**: If players need to visit so many star systems, ensure there's enough variety and interest in each system to keep exploration engaging. This could be achieved through procedurally generated content, unique challenges, or lore elements.

4. **Narrative Importance**: To give weight to the task, sprinkle hints, lore, and stories throughout the game that highlight the impending Great Filter event. Make players feel the importance and urgency of their mission.

5. **Progress Trackers**: Provide players with tools or interfaces that allow them to track their progress toward the 150,000 star system goal. This could include a global counter showing the collective effort of all players.

6. **Rewarding Exploration**: To incentivize visiting a large number of star systems, each system could offer unique rewards, discoveries, or even mini-stories. This can keep the exploration phase interesting.

7. **End of Year Climax**: As the in-game year nears its end, intensify the narrative elements. Increase the frequency of anomalies, add more urgent missions, and amplify the cosmic disturbances to give players a sense of impending doom.

8. **Failure and Success States**: Decide what happens if players succeed in their task versus if they fail. Does the game universe change in some way? Are there different narrative outcomes? 

9. **Annual Changes**: If you're resetting the game every January 1st, perhaps the nature of the Great Filter event, its backstory, or the requirements to prevent it can change slightly each year, offering a fresh experience.

10. **Community Events**: Host community events or challenges related to the Great Filter. This can help engage the player base, especially during times when they might be close to achieving or missing the goal.

By integrating such a high-stakes, community-focused event, you can create a sense of shared purpose and urgency among players, making the gameplay experience rich and memorable.

ChatGPT
Exactly. Your example illustrates that while the language and presentation can sound logical and formal, the content itself can be fictional or far-fetched. It's crucial to differentiate between the formality of language and the credibility or logic of the content presented.
This underscores the complexity of managing "hallucinations" in large language models and the importance of context. While formality might reduce certain types of hallucinations, it's not a catch-all solution, and users should always be critical and discerning of the information provided.

You Only Look at Screens: Multimodal Chain-of-Action Agents
Zhuosheng Zhang, Aston Zhang
Download PDF
Autonomous user interface (UI) agents aim to facilitate task automation by interacting with the user interface without manual intervention. Recent studies have investigated eliciting the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for effective engagement in diverse environments. To align with the input-output requirement of LLMs, existing approaches are developed under a sandbox setting where they rely on external tools and application-specific APIs to parse the environment into textual elements and interpret the predicted actions. Consequently, those approaches often grapple with inference inefficiency and error propagation risks. To mitigate the challenges, we introduce Auto-UI, a multimodal solution that directly interacts with the interface, bypassing the need for environment parsing or reliance on application-dependent APIs. Moreover, we propose a chain-of-action technique -- leveraging a series of intermediate previous action histories and future action plans -- to help the agent decide what action to execute. We evaluate our approach on a new device-control benchmark AITW with 30K unique instructions, spanning multi-step tasks such as application operation, web searching, and web shopping. Experimental results show that Auto-UI achieves state-of-the-art performance with an action type prediction accuracy of 90% and an overall action success rate of 74%.

1INTRODUCTION 
Building intelligent autonomous agents that are capable of task planning, decision making, and 
action execution in a particular environment is a long-standing goal of artif i cial intelligence (AI) 
(Searle, 1969; Wooldridge & Jennings, 1995; Maes, 1995; Hendler, 1999). The advent of large 
language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023) has l ourished 
promising opportunities for developing autonomous agents to assist users in completing tasks in 
distinct environments such as operation systems, specif i c applications, and web browsers (Adept, 
2022; Rawles et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023c).

Recent studies have explored prompt engineering (Richards, 2023; Nakajima, 2023; Reworkd, 
2023; Sumers et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023) and i ne-tuning techniques (Rawles et al., 2023; Wen 
et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2022) to elicit the capability of language models to execute actions in 
interactive environments. However, there are at least two major challenges that have limited real- 
world applications of autonomous agents. 
First, existing approaches commonly rely on external tools such as optical character recognition 
(OCR) and icon detectors (Zhang et al., 2021; Sunkara et al., 2022) to parse the environment into 
textual elements (e.g., HTML layouts) as inputs to a language model (Figure 1(a)) (Rawles et al., 
2023; Wen et al., 2023). On the one hand, the parsed elements generate lengthy inputs, thus leading 
to inference eff i ciency. Since computational latency is a key measure in deployment, using lengthy 
inputs would increase inference cost and may even exceed the input length limit of the language 
model. On the other hand, parsing the visual environment into textual elements may also be prone to 
error propagation or information loss because parsing mistakes are inevitable using external tools. 
Second, most existing approaches are under the sand-box setting that requires accessing internal 
APIs to interact with the environment (Zhou et al., 2023; Gur et al., 2023), e.g., using a JavaScript 
element selection on a webpage or a Python interpreter to execute actions. However in practice, the 
API interface is often inaccessible in third-party applications (Apps). 
These challenges have motivated more advanced techniques that are capable of i rst principles 
thinking (Aristotle; Irwin, 1989)���allowing direct interactions on the screen without needing access 
to intermediate environment parsing or interval application-dependent APIs (Figure 1(b)). To address 
the challenges, we introduce Auto-UI, a multimodal approach that directly interacts with the interface. 
To improve the agent���s action prediction capability, we propose a novel chain-of-action technique, 
where a chain of action is a series of intermediate previous action histories and future action plans 
that lead to action prediction. 
We evaluate Auto-UI on a new device-control benchmark AITW (Rawles et al., 2023) with 30K 
unique instructions, spanning multi-step tasks of application operation, web searching, and web 
shopping. Experimental results show that Auto-UI achieves state-of-the-art performance with an 
action type prediction accuracy of 90% and an action success rate of 74%. 
In summary, our work makes the following technical contributions: 
1.We introduce Auto-UI, a multimodal agent for autonomous UI control that can directly 
interact with the screens, thus circumventing the constraints of environment parsing and 
application-specif i c API access. 
2.We propose a chain-of-action technique that leverages the previously executed actions and 
future action plans to help the agent decide what action to execute at each step. 
3.Auto-UI achieves state-of-the-art performance with an action type prediction accuracy of 
90% and an action success rate of 74%. Notably, Auto-UI can infer an action as fast as 
within less than one second.

2RELATEDWORK 
Our work falls into the i eld of language agents. This section will i rst review the recent progress 
in building language agents and then discuss the approaches to conduct user interface control with 
language agents. 
2.1LANGUAGEAGENTS 
Language agents refer to those agents that can follow user instructions and interact with environments 
to complete tasks. Such agents expand the landscape of language models to compete in specif i c 
i elds, including application operation, web searching, and web shopping. There are two popular 
types of language agents, autonomous agents and communicative agents. Autonomous agents aim to 
assist humans to achieve specif i c goals in the real world. Typical examples of autonomous agents are 
AutoGPT (Richards, 2023), BabyAGI (Nakajima, 2023), and AgentGPT (Reworkd, 2023). In contrast, 
communicative agents are personalized and socialized agents (Park et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b; 
Zhu et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2023) with human behaviors that can communicate and collaborate 
2 
with each other. They are often deployed in immersive environments. Inspired by the potential 
in real-world applications, this work focuses on autonomous agents, especially those working in 
mobile devices. We aim to assist users by completing multi-step tasks (e.g., manipulating Apps, 
web shopping, and question answering) without any manual intervention. Given a user instruction 
in natural language, the agent is required to interpret the instruction and execute actions by directly 
controlling its user interface. Due to the requirement in real-world applications, the agent is expected 
to be both effective and eff i cient. 
2.2UI CONTROL WITHNATURALLANGUAGE 
Recently, LLMs have shown promise in building autonomous UI agents with abilities of instruction 
following (Sanh et al., 2021; Taori et al., 2023b; Chiang et al., 2023) and chain-of-thought (CoT) 
prompting (Nye et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022). Especially, CoT prompting (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima 
et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023a) elicit LLMs��� capacities of step-by-step planning, decision making, 
and action execution. Those capacities have been shown to be effective in UI control tasks (Rawles 
et al., 2023). However, the task environments are graphical user interfaces (GUIs), instead of natural 
language that LLMs can directly process. Therefore, the GUI states and actions are required to be 
converted to textual formats to conform to the input and output formats of LLMs. For example, it 
is feasible to parse the UI screens by icon recognition and OCR (Zhang et al., 2021; Sunkara et al., 
2022) and organize the parsed elements into HTML layouts. As a compromise, existing approaches 
are restricted in a sandbox setting where they rely on external tools (Rawles et al., 2023; Wen et al., 
2023) and application-specif i c APIs (Zhou et al., 2023; Gur et al., 2023) for environment parsing 
and action interpretation; thus, commonly suffer from inference eff i ciency and error propagation. 
Although there are studies that have considered multimodal architecture to process inputs in different 
modalities (Sun et al., 2022), however, those studies still rely on i ne-grained environment parsing to 
ensure competitive performance. In contrast, this work is established upon i rst principles thinking, 
which directly reads the UI without additional environment parsing and provides the action (e.g., 
action type, gesture coordinate, and typed text) that can be executed without needing any extra APIs. 
3METHODOLOGY 
In this section, we will i rst introduce the basic concepts for the UI control task and then describe the 
design of our proposed Auto-UI framework. 
3.1PROBLEMFORMALIZATION 
Given a user instruction (also known as a goal), the agent needs to complete the task with multiple 
steps of interactions. The entire process is called an episode, which is composed of a series of screens. 
For each step in the episode, the agent will be provided with a screenshot, and the agent is required to 
predict the action until the task is complete. Detailed examples can be found in Appendix A.1. 
3.2FRAMEWORKOVERVIEW 
Auto-UI is a multimodal agent that decides what action to take given the input screenshot and a 
user instruction. To empower the agent���s decision making capability, we introduce a chain-of-action 
approach by leveraging a series of intermediate previous action histories and future action plans to 
predict actions. 
The model architecture of Auto-UI is illustrated in Figure 2. On a high level, Auto-UI consists of 
three stages. First, we acquire encoded features from both vision and language inputs. Specif i cally, 
the vision input, i.e., a screenshot, is encoded by a frozen vision encoder. Meanwhile, the language 
input, consisting of the goal and a chain of previous action histories���each history contains a tuple 
{action type, touch point, lift point, and typed text}, is encoded by a language encoder. Second, the 
encoded vision and language representations are integrated by a self-attention module. Third, the 
fused representation is fed to the decoder to generate a chain of future action plans (i.e., action types 
to execute in future steps) followed by action prediction. A chain of action consists of two parts in 
the procedure above: a chain of previous action histories on the input side and a chain of future action 
plans on the output side. In the following, we describe the entire procedure in detail.

ChatGPT
3.3 VISION ENCODING
The visual representation of the UI plays a crucial role, as it is the primary source of information for understanding the current state of the interface. For encoding screenshots, we utilize a frozen vision encoder. This encoder is pre-trained on vast amounts of data to convert the visual data into a meaningful latent space. The screenshot is passed through this encoder, which generates a dense vector, capturing the essential visual features of the UI.
3.4 LANGUAGE ENCODING
The language encoding process handles both the user's instruction and the history of previous actions. This history is essential as it gives context to the current state of the task, ensuring the agent understands its past moves and can plan the next step accordingly.
We use a transformer-based language encoder, given its proven efficacy in capturing sequential relationships in data. The user instruction and the action history are tokenized and passed through the encoder. The output is a vector representation that captures the semantics of the instruction and the action sequence.
3.5 INTEGRATED SELF-ATTENTION MODULE
Combining visual and language data is a crucial step. The integrated self-attention module merges the encoded representations of both the screenshot and the language inputs. By utilizing self-attention mechanisms, this module allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input, making the model more accurate and efficient.
3.6 DECODER AND ACTION PREDICTION
The fused representation obtained from the self-attention module serves as input to the decoder. This decoder is designed to generate a series of future action plans. Given the current state, it predicts the most likely sequence of actions the agent should take to achieve the user's goal. Each action in this sequence consists of the action type, touch point, lift point, and any typed text.
The chain-of-action concept here ensures that the agent not only predicts the immediate next action but also has a broader perspective of the subsequent steps it might take. This forward-looking approach enhances the agent's efficiency in multi-step tasks.
3.7 CHAIN-OF-ACTION TECHNIQUE
As mentioned, the chain-of-action technique involves considering both past action histories and future action plans. By leveraging this dual perspective, Auto-UI can make better-informed decisions.
On the input side, the chain of previous action histories provides context. It lets the agent understand where it is in the task and how it got there. On the output side, the chain of future action plans gives the agent foresight. By anticipating the next few steps, the agent can operate more efficiently, reducing the number of steps and errors in task completion.
In summary, the Auto-UI framework, with its integrated vision and language encoders, self-attention module, and chain-of-action technique, offers a robust solution for UI control tasks. This multimodal approach ensures that the agent can interact directly with user interfaces without needing intermediate environment parsing or relying on specific application-dependent APIs.

We concatenate Xgoaland Xhistoryas the input to the language encoder: 
Xlanguage= {Xgoal,Xhistory}.(2) 
Then, we obtain the encoded representations of the vision and language inputs as follows:

predictions in a string format. The target predictions consist of a chain of future action plansYplan

tion_type>, ���touch_point���: <touch_point>, ���lift_point���: <lift_point>, ���typed_text���: <typed_text>}. 
These four components will be explained in the following subsection. 
3.3COORDINATENORMALIZATION 
Recall that a target action consists of four components: action type, touch point, lift point, and 
typed text. We consider six action types: dual-point gesture, type, go_back, go_home, enter, and 
status_complete. A dual-point gesture comprises a touch point and a lift point with[y,x]coordinates. 
The gesture actions ensure a l exible action space and can represent clicks and scrolls at arbitrary 
locations. For example, a gesture action {���touch_point���: [0.7761, 0.7089], ���lift_point���: [0.7761, 
0.7089]} means clicking at the coordinate [0.7761, 0.7089], while a gesture action {���touch_point���: 
[0.1898, 0.4477], ���lift_point���: [0.8242, 0.4077]} means scrolling down. A type action means typing 
a text and the text is placed in the <typed_text> i eld. The other action types, i.e., go_back, go_home, 
enter, and status_complete are system actions, whose corresponding <touch_point>, <lift_point> 
i elds are i lled with -1, and the <typed_text> is empty. 
We observe that high-precision coordinates are not necessary for representing a click or scroll action. 
Therefore, we apply normalized values of the coordinates, which helps accelerate convergence and 
mitigate the ambiguity of coordinates. The normalization is applied to click and scroll actions. For 
click actions, we keep four decimal places. For scroll actions, we i rst determine the scroll direction 
with the touch point and lift point. Then, we transform the touch and lift points into i xed directional 
coordinates as follows: ���up���: {[0.8, 0.5], [0.2, 0.5]}, ���down���: {[0.2, 0.5], [0.8, 0.5]}, ���left���: {[0.5, 
0.8], [0.5, 0.2]}, ���right���: {[0.5, 0.2], [0.5, 0.8]}, where {[��], [��]} 
consists of the touch point and lift 
point in the i rst [��] and second [��]. We provide examples of target actions in Appendix A.2.

���Pre-trained Features. There are two kinds of pre-trained features used in this work, the vision 
features and language model weights. For vision features, we compare two popular types, CLIP 
(Radford et al., 2021) and BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023). We observe that BLIP-2 achieves relatively 
better performance. Therefore, we use BLIP-2 by default in Auto-UI. For pre-trained language 
model weights, we compare initializing the model with the vanilla T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), FLAN-T5 
(Chung et al., 2022), and FLAN-Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023a) weights under the large size. We see that 
FLAN-Alpaca achieves the best performance as it has been optimized with Stanford Alpaca synthetic 
instruction tuning data. 
���Model 
Scale. Compared with the performance gains from our technique components (chain of 
actions and coordinate normalization) in Table 3, the benef i t of scaling parameter size becomes 
relatively marginal. As we observe that a larger model size does not lead to signif i cant improvement 
in performance, we do not scale the model scale but focus on the base (220M) and large (770M) 
models in this work. In addition, our choice is also based on other considerations, including the 
constriction of GPU memory and computation budget. 
5.4COMPUTATIONCOST 
Table 5 compares the inference speed and GPU memory cost for Auto-UI and Llama 2. Auto-UI is 
able to achieve nearly real-time inference (within less than one second for an action prediction) with

This work presents an autonomous UI agent called Auto-UI that can interact in a multimodal UI 
environment without environment parsing or application-dependent API access. In addition, we 
propose a chain-of-action technique that leverages the previously executed actions and future action 
plans to help the agent decide what action to execute. Experimental results show that Auto-UI

ChatGPT
That's a fitting title! The "chain-of-action technique" is indeed a central aspect of the provided content, highlighting a unique approach within the Auto-UI framework for decision-making based on previous and future planned actions. If you have any more questions or need further information on this topic, feel free to ask!
1 / 1
Explain the technique
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! The "chain-of-action technique" described in the provided content is a method used by the Auto-UI system to make decisions about its next actions based on both historical actions and future action plans. Here's a breakdown:
Chain of Actions
:
The system maintains a chain (or sequence) of actions. This chain has two main components: previous action histories (
Xhistory
) and future action plans (
Yplan
).
If the system is at step
t
t
t
(meaning it has already taken
t
���
1
t-1
t
���
1
steps),
Xhistory
will have a record of all the actions taken up to that point. If it's the first step, then
Xhistory
will be empty.
Encoding
:
The system takes a screenshot of the current state of the user interface (UI) and extracts vision features from it. This is done using a frozen image encoder, like BLIP-2.
Language features are extracted from the input goal and the chain of previous action histories.
These extracted features (both vision and language) are then encoded to create representations (
Hscreen
for vision and
Hlanguage
for language).
To match the dimensions of these representations, a trainable projection matrix is used.
Interaction
:
A self-attention mechanism is used to relate the vision and language features. This means that the system can consider both what it "sees" in the UI and the actions it has previously taken when deciding its next move.
The output of this attention mechanism is then combined (fused) with the language features to create a unified representation of the current state.
Decoding
:
The fused representation is decoded using a Transformer decoder. The output is a prediction of the next set of actions the system should take.
The output contains a chain of future action plans and a prediction for the current action.
These actions can include specific UI interactions like touch gestures, typing text, going back, going home, etc.
Coordinate Normalization
:
For actions that involve touch gestures, the system uses normalized coordinates. This means the specific coordinates for touch and lift points are transformed to have standard values for specific directions (up, down, left, right) to represent gestures like scrolling.
In essence, the "chain-of-action technique" allows Auto-UI to make decisions based on the current state of the UI, its goals, and the actions it has taken so far, leading to more context-aware and effective interactions with the UI environment.

ChatGPT
Sorry, I cannot assist with that request. Reverse engineering proprietary software without explicit permission can be illegal and unethical.
If you're interested in understanding the principles behind gesture-based keyboards like Swype, I can provide a general overview or suggest resources on the topic. Always remember to respect intellectual property rights and laws. If you have a legitimate use case, you should seek permission or licensing from the software's owner or consult legal guidance.
1 / 1
You can provide the overview. But the software was discontinued a long time ago, the patents were sold with the company nuance, but who knows they might just be planning to let them expire.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Alright, let's discuss the general principles behind gesture-based keyboards like Swype without getting into specifics that might infringe on any intellectual property.
Gesture-Based Keyboards: An Overview
Concept
: The main idea behind gesture-based keyboards is to let users input words by drawing a continuous path across the keyboard, moving through the letters of the word in sequence. This can often be faster and more fluid than tapping each letter individually.
Word Prediction and Path Analysis
: One of the main challenges for gesture keyboards is determining which word the user intended. The software has to analyze the drawn path and match it to the most likely word in its dictionary.
Error Correction
: Due to the fluid nature of gestures, there's room for inaccuracies. The software must be able to interpret slight deviations from a letter and still predict the intended word accurately.
Dictionary and Language Model
: A robust dictionary and language model are crucial. The dictionary contains all the words the software might need to recognize, while the language model helps predict which word is most likely based on the context.
Adaptive Learning
: Advanced gesture keyboards can learn from user input, improving their predictions over time. If a user often swipes a particular word or uses a unique vocabulary, the keyboard can prioritize those words in future predictions.
Multi-word Gestures
: Some keyboards allow users to swipe through space, letting them input entire phrases in a single gesture.
Feedback Mechanisms
: Visual or haptic feedback (like a trace line or vibrations) can help users see or feel the path they're drawing, aiding in accuracy.
Handling Ambiguities
: Many words might have similar swipe paths. The software needs algorithms to handle such ambiguities, often relying on context, frequency of usage, and other factors.
If you're interested in gesture recognition or predictive text input, there's a lot of academic research and open-source projects available that delve into these topics without infringing on proprietary technologies. Always proceed ethically and legally when exploring or working on such projects.

It would be nice if you had more control over the personal dictionary, and could modify it when it accidentally overfits.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! The ability to control and modify the personal dictionary is a valuable feature that can enhance the user experience of gesture-based keyboards. Here's how it could work and the potential benefits:
1. Manual Addition & Removal:
Addition
: Users should be able to add words to the dictionary that aren't recognized by default, such as slang, industry jargon, or names.
Removal
: If a word is added by mistake or is no longer relevant, users should be able to remove it.
2. Review & Edit Suggestions:
A section where users can review words the keyboard has learned and edit or delete them. This helps in cases where the keyboard has overfitted to a typo or an uncommon word.
3. Contextual Learning Toggle:
Users could have an option to toggle whether the keyboard learns from specific apps or contexts. For instance, they might not want the keyboard learning words from a password manager or a medical app.
4. Backup & Synchronization:
Users should have the ability to back up their personal dictionary, so if they switch devices, they don't have to start from scratch.
Syncing the personal dictionary across devices can be an added advantage, ensuring consistency in predictions no matter which device is used.
5. Reset to Default:
An option to reset the personal dictionary to its default state. This is useful if the user feels the predictions have deviated too far from their preference.
6. Word Frequency Adjustment:
The ability for users to manually adjust the frequency or priority of certain words. For example, if a user frequently uses the word "bake" but the keyboard keeps suggesting "back", they could boost "bake" in the dictionary.
7. Import & Export:
Users could have the option to import word lists or export their dictionary. This is particularly useful for professionals who have specific jargon or terms they frequently use.
By giving users control over their personal dictionary, gesture-based keyboards can better cater to individual needs and preferences, resulting in a more personalized and efficient typing experience.
1 / 1
Yeah in that situation I just delete the word "back" for a bit and then type it back in, you can't manually type in words or import wordlists, which seems inconvenient
1 / 1
ChatGPT
It sounds like the current implementation you're referring to lacks user-centric flexibility, which is unfortunate, especially for a tool as frequently used as a keyboard. The ability to manually input words or import wordlists could make a significant difference in user experience.
When designing or modifying software like gesture-based keyboards, it's essential to prioritize features that empower users to tailor the tool to their preferences and needs. Doing so not only enhances user satisfaction but can also increase retention and promote positive word-of-mouth recommendations.
For gesture-based keyboards, the central idea is to predict and suggest words based on patterns and habits. However, it's equally essential to allow users to have a say in the process, ensuring that the software doesn't become a source of frustration due to overfitting or mispredictions.
In the case of the Swype keyboard or similar technologies, offering a more comprehensive set of tools for managing the personal dictionary can significantly enhance the overall user experience.

ChatGPT
That's certainly a drawback, especially for users who rely heavily on a consistent typing experience across multiple devices. A synchronized dictionary helps maintain a seamless and efficient typing experience, especially when users have added or modified several custom words or phrases.
When the email sync or any cloud-based synchronization feature fails or is no longer supported, it can be quite disruptive. It means any word or phrase you've trained your keyboard to recognize on one device won't be known on another, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies.
If you're looking for solutions, you might consider:
Backup & Restore
: Check if there's a backup and restore option for the dictionary. Some keyboards allow users to manually back up their dictionary and then restore it on another device.
Third-party Apps
: Some apps might help with dictionary backup and transfer, although the success can vary based on the keyboard's design.
Alternative Keyboards
: Consider switching to another gesture-based keyboard that has better synchronization features. Many keyboards have evolved, offering a more comprehensive set of features, including multi-device synchronization.
Feedback to Developers
: If the original developers or the company that now owns the keyboard software are still active, provide feedback about these issues. Sometimes, user feedback can prompt updates or fixes.
Custom Solutions
: If you're technically inclined, you might even look into more custom solutions or scripts to manually extract and import the dictionary, though this would require some technical know-how.
Ultimately, a good software design should prioritize user convenience, and the ability to sync dictionaries across devices is a big part of that for keyboard apps.

Feb 21, 2018 ��� The app responsible for popularizing swipeable virtual keyboards has been discontinued. Nuance ended development this month of Swype for ...
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, Swype was indeed discontinued by Nuance in 2018, as you pointed out. It was one of the pioneering apps in introducing swipe-based typing, which became immensely popular and was later integrated or mimicked by many other keyboard apps.
Given that it's been discontinued, it's understandable that features like email sync and regular updates have stopped. Users are left with whatever the final version of the app was, and over time, compatibility and functionality issues might arise, especially with newer OS updates and devices.
If you're sentimentally attached to Swype or prefer its particular style of swipe typing, you might continue to face the challenges you described. However, the good news is that the concept of swipe typing has been integrated into many other keyboard apps, including major ones like Gboard by Google, SwiftKey by Microsoft, and even the default keyboards on many smartphones.
Switching might take a bit of adjustment, but many of these alternatives offer robust features, including customizable dictionaries, multi-device sync, and frequent updates for compatibility and new features.

There is no chance I am using any of these as long as this one works, it works because I've built a dictionary of words and words combinations. It just shows one entry in the list but it must be storing multiple swype traces. It would be good if you could easily see and edit the swype trace for previous words and I was thinking that they could be visualized in 3d as well
1 / 1
ChatGPT
It's evident you have a deep appreciation for the nuances (pun unintended) of Swype and have invested a significant amount of time into tailoring its dictionary to your specific needs. The concerns you've expressed are valid, especially for users who've come to rely heavily on a particular tool or system.
The idea of visualizing Swype traces is an intriguing one. Here's a basic overview of how it might work:
Recording the Trace Data
: Every time you form a word using Swype, the software would record the path your finger took. This could be a sequence of x,y coordinates on your screen.
Visual Representation
: The series of coordinates could be represented graphically, perhaps with a start point, an end point, and a line showing the path in between.
3D Visualization
: Extending this into three dimensions could mean plotting the path your finger took over time. The X and Y axes could represent the screen's coordinates, while the Z axis could represent the time it took to draw the path. This way, you would see not only the path of your swipe but also the speed and rhythm with which you Swype.
Editing the Trace
: This is trickier. If you had a visual representation of your Swype traces, you'd need an intuitive interface to edit these paths. Perhaps you could adjust the path directly, or there might be control points that you could manipulate.
Storage
: The system would need to store not just the final word, but also the entire trace data for each word. This would increase the memory requirements but might be feasible with today's storage capacities.
Benefits
: By having access to and control over these traces, you could potentially "train" your Swype keyboard more effectively. For example, if it often mistakes one word for another, you could adjust the trace of one of those words slightly to minimize confusion.
Implementing something like this would be a significant project and would require expertise in mobile app development, UI/UX design, and perhaps some machine learning. Still, it's a fascinating concept that could push the boundaries of what's possible with touch-based text input.

Ok well I misspelled spherepop but you sort of get. I was thinking there could be swype trace in a bubble and that you have to fire a flare or tracer that matches it to pop or unlock it, and that tunnels could be named after their keyword and shaped after the the 3d trace. For examine in 2d the word magic looks like a pretzel, from the side it looks like a sweeping curve
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, I see! Thanks for clarifying the concept of "spherepop". Let's explore the refined idea:
Bubble Mechanics
: Each bubble in "spherepop" contains a Swype trace. To pop or unlock the bubble, players have to reproduce the same trace with precision. The more accurate the trace, the higher the score or faster the bubble pops.
3D Visualization
: The idea of visualizing Swype traces in 3D adds depth (literally) to the game. For words like "magic", with its pretzel-like 2D trace, visualizing it in 3D could reveal interesting shapes. The height of the trace (on the Z-axis) can be influenced by the speed or pressure of the swipe.
Tunnel Challenges
: Tunnels, named after their respective keyword (e.g., "magic" for the pretzel-shaped tunnel), become challenges that players navigate through using the corresponding Swype trace. Some tunnels can have twists and turns, requiring the player to Swype in a specific sequence to successfully navigate through.
Power-Ups
: Players can collect or earn power-ups that aid in the accurate recreation of traces. For instance, a "slow-motion" power-up could give players more time to trace, or a "trace guide" might provide a shadow guide to help them swipe accurately.
Levels and Difficulty
: As players progress, the complexity of Swype traces and the speed required to recreate them can increase. More intricate words or phrases could be introduced, creating elaborate 3D tunnels.
Story Mode
: To add depth to the game, there could be a narrative where players are "trace masters" in a universe where accurate tracing holds the power to unlock or protect treasures, memories, or realms.
Multiplayer Mode
: Players can challenge each other to reproduce traces with the highest accuracy in the shortest time. Alternatively, they can work collaboratively, where one player creates a trace and the other tries to match it.
Customization
: Allow players to design their own 3D tunnels or bubbles, potentially creating a user-generated content community around the game.
Feedback and Training
: Implement a feedback system where players can see how closely their trace matched the original. Additionally, a training or sandbox mode allows players to practice and hone their skills.
The concept of translating Swype-like mechanics into a game environment sounds both fun and innovative. It leverages familiar tactile interactions and transforms them into a unique gameplay experience. "Spherepop" could appeal to both casual gamers and those who enjoy challenges requiring precision and speed.

I thought the chain-of-action technique reminded of predictive mouse movement and the swype trace keyboard which tries to predict the next word you are going to use and interpret which word you are using by its shape and its context
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's an insightful connection! Both the chain-of-action technique and predictive input methods like Swype or predictive mouse movements are essentially trying to anticipate user behavior or actions based on a series of preceding events or data.
The
chain-of-action technique
in the autonomous UI agent scenario looks at previously executed actions and potential future actions to decide the most appropriate next step. It's like understanding a sequence of actions and then predicting the next logical step.
Swype
, on the other hand, predicts words based on the shape drawn by the user on the keyboard and uses linguistic models to guess the intended word. If you've typed "I am going to the", the prediction engine might suggest "store" or "park" as possible next words, because they're common continuations.
Predictive mouse movements
anticipate where the user will move the mouse next, often used in UI/UX design to improve website responsiveness or in gaming scenarios.
All these techniques have a common theme: they leverage prior data (whether it be actions, words, or movements) to predict the most likely next event. Making such connections across disciplines can lead to innovative ideas and solutions, as it often allows for borrowing methodologies from one field and applying them to another. Your idea for the game "spherepop" utilizing 3D Swype traces is a prime example of such cross-disciplinary innovation.
