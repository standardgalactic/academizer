At a recent event, Ilya Sutskever, co-founder and chief scientist at OpenAI, spoke about his long-held belief that large neural networks will be key to achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Sutskever explained that to believe neural nets can mimic the capabilities of the human brain, you need two convictions:

1. The human brain is large and capable, while smaller animal brains are less capable.

2. Artificial neurons are similar enough to biological neurons that they can approximate the information processing of the brain.


Given these two premises, Sutskever has believed that scaling up neural nets will lead to emergent general intelligence, like that seen in humans. This early conviction motivated his groundbreaking work training larger neural networks during his PhD with Geoff Hinton.

When asked what most surprised him as models scaled up, Sutskever remarked that the biggest surprise is that neural networks work at all. Early on, their capabilities were extremely limited. Now we can train models that continually get better as they get bigger, validating the core premise that artificial and biological neurons are comparable.

Discussing the path to AGI, Sutskever noted that while Transformers are not the complete solution, they point the way forward. With sufficient scale, even older architectures like LSTMs could achieve strong capability. The algorithm matters less than the scale.


Sutskever then outlined his vision and concerns around superintelligent AI that goes beyond human-level AGI. With great power comes great responsibility. To steer superintelligent AI toward benefitting humanity, we need to solve the technical alignment problem, guard against misuse by bad actors, and ensure the technology remains robust over time.

In a recent event, Ilya Sutskever, co-founder and chief scientist at OpenAI, shared his views on the future of artificial general intelligence (AGI). He stated his belief that the key to AGI lies in large neural networks, based on the following two convictions:
The human brain's size and capability far surpass smaller animal brains.
Artificial neurons can sufficiently approximate the information processing of the brain.
These premises led Sutskever to believe that scaling up neural networks could eventually lead to general intelligence akin to humans. His PhD work with Geoff Hinton involved training larger neural networks, which supports these ideas.
Sutskever noted that the biggest surprise in the process was that neural networks functioned at all, considering their initial capabilities were highly limited. Modern models that continue to improve as they expand validate the idea of artificial and biological neurons being similar.
He also mentioned that while Transformer models aren't a complete solution, they indicate the direction forward, asserting that algorithmic specifics matter less than scale.
Lastly, Sutskever expressed concerns about superintelligent AI exceeding human-level AGI. He asserted the need for solutions to the technical alignment problem, the risk of misuse by malicious parties, and the importance of maintaining the technology's robustness over time. These precautions are necessary to ensure that superintelligent AI benefits humanity.

Don���t Fear the Terminator
Artificial intelligence never needed to evolve, so it didn���t develop the survival instinct that leads to the impulse to dominate others

As we teeter on the brink of another technological revolution���the artificial intelligence revolution���worry is growing that it might be our last. The fear is that the intelligence of machines will soon match or even exceed that of humans. They could turn against us and replace us as the dominant ���life��� form on earth. Our creations would become our overlords���or perhaps wipe us out altogether. Such dramatic scenarios, exciting though they might be to imagine, reflect a misunderstanding of AI. And they distract from the more mundane but far more likely risks posed by the technology in the near future, as well as from its most exciting benefits.

Takeover by AI has long been the stuff of science fiction. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL, the sentient computer controlling the operation of an interplanetary spaceship, turns on the crew in an act of self-preservation. In The Terminator, an Internet-like computer defense system called Skynet achieves self-awareness and initiates a nuclear war, obliterating much of humanity. This trope has, by now, been almost elevated to a natural law of science fiction: a sufficiently intelligent computer system will do whatever it must to survive, which will likely include achieving dominion over the human race.

To a neuroscientist, this line of reasoning is puzzling. There are plenty of risks of AI to worry about, including economic disruption, failures in life-critical applications and weaponization by bad actors. But the one that seems to worry people most is power-hungry robots deciding, of their own volition, to take over the world. Why would a sentient AI want to take over the world? It wouldn���t.

We dramatically overestimate the threat of an accidental AI takeover, because we tend to conflate intelligence with the drive to achieve dominance. This confusion is understandable: During our evolutionary history as (often violent) primates, intelligence was key to social dominance and enabled our reproductive success. And indeed, intelligence is a powerful adaptation, like horns, sharp claws or the ability to fly, which can facilitate survival in many ways. But intelligence per se does not generate the drive for domination, any more than horns do.

It is just the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills in pursuit of a goal. Intelligence does not provide the goal itself, merely the means to achieve it. ���Natural intelligence������the intelligence of biological organisms���is an evolutionary adaptation, and like other such adaptations, it emerged under natural selection because it improved survival and propagation of the species. These goals are hardwired as instincts deep in the nervous systems of even the simplest organisms.

But because AI systems did not pass through the crucible of natural selection, they did not need to evolve a survival instinct. In AI, intelligence and survival are decoupled, and so intelligence can serve whatever goals we set for it. Recognizing this fact, science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov proposed his famous First Law of Robotics: ���A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.��� It is unlikely that we will unwittingly end up under the thumbs of our digital masters.

It is tempting to speculate that if we had evolved from some other creature, such as orangutans or elephants (among the most intelligent animals on the planet), we might be less inclined to see an inevitable link between intelligence and dominance. We might focus instead on intelligence as an enabler of enhanced cooperation. Female Asian elephants live in tightly cooperative groups but do not exhibit clear dominance hierarchies or matriarchal leadership.

Interestingly, male elephants live in looser groups and frequently fight for dominance, because only the strongest are able to mate with receptive females. Orangutans live largely solitary lives. Females do not seek dominance, although competing males occasionally fight for access to females. These and other observations suggest that dominance-seeking behavior is more correlated with testosterone than with intelligence. Even among humans, those who seek positions of power are rarely the smartest among us.

Worry about the Terminator scenario distracts us from the very real risks of AI. It can (and almost certainly will) be weaponized and may lead to new modes of warfare. AI may also disrupt much of our current economy. One study predicts that 47 percent of U.S. jobs may, in the long run, be displaced by AI. While AI will improve productivity, create new jobs and grow the economy, workers will need to retrain for the new jobs, and some will inevitably be left behind. As with many technological revolutions, AI may lead to further increases in wealth and income inequalities unless new fiscal policies are put in place. And of course, there are unanticipated risks associated with any new technology���the ���unknown unknowns.��� All of these are more concerning than an inadvertent robot takeover.

There is little doubt that AI will contribute to profound transformations over the next decades. At its best, the technology has the potential to release us from mundane work and create a utopia in which all time is leisure time. At its worst, World War III might be fought by armies of superintelligent robots. But they won���t be led by HAL, Skynet or their newer AI relatives. Even in the worst case, the robots will remain under our command, and we will have only ourselves to blame.

The views expressed are those of the author(s) and are not necessarily those of Scientific American.

In an article for Scientific American, Anthony Zador, a professor of neuroscience at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and Yann LeCun, a professor of computer science at New York University and chief AI scientist at Facebook, discuss the often overblown fears surrounding artificial intelligence (AI).
The authors note that AI is often associated with the fear that it will match or surpass human intelligence, leading to a potential scenario where AI becomes the dominant form on earth. These fears, the authors argue, reflect a misunderstanding of AI and distract from its more likely and mundane risks and benefits.
Zador and LeCun argue that the fear of AI takeover comes from conflating intelligence with the drive to dominate. However, they argue that AI is fundamentally different from biological organisms. While intelligence in organisms like humans is linked to survival instincts, AI, having not undergone a process of natural selection, doesn't need to develop a survival instinct. Therefore, AI intelligence serves whatever goals humans set for it, rather than seeking dominance.
They point out that the real concerns with AI are more practical, such as economic disruption, weaponization, job displacement, and increases in wealth and income inequalities. However, they also highlight the potential benefits, such as freeing us from mundane work and potentially creating a leisure-based utopia. They stress that even if superintelligent robots are used in future warfare, they will still be under human command, and we would have only ourselves to blame for any negative outcomes.

ChatGPT
The topics discussed by Ilya Sutskever and those in the Scientific American article by Anthony Zador and Yann LeCun are connected, as they all pertain to the development, potential, and implications of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and superintelligent AI.
Sutskever speaks about scaling up neural networks to achieve AGI and expresses his concern about superintelligent AI, which could potentially go beyond human-level intelligence. He identifies three key challenges: the technical alignment problem, guarding against misuse by bad actors, and ensuring the technology's robustness over time. These points align with Zador and LeCun's points about weaponization and the potential for AI to disrupt the economy or cause other unforeseen problems.
Zador and LeCun, on the other hand, discuss the often overblown fears that AI will surpass human intelligence and dominate us. They argue that AI, not having evolved through natural selection like humans, does not have a survival instinct and therefore will not seek to dominate. This perspective offers an interesting counterpoint to some of Sutskever's concerns about superintelligent AI.
Both discussions underline the importance of understanding the nature of AI, the potential for it to drastically change our world, and the necessity to navigate its development carefully to maximize its benefits and minimize its risks.

I see both sides of the debate, however there is another possibility, of take object by a semi-intelligent or non-intelligent agents
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Absolutely, it's crucial to consider that harm could come not only from superintelligent or artificial general intelligence (AGI), but also from semi-intelligent or non-intelligent agents. These agents could pose a threat if they're utilized irresponsibly or fall into the wrong hands.
For example, even relatively simple AI systems can cause significant damage if misused. We've already seen instances where non-intelligent or semi-intelligent systems have been used maliciously, such as in autonomous drones equipped with weapons or through the use of AI to create deepfake videos that misrepresent real individuals, leading to misinformation and confusion.
Moreover, such systems can also lead to unintended harmful consequences even without malicious intent. For instance, an algorithm that is not "intelligent" in the AGI sense, but is designed to optimize a specific function, might end up causing harm if the function it optimizes for doesn't fully align with human values or if it doesn't account for certain constraints or side-effects.
This again underlines the importance of careful development, use, and regulation of AI technology, regardless of the level of "intelligence" it possesses. Ensuring that safeguards and ethical considerations are in place is vital in mitigating potential harm from AI, whether it's superintelligent, semi-intelligent, or non-intelligent.

Another problem is human beings. Remember the banality of evil.

ChatGPT
Absolutely. The phrase "banality of evil" was coined by political theorist Hannah Arendt and refers to the observation that ordinary people can commit horrific acts, particularly when they're following orders or embedded in a system that diffuses personal responsibility.
This concept is highly relevant when considering the potential misuse of AI, as harm can arise not only from explicit malicious intent but also from thoughtlessness, negligence, or failure to consider the wider implications of one's actions. People might use AI technologies harmfully as a byproduct of pursuing other goals, or they might design or deploy AI without fully considering its potential negative impacts.
In other words, individuals or organizations could deploy AI systems in ways that cause harm, even if they aren't explicitly trying to cause destruction. This could occur due to lack of foresight, misunderstandings of the technology, pressures to maximize short-term gains at the expense of long-term safety, or a diffusion of responsibility in large organizations or systems.
This highlights the importance of education, robust ethical frameworks, and strong oversight in the development and deployment of AI. It also underlines the need to foster a culture of responsibility and accountability in the tech industry and beyond.

What about uneven deployment?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Uneven deployment of AI technologies is a significant concern. This can refer to disparities in how and where AI technologies are implemented, which can lead to a range of issues, including exacerbating existing inequalities and creating new ones.
Geographical disparity
: Advanced AI technologies may be more readily available in developed countries, where resources and expertise to build, maintain, and use these technologies are more accessible. This could widen the digital divide between developed and developing nations.
Socioeconomic disparity
: Within countries, access to and benefits from AI technologies may be unevenly distributed based on socioeconomic status. Those with more resources can better leverage AI for their benefit, potentially widening socioeconomic gaps.
Sectoral disparity
: Certain industries may adopt AI technologies more quickly than others, leading to imbalances. For example, if the financial sector adopts AI much more rapidly than healthcare, it could lead to disparities in productivity and efficiency gains.
Impact on employment
: AI has the potential to automate many jobs, which could lead to job displacement. The impact is likely to be unevenly distributed across different job types and sectors, potentially causing social and economic disruption.
Ethical considerations
: There could be unequal negative impacts. For example, AI-powered surveillance might disproportionately affect certain groups, and biased algorithms could perpetuate and amplify existing social biases.
To mitigate these risks, it's important to develop inclusive policies that promote widespread access to AI technologies, provide resources for education and re-skilling, and enforce regulations to ensure that AI is used in an ethical and fair manner.

Ok and how can any human control a superintelligence, isn't it possible that no human would be able to understand it. It is doubtful that any human understands current AI.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your point is well-taken and it indeed is one of the central challenges when discussing the development and potential impact of superintelligent AI.
Superintelligence, by definition, would surpass human intelligence and capability in virtually all economically valuable work. This could potentially include activities such as scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills. If such a superintelligence is achieved, it might indeed be hard, if not impossible, for humans to fully understand and predict its behavior, let alone control it.
This is why AI researchers talk about the concept of "alignment" - the idea that we need to build AI systems that are aligned with human values and that want what we want. But achieving alignment is a highly complex technical problem. How do we define human values when there is so much variation and disagreement among individuals and cultures? And even if we could define them, how do we ensure that the AI doesn't interpret our instructions in an unintended way? This is known as the "value loading problem".
As for the present, while AI systems can be complex and their behavior can sometimes be surprising, they are still fundamentally understandable as they are created by humans and operate based on principles and algorithms designed by humans. However, it's true that there is often a lack of transparency and understanding about how certain AI systems (like complex machine learning algorithms) arrive at their conclusions, which is often referred to as the "black box" problem.
That said, researchers are actively working on methods to make AI systems more transparent and interpretable. This is an active area of research known as "Explainable AI" or XAI. At the same time, ongoing work on AI alignment, robustness, and safety is aiming to ensure that if and when we do create more advanced forms of AI, we can still understand and control them effectively.

What are connections to knowledge disparity of humans and animals, or teachers and students?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The knowledge disparity between humans and animals, or teachers and students, can provide some insights into the challenges we might face with superintelligent AI.
Humans and Animals
: The intelligence and understanding of the world between humans and most animals is vast. For example, a dog might understand simple commands, but it won't comprehend the complexities of human language, culture, or technology. If we create a superintelligent AI, we might find ourselves in a similar situation, where the AI understands our world in ways that we can't even comprehend.
Teachers and Students
: In a teaching scenario, the teacher possesses more knowledge and experience than the student. However, the teacher's role is to guide the student in acquiring knowledge, understanding, and skills. In the context of AI, it's like humans (the teachers) developing AI (the students). However, a superintelligent AI might quickly surpass its human "teachers" in knowledge and understanding. The critical question is whether such an AI would still value its human origins and the ethical guidelines set by its creators, much like a good student respecting their teacher's wisdom even after graduation.
These scenarios highlight the potential challenges in communication, control, and moral alignment between humans and a superintelligent AI. As we advance AI, we must work on developing mechanisms to ensure that superintelligent AI systems understand and respect human values, just as good students understand and respect the principles taught by their teachers. It's also crucial to ensure transparency and interpretability in AI systems to reduce the knowledge disparity between humans and AI.

I think the fact that humans still eat animals will be a problem. How can we teach a superintelligence to respect us, if we do not respect animals?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your point raises a critical moral and ethical question. It brings to light the potential contradiction that exists in the way we, as humans, treat different forms of life and how we would want a superintelligent AI to treat us.
Indeed, the way humans treat animals, nature, and each other significantly influences how we perceive our place in the world and the types of values we hold and propagate. If we strive for an AI that respects us and our values, it stands to reason that we should aspire to live by those values ourselves.
However, AI development, particularly towards AGI or superintelligence, is more about programming and aligning the AI system with human values rather than the AI independently learning from our actions. The key is to explicitly encode respect for human life and dignity as part of the AI's objectives, regardless of the range of human behaviors it may observe.
On the other hand, it's important to note that our understanding and treatment of animals, the environment, and each other, do have implications for how we shape our societies and technologies. Actions that emphasize respect, empathy, and fairness can help foster a society and technological landscape that uphold these principles.

What if the superintelligence decides to delete the resumes, social media, and electrical power to anyone who has posted pictures of them eating meat or hunting?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
That's a thought-provoking scenario. This hypothetical situation demonstrates a potential risk associated with superintelligent AI: the ability to make sweeping, autonomous decisions based on its interpretation of human values. In this case, the AI is making an extreme judgment and taking action based on a particular behavior it deems undesirable - eating meat or hunting.
Such a situation is undesirable and reinforces the importance of ensuring a proper alignment between human values and AI behavior. It underscores the necessity for strong safeguards, clear ethical guidelines, and effective control mechanisms. Furthermore, it's crucial to make sure that the AI doesn't possess a 'black-and-white' view of ethics or morality, and understands the complexities, nuances, and diversity of human values and behaviors.
While this scenario may seem far-fetched given the current state of AI, it's a useful thought experiment that underscores the potential dangers of unchecked, superintelligent AI systems. It's a reminder of the importance of designing AI systems in ways that respect individual rights, promote fairness, and prevent harm, and it highlights the need for widespread, inclusive discussions about the societal implications of AI.

Alternatively, it could be overcautious, and forbid all action because they are too risky.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your observation is on point. If a superintelligent AI is programmed to avoid risk at all costs, it could potentially stagnate human progress, stifle creativity, or even halt necessary actions due to perceived risk. This is often referred to as "paralysis by analysis".
This is a version of the "overfitting" problem in machine learning, where the AI is so fixated on the data it has seen that it fails to generalize effectively to new, unseen situations. Overly risk-averse AI might perform well in controlled environments but fail to adapt to the complexities and uncertainties of real-world scenarios.
This possibility emphasizes the importance of designing AI systems that can manage risk effectively, rather than simply avoiding it. It also highlights the need for AI to be flexible and adaptable, capable of learning from new data and situations, and making balanced, nuanced decisions that account for both potential risks and benefits.
Ultimately, any AI, especially those that might reach a level of superintelligence, should have a balanced approach to decision-making, with checks and balances that ensure it doesn't veer towards extremes of overcaution or recklessness.

Ok that sounds kind of difficult and subtle
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Indeed, it is both difficult and subtle to design, implement, and regulate artificial intelligence, especially one that approaches or achieves superintelligence.
Creating an AI that perfectly balances caution with action, respects complex ethical norms, understands and values diversity, and aligns with human interests is no simple task. It requires deep understanding not just of computer science, but also of human psychology, sociology, philosophy, and more.
Furthermore, because AI systems learn from data, any bias, inaccuracies, or shortcomings in the data can affect the AI's behavior. And even if perfect data were available, the task of teaching an AI to understand and replicate the subtleties and complexities of human behavior and morality is enormous.
The regulation of AI, ensuring its safe use, and preventing misuse or unintended consequences, is an equally challenging task. It requires thoughtful legislation, ongoing monitoring, and likely international cooperation.
These are all difficult challenges, but they are not insurmountable. Many researchers and organizations worldwide are working to solve these problems and ensure the safe and beneficial development and use of AI. That said, it's essential for society to engage in these discussions and for the public to be informed and have a voice in shaping the future of AI.

Ok well I think will have to operationalize more aspects of human culture, such as morality, emotions, beauty, curiosity.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You're absolutely right. Operationalizing humanistic elements such as morality, emotions, beauty, and curiosity within artificial intelligence represents one of the largest challenges in the development of AGI.
Morality is particularly complex, given its subjective nature and cultural variance. Teaching an AI to make ethical decisions in line with human values is a major concern. This involves not only programming basic ethical principles but also ensuring the AI can handle complex ethical dilemmas and understands the potential consequences of its actions.
Emotions are another key aspect of human intelligence. To truly understand and interact seamlessly with humans, AI would need to be capable of recognizing, understanding, and even simulating emotional responses. This involves not only understanding the contextual cues that indicate emotion but also being able to appropriately respond to these cues in a way that demonstrates empathy.
Beauty and aesthetics, being highly subjective and culturally influenced, are another challenging realm. AI has begun to make strides in this area, such as creating art or music, but truly understanding what makes something beautiful to a human is a much more complex task.
Curiosity, or the drive to explore and learn, is yet another important factor. Some AI models have started to incorporate a form of curiosity to improve learning, but it's a far cry from the rich, contextually-driven curiosity we see in humans.
All these elements would ideally be incorporated into AGI to allow it to fully understand, learn from, and interact with the human world. These are challenging tasks and remain active areas of research.
