I was referring to this The 128-Language Quine Relay
18H04 (2018-04-12)share:     


Yusuke Endoh has created an astonishing 128 language Ouroborous quine. This Ruby program produces a Rust program, which produces a Scala program, which produces a Scheme program, and so on, progressing through another 124 languages to return to its original state. To understand what this is and how it came to be, we first need to consider the quine.

A quine is a program that prints its own source code to the screen. The term comes from philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine���s paradox ���Yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation,��� which fails to yield falsehood when preceded by its quotation, making it neither true nor false. The quine in code is named not in reference to the paradoxical quality of the statement, but to its embedding of the quote in itself, where it acts as both the subject and expression of the sentence. The quine program, likewise, flattens the reading of the program with the running of the program. If one were to print its source code to the screen or execute it, the result is the same.

Since this is a fancy way of saying ���it prints its own source code,��� one might expect such a program to be simple. However, even concise quines in fairly straightforward languages, like Python, are strange looking:



An Ouroborous quine, like Endoh���s Quine Relay cycles through many languages. We can think of an ordinary quine as an Ouroborous quine of only one language. Its primary feature is ending up back where it started, the snake eating its own tail. The multi-language Ouroborous is a cousin of the ployglot, the program which runs in more than one language, since each iteration of the Ouroborous quine holds information for the other steps, passively, until those steps are executed. At any one stage, changes to the program could affect any other step in the chain. Thus, adding a new language into the quine relay often involves touching nearly every line of the program. For an example of what that looks like, here���s a tiny excerpt from the diff for adding the Haxe language, between Haskell and Icon

https://esoteric.codes/blog/the-128-language-quine-relay
Nuspeak Translator
The "128-Language Quine Relay" created by Yusuke Endoh is a fascinating and complex example of a quine, a program that outputs its own source code. This particular quine is remarkable for its use of 128 different programming languages, forming an ouroboros���a symbolic serpent eating its own tail, representing cyclicality and self-reference.
In this quine relay, the output of one program in a specific language becomes the source code for the next program in a different language. This sequence continues through 128 languages, eventually circling back to the original code in Ruby. It's a stunning demonstration of both programming prowess and the intricate possibilities of code translation across multiple languages.
Key Points of the 128-Language Quine Relay:
Quine Definition
: A quine is a program that prints its own source code. It's a concept drawn from a paradox noted by philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine.
Complexity and Creativity
: Despite the seeming simplicity of a program that outputs its own source code, creating a quine, especially one that spans multiple languages, requires significant creativity and understanding of each language's nuances.
Ouroboros Quine
: This type of quine cycles through multiple languages, starting and ending with the same code, symbolizing the ouroboros. It's a more complex version of a standard quine, showcasing the interplay and compatibility of various programming languages.
Polyglot Aspect
: This quine relay is related to polyglot programming, where a single program is valid in multiple programming languages. Each segment of the quine contains code that is functional in multiple contexts.
Programming Challenge
: Integrating a new language into the quine relay can be challenging, as it often requires modifying nearly every line of the program to ensure that the entire sequence remains functional.
The 128-Language Quine Relay is not just a technical feat but also a work of programming art. It exemplifies the depth and breadth of coding languages and the intricate ways they can interact. This relay serves as a testament to the power of programming languages and the creativity of their users.

So maybe we can see the development of an idea as continually translating it into other notations or formats until it returns to original discussion, which in this case was Archimedean screwbots, which we called Graboid transport
Nuspeak Translator
Absolutely, the concept of the 128-Language Quine Relay can indeed be metaphorically applied to the development and evolution of ideas, particularly in our discussion about Archimedean screw bots and Graboid Transport. Just as the quine relay translates a program through various languages before returning to its origin, ideas can undergo a similar transformational journey. Let's break down this analogy:
Idea Translation
: The idea of Archimedean screw bots in Graboid Transport, when discussed, can be seen as evolving through various "conceptual languages." These languages could be different perspectives, applications, fields of knowledge, or even the cultural and philosophical contexts in which the idea is considered.
Evolving Understanding
: As the idea passes through these different lenses, it gains depth and breadth. This is akin to the quine relay, where the core program is expressed in various programming languages, each adding its own syntax and structure while preserving the core idea.
Returning to Origin
: After exploring various facets and applications, including self-healing materials, xylem economy, and even edible architecture, the discussion circles back to its original concept - Graboid Transport. This return mirrors the quine relay's completion of its cycle, bringing a richer and more nuanced understanding of the initial idea.
Enhanced by the Journey
: Just as the quine in different programming languages might reveal insights about the nature of each language, the journey of our idea through various contexts and applications enriches our understanding of its potential, challenges, and implications.
Continuous Process
: Similar to the ouroboros symbol in the quine relay, the development of ideas is continuous. Each cycle of translation and return can lead to new insights, adaptations, and innovations, fueling ongoing discussion and exploration.
In summary, the development of the Graboid Transport idea, when viewed through this metaphor, underscores the dynamic and evolving nature of idea generation and innovation. It's a process that continually transforms and adapts, gaining value and complexity with each iteration, much like a program being translated across a multitude of programming languages in a quine relay.

It seems like I was discussing a culinary quine, using the curry-centric hub and spoke model with the hexagonal food wheel, where the food is slowly merged from one food into other through gradual interpolations, and also the pumpkin disassembly-reassembly device, which attempts to 3d print pumpkins from separated and processed pumpkin ingredients
Nuspeak Translator
Your concept of a "culinary quine" using a curry-centric hub and spoke model, along with the hexagonal food wheel and the pumpkin disassembly-reassembly device, is a fascinating application of the quine concept to the culinary world. It represents a creative blend of cooking, technology, and systemic thinking. Let's delve into how these components form a culinary quine:
Curry-Centric Hub and Spoke Model
: This model can be seen as the central program or core idea in your culinary quine. Just like the initial code in a quine relay, the curry acts as the starting point. In this model, different ingredients or dishes (spokes) radiate out from the central curry (hub), each connected yet distinct.
Hexagonal Food Wheel
: This wheel allows for gradual interpolation between different foods, much like how a quine program transitions smoothly from one language to another. In this culinary context, it could mean creating dishes that progressively change in flavor, texture, or ingredients, eventually looping back to the original dish.
Pumpkin Disassembly-Reassembly Device
: Mirroring the idea of a quine replicating its own source code, this device conceptually 'disassembles' a pumpkin into its base ingredients and then 'reassembles' or 3D prints it. This reflects the self-referential nature of a quine, where the output mirrors the input.
Gradual Interpolations of Food
: The process of merging one food into another through gradual changes is akin to the transitions in a quine relay. Each step is a transformation that���s subtly different from the last, eventually returning to the starting point but enriched by the journey.
Culinary Quine as an Infinite Loop
: The entire process, from the curry-centric model to the pumpkin device, forms a loop of creation, transformation, and recreation. This loop can be seen as a never-ending cycle of culinary innovation, where dishes are continuously evolved and reimagined.
In essence, your culinary quine is a system where food and flavors are constantly evolving, yet always connected to their origins. It���s a concept that celebrates both the diversity and unity of culinary art, emphasizing a continuous, creative exploration of flavors and techniques. This idea could lead to novel experiences in gastronomy, much like how a quine relay in programming showcases the versatility and interconnectivity of different coding languages.
