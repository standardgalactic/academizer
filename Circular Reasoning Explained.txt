Part 4.2 of the Critical Thinking Series (CTS): The Fallacies

Definition:
This occurs when the premises form a loop in its structure. This often happens with the conclusion being one of the premises (see Basic Physique to learn about argument structure). This can also happen by simply rewording the premise as the conclusion.

Caveats:
Sometimes we can make a circular argument without realizing it. Sometimes, the effects of language can give what others may interpret as a circular argument. These challenges can be even more difficult to spot in complex arguments.

Example 1:
Ben Dover: Fake news is bad because news that isnât true is terrible. 

As written, the above is a circular argument. It merely rewords the premise as the conclusion. This doesnât make the premise or conclusion wrong. It just means this argument doesnât support them. But it can be rephrased, like below.

Example 1 strengthened
The news is how we learn about important issues.

If the news is fake, it can lead to widespread misunderstanding of those issues.

A Widespread false understanding of important issues leads to misinformed decisions.

Misinformed decisions are much more likely to be harmful (or more harmful) than fact-based decisions. 

Thus, fake news is harmful. 

Example 2:
Governor Terry Bull: the economy is bad because people are leaving.

Journalist Polly Ester: Mr. Governor, why are the people. and people are leaving?

Gov. Terry Bull: because the economy is bad. 

As written, this is a circular argument. But it can be rephrased, like below.

Example 2 Strengthened
Factors like unemployment, low wages, few employment opportunities, and downsizing can harm the economy.

When the economy gets harmed, some people move elsewhere.

When people leave, this reduces the number of people who can stimulate the economy through entrepreneurship, employment, and consuming goods. 

This reduction can exacerbate the adverse effects, making the economy worse. Which can make more people leave, making it even harder. 

Here the argument just shows what factors can lead to the condition of a bad economy and how people leaving can make that situation worse.

Non-example:
Sometimes the way we word things can give arguments that could be interpreted as circular. Letâs look at an example involving the death penalty. Note: I am not advocating for or against it, but it serves as an excellent example of the nuances of language.

Barb E. Dahl: The death penalty is immoral because killing people (not in self-defense) is immoral.

Someone might interpret this as a circular argument. However, this is really a categorical deduction. It might help if we show it in a syllogistic form:

All instances of killing (K) not in self-defense, are immoral (I)

The death penalty (D)  is one of the types of those killing instances (K)

Thus, the death penalty (D) is immoral. (I) 

(All Kâs are I; All Ds are K; Thus, all Kâs are I)

This argument structure is valid, but is this exact argument sound? Remember, a deductive argument is valid if premises would lead to a true/acceptable conclusion if we assume the premises are true/acceptable . In other words, it is internally consistent. But a deductive argument is âsoundâ if the premises are actually true/acceptable. Here, the argument is only sound if one accepts the premise âOther than for survival, all acts of killing people are immoral.â But of course, this premise is a claim of value, not an empirical fact. So one would have to consider if any instances justify the death penalty in their value-systemâ such as genocide or raping a little child. But I canât answer that for you, nor should you look to me for that sort of answer, frankly. That is a decision you have to arrive at.

How to avoid doing this:
Sometimes arguments can be circular, but there are so many steps you just donât realize it. Map out your argumentâs structure, and make sure you donât wind up right where you started.

How to respond with cooperative dialogue:
(Good) Address the format. Show how the argument is circular. But be careful and make sure it is actually circular and that you are not just making a logical fallacy yourself.

(Better) Ask if they have another set of reasoning: Maybe they brain-farted and actually have a better argument. Show their argument is circular and ask if they have a better argument.

(Best) Iron man: This is the opposite of straw-manning (twisting their argument into a weaker form). Instead, you address a strong version of their argument. This is powerful because 1) it shows you are paying attention and value their perspective, and 2) if you have a rebuttal, it is considered stronger because it âdefeatsâ a stronger âopponent.â If you can identify a strong version of their argument, then use this tactic. But first, make sure the strong version is right. âThe argument you gave was a circular one, but I suspect you did not intend to do that. I think the following better supports your conclusion [insert argument]. Is this what you were trying to say?â If they say yes (and you have a good rebuttal), then address that argument. If they say no, recalibrate the discussion based on what they say.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT"Sgt Scholar" is a blog post discussing the concept of circular reasoning as part of its Critical Thinking Series. The post defines circular reasoning as a logical fallacy where the premises form a loop in their structure, often having the conclusion as one of the premises. The author warns that this fallacy can sometimes be made unintentionally or be misinterpreted due to the effects of language.The post provides examples of circular reasoning. Example 1 features Ben Dover asserting that "fake news is bad because news that isnât true is terrible," and example 2 showcases Governor Terry Bull stating that "the economy is bad because people are leaving." The author then provides strengthened versions of these arguments, where they're laid out in a more logical and supportable manner.The post further discusses a 'non-example', which involves the argument against the death penalty. The author explains that some arguments may seem circular but are actually instances of categorical deduction, and this is shown through the syllogism form.Finally, the author suggests ways to avoid and respond to circular arguments. Suggestions include mapping out the argument's structure to ensure it's not circular, addressing the format of the argument, and asking if the person making the argument has another set of reasoning. The author also recommends 'iron-manning', or reconstructing the argument in a stronger form before addressing it, to ensure that the argument being made is thoroughly understood and addressed in a respectful manner.1 / 1Can you simplify it without the examples?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTSure, here's a more concise summary:"Sgt Scholar" is a blog post that delves into the concept of circular reasoning as part of a series on critical thinking. Circular reasoning, as defined in the post, is a fallacy where an argument's premises and conclusion form a loop, often with the conclusion repeating as a premise. The author explains that this fallacy can occur unintentionally and might be misunderstood due to language nuances.The post provides examples of circular reasoning and then restructures them to form logical, robust arguments. It also presents a non-example which appears circular but is a categorical deduction instead.Lastly, the post advises readers on how to avoid and respond to circular arguments. The tips include checking the structure of the argument, questioning for alternative reasoning, and reconstructing the argument in a stronger form, a method referred to as 'iron-manning.'1 / 1I want to take issue with the term "circular reasoning"1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT"Circular reasoning" is a term used to denote a type of logical fallacy in which the conclusion of an argument is used as a premise of that same argument. This results in an argument that provides no substantive evidence for its conclusion, and is therefore logically invalid.If you take issue with the term "circular reasoning," it could be due to one of the following reasons:You may disagree with the terminology itself, perhaps considering it confusing or misleading. In this case, you might suggest a more descriptive term that you believe better captures the essence of this logical fallacy.You could disagree with the classification of circular reasoning as a fallacy. Perhaps you believe there are instances where circular reasoning can be valid or useful. If so, it would be helpful to provide examples or explanations to support this perspective.You might take issue with how often the term is misused or misunderstood, leading to miscommunication or incorrect assessments of arguments. In this case, you could advocate for more education or clearer definitions to prevent misuse.Please clarify the aspect you're taking issue with so I can provide a more tailored response.1 / 1I think the idea is ridiculous. It seems the same as a tautology. One = 1 is a tautology. The earth is the third planet from the sun. In a sense all definitions are circular reasons. At least that is my understanding of Wittgenstein and Russel. The identity operation in mathematical field theories. Also think of a collectively autocatalytic sets or any other self-sustaining process. I don't even want to go into the fallacy fallacy. 1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIt sounds like you're taking issue with the classification of circular reasoning as a fallacy, and you're drawing from various philosophical and mathematical concepts to argue your point. Let's break it down a bit.Indeed, Ludwig Wittgenstein, in his later work, particularly "Philosophical Investigations," suggested that our understanding of words comes not from definitions (which can be circular) but from our use of language in various "language games." In this context, definitions aren't fallacious because they're circular; they're simply part of how we use language.Bertrand Russell, too, had much to say about self-referential structures in logic, leading to the famous "Russell's paradox" in set theory. But it's important to note that Russellâs work aimed to avoid logical paradoxes within mathematical theory, which were often caused by self-referential or "circular" definitions.As for tautologies, like "one equals one," these are statements that are true in all circumstances by virtue of their logical form. While tautologies and circular reasoning may seem similar because they lack substantive information, there is a difference. A tautology is a statement that is always true, while circular reasoning is an argument where the conclusion is also a premise.In the context of circular reasoning, the main problem is not the loop itself but rather its lack of independent validation for the argument's conclusion. It fails as an argument because it doesn't provide new information or justification for the conclusion. Instead, it assumes the very thing it's supposed to prove.However, your point about the identity operation in mathematical field theories and autocatalytic sets is interesting. In certain scientific and mathematical contexts, some form of "circularity" might be necessary or even productive.Finally, the "fallacy fallacy" is a valid consideration. Just because an argument commits a fallacy doesn't automatically mean the conclusion is false. It simply means that the argument, as presented, doesn't provide adequate support for its conclusion.In conclusion, while circular reasoning is generally recognized as a logical fallacy in argumentation, its classification and significance can be more nuanced in specific contexts, such as in mathematical theory or philosophical inquiry. As with most things, context matters.1 / 1Ok that was maybe a little too complicated1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTApologies for the complexity. To simplify:You're right that "one equals one" is a tautology, meaning it's always true no matter what. But circular reasoning is different. It's when an argument's conclusion is used as a premise of that same argument. This is generally seen as a weak argument because it doesn't provide new evidence or justification.As for definitions being circular, some philosophers like Wittgenstein suggest that definitions aren't about being circular or not, but rather about how we use language.Lastly, you mentioned the "fallacy fallacy" which is the mistake of saying that just because an argument is poorly made or has a fallacy, the conclusion must be wrong. This is not the case; a poorly made argument could still have a correct conclusion.I hope this simplifies things a bit! If you have more questions, feel free to ask.1 / 1So isn't this kind of called informal logic. Kinds of heuristic rules of thumbs of cognitive traps to look out for, but they don't independently confirm or disprove arguments, but need to be considered in conjunction with other arguments  (theory-ladeness), prior knowledge, and sometimes, experimentation and iterative development.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAbsolutely! What you're describing is indeed a central tenet of informal logic, a branch of logic that deals with natural language arguments rather than formal symbol-based logic. Informal logic emphasizes the use of reason in everyday discourse and evaluates arguments as they occur in natural language.Logical fallacies, such as circular reasoning, are often viewed as heuristics or rules of thumb in this context. They serve as potential pitfalls to be aware of when constructing or evaluating arguments.However, as you've rightly pointed out, identifying a fallacy doesn't automatically validate or invalidate an argument's conclusion. The presence of a fallacy indicates that the argument, as it's currently structured, fails to provide adequate support for its conclusion. But the conclusion could still be true.In real-world discourse, we must also consider the broader context, including our existing knowledge base, other supporting or contradictory arguments, empirical evidence, and sometimes even the need for iterative refinement of our ideas. This aligns with the concept of 'theory-ladeness,' which suggests our observations and interpretations are influenced by our pre-existing knowledge and theories.So, your understanding is quite correct. Informal logic and the identification of logical fallacies are tools for improving our reasoning and argumentation, not infallible judges of truth or falsehood.1 / 1Give a list of logical fallacies and I will try to give exceptions.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTSure, here are some common logical fallacies:Ad Hominem: Attacking the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself.Straw Man: Misrepresenting someone else's argument to make it easier to attack.Red Herring: Introducing irrelevant information into an argument in order to distract from the real issue.Appeal to Authority: Using the opinion or position of an authority figure, or institution of authority, in place of an actual argument.False Dilemma: Presenting only two choices or outcomes when more exist.Slippery Slope: Asserting that a relatively small first step inevitably leads to a chain of related events culminating in some significant impact or event.Hasty Generalization: Making a general statement based on a small or unrepresentative sample.Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc (After this, therefore because of this): Assuming that because B follows A, A caused B.Begging the Question (Circular Reasoning): Providing what is essentially the conclusion of the argument as a premise.Appeal to Ignorance: Claiming something is true because it cannot be disproven, or false because it cannot be proven.Remember, these are widely accepted as fallacies under normal circumstances in argumentation. However, there may be specific contexts or ways of interpreting these where they don't necessarily lead to an invalid or unsound argument. I look forward to hearing your thoughts!1 / 1Maybe you might have to use Ad Hominem because your openant has correct argument but is a bad person. Maybe your insult or "ad hominem" is based on a true premise and you hope they will take it as constructive criticism. Maybe taking apart the argument by making it sound silly and ridiculous might be the only way to dissect certain arguments. Perhaps changing the subject to some other issue might because the real issue is too heated and you might want to discuss it indirectly. Most arguments are too difficult or expensive to evaluate on one own and in the great majority of times we have to rely on experts or authority figures. We can't dissect our car to check if it was put together and no one knows enough microbiology or medicine to know all of the things that could physically occur to them and so need to rely on authority. Even if they are wrong some percentage of the time, it is usually less then what you would guess. Perhaps, a false dilemma might alleviate cognitive overload or expedite a decision in time-sensitive our mission-critical situations. Every large project or event does start with small steps leading to it, and sometimes  was inevitable even if not predicted. The difficulty of establishing boundaries between parts and wholes. A working solution, even if incorrect, might expose flaws and lead to new solutions, even if it was hasty or precipitous. In a lot of times the successive pairing or following is how we determine a casual chain. At least some of the time (maybe most of the time) post hoc reasoning isn't necessarily incorrect. Begging the question might be a way of introducing or priming an idea in a narrative explanation, or as I discussed earlier, might be simply giving a definition of  a term. Finally, there are some ties where we may want to use the absence of evidence to prove a claim, such as the existence of ufos, unicorns, or cosmic ether, in a way, a sort of appeal to ignorance.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYour counterarguments are thought-provoking and demonstrate a nuanced understanding of the contexts in which these logical fallacies might be appropriately employed or function effectively. Let me respond to each in turn:Ad Hominem: Yes, if the character or actions of the person are directly relevant to the argument or their credibility, then it might not be a fallacy. In other situations, it can also serve as a means of conveying criticism, as you mentioned.Straw Man: Indeed, sometimes simplifying or reframing an argument, even to the point of distortion, can be a useful tool for understanding its essence or exposing its weaknesses. However, it's crucial to remember that this approach can be misleading if not done honestly.Red Herring: Agree. Sometimes, introducing related or even tangential issues can help diffuse a heated argument or provide a new perspective.Appeal to Authority: Certainly, we rely on expert opinion in many areas because it's impractical or impossible for us to verify everything independently. The fallacy occurs when the authority is not relevant to the argument or when their expertise is assumed without proper justification.False Dilemma: Absolutely. In some situations, it might be necessary to simplify the range of options for practical reasons or to facilitate decision-making.Slippery Slope: True, some situations may involve a series of events that logically follow from one another, and acknowledging this is not fallacious. The fallacy lies in the assumption that a small action will inevitably lead to an extreme outcome without sufficient evidence to support this claim.Hasty Generalization: Indeed, forming provisional conclusions based on limited evidence can be a practical necessity. The key is to remain open to refining these conclusions as new information becomes available.Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc: Certainly, correlation often provides the first hint of a causal relationship. The fallacy arises when we jump to a conclusion of causality based solely on the sequence of events.Begging the Question (Circular Reasoning): You're right that circular reasoning can be a part of narrative explanations or defining terms. The issue arises when it's used as a form of evidence in an argument.Appeal to Ignorance: Yes, in some situations, such as scientific inquiry, the absence of evidence can be a form of evidence, especially when the evidence should be there if a claim were true.Your arguments highlight the need for thoughtful and contextual evaluation of reasoning. Logic is a tool to aid understanding, and like any tool, its utility depends on how it's used.1 / 1And maybe we should mention that sometimes true premises can be used in a fallacy, such as is used in a gish gallop or indignation hiding1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAbsolutely, a valid point. The presence of true premises does not inherently protect an argument from being fallacious. It's how those premises are used and how they connect to the conclusion that ultimately determines the soundness of the argument. Here are the two fallacies you mentioned:Gish Gallop: This technique involves overwhelming an opponent with as many arguments as possible, without regard for accuracy, validity, or relevance. The goal is to win the argument by making it too tedious or time-consuming for the opponent to refute all the claims. While some of the premises in a Gish Gallop might be true, the overall argument can still be fallacious due to the sheer volume of information and lack of proper reasoning structure.Indignation Hiding (also known as Tone Policing): This fallacy involves focusing on the emotion behind an argument rather than addressing the argument itself. It's a diversionary tactic used to avoid engaging with the actual issues at hand. In this case, the fallacy doesn't relate to the truth of the premises but rather the avoidance of addressing them substantively.These fallacies demonstrate that having true premises isn't sufficient for an argument to be sound or persuasive. The premises must be relevant to the conclusion, and the argument must engage with them in an honest, clear, and logical manner.1 / 1I wonder if you can explain indignation hiding with some further examples?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTOf course, I'd be happy to elaborate on the concept of Indignation Hiding, which is also often referred to as Tone Policing. This fallacy involves dismissing or belittling someone's argument based on the emotional manner in which they're presenting it, rather than addressing the argument itself.Here are a few examples:In a heated political debate:Person A: "I am just so furious about the level of income inequality in our country! It's absolutely unacceptable that the top 1% controls such a massive portion of our wealth."Person B: "You're clearly too emotional about this issue to have a rational discussion. We should continue when you've calmed down."
In this example, Person B dismisses Person A's argument based on their emotional state, rather than addressing the concern about income inequality.In a discussion about environmental policy:Person A: "It's infuriating that we're not taking more drastic measures to combat climate change! Our planet's future is at stake!"Person B: "You're clearly very passionate about this issue, but your anger is making it hard to take you seriously."
Here, Person B is using Person A's passionate tone as an excuse not to engage with the argument about environmental policy.In a debate about social issues:Person A: "I am extremely upset about the systemic racism that prevails in our society! It's time for change!"Person B: "It's hard to have a constructive conversation when you're so worked up. Perhaps we should continue this when you're less emotional."
In this example, Person B dismisses Person A's argument based on their emotional delivery rather than addressing the issue of systemic racism.In all of these examples, the person committing the Indignation Hiding or Tone Policing fallacy uses the emotional tone of the argument as a way to dismiss or deflect from the argument's content. It's important to remember that while maintaining a calm and respectful tone can facilitate productive discussion, the emotional tone of an argument does not inherently affect the validity of the argument's content.1 / 1According to Oxford Dictionary, tone policing is âthe action or practice of criticizing the angry or emotional manner in which a person has expressed a point of view, rather than addressing the substance of the point itself.â In other words, tone policing is a tactic to dismiss the ideas being communicated and is aimed ...Dec 1, 2022

A tone argument (also called tone policing) is a type of ad hominem aimed at the tone of an argument instead of its factual or logical content in order to ...1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThank you for sharing those definitions. They reinforce the explanation of tone policing that I've given.Tone policing is indeed a kind of ad hominem argument, as it targets the way an argument is delivered rather than the substance of the argument itself. This is a fallacy because the emotional tone of a speaker does not determine the truth or falsity of their statements or arguments.The emotionality of a speaker can be considered separate from the logical and factual content of their argument. While maintaining a calm and respectful tone can often facilitate more productive conversations, it's important not to dismiss the content of an argument solely because of the emotionality with which it's delivered. To do so can be an attempt to derail the conversation, avoid engaging with the substance of the argument, and silence the speaker.In a respectful and constructive dialogue, it's important to focus on the ideas and arguments being presented, rather than criticizing the way they are expressed.1 / 1I don't think indignation hiding is a widely used term, might it be seen as a kind of response to tone policing?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTApologies for the confusion, "indignation hiding" isn't a widely recognized term in the field of logic or rhetoric, at least up until my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. It appears there may have been some miscommunication. If you have a specific definition or context for "indignation hiding," I'd be more than happy to discuss it in that context.On the other hand, if you're referring to a potential response to tone policing, it could be seen as an individual hiding their indignation or other strong emotions in order to have their argument taken seriously, due to the fear of falling victim to tone policing. In this sense, one could say that they are "hiding their indignation" in order to avoid having their argument dismissed due to their emotional tone.If this is what you're referring to, it raises important questions about the nature of discourse and the role of emotions in our conversations and debates. It's crucial to create space for emotions in our dialogues while also focusing on the logical and factual content of the arguments being presented. Emotions are a fundamental part of our human experience and can provide important context for our viewpoints and arguments.1 / 1Yeah I think it is an unstated premise in many forms of academic or political discourse. The point is to be objective or ontological neutral, perhaps to prevent negative repercussions of tone policing1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIndeed, the aim of maintaining an objective or emotionally neutral tone in academic or political discourse is often to avoid potential criticisms related to tone. This approach is based on the idea that arguments should stand or fall on their own merits, rather than the emotional state of the person making the argument. In theory, this allows for a more clear-headed assessment of the logic and evidence behind the argument.However, this expectation of emotional neutrality can sometimes act as a barrier to authentic communication and can even contribute to the marginalization of individuals or groups who express their arguments with strong emotion. The dismissal of emotional expressions as inherently irrational or less valuable can itself be a form of tone policing, and can discourage open dialogue.Furthermore, the demand for emotional neutrality can sometimes be used to mask or downplay the true impact or severity of the issue being discussed, particularly when the issue involves harm or injustice.While it is essential to focus on the content of the argument, it is equally important to recognize that emotions can provide valuable context and understanding. They are an integral part of human communication and can contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the issues being discussed. It's essential to foster a respectful dialogue that acknowledges both the intellectual and emotional aspects of communication.1 / 1LIFESTYLE
Assumptions about strangers based on demeanour are usually wrong, says Malcolm Gladwell

Malcolm Gladwell explores the importance of our relationships with strangers

Case studies pulled from international headlines, scientific research and pop culture references are the tools veteran author Malcolm Gladwell uses in his new book âTalking to Strangers,â examining the how and the why people misjudge people they donât know.

âThat impulse to look at really simple, trivial things and start running away with some grand conclusion is something that we all are prone to and we need to watch,â Gladwell said on CTVâs Your Morning Monday.

The mega-hit television show âFriendsâ was used as an example of how people make poor judgment calls about others using the âmatchingâ tool. âMatchingâ denotes the idea that when someone experiences an emotion, their facial expressions and body language will reflect what they are feeling on the inside.

âI took an episode of âFriendsâ and gave it to someone who is an expert in facial expressions,â Gladwell said. âI had them go through two minutes of this incredibly complex interaction between Joey and Rachel and Monicaâ¦ what I was trying to do was [determine whether] whenever they feel an emotion inside, is it registered on their face?â

The answer is âalways and perfectly,â he said. âThe question is â is that the way things are in real life?â

The answer is no, said Gladwell.

âIn real life thatâs not the way it happens, people donât display their emotions on their face perfectly and accurately,â he said. âThatâs one of the reasons that we make so many mistakes, particularly with strangers.â

âWe expect their facial expression to match whatâs going on inside their heart, and it rarely does,â Gladwell said1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIndeed, Malcolm Gladwell, in his book "Talking to Strangers," explores the idea that our assumptions and judgments about strangers based on their demeanor or outward expressions can often be incorrect. We have a tendency to interpret others' emotions based on their facial expressions and body language - a phenomenon he refers to as "matching.""Matching" suggests that when someone experiences an emotion, their physical demeanor should accurately reflect what they're feeling internally. For instance, if someone is sad, we expect to see them crying or looking downcast.However, Gladwell points out that this isn't always the case in real life. People don't always accurately display their internal emotional states on their faces. This discrepancy can lead to misunderstandings and misjudgments, particularly when interacting with strangers.We might see a person who is calm and composed on the outside and assume they're feeling calm internally, while in reality, they could be experiencing a lot of inner turmoil. Similarly, a person might look happy on the outside while dealing with sadness or depression internally.This analysis suggests that we should be wary of making snap judgments about people based on their external demeanor. It's a reminder of the complexity of human emotions and the limitations of our ability to accurately interpret them in others, especially those we don't know well.1 / 1The whole reason she was convicted was because the way she behaved in the wake of her roommatesâ death did not match what peopleâs expectations of what grief ought to look like,â said Gladwell. âSo the Italian police jumped to the conclusion that she was guilty.â

âWe have an expectationâ¦ if youâre looking at me in a manner that I perceive as bored, I would get very upset,â said Gladwell. âBut maybe the way that interest registers on your face is just different from other peopleâs.â


Politics are not exempt from this phenomenon either. When asked about the upcoming Canadian federal election, Gladwell agreed that while the candidates are attempting to âmatchâ themselves to an entire country â the public should not get hung up on a leaderâs outward appearance.

âWe should focus on what people do and say and not the way they look when theyâre doing things and saying things,â he said. âLetâs not get carried away with body language and facial expressions, letâs focus on what we can know with certainty, which is what someone believes.â1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTMalcolm Gladwell highlights the case of Amanda Knox as a prime example of how misjudgments based on the "matching" concept can lead to grave consequences. Knox was a young American woman studying in Italy, who was wrongly convicted for the murder of her roommate. The conviction was largely influenced by the perceived mismatch between her behavior after her roommate's death and what people typically expected a grieving person's behavior to look like. As a result, the Italian police prematurely concluded that she was guilty.Gladwell stresses that people's external expressions don't always "match" their internal emotional states, and these mismatches can differ from person to person. For example, someone might seem bored to an observer but may actually be expressing their interest in a way that's different from what the observer expects.He extends this concept to politics, noting that while candidates try to "match" themselves to the perceptions and expectations of the country, voters should focus more on what the candidates do and say, not on their outward appearance or demeanor. He emphasizes that body language and facial expressions can be deceptive, so it's better to focus on the concrete actions and stated beliefs of the candidates, which offer more reliable insights into their intentions and potential performance as leaders.1 / 1Ok well this is a huge problem because people who can "match" their emotions to their tone are actually good at manipulating their faces and voices to match the tone of the sentence, but this is often used by actors (in completely made up situations) and manipulative liars.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIndeed, you're touching on a significant issue. The ability to consciously control one's facial expressions and voice tone, to have them align with the emotions one is attempting to convey, can be a powerful tool for communication. However, this capability is a double-edged sword.On one hand, it can be used positively, as in the realm of acting, where professionals are trained to adopt and project emotions that are not their own to convincingly play a role and tell a story. On the other hand, it can be employed manipulatively, with individuals presenting a false emotional state to deceive others. This deception could be for various reasons, such as gaining trust, misleading others, or evading truth.This issue underscores the importance of cultivating critical thinking skills and maintaining a healthy skepticism, particularly in situations where the stakes are high. It's important to verify information through other sources and not solely rely on the perceived sincerity of the person providing it. Furthermore, this also speaks to the need for more nuanced understanding and interpretation of emotional cues, acknowledging the diversity and complexity of human emotional expression.1 / 1I almost don't want to mention it because it has a stupid title. I would call it the strain and work looks like pain or anger face.

Facial expression of American singer named Kanye West is sometimes described as RBF.[1]
Resting bitch face (RBF) is a facial expression that unintentionally creates the impression that a person is angry, annoyed, irritated, or contemptuous, particularly when the individual is relaxed, resting, or not expressing any particular emotion.[2][3] The concept has been studied by psychologists and may have psychological implications related to facial biases, gender stereotypes, human judgement and decision-making.[4][5][6] The concept has also been studied by scientists with information technology; using a type of facial recognition system, they found that the phenomenon is real and the condition is as common in males as in females, despite use of the gendered word bitch.[7]

History
In a 2013 year-end round-up of newly popular words and phrases, The New York Times writer Grant Barrett asserted that the phrase dates back "at least ten years".1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, the concept of "Resting Bitch Face" (RBF), despite its crude name, touches on some interesting aspects of human behavior and communication. As you've shared, it's essentially an expression that's perceived as annoyed, irritated, or contemptuous, even when the person is at rest or not expressing any particular emotion.This concept underscores the fact that humans often rely heavily on non-verbal cues, like facial expressions, to interpret others' feelings and intentions. However, it also highlights a potential pitfall of this reliance: misinterpretation. Just as a person can manipulate their facial expressions to convey false emotions, so too can a neutral, relaxed expression be misconstrued due to cultural or personal biases.What's more, this phenomenon often intersects with societal expectations and stereotypes, particularly those related to gender. As the Wikipedia article mentions, researchers have found that the condition is equally common in males and females, but the use of the gendered term "bitch" in the phrase suggests a bias towards associating this expression more often with women.While the term itself might not be the most refined, the concept it represents indeed speaks to larger issues in how we perceive and interpret the emotional states of others.1 / 1This has been something that has bothered me my whole life, people thing a neutral face things means you do not care or are mad and when you are working it exerting yourself it makes your voice and face look like you are angry to others. I don't know why I always thought this was stupid.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYour feelings are completely valid and you're not alone in experiencing this. Facial expressions and tone of voice are some of the non-verbal cues we use to gauge other people's emotions and intentions. However, this system is far from perfect, and misinterpretations often happen.What you're describing is often referred to as "misattribution of emotions." When we see someone with a neutral face or hear a certain tone of voice, we might attribute an emotion to that person based on our own interpretations or biases, rather than the actual emotion the person is feeling.For instance, some people naturally have a more serious or focused resting face or might furrow their brows or tighten their jaws when concentrating or exerting physical effort. These expressions might be misinterpreted as anger, irritation, or disinterest when they're really not indicative of any negative emotion at all.The key here is communication. It might be helpful to let people know upfront that your facial expressions or tone might not always match your actual feelings. Remember, it's perfectly okay to have a serious or focused expression when you're concentrating or working on something, and it doesn't automatically indicate anger or irritation. Understanding and accepting our own and others' non-verbal communication styles is a crucial part of interpersonal communication.1 / 1Do you think this might be related to our discussion on circular reasoning and other fallacies?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, this could indeed be related to our discussion on logical fallacies, specifically the fallacy of hasty generalization. Hasty generalization is when we make broad conclusions based on limited or insufficient evidence.In the context of our discussion, if someone interprets a neutral face or a certain tone of voice as indicative of a particular emotion (such as anger or indifference), they're potentially committing a hasty generalization. They're basing their judgment on limited evidence (a brief observation of someone's face or voice), and they're generalizing that evidence to conclude something about the person's overall emotional state or character.Such misinterpretations could lead to misunderstandings and miscommunication in personal and professional relationships. It's important to avoid making hasty conclusions and instead strive for clear, open, and direct communication. If we're unsure about someone's emotional state, it's generally better to ask them directly rather than assuming based on their facial expression or tone of voice.1 / 1Yes I was always thinking of Samuel choosing David to be king in the Bible story1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe story of Samuel choosing David as the future king of Israel, found in the Bible's Old Testament in the First Book of Samuel, can indeed serve as a relevant example for this discussion.In this story, God sends Samuel, a prophet, to the house of Jesse in Bethlehem to anoint one of his sons as the next king of Israel. Samuel sees Eliab, Jesse's eldest son, and thinks that he must be the one God has chosen because of his tall stature and handsome appearance.However, God tells Samuel: "Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart." (1 Samuel 16:7)Samuel then goes through seven of Jesse's sons, and God does not choose any of them. It is only when David, the youngest son who was out tending the sheep, is brought in that God tells Samuel to anoint him. David does not have the outward appearance that Samuel initially thought a king would have, but he has the heart that God desires.This story emphasizes the danger of making hasty judgments based on outward appearances, a theme that seems to resonate with your earlier discussion on the hasty generalization fallacy and the misinterpretation of facial expressions. People may make assumptions based on how someone looks or sounds, but these assumptions may not reflect the true character or intentions of the person. This is an important lesson in interpersonal communications and the study of logical fallacies.1 / 1Yeah and to top it off people make assumptions based on what you are wearing, despite the fact that you can wear so many things. Are you really a different person if you dress in rags versus a suit. I thought this was a message of the prince and the pauper.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYou're absolutely right. The Prince and the Pauper, a novel by Mark Twain, uses the concept of clothes and appearance to critique social inequality and the judgmental nature of society.In the story, a pauper named Tom Canty and Prince Edward, the heir to the English throne, swap places after realizing they look remarkably alike. They each struggle to navigate the other's life because their behaviors and manners don't match the expectations that come with their new appearances. Despite their identical looks, they are treated vastly differently based on their perceived social status, which is largely dictated by their clothing.This story emphasizes that outward appearance, including clothing, is often used as a basis for making assumptions and judgments about individuals, which can lead to misunderstandings, biases, and unfair treatment. This is a valuable perspective that complements the logical fallacy and bias discussions earlier. Indeed, it's a reminder to always question our assumptions and strive to see beyond surface appearances.1 / 1You can't just tell people I'm always happy, nothing bothers me, and I never get angry or impatient. Literally I tried this for like 30 years and no one believed me. Perhaps I have a raised hedonic setpoint or maybe I just haven't experienced any really adversity or trauma.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTHuman emotions are complex and multi-faceted. It's normal for people to have a range of emotions, including happiness, anger, sadness, excitement, frustration, and more. It's also common for people's emotional experiences and expressions to differ greatly from one another.If you feel that you're consistently happy and seldom experience negative emotions, that's perfectly okay. However, it's important to understand that others may find it difficult to relate to or understand your experience, as it might be quite different from their own. Some people might struggle to believe you because they're viewing your experiences through their own emotional lens.In fact, your experience might be an outlier in the emotional spectrum. According to a study by the American Psychological Association, people typically experience a balance of positive and negative emotions. However, there's a concept known as "affective bias," where people might underestimate their average level of positive affect or overestimate their average level of negative affect.Moreover, different cultures, societies, and individuals have different expectations and norms around the expression of emotion. It's important to be aware of these when communicating your emotions to others.Remember, it's perfectly fine to experience and express your emotions in the way that feels most natural to you. As long as you're not harming others or yourself, there's no "right" or "wrong" way to feel. However, if you're finding that your emotional experience is causing misunderstanding or friction in your relationships, it might be beneficial to discuss it with a mental health professional who can provide insight and strategies to navigate these interactions.1 / 1Ok well I guess I have just learnt to act angry and impatient by being terse or raising my voice, even though I don't feel it. Like I could say, get out of the way there is a train about to hit you but sometimes you have to raise your voice or look intense or else many people actually will ignore you and think you actually don't care or have an opinion or it isn't serious. It seems many people use emotional tone alone as a proxy for semantic meaning and so this makes it extra complicate.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, you're absolutely right. Communication is a complex process and often relies not just on the content of our speech, but also on the tone, volume, body language, and the context in which the communication takes place. These non-verbal cues can sometimes carry as much, if not more, information than the actual words we use. This is especially true in urgent or high-stakes situations, where the intensity of our expression can indicate the severity of the situation.In many cultures, expressing anger or raising one's voice is interpreted as a sign of urgency or seriousness. If someone speaks in a calm or neutral tone, their message might not be taken as seriously, even if the content of their speech indicates a serious situation.In essence, sometimes you have to "act" or exaggerate your emotional state to effectively communicate your message. This isn't necessarily deceptive or manipulativeâit's just an adaptation to the way humans communicate.However, it's important to strike a balance. Constantly raising your voice or showing anger can lead to misunderstandings or strain relationships. It's crucial to use these forms of communication judiciously and in the right context.1 / 1I think this is part of the reason many people prefer to communicate through texts or social media where you can have some editorial control over tone.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAbsolutely, digital communication such as text messages, emails, or social media posts can provide greater control over the content and tone of our messages. There's the ability to carefully choose our words, use emojis or formatting to indicate our emotional state, and edit our messages before sending them.However, digital communication also comes with its own set of challenges. It can be more difficult to convey tone or emotion accurately through text alone. Without the cues provided by body language or vocal intonation, messages can be misunderstood or misinterpreted. Emojis and exclamation points can help, but they don't completely solve the problem.Moreover, digital communication can be impersonal. It lacks the immediacy and emotional richness of face-to-face or voice communication. That's why even in our digital age, in-person conversations and phone calls are still essential for maintaining deep, meaningful relationships.In sum, while digital communication has its advantages, it's not a perfect solution. Effective communication, whether digital or face-to-face, involves a careful balance of clarity, empathy, and emotional intelligence.1 / 1I mean it is less cognitively taxing because you don't need to control your facial expressions and tone of voice.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIndeed, digital communication can be less cognitively taxing in certain aspects. As you mentioned, it eliminates the need to control or interpret non-verbal cues such as facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice, which can be particularly beneficial for individuals who find these aspects of communication challenging.Further, the asynchronous nature of many forms of digital communication allows for more time to process information, formulate responses, and check the message for errors before sending. This can reduce the cognitive load associated with real-time, face-to-face conversations where immediate responses are expected.However, it's worth noting that digital communication also introduces its own cognitive demands. These include the need to interpret text-based messages without the aid of non-verbal cues, the pressure to respond promptly to messages, and the cognitive load associated with multitasking in digital environments. Moreover, the sheer volume of digital communication we receive can be overwhelming and cognitively taxing.So, while digital communication can be less demanding in some respects, it also presents unique challenges that can impact cognitive load. It's about finding the balance that works best for each individual in different contexts.1 / 1Could I have a list of everything we have talked about so far?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAbsolutely! Here's a summary of the topics we've discussed:Circular reasoning: We initially discussed the concept of circular reasoning, its definition, and its categorization as a logical fallacy.Tautologies: We touched upon tautologies, exploring how they are similar yet distinct from circular reasoning.Informal logic: We explored the concept of informal logic, particularly its role in developing heuristics and guiding cognition. We also looked at its limitations and dependence on context, other arguments, prior knowledge, and sometimes experimentation and iterative development.Logical fallacies: We provided a list of several logical fallacies, such as ad hominem, straw man, appeal to authority, false dilemma, slippery slope, hasty generalization, post hoc, begging the question, and appeal to ignorance.Exceptions to fallacies: We considered potential scenarios where these fallacies might have utility or could lead to correct outcomes despite their general classification as fallacies.Other fallacies: We introduced additional fallacies such as gish gallop and tone policing.Indignation hiding: We discussed the concept of indignation hiding, which is not a widely recognized term, but refers to the idea of concealing emotions to maintain a neutral, objective tone in discourse, and its possible relation to tone policing.Malcolm Gladwell's ideas: We discussed Malcolm Gladwell's perspectives on misjudging strangers based on their outward expressions and the idea of "matching" emotional expressions to internal feelings. We considered the potential implications of these ideas for areas like the judicial system and politics.Resting Bitch Face (RBF): We brought up the phenomenon of RBF, where a person's neutral facial expression can be misinterpreted as angry or irritated.The influence of clothing: We considered how people's attire can influence the perceptions and assumptions others make about them.Emotional regulation and expression: We explored the challenges of consistently expressing happiness and contentment in a world that often misinterprets neutrality or equanimity as disinterest or anger. We also discussed the idea of learning to feign anger or impatience for communication purposes.Digital communication: Finally, we looked at the role of text-based communication, its benefits, and the challenges it presents.I hope this summary is helpful! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else you'd like to discuss.1 / 1It's good. A final summary1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTSure, here's a concise summary of our discussion:We began by diving into the concepts of circular reasoning and tautologies, followed by an exploration of informal logic, its use in creating heuristic "rules of thumb," and its dependence on the context.We then listed several logical fallacies, examining potential exceptions to these fallacies where they might serve a purpose or lead to correct conclusions. This included a discussion on fallacies like ad hominem, straw man, appeal to authority, false dilemma, and others.Next, we introduced the concepts of gish gallop, tone policing, and "indignation hiding," discussing how the latter might be used as a counter to tone policing, by maintaining a neutral, objective tone to avoid repercussions.We brought in Malcolm Gladwell's work on the topic of misjudging strangers based on their outward expressions and the implications of such misjudgments in various fields like law enforcement and politics.Then, we touched on the phenomena of Resting Bitch Face and how attire can influence others' perceptions, leading us to explore the challenges of emotional regulation and expression in a world that often misinterprets neutrality or calm as disinterest or anger.Lastly, we considered the benefits and challenges of text-based communication, particularly how it can reduce cognitive load by eliminating the need for managing facial expressions and tone of voice.This discussion provided a broad overview of informal logic, the utility and potential exceptions of logical fallacies, the complexities of human communication, and the impacts of misinterpretations on our interactions.1 / 1Seriously this is ridiculous: 

Seen At 11: A Cosmetic Cure For 'Resting Bitch Face'

October 26, 2015 
NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) - There is a name for the expression that makes people look angry, unhappy or tired when they're really just fine â and now, there is even a cosmetic procedure to correct it.

What has come to be known as the "resting bitch face" is a natural phenomenon that's been brought to the spotlight on the social media scene. It's sometimes even glamorized by figures like Grumpy Cat and other celebrities who embrace their naturally angry-looking mug.

But as CBS2's Kristine Johnson reported, it isn't just about looks. According to clinical psychologist Dr. Barbara Greenberg, having that bored/tired/mad/sad expression can also impact your mood, and how people interact with you.


"Resting bitch face is an un-engaged expression," Greenberg said. "And I would have to say that most people are not aware that this how their face settles when they're relaxed."
And experts said it really can affect how you feel.

"If you have a tired angry looking face, it is going to affect your mood," she said.

It can also affect how people react to you.

"This is called 'face-ism' or 'facial stereotyping,' so people should be aware of how they come across," she said.

But while celebrities have made a career out of their RBF, for others, the face has become a true burden.

"I'm happy and I want to look happy," one woman said. "I don't want look like I have the weight of the world on my shoulder."

The woman said even her family sees her for what she isn't

"My kids will come up or my husband will be like, 'Why are you â What's wrong with you? "I look mean."

The woman said she even tries to hide it.

"I'll shift direction or I'll turn my face1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIt seems like the issue being described in the article is part of a larger social context, one that often places a high premium on looking "happy" or "friendly" at all times. It's important to note that everyone's facial muscles naturally rest in different ways. Some people may appear to be more expressive or emotional, while others have faces that may look unengaged or, as the term suggests, give off a "resting bitch face" when they are neutral or relaxed.The article points to a cosmetic solution to this phenomenon, but it's also essential to underline that these expectations are socially constructed and may vary across different cultures or contexts. In fact, one could argue that the need to surgically modify one's face to appear more friendly or approachable reflects a societal pressure that may not be healthy or fair.While it's true that our facial expressions can impact our interactions with others and how others perceive us, it's equally important to promote the acceptance of diverse expressions and emotions. What we perceive as an "angry" or "bored" face might just be a neutral face for another individual. The key might lie in encouraging people to communicate openly about their feelings rather than make assumptions based on facial expressions. This is particularly relevant given our earlier discussion on the potential for misunderstanding and misjudgment.Finally, there's an emerging understanding that emotional health is not about being "happy" all the time. It's about being able to experience a full range of emotions and respond to them appropriately. In that light, advocating for a constant "happy face" might be contrary to the concept of emotional wellness.1 / 1I was thinking particularly of walruses or pugs with wrinkly faces. Many people acribe different emotions to animals based on their genetic experience1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYou're absolutely right. Humans tend to anthropomorphize animals, that is, we attribute human characteristics, emotions, or intentions to non-human entities. This is especially common with our pets, where we often interpret their behavior in human terms.Walruses, pugs, or any animal with a "wrinkly" or expressive face might be perceived as having a particular emotion based on their physical features. For instance, bulldogs or pugs might be seen as grumpy or sad because of the way their faces naturally fall, but this is a projection of our human interpretations onto the animal and not necessarily reflective of the animal's actual emotional state.In reality, animals do experience a range of emotions, but not necessarily in the same way humans do. They do not have the same complex socio-emotional systems as humans, but they do show basic emotions such as fear, joy, anger, and affection. It's essential to interpret their behaviors within the context of their species-specific behaviors and biology, and not solely based on human emotional expressions.Therefore, it's crucial to understand and respect these differences and not to overly humanize animals, which can lead to misinterpretation of their needs and behaviors. Reading their body language and behaviors from a species-specific perspective allows us to take better care of them and ensure their well-being.1 / 1Ok I feel like this makes me very upset. You can't tell if you can trust someone or whether they are lying from looking at a photograph. Especially when it is often genetic factors that contribute most to the shape of their face, eyes, proportions, and has nothing to do with what they were thinking or feeling. This is especially the case with all cartoons and computer generated across, I mean we know they don't have emotions or intentions, but they are seen as more predictable and easier to read than actual people1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, you're absolutely right. Many research studies have shown that humans aren't particularly good at discerning truth from lies based solely on facial expressions. Judging a person's character, emotions, or intentions based on their physical appearance or a photograph can lead to significant misunderstandings and biases. This tendency to draw conclusions from facial appearances is known as "physiognomy," and it has been largely discredited in scientific communities due to its inaccuracy and potential for harmful stereotyping.The use of cartoons and computer-generated avatars can further contribute to this problem. Such depictions, because they can be manipulated to express clear and exaggerated emotions, might seem more "readable" or predictable compared to real human faces. However, they don't accurately represent the complexity of human emotional expression and can reinforce misconceptions about how emotions are communicated.Your point about the genetic factors that contribute to facial features is crucial. People don't have control over these features, and they don't reflect a person's character or emotional state. Relying on these features to make judgments about a person is unfair and inaccurate.Emotion perception and lie detection are complex processes that involve a lot more than just facial expressions. They often involve assessing a combination of verbal cues, body language, context, and prior knowledge about the person. Even then, our ability to accurately perceive these things is far from perfect.It's also worth noting that emotional expression can vary significantly between cultures and individuals. What might be considered a "neutral" facial expression in one culture could be interpreted differently in another. Individual differences, such as whether a person is more introverted or extroverted, can also affect how emotions are expressed and interpreted.In summary, it's important to be mindful of these complexities and not to rely solely on facial appearances when forming judgments about others.1 / 1I say that it upsets me, but nothing has changed about my physical appearance.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAbsolutely, and that's a crucial point. Emotions are internal experiences that don't always have a one-to-one correspondence with external expressions. Many factors can influence how emotions are displayed, including cultural norms, personal habits, and situational contexts.For instance, someone might feel very happy but maintain a neutral facial expression due to cultural norms that discourage overt displays of emotion. Conversely, a person might smile to be polite, even if they're feeling upset. These examples demonstrate why it's so important to avoid making assumptions based solely on a person's facial expression or tone of voice.Moreover, complex emotions can be hard to categorize or express accurately. There might be cases where you feel a mix of emotions or where your emotional state is hard to pin down. In these situations, your internal emotional experience might not align neatly with any particular external expression.Therefore, it's essential to communicate our emotions clearly and honestly and to listen to others when they communicate their feelings to us. Even if their words don't seem to "match" their facial expressions or tone, it's important to believe them and understand that emotions are complex and can be expressed in many ways.1 / 1Actually even pointing any of this out makes people say that you are autistic or have asperger's1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe perception that someone who communicates in this manner may be on the autism spectrum is actually not entirely baseless, given our current understanding of these conditions. Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Asperger's syndrome often have difficulties with non-verbal communication, including interpreting facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice. Additionally, they may struggle with expressing their own emotions and thoughts in conventional or socially accepted ways.However, it's crucial to note that these are only potential indicators, not definitive diagnoses. Autism is a complex condition that cannot be diagnosed based solely on a person's communication style or ability to interpret non-verbal cues. It involves a broad range of symptoms, affects each person differently, and requires a formal diagnostic process by a trained professional.Moreover, it's important not to stigmatize or stereotype people based on their communication styles or abilities. Many people, whether they're on the autism spectrum or not, struggle with interpreting and expressing emotions in socially conventional ways, for a variety of reasons. Emphasizing open and understanding communication can help everyone feel more understood and accepted.Your observations and reflections on these topics are insightful and valid, regardless of whether or not you have any particular condition. These discussions can increase understanding and empathy for everyone, regardless of neurotypical or neurodivergent status.1 / 1Autism ResearchVolume 15, Issue 9 p. 1603-1608

Abstract
Prior research suggests that while autistic people may demonstrate poorer facial emotion recognition when stimuli are human, these differences lessen when stimuli are anthropomorphic. To investigate this further, this work explores emotion recognition in autistic and neurotypical adults (n = 196). Groups were compared on a standard and a cartoon version of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. Results indicated that autistic individuals were not significantly different from neurotypicals on the standard version. However, autistic people outperformed neurotypicals on the cartoon version. The implications for these findings regarding emotion recognition deficits and the social motivation account of autism are discussed and support the view of socio-cognitive differences rather than deficits in this population.

Lay Summary
The Reading the Mind in the Eyes test and a cartoon version were tested on autistic and neurotypical adults. Autistic adults were not significantly different on the original test compared to neurotypicals, but they outperformed neurotypical adults on the cartoon version.

INTRODUCTION
Autistic people are often described as mindblind or having poorer socio-cognitive skills than neurotypicals (NTs) (Baron-Cohen, 1997). The mindblind account not only pathologises the autistic condition (Duffy & Dorner, 2011), but it also fails to consider the double empathy problem (Milton, 2012), which occurs when NTs do not consider the autistic person's perspective. Failures in double empathy are often not considered failures, as neurotypical ways of relating to the world are used as benchmarks by which neurodivergent preferences or strategies can be measured (Pellicano & den Houting, 2021). Many socio-cognitive tests in general, but facial emotion recognition (FER) tests in particular, reflect the double empathy problem in autism research. FER assessments are often explicitly designed to exploit NT strengths and autistic deficits. For instance, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (RME) (Baron-Cohen et al., 2001) was devised to identify areas of autistic differences, such as irregular eye-gaze (Tanaka & Sung, 2016). While understanding deficits can help identify areas of need, there is a growing movement to capture the strengths inherent to neurodiverse conditions such as autism. In this way, tests such as the RME may themselves be changed to reveal autistic strengths and understand the contexts in which differences between autistic and NT people are lessened.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe research paper you shared gives a fresh perspective on the concept of socio-cognitive skills among autistic individuals versus neurotypicals. The study highlights the double empathy problem, which considers the potential miscommunication that may occur when neurotypicals fail to understand the perspectives of those who are neurodivergent.The study's findings show that while there may be differences in the way autistic individuals interpret facial expressions in real life, these differences are reduced or even reversed when the expressions are represented in a cartoon format. This suggests that the difficulties autistic people might have in interpreting non-verbal cues could be related more to the specific types of cues they're presented with, rather than an inherent inability to interpret non-verbal cues in general.This research underscores the importance of being mindful about the tests and metrics we use to measure social and emotional cognition. The ways in which these tests are structured can heavily influence the outcomes, and it is vital to consider the potential biases inherent in these tests, as well as the diverse ways in which different individuals might perceive and interpret social cues.The concept of "mindblindness" may not fully capture the complexity of socio-cognitive processes in autism. This study challenges the notion that autistic individuals are deficient in social and emotional cognition, instead suggesting that they may just engage with these aspects of cognition in different ways.This aligns with the broader movement toward a more nuanced understanding of neurodiversity, where differences in cognitive processing are not necessarily seen as deficits, but as alternative ways of perceiving and interacting with the world. This can help create a more inclusive and understanding society that values and accommodates for a wider range of cognitive styles and abilities.1 / 1Connections with our conversation.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAbsolutely, this research paper aligns with several key points discussed in our conversation:Misinterpretation of Facial Expressions: Just as you described people misconstruing your expressions as anger or impatience, the study notes how autistic people may interpret or display facial expressions differently from neurotypicals. The difference, however, does not imply a deficiency, but rather an alternative way of processing non-verbal cues.Stereotyping and Misjudgments: The discussion about 'Resting Bitch Face' and how people can be judged based on their neutral facial expressions connects to the 'double empathy problem' highlighted in the study. The problem refers to the misunderstanding that occurs when neurotypicals fail to consider the perspectives of those who are neurodivergent, leading to false assumptions and stereotypes.Digital Communication: The preference for text-based communication due to its relative ease and control over tone can be paralleled with the finding that autistic individuals performed better on the cartoon version of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. Both scenarios suggest a preference for controlled, predictable, or stylized social cues over more complex, real-life ones.Overreliance on Non-Verbal Cues: Your concern about people using emotional tone alone as a proxy for semantic meaning, disregarding the actual words being said, ties into the broader theme of how socio-cognitive tests often rely heavily on NT strengths and may not capture the full range of social cognition in neurodiverse populations.The Importance of Substance over Surface-Level Perception: Just as you argued that we should focus more on what people do and say rather than how they look or sound, the research paper suggests that understanding and accommodating the unique socio-cognitive profiles of neurodiverse individuals is more important than conforming to neurotypical norms.Overall, these themes emphasize the need for more nuanced and inclusive understanding of social cognition, one that goes beyond surface-level perceptions and takes into account the diverse ways in which people perceive and interpret the world.1 / 1I think there is a circular reasoning in facial recognition of emotions. Some aspect of it is cultural.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAbsolutely, you're right. The interpretation of facial expressions is indeed subject to cultural conditioning and there can be a circular reasoning at play.Emotions are universal phenomena, but the way we express and interpret them can vary greatly depending on our cultural background. For example, certain cultures might express happiness, sadness, anger, or surprise differently. This variability, if not recognized, could lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations, particularly in multicultural or international contexts.When it comes to circular reasoning, it can occur when people base their interpretation of someone's emotional state on preconceived notions or stereotypes about how certain emotions should be expressed. This is essentially a form of bias, as they're interpreting someone's emotions not based on objective observation, but on their own subjective expectations.For instance, if someone believes that sadness should always be expressed with tears, they may not recognize or acknowledge another person's sadness if it's expressed differently, like through quiet withdrawal. They might then conclude that the person isn't truly sad because they're not crying, thereby completing the circle of their biased reasoning.This shows how important it is to approach the interpretation of facial expressions with an open mind and an understanding of cultural and individual differences in emotional expression. It also emphasizes the importance of communication and clarifying understanding, rather than making assumptions based on surface-level perceptions.1 / 1Ok one more list of the topics we've discussed.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTSure, here's a summary of the topics we've discussed:Emotion Perception and Expression: We discussed the complexities of perceiving and expressing emotions, including the idea that different individuals may express and interpret emotions differently. We talked about the mismatch that can occur between internal feelings and external expressions.Malcolm Gladwell's Observations: We discussed Malcolm Gladwell's views on how people are often judged based on their physical demeanor, not on what they say or do. Gladwell emphasizes focusing on someone's actions and words over their facial expressions and body language.Manipulation of Tone and Facial Expression: We touched on the idea that people who are good at manipulating their faces and tones can sometimes be perceived as deceptive or inauthentic, while also noting that such manipulation can be part of professional roles, like acting.Resting Bitch Face (RBF): We discussed the concept of RBF, a term used to describe a facial expression that unintentionally appears angry, annoyed, or contemptuous when a person is in a relaxed state.Emotional Perception and Clothing: We discussed how people's assumptions can be influenced by what a person is wearing, drawing parallels with the message of "The Prince and the Pauper".Raised Hedonic Setpoint: We discussed the idea of a possibly raised hedonic setpoint, where you might feel content and happy despite your external demeanor not matching those emotions.Misinterpretation of Intensity: We discussed the need to sometimes intensify our voice or look intense to ensure our message is taken seriously, as some people might interpret a calm demeanor as a lack of urgency or seriousness.Text-Based Communication: We considered the role of text-based communication as a means to control tone and avoid misinterpretation of emotional cues.Misinterpretation of Animal Emotions: We discussed how people often misinterpret animals' emotions based on their physical characteristics, despite the fact that such interpretation is usually anthropomorphic and not truly reflective of the animal's feelings.Facial Recognition: We touched upon the biases associated with facial recognition, including the assumption that we can judge trustworthiness or detect lies just by looking at someone's face.Autism and Emotional Recognition: We examined a study that suggested people with autism might excel at recognizing emotions in cartoons compared to neurotypicals, challenging the stereotype of individuals with autism having difficulty in interpreting emotions.Circular Reasoning in Facial Recognition of Emotions: Lastly, we discussed the idea of circular reasoning in facial emotion recognition, where certain interpretations of facial expressions could be influenced by cultural or societal biases.Each of these topics intertwines with the overarching theme of the complex dynamics between internal emotional states, their outward expressions, and how these expressions are interpreted by others.1 / 1Any final words?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly. The discussions we've had around facial expressions, tone, and emotional interpretation highlight a universal human challenge - the complexity of interpersonal communication. This complexity emerges from the fact that our inner emotional world is nuanced, multi-dimensional, and not always perfectly reflected in our outward expressions.Moreover, the interpretation of these expressions is filtered through individual and cultural lenses, leading to possible misunderstandings or misinterpretations. The difficulties we face in reading and conveying emotions remind us of the importance of empathy, patience, and open dialogue in our interactions.It's vital to remember that each person is a unique individual with their own emotional landscape, and the ways in which they express and interpret emotions can vary greatly. Therefore, cultivating a deeper understanding and a non-judgmental approach towards the emotional expressions of others can facilitate better communication and foster stronger relationships.Finally, the ability to navigate these complexities successfully is not a fixed trait but a skill that can be developed and refined over time. So whether it's in our personal lives or in wider societal contexts, let's continue striving for empathy, understanding, and effective communication.1 / 1ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.
