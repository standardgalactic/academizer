A Linux command to rm a file and touch it again to make it empty
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
To remove a file and then recreate it as an empty file in Linux, you can use the following command sequence:
bash
Copy code
rm
filename &&
touch
filename
Replace
filename
with the actual name of the file you want to delete and recreate. This command first deletes the file using
rm
and then recreates an empty file with the same name using
touch
. Note that the
&&
ensures that the
touch
command only runs if the
rm
command succeeds.

I mean so I don't have to type it twice

To achieve this without typing the filename twice, you can use a shell variable. Here's how you can do it:
bash
Copy code
file=
"filename"
;
rm
"
$file
"
&&
touch
"
$file
"
Replace
filename
with the actual name of the file you want to delete and recreate. This command sets a variable
file
to your filename, then removes the file and recreates it as an empty file using this variable. This way, you only need to type the filename once.
