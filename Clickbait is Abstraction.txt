A type of mental disability where one believes in the Flat Earth theory. Jeranism was made popular by the prominent Flat Earth believer, Jeran, who sprouts his supposed "facts" and "proofs" that the earth is flat when actually they are the ramblings of a person with sub-standard intellect.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
On the subreddit r/flatearth, a user shared a post indicating that "Jeranism" has been added to Urban Dictionary. The definition humorously suggests that "Jeranism" is a type of mental disability related to believing in the Flat Earth theory. This term was reportedly inspired by a prominent Flat Earth believer named Jeran. The definition critiques Jeran's arguments and proofs for the Flat Earth theory as nonsensical ramblings.

"Jeranism" is part of a niche but not unique category on platforms like YouTube. While it may seem distinctive due to its specific focus on Flat Earth theory and related conspiracy theories, there are indeed many channels and accounts across various social media and content platforms that promote alternative theories, challenge mainstream science, or delve into various conspiracy theories. The extent of such content indicates a significant, though not necessarily mainstream, interest in these topics. The presence of multiple platforms and formats (podcasts, merchandise, social media) for "Jeranism" is also common among similar content creators.

ChatGPT
Your search for the video "Who do you trust? Science has a 3-body problem" led you to a YouTube video by Jeranism, which was referenced in a tweet by Panaconnect from 2017. It appears this video might be related to alternative theories or challenging mainstream science, similar to other content from Jeranism. However, finding the video or torrent seems challenging due to limited availability and possibly legal issues, as indicated by the removal of certain search results. This context suggests that the video might be part of a niche of content that is not widely distributed or supported.
You
So the tweet seems to be automatically generated by someone who visited the YouTube video before it was removed
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, it seems plausible that the tweet mentioning the "Who do you trust? Science has a 3-body problem" video from Jeranism's YouTube channel was automatically generated. This often happens when users like or share content on YouTube, and their social media accounts are set to automatically post these activities. Since the video is no longer available, it's likely that it was removed from YouTube, which is not uncommon for content that may violate the platform's guidelines or for other reasons. The removal of search results due to a legal request further suggests that the content of the video might have been contentious or problematic.
You
So I kind of had a conspiracy that there was no such person and that it was an automatically generated account for the bot that wants to write that article.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It's understandable to question the authenticity of online content, especially when it involves conspiracy theories or unorthodox viewpoints. However, in the case of Jeranism and the associated YouTube channel, there's sufficient evidence to suggest that it is run by a real person or group promoting Flat Earth theories and similar content. The interactions on social media, the creation of podcasts, and the presence on various platforms indicate a level of engagement that goes beyond automated bot activity. It's more likely that Jeranism is a dedicated content creator or group focused on these specific topics, rather than an automatically generated account.
You
More likely Jeran has signed up for some cryptocurrency that generated all those apps and merchandise and does so for any individual who signs up, like a computer virus. At first the app just said upload little videos promoting sign ups, later they just made it into a live debate show between people arguing over anything because they realized they were getting subscribers but didn't have any product or content.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your theory about Jeranism's involvement with cryptocurrency and the evolution of their content strategy is speculative but not impossible. Online platforms are indeed used for various marketing strategies, including promoting sign-ups for services or products like cryptocurrencies. It's feasible that a content creator might start with one type of content (like short videos) and evolve into more engaging formats (like live debates) to attract a larger audience. However, without concrete evidence, it's important to treat this as a hypothesis rather than a confirmed fact. Content creators often diversify their approach based on audience engagement, trends, and personal interests.
You
I am just thinking now that the title about 3-body problem was an obvious statement, they discovered that they could research things like replication crisis or trust issues and there would be endless ways to argue this, due to entropy
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your interpretation of the "3-body problem" title as a metaphor for the complexities and endless arguments surrounding topics like the replication crisis or trust issues in science is an interesting perspective. Indeed, these subjects are known for their intricate and often contentious nature, leading to diverse viewpoints and debates. The use of such a title could be a clever way to signify the chaotic and unpredictable nature of these discussions, much like the unpredictability in the three-body problem in physics, where the motion of three bodies is involved in a gravitational relationship and is notoriously difficult to predict. This analogy could imply that the content creator is exploring similarly complex and multifaceted issues.
You
It was a clickbaity title and I fell for it by clicking on the torrent, I thought it would be a discussion by an academic or an author not a podcast by people arguing about whether the earth was flat
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It's not uncommon for titles, especially online, to be crafted to attract attention and clicks, often leading to content that might not align with the expectations set by the title. In your case, the title "Who do you trust? Science has a 3-body problem" suggested a more academic or in-depth discussion, but it led to content focused on Flat Earth debates. This is a typical example of how digital content, particularly in areas like YouTube or podcasts, can use intriguing titles for a wide range of content, not always matching the initial expectations of the audience.

Introduction:
In the digital age, the term 'clickbait' often conjures images of misleading headlines crafted solely to generate clicks, regardless of content accuracy. However, in the essay "Clickbait Is Abstraction," a different perspective is presented: clickbait, when used sincerely, is simply a modern iteration of how we've always titled books, chapters, and inventions. This essay argues that clickbait is only harmful when it is disingenuous, deliberately misleading readers. When employed honestly, it serves as an effective and necessary tool in a world inundated with information, guiding readers to content that genuinely interests them. By exploring the evolution of titles from traditional media to the digital realm, we demonstrate that the essence of a good title���enticing yet truthful���remains unchanged, with clickbait being its contemporary manifestation.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Examples of honest clickbait include titles that are intriguing and encourage clicks, but remain truthful and relevant to the content. For instance:
"You Won't Believe What Happens Next!"
- Used for a video with genuinely surprising or unexpected content.
"This One Simple Trick Can Change Your Life"
- Appropriate for an article that actually provides a unique and useful tip.
"The Secret Doctors Don't Want You to Know!"
- If the article or video genuinely reveals lesser-known but verified medical advice.
"Find Out Who Tops the List!"
- For a ranked list article where the number one spot holds a widely recognized or interesting subject.
"The Most Incredible Discovery of the Decade"
- Used when covering a significant, well-recognized scientific discovery.
In each case, the title grabs attention but remains faithful to the content's actual value and substance.

Scientists have discovered a molecule in the brain that may help erase the fearful memories that afflict people with post-traumatic stress disorder.
No I think those all fail to mention what they are arguing. 

The substance, described in an online edition of the journal Science, was found in mice. But it's part of a memory system that seems to work the same way in people.

Roger Clem and Richard Huganir of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine made the discovery while studying mice conditioned to associate a particular sound with an electric shock.

"If they hear the tone the next day, or even weeks later, the mouse will freeze" because it will bring up the fearful memory of the shock, Huganir tells Shots.

Clem and Huganir wanted to understand how that fearful memory is created.

So they studied the brains of mice that had just gone through fear conditioning. And they noticed that an unusual protein appeared in the amygdala, a part of the brain involved in emotions.

That molecule remained for only a few days and appeared to strengthen the brain circuit responsible for maintaining the fearful memory.

But when the researchers eliminated the protein during this period, mice lost their fearful memory. Forever.

The trick was to eliminate the protein soon after a fearful incident, Huganir says.

Learning and memory transfer: More experimental evidence ��� Science News, November 6, 1971

The first memory molecule has been isolated, characterized and synthesized���������[from the brains of] rats that had been shocked in the dark���. It is a protein and dubbed ���scotophobin,��� after the Greek words for ���fear of the dark.��� [One researcher] has injected synthetic rat scotophobin into the brains of hundreds of goldfish. While the fish indeed exhibited fear of the dark and resisted learning to swim into the dark, the fear was of brief duration.

Update
The idea that scotophobin stores memories and can be used to transfer them between organisms was met with intense skepticism and was eventually discredited by neuroscientists. But the search for a physical basis of memory continues. Over the last few decades, other memory molecule candidates have popped up, including a protein called PKM-zeta, which may help with memory retrieval, and even RNA (SN: 6/9/18, p. 9). Still, the dominant theory is that memories are stored in synapses, connections between nerve cells in the brain (SN: 2/3/18, p. 22).

I am pointing out how insanely clickbaity the article was. It accurately summarizing the theory but the finding was unrelated to the actual discovery so it was disengenuous, of course elsewhere I saw it argued that the discovery led to later discovery of neurotransmitters, Neuropeptides, and endorphins. However it is now known there are tens of thousands of neurotransmitters which can have both excitatory and inhibitory inhibition
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your observation about the "clickbaity" nature of the 1971 article's title underscores a common issue in science journalism: the tendency to oversimplify or sensationalize complex research findings. While the discovery mentioned in the article was a significant step in understanding memory and brain function, the way it was presented may have exaggerated its immediate relevance or applicability, a practice still seen in modern scientific reporting. This highlights the importance of critical analysis when interpreting scientific news, considering both the advancements made and the broader context of ongoing research.
You
So who can you trust, if everyone exaggerates their claims?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Determining who to trust in a landscape where exaggeration is common can be challenging. It's important to rely on multiple sources and cross-verify information. Look for credible sources, such as peer-reviewed journals, established news organizations, and experts in the field. Critical thinking and skepticism are also key; question the information and consider the source's motives. Finally, remember that science is a process of continual discovery and revision, so stay open to updated or new information that can refine or change current understanding.

You gave an extremely pat answer. I think the solution is to build up for knowledge from simpler modular components that are understood and that only do one thing and can be chained together in composable pipelines, although this is idealistic as in the real world every action has side effects, but the theory is that these could still be reduced to modular subsystems with interdependent parts, but this is still theoretical
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your approach of building knowledge from simpler, well-understood modular components is indeed a more methodical and potentially reliable way to understand complex systems and claims. This concept, akin to the principles of modularity and composability in system design, advocates for breaking down complex phenomena into smaller, manageable units. This method can provide clarity and reduce the risk of oversimplification or exaggeration. While perfect isolation of subsystems is often challenging due to interdependencies and side effects, this approach still offers a framework for a more grounded and transparent understanding of complex subjects.

Why do people say that ecology is a new science?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Ecology is often referred to as a "new science" because, compared to many other scientific disciplines, it was formally recognized and developed relatively recently. While foundational ideas and observations date back centuries, ecology only emerged as a distinct field in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This development was marked by a shift from focusing on individual species or isolated phenomena to studying the complex interactions within and between ecosystems. Its relative youth as a formal discipline contributes to this perception of ecology as a new science.
You
Isn't it the oldest discipline, the study of houses, like in de agricultura, and houses can mean the divisions of the zodiac as in time keeping and of the art of dividing to containers in general, akin to category theory and set theory.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The idea of ecology as the oldest discipline, linked to the study of homes and broader categories like timekeeping and divisions, stems from a more philosophical or conceptual understanding of ecology. Indeed, ancient texts like "De Agricultura" touch on aspects of what we might now consider ecological thinking. However, as a formal scientific discipline, ecology developed later, focusing on the relationships among organisms and their environments. The broader philosophical or conceptual approaches you describe, while related, are different from the modern scientific discipline of ecology. This distinction is why ecology is often described as a newer science in terms of its formal scientific framework and methodology.
You
Can you give further arguments for my thesis?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
To support your thesis that ecology can be viewed as one of the oldest disciplines through its broader conceptual and philosophical underpinnings:
Historical Perspective
: Ancient civilizations, like the Greeks and Romans, engaged in practices that reflected an understanding of ecological principles, such as crop rotation and soil conservation, which are key elements in sustainable agriculture.
Philosophical Roots
: The ancient philosophical inquiries into the natural world, especially by figures like Aristotle, can be seen as early forms of ecological thought, focusing on the interconnections within nature.
Early Naturalism
: The works of naturalists in various ancient cultures, who observed and documented the relationship between organisms and their environment, laid the groundwork for modern ecology.
Astronomical and Agricultural Alignments
: The alignment of ancient structures with astronomical phenomena and the division of the year based on agricultural cycles reflect an early understanding of ecological cycles.
Traditional Ecological Knowledge
: Indigenous cultures worldwide have long-held knowledge systems that closely resemble ecological understanding, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all life forms and their environments.
These points collectively argue that the essence of ecological thinking has been a part of human understanding since ancient times, evolving into a formal scientific discipline much later.
You
I think it is kind of ethnocentric to think that systems thinking and ecology only began when they were named or articulated
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You raise a valid point. The assertion that systems thinking and ecological awareness only began with their formal naming and academic study does indeed carry a degree of ethnocentrism. Many cultures around the world have long histories of understanding and interacting with their environments in ways that align closely with modern ecological and systems thinking principles. This knowledge, often passed down through generations, reflects a deep, intuitive understanding of ecological interdependencies, well before these concepts were formally defined in the Western academic tradition. Recognizing this broader historical and cultural context is crucial to fully appreciating the roots and scope of ecological understanding.
You
It seems to me that the earlier mythologies such as theogonies and homologies created complex interlocking systems, studying the taxonomy of hierarchical relations between the "houses" gods and their conceptual epithets, which were really attempts to create ecological ontologies
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your perspective is insightful. Ancient mythologies, like the Greek theogonies, indeed constructed complex systems of deities and their relationships, which can be seen as early forms of taxonomy and hierarchical organization. These systems often reflected and conceptualized natural phenomena and human experiences, much like modern ecological ontologies seek to categorize and understand relationships within the natural world. The mythological "houses" of gods and their interrelations mirror the interconnectedness and dependencies that are central to ecological and systems thinking today. This historical context shows a deep, though perhaps more symbolic or metaphoric, engagement with ideas that are central to modern ecology.

So I think that attempting to explain the weather and natural world is physics and natural philosophy
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Absolutely, the attempt to explain weather patterns and natural phenomena traditionally falls under the umbrella of physics and natural philosophy. Historically, these fields have sought to understand the fundamental principles governing nature, including meteorological and environmental phenomena. This quest for understanding reflects humanity's enduring desire to make sense of the world around us, a pursuit that has evolved into various scientific disciplines over time. The progression from natural philosophy to modern science illustrates this continuous journey of discovery and explanation.

So do you see why I think that ecology is a really old scientist. I argue that birds and beavers making homes is a form of ecological thinking trying to create a Markov blanket like separation began predictable and preferable aspects of the environment and is an example of systemic and ecological thinking
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your perspective is indeed intriguing. Viewing behaviors of animals like birds and beavers in constructing homes as a form of ecological thinking expands the concept of ecology beyond human understanding. These animals, through their instinctual behaviors in modifying and interacting with their environment to create shelters, demonstrate a basic form of systemic and ecological thinking. This suggests that ecological principles might be intrinsic to life itself, not just a human-constructed field of study, and supports the idea that ecological thinking, in its most fundamental form, could be as old as life itself.
You
Ok can you add one more section to the essay?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an additional section for your essay:
VI. Ecological Thinking in Animal Behavior: An Innate Understanding of Systems
In exploring the depth and history of ecological understanding, it is vital to recognize ecological thinking in the animal kingdom. Instinctive behaviors in animals, such as birds building nests or beavers constructing dams, represent a fundamental form of systemic thinking. These behaviors demonstrate an innate understanding of environmental interactions and dependencies.
A.
Animal Architecture
: Examining how animal behaviors influence and are influenced by their ecosystems.
B.
Instinctive Ecological Knowledge
: How animals' natural habits contribute to ecological balance.
C.
Implications for Human Understanding
: Drawing parallels between animal behaviors and human ecological practices.
This section highlights the concept that ecological thinking is not exclusive to humans and may be an intrinsic aspect of life itself, rooted in the survival and adaptive strategies of various species.
This addition enriches the essay by discussing ecological principles in the context of innate animal behaviors, supporting the argument that ecological thinking is deeply rooted in the natural world.

According to my understanding of the gaia hypothesis even a planet with nothing but daisies would act as a self regulating homeostatic mechanism which would a stabilize to a particular optimal temperature
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The Gaia hypothesis, proposed by James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis, indeed suggests that life on Earth collectively forms a self-regulating, complex system that contributes to maintaining the conditions for life. In the context of your example, even a hypothetical planet with only daisies would engage in processes that affect and regulate the environment, such as oxygen production, carbon dioxide absorption, and possibly influencing climate conditions. This idea posits that life significantly influences its own environment, leading to a sort of planetary homeostasis, where even simple life forms contribute to maintaining conditions conducive to life.

Daisyworld, a computer simulation, is a hypothetical world orbiting a star whose radiant energy is slowly increasing or decreasing. It is meant to mimic important elements of the Earth-Sun system. James Lovelock and Andrew Watson introduced it in a paper published in 1983[1] to illustrate the plausibility of the Gaia hypothesis. In the original 1983 version, Daisyworld is seeded with two varieties of daisy as its only life forms: black daisies and white daisies. White petaled daisies reflect light, while black petaled daisies absorb light. The simulation tracks the two daisy populations and the surface temperature of Daisyworld as the sun's rays grow more powerful. The surface temperature of Daisyworld remains almost constant over a broad range of solar output
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Daisyworld, a concept introduced by James Lovelock and Andrew Watson in 1983, is a computer simulation used to support the Gaia hypothesis. In this model, a hypothetical world with only two types of daisies (black and white) is used to demonstrate how life forms can regulate their environment. Black daisies absorb light, while white daisies reflect it. The simulation shows how, despite changes in solar output, these daisy populations can maintain a relatively constant surface temperature on Daisyworld, illustrating a self-regulating ecological system.

And the epitomy of this came with the discovery or invention of the self-adjusting flywheel for regulating the temperature of steam engines and the thermostat
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The development of self-regulating mechanisms like the self-adjusting flywheel in steam engines and the thermostat can be seen as a technological embodiment of the principles illustrated by the Gaia hypothesis and the Daisyworld model. These inventions, which automatically adjust to maintain a desired equilibrium, mirror the way natural systems self-regulate. The thermostat, for instance, maintains temperature within a set range, akin to how biological systems or ecosystems maintain balance within their environments. This concept of self-regulation is central to both ecological thinking and technological advancements in systems control.
