Summarize: that higher level regions represent a more abstract form of shape, which is factored into the design of Set A, but 
not B. Indeed, previous studies showed that perceived shape similarity strongly overlaps with higher-level brain 
representations in humans41, and in monkeys12,42. Kalfas et al.12 found that the deepest layers of networks, rather 
than IT responses, correlated best with human shape similarity judgements. We also found that CNNs correlated 
much higher with behavioural shape judgements than fMRI. Th is fi nding suggests that there is at least some cor- 
respondence between how humans and models use shape, even though there are very likely also dif f erences (see 
e.g. Baker et al.19 and Geirhos et al.21). 
Considering the dif f erences in category def i nitions between the stimulus sets, Set A has only two category 
clusters def i ned by the animate-inanimate division, whereas Set B has six object clusters. Th e number of groups 
clearly af f ects the size dif f erence in correlation levels between category models and CNNs as well as the brain, 
where fewer groupings boost the signal. In the fi nal layer of all CNNs, we see that category, as def i ned by animacy 
in Set A, reaches correlation levels up to three times the magnitude of Set B. Considering brain data, category 
as def i ned by animacy in Set A reaches six times the magnitude in VTC ant compared to Set B. However, when 
the contributions of category and shape are analysed separately, the dif f erence between Sets A and B, in terms of 
category information, disappears. Th is is evident in Fig. 6, with the blue line showing a very similar peak in both 
datasets for all DNNs. Th e very high correlations for category that were observed in Fig. 5 for Set A were mainly 
driven by the shape component, and when this is dissociated the results across the two stimuli sets largely corre- 
spond (Fig. 6). We fi nd that in all four networks, human similarity judgements of category are best explained by 
the fi nal layer of CNNs, more so than fMRI representations in late ventral areas. 
It may seem striking that in some cases the correlations for shape remain higher than those for category, 
even at the fi nal layer (see Fig. 2, Caf f eNet both sets and ResNet50 Set A). Th e shape model itself is a behavioural 
model, which captures high-level properties of shape that are presumably, still represented at the fi nal layers of 
CNNs. If the shape model was def i ned instead using basic low-level shape features, we would expect more of a 
decrease in the fi nal layers of CNNs. 
Our use of multiple CNNs allows us to observe the inf l uence of network depth on peak correlations with brain 
regions. Hong et al.9 compared their brain data to a CNN consisting of 6 parallelised convolutional layers, fi nding 
that the model���s top hidden layer was most predictive of IT response patterns and that lower layers had higher 
resemblance to V1-like Gabor patterns. Consistent with their fi ndings, we also found that the fi nal layer of CNNs 
had maximum correspondence with later ventral stream areas, and that earlier layers showed higher correlation 
with V1. Cichy et al.14 found peak V1 correlations in the second layer of an 8-layer CNN trained for object recog- 
nition. Similarly in our experiments, we found that peak V1 correlations occurred at layer 3 in an 8-layer network 
(Caf f eNet) for both stimulus sets. As network depth increases, peak correlations with V1 shif t from earlier tiers 
in the network to later layers. Interestingly, some of the highest V1 correlations occur immediately prior to fully 
connected layers, as is the case in ResNet50 and VGG-19. 
Figure 5 illustrates peak V1 correlations occurring as late as the 45th layer in ResNet50, bringing into question 
the explanatory value of additional processing stages in deeper networks, especially when an 8-layer network 
achieves similar magnitudes of correlation with V1 by the third layer. Nevertheless, while the maximum correla- 
tion values of brain regions shif t to later layers in larger networks, the rank-order of correlation peaks with brain 
regions still matches the order of information processing along the ventral pathway. Th at is, correlations with V1 
always peak before VTC ant, regardless of network depth. We extend upon the fi ndings of Cichy et al.14 that early 
visual area correlations peak before later ones, from a single 8 layer network to multiple networks, including a 50 
layer network. 
In conclusion, despite shape and category of t en being confounded in natural images, and the possibility for 
artif i cial neural networks to exploit this correlation when performing classif i cation tasks, we fi nd that deep con- 
volutional neural networks are able to represent category information independently from low-level shape in a 
manner similar to higher level visual cortex in humans.

This summary refers to a study investigating the similarities and differences between human and artificial neural network (ANN) representations of shape and category. The study utilizes two sets of stimuli, with Set A focused more on abstract shapes and Set B on object categories.
The findings indicate that both human and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) representations of shape have some degree of correlation, especially in the higher-level areas of the brain and in deeper layers of the networks. CNNs were found to correlate more with behavioral shape judgements than functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results.
The study also found differences based on how the stimuli were categorized. Set A, divided into two categories (animate vs inanimate), showed stronger correlation levels between CNNs, brain data, and category models than Set B, which had six object clusters. However, when shape and category contributions were analyzed separately, the difference between Set A and B in terms of category information disappeared.
Additionally, the study noted the influence of network depth on peak correlations with brain regions. It found that correlations with early visual areas peaked before those with later areas, regardless of the depth of the network. This was true across multiple networks of varying depths.
The researchers concluded that, despite potential confounding factors in natural images, deep CNNs can represent category information independently from low-level shape in a way similar to higher-level visual cortex in humans. This suggests the potential for deep learning systems to mirror some aspects of human perceptual processing.

common in V1 or in the fi nal layers of CNNs. Th ere is still some correlation related to shape (indicated by the blue 
line) that is preserved in V1 and in the fi nal layers of CNNs. 
Discussion 
In this study, we investigated orthogonal shape and category representations in biological and artif i cial networks 
by making comparisons between: (i) CNNs and behavioural models of shape and category; (ii) behavioural mod- 
els and the brain; and (iii) CNNs and the brain. First, comparing artif i cial networks and models, we found that 
CNNs represent category information as well as shape, and that category information peaks at the fi nal layer for 
all tested CNNs, regardless of network depth. Second, comparing models and the brain, there is a two-way inter- 
action between shape and category in the human visual ventral pathway, where shape is best represented earlier 
in V1, and category emerges later in anterior VTC. Th is interaction between shape and category is signif i cant 
across both stimulus sets. Th ird, comparing artif i cial networks and the brain, V1 correlates highest with early to 
mid-level layers of deep networks, and anterior VTC correlates best with the fi nal layer of CNNs. Across both 
stimulus sets and for all networks, peak correlations with V1 always occur in earlier network layers than peak 
correlations with anterior VTC, demonstrating that CNNs ref l ect a similar order of computational stages as the 
human ventral pathway when processing these object images. 
Our results allow for a greater understanding of how shape and category are represented in deep networks 
and in the visual ventral pathway, in particular: (i) how dif f ering shape and category def i nitions between the two 
stimulus sets reveal dif f erences between low-level and high-level shape representations in CNNs and the brain; 
(ii) how shape and category processing along deep network layers maps onto brain regions; and iii) how careful 
stimulus design allows us to make better inferences about category information in the brain and in CNNs. 
One major advantage of this study is that we consider two stimulus sets that carefully control shape and cat- 
egory to draw conclusions about their interaction and interplay, rather than broadly extrapolating results based 
on a single set of images. Th ese two well-controlled stimulus sets are similar in design but dif f er slightly in how 
shape and category are def i ned, allowing us to extract a fi ner interpretation of results. Looking at the dif f er- 
ences in shape def i nitions between these stimulus sets, in Set A, shape is def i ned with a low to high aspect ratio 
(described as ���bar-like��� or ���blob-like���), while it is characterized retinotopically in Set B. Comparing CNNs and 
models, both low-level (Set B) and high-level (Set A) shape information is preserved until the very last layer 
of all networks, however there is a visible reduction in low-level compared to high-level shape information in 
the fi nal layers. Comparing models and the brain, we see that the high-level (Set A) shape information remains 
quite high in VTC ant, compared to low-level (Set B) shape information, which reduces to correlation levels 
that are at or near zero. Th e plausible explanation for why shape information drops of f in Set B but not in A, is

This research investigated the orthogonal shape and category representations in biological and artificial networks. It found similarities and differences between convolutional neural networks (CNNs), behavioral models of shape and category, and brain data.
Firstly, comparing artificial networks with models, CNNs were found to represent both shape and category information. Interestingly, category information peaked at the final layer for all tested CNNs, regardless of the network's depth.
Secondly, when comparing models with brain data, a two-way interaction was noted between shape and category in the human visual pathway. Specifically, shape was best represented earlier in the primary visual cortex (V1), and category emerged later in the anterior ventral temporal cortex (VTC).
Thirdly, when comparing artificial networks with brain data, correlations were highest between V1 and early to mid-level layers of deep networks. Meanwhile, the anterior VTC correlated best with the final layer of CNNs. This indicates that CNNs reflect a similar order of computational stages to the human ventral pathway when processing object images.
The study used two well-controlled stimulus sets which defined shape and category slightly differently. This allowed for a nuanced interpretation of results and improved inferences about category information in both the brain and CNNs.
Finally, the researchers identified that both low-level and high-level shape information was preserved in the final layers of all networks. However, there was a reduction in low-level compared to high-level shape information in these layers. In the brain, high-level shape information remained quite high in the VTC ant, compared to low-level shape information, which reduced to correlation levels at or near zero.

explained variance from shape versus category information in correlations between fMRi brain 
data and cnn layers. We partialled out shape and category when correlating between brain data and CNN 
layers to investigate the level of variance that could be explained by each of these factors individually. Figure 6 
shows partial correlations for all CNNs and V1 (f i rst two columns) and VTC anterior (last two columns), partial- 
ling out shape (magenta) or category (blue). Zero is indicated by the dotted line. 
Looking at partial correlations with VTC anterior, for Set A, when shape is partialled out (magenta), the 
correlation values drop, which is expected given that the two dimensions are partially correlated. However, 
importantly, category alone (indicated by the blue line) in anterior VTC is still signif i cant in the fi nal 3 lay- 
ers of all CNNs (Caf f eNet: t(14) = 3.306, p = 0.005, t(14) = 4.166, p < 0.0001, t(14) = 9.055, p < 0.0001; VGG- 
19: t(14) = 7.608, p < 0.0001, t(14) = 7.620, p < 0.0001, t(14) = 7.758, p < 0.0001; GoogLeNet: t(14) = 7.015, 
p < 0.0001, t(14) = 9.320, p < 0.0001, t(14) = 9.060, p < 0.0001; ResNet50: t(14) = 6.643, p < 0.0001, t(14) = 7.089, 
p < 0.0001, t(14) = 10.033, p < 0.0001). Th is is visible and clearly consistent in all four CNNs. For Set B, in anterior 
VTC, the drop in correlation values when partialling out shape is not apparent in any of the CNNs, conf i rming 
that the two dimensions are already independent in the stimulus set. 
Looking at the fi rst row of Fig. 6, we see that partial correlations between V1 and both datasets follow a similar 
pattern. When partialling out shape or category, correlations are still quite high along the convolutional layers, 
indicating that there is additional information contained in V1 and these CNN layers that is not accounted for by 
shape or category alone. Across all layers, the information contained by partialling out shape (magenta) is lower 
than the information contained by partialling out category (blue). Th e main decrease in these partial correla- 
tions is seen in the fi nal fully connected layers, where there is near zero information related to category that is in

The researchers further examined the variance from shape versus category information in correlations between fMRI brain data and CNN layers. By doing so, they aimed to understand the extent to which each of these factors could individually explain. They used partial correlations for this analysis, controlling for either shape or category.
For Set A, when shape was controlled for, correlation values with the anterior ventral temporal cortex (VTC) dropped. This was expected as the two dimensions (shape and category) are partially correlated. However, importantly, category alone was still significantly correlated with the anterior VTC in the final three layers of all CNNs. This was consistent across all four CNNs.
For Set B, there wasn't any notable drop in correlation values when controlling for shape in any of the CNNs. This suggests that the two dimensions (shape and category) are independent in this stimulus set.
Partial correlations between the primary visual cortex (V1) and both datasets followed a similar pattern. Correlations remained quite high along the convolutional layers, even after controlling for shape or category. This suggests that there is additional information contained in V1 and these CNN layers that is not accounted for by shape or category alone.
Interestingly, across all layers, the information content when controlling for shape was lower than when controlling for category. The most significant decrease in these partial correlations was observed in the final fully connected layers, where there was near zero information related to category.

Low-level shape analysis of stimuli. Using GIST31 descriptors of each image and combining this with 
LDA, we conf i rmed that category could not be predicted based upon these low-level descriptors whereas shape 
could, demonstrating that our stimulus sets were properly orthogonalised. LDA with GIST predicted shape above 
chance level, at 87.5% for Set A and 69% for Set B. Category was predicted below chance level, at 37.5% for Set A 
and 10% for Set B. 
Shape and category RSA on all cnn layers for stimulus sets A and B. Figure 2 illustrates 
layer-by-layer RSA between the CNN representations and the shape and category models in the two stimulus sets. 
Note that all applications of RSA using the Set A behavioural models involved partial correlations (see Results: 
Behavioural). Looking across all networks, in the fi rst layer of all CNNs, shape is already represented above 
the signif i cance threshold in most cases, whereas category is not. We determined the signif i cance threshold of 
every correlation by comparing it with a null distribution obtained by randomly permuting the RDM labels and 
then calculating dissimilarity relationships 1000 times. Shape correlations at the fi rst layer of CNNs are lower 
and closer to the signif i cance threshold for Set A (0.12 < �� < 0.24) than Set B (0.24 < �� < 0.36). For Set A, shape 
correlations remain relatively high at the fi nal layer (0.29 < �� < 0.59). In contrast, for Set B, shape correlation 
levels increase in the networks before falling in the fi nal layers of all networks, to roughly their initial values 
(0.32 < �� < 0.36). For all networks, category information remains low across the majority of layers, hovering at or 
below the signif i cance level until the fi nal few layers, where it increases above the signif i cance threshold to peak at 
the fi nal layer. At the fi nal layer, for Set A, category correlations reach between 0.34 < �� < 0.42. For Set B, category 
correlations reach between 0.24 < �� < 0.37 at the fi nal layer. Th e values of fi nal layer correlations are presented in 
Table 1. Set B correlations with Caf f eNet, VGG-19 and GoogLeNet are reproduced from Kubilius et al.18. 
To investigate the interaction between shape and category and CNN layers, we tested correlation values in 
a 2 �� 2 ANOVA with Layer (modelled linearly with intercept and slope) and Condition (Shape or Category) as 
factors. Table 2 summarises the statistical results of the main ef f ects (Layer, Condition) and their interaction in 
CNNs and models. For Set A, across all networks, Layer has a highly signif i cant main ef f ect and Condition is also 
signif i cant (Table 2) which suggests that correlation values can be predicted given the CNN layer and the condi- 
tion of interest (shape or category information). Th eir interaction is signif i cant in GoogleNet and VGG-19, but 
not in Caf f eNet and ResNet50, suggesting that as category information increases, shape information decreases 
signif i cantly in two out of the four networks tested. For Set B, across all networks, Condition is highly signif i cant, 
and Layer has a signif i cant main ef f ect in behavioural model correlations. Th is suggests that it is possible to make 
signif i cant predictions of behavioural shape and category judgements given CNN layer information. For Set B, 
Condition is highly signif i cant across all networks, and the interaction between Layer and Condition is only 
signif i cant in Caf f eNet. 
In summary, across both Sets A and B, we can see that shape information gradually increases and/or wavers as 
the network is traversed, before falling in the fi nal layers. Across both Sets A and B, category information is at or 
below the signif i cance threshold in the initial layer before reaching the maximum value at the fi nal layer, showing 
the opposite trend with shape correlations. Figure 3 contains multidimensional scaling plots of peak shape and 
category information for Sets A and B. 
Shape versus category information in visual ventral stream regions. Figure 4 summarises the 
representational similarity in three regions of interest (ROIs) along the visual ventral pathway, from low-level 
area V1 through to posterior and anterior VTC, compared with models of shape and category. Note that all RSA 
using Set A involved partial correlations (explained above in Results: Behavioural). For Set A, shape information 
reduces along the ventral stream, from 18% to 10%. Category information increases along the ventral pathway, 
from ���6% to 40%. We tested RSA results using a two-factor ANOVA, with ROI (V1, VTC ant, VTC post) and 
Condition (category, shape) as within-subject factors. For Set A, results reveal a signif i cant main ef f ect for ROI 
(F2, 15 = 35.81, p < 0.001), whereas the main ef f ect of Condition (shape vs category) is not signif i cant (F1, 15 = 1.02). 
Th ere is a signif i cant interaction between ROI and Condition (F2, 15 = 73.34, p < 0.001), indicating that as cate- 
gory information increases from V1 to VTC ant, shape information decreases. Post hoc pairwise t-tests further 
conf i rmed the dissociation between shape and category along the visual ventral stream: category divisions were 
able to signif i cantly better explain the neural pattern in later ventral areas (VTC ant) relative to shape (t(15) = 5.67, 
p < 0.0001); whereas the opposite was true in early visual area V1, where shape was signif i cantly more related to 
the neural data compared to category divisions (t(15) = 8.16, p < 0.0001). 
For Set B, we see a qualitatively similar trend of decreasing shape information from V1 to VTC anterior (from 
18% to 4%) and increasing category information (from 1% to 6%). Th e two-factor ANOVA, with ROI (V1, VTC 
ant, VTC post) and Condition (Category, Shape), revealed that when correlating ROI representations with the 
models for Set B, the ef f ect of ROI is signif i cant (F2, 14 = 3.79, p = 0.027), as is Condition (F1, 14 = 33.84, p < 0.001) 
and there is a highly signif i cant interaction ef f ect between ROI and Condition (F2, 14 = 13.33, p < 0.001). Again, 
pairwise t-tests further conf i rmed the dissociation between shape and category in visual brain regions, with Shape 
being signif i cantly more related to neural data in early visual area V1 than Category (t(14) = 5.28, p = 0.0001). 
Category was not able to signif i cantly explain neural patterns more in VTC ant than shape (t(14) = 1.20, p = 0.24). 
Overall, these results illustrate a decrease in shape combined with an increase in category going from V1 to VTC 
anterior.

The researchers conducted a low-level shape analysis of the stimuli using GIST descriptors. Using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), they determined that while the shape could be predicted with these descriptors, category could not, thereby confirming the orthogonality of their stimulus sets.
In examining the representation similarity analysis (RSA) between the CNN representations and the shape and category models, the researchers found that shape is represented above the significance threshold from the first layer of all CNNs in most cases, while category is not. They established a significance threshold by creating a null distribution, randomly permuting the Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM) labels and calculating dissimilarity relationships 1000 times.
Using a 2x2 ANOVA, the team investigated the interaction between shape and category and CNN layers. They found that for Set A, the layer and condition (shape or category) were significant predictors of correlation values. They found an interaction effect in GoogleNet and VGG-19, where as category information increases, shape information decreases significantly.
The same trend was observed in Set B, where condition was highly significant across all networks, and the interaction between layer and condition was only significant in CaffeNet.
In the examination of visual ventral stream regions, they found that shape information decreases while category information increases along the ventral pathway, confirming a significant interaction between Region of Interest (ROI) and condition (shape vs. category).
For Set B, they observed a similar trend of decreasing shape information and increasing category information from V1 to VTC anterior. Here too, the effect of ROI and condition were both significant, with a significant interaction effect between ROI and Condition.
Overall, these results indicate a shift from shape to category information as processing moves from the primary visual cortex (V1) to the anterior ventral temporal cortex (VTC) in both Set A and Set B. This suggests that early stages of visual processing may focus more on shape, while later stages integrate more category information.

Methods 
We aimed to determine the relationship between models of shape and category, CNNs, and neural responses in 
the human visual ventral pathway. We tested object shape and category representation in four top-performing 
CNNs and compared this with behavioural ratings of shape and category as well as human fMRI response pat- 
terns from experiments in two previous studies16,30. Human fMRI responses that are reported here use dif f erent 
ROIs than in the original studies. Some fi ndings related to the second stimulus set have been published in pre- 
vious work, which we acknowledge here and within the paper. For the second stimulus set, human behavioural 
ratings were compared to three of four of the CNNs we present here, in Kubilius et al.18. Human fMRI responses 
to shape and category were previously reported in Bracci & Op de Beeck16. 
Below we describe participants, stimulus sets, CNN architectures, the neuroimaging experiments, and data 
analysis. 
participants. All participants gave written informed consent. All experiments were approved by the Ethics 
Committee at KU Leuven and the University Hospitals Leuven. All methods were performed in accordance with 
the relevant guidelines and regulations. For the behavioural ratings, each stimulus set was rated by an independ- 
ent group of participants (N = 4 for set A; N = 16 for set B). For the neuroimaging experiments, there were 15 
participants (8 females, mean age of 30 years) scanned in fMRI experiment A, none whom were excluded. Th ere 
were also 15 participants (8 females, mean age of 24 years) scanned for fMRI experiment B, with one subject who 
was excluded due to excessive head motion. All subjects had normal or corrected vision. 
Stimulus sets. Th e stimuli in both experiments were designed to dissociate shape from category informa- 
tion. Both stimulus sets are grayscale images of objects on a white or grey background, centred at the origin and 
presented at a normal viewing angle (see Fig. 1). Set A contains 32 unique images, divided into 2 equally sized 
categories (animal vs non-animal) and 2 equally sized groups of shapes (low and high aspect ratio). Set B contains 
54 images divided into 6 object categories (minerals, animals, fruit/veg, music, sport and tools) and 9 shape types. 
Th e model design for each stimulus set, which orthogonalises shape from category, is illustrated in Fig. 1. For 
additional information about the stimulus sets, refer to Ritchie and Op de Beeck30 and Bracci and Op de Beeck16, 
for Set A and B respectively. 
To conf i rm that shape was not predictive of category information for each of the stimulus sets, we analysed the 
images using low-level GIST descriptors31 and tested how well these visual features predicted shape or category 
using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). GIST provides a low dimensional representation of an image based 
on spectral and coarsely localised information. We def i ned the GIST descriptors to include 8 orientations over 8 
scales and combined this with LDA. For Set A, we ran a two-way classif i cation using a leave-one-level out proce- 
dure, for example, training on bar stimuli and generalising to blob stimuli to test for animacy classif i cation. For 
Set B, we followed a six-way classif i cation scheme using a leave-one-level out test procedure, permuting across all 
possible groups of train and test combinations and averaging across results. For example, we selected six shape 
clusters of the total nine, trained an LDA on GIST descriptors from fi ve clusters (5 �� 6 = 30 images) and tested

The researchers' goal was to establish a relationship between models of shape and category, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and the responses in the human visual ventral pathway. To achieve this, they examined object shape and category representation in four high-performing CNNs and compared this to behavioural ratings of shape and category, as well as human fMRI response patterns from prior studies.
Participating individuals gave written informed consent, and all methods and experiments were conducted in accordance with the relevant ethical guidelines and regulations. The behavioural ratings included two independent groups of participants (N=4 for Set A; N=16 for Set B). The neuroimaging experiments involved 15 participants for each of the two experiments. One participant from the second fMRI experiment was excluded due to excessive head motion.
The stimuli for both experiments were designed to dissociate shape from category information. They comprised grayscale images of objects on a white or grey background, presented at a normal viewing angle. Set A included 32 unique images split equally between two categories (animal vs non-animal) and two shape groups (low and high aspect ratio). Set B contained 54 images divided into six object categories (minerals, animals, fruit/veg, music, sport, and tools) and nine shape types.
To ensure shape wasn't predictive of category information, the researchers used GIST descriptors and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to analyze the images. GIST provides a low dimensional representation of an image based on spectral and coarsely localized information. For Set A, a two-way classification was run using a leave-one-level-out procedure. For Set B, a six-way classification scheme was used, permuting across all possible groups of training and test combinations and averaging the results.

the ���shape-bias���, which is the preference to categorise an object based on shape rather than colour20. In contrast 
to humans, CNNs rely more heavily upon local shape information for classif i cation, known as texture-bias, which 
may potentially cause a greater discrepancy in performance than shape-bias21. Given that these networks are 
adept at representing object shape, to a degree that may even be greater than humans, it is possible they are taking 
advantage of shape-based features, instead of category information, to classify object images. 
Recent neuroimaging studies have begun to de-confound category from visual features, including shape, in 
order to investigate their interaction along the visual ventral pathway10,16,22,23. VTC in humans is one of the main 
category-selective areas24, distinguishing, for example, between animate and inanimate objects25,26. To build up 
this category-related representation, visual information is processed in a series of stages along the ventral visual 
pathway, from primary visual cortex (area V1) through to VTC24. In recent years, the exact role of VTC has come 
under question, in particular whether this area encodes category-specif i c information, or simply the low-level 
visual properties associated with category, such as colour, shape, size and texture15,27,28. Proklova, Kaiser & 
Peelen23 found that VTC encodes texture and outline alongside category-specif i c information that is not present 
in earlier visual areas. Another higher visual area, lateral occipitotemporal complex (LOTC), was found to encode 
category-associated shape properties as well as category-selective information22. Other category-orthogonal 
object properties, including size, position and pose, show higher population decoding performance in monkey 
IT (analogous to human VTC) compared to early visual areas, contrary to what was previously believed10. Indeed, 
the majority of visual object representations in IT may be accounted for by object shape, or other low-level visual 
properties, rather than category29. Nevertheless, studies that explicitly de-confound category from more low-level 
properties suggest that the category selectivity cannot be fully explained by these other properties10,16,22, and point 
towards a so-called ���feature-dependent categorical code15.��� Such a code stands in contrast to a more abstract cat- 
egorical code, and includes clear selectivity for the features that def i ne and correlate with the coded category (see 
Bracci, Ritchie & Op de Beeck15 for more information). 
In this paper, we explicitly dissociate shape from category in two stimulus sets to determine: (i) how CNNs 
represent object shape and category when they are independent from one another; and (ii) how these artif i cial 
representations correspond with shape and category representations in human visual cortex. Using two carefully 
designed stimulus sets, which orthogonalise shape and category, we assess four top-performing CNNs in their 
ability to represent category independently from shape layer by layer. Taking the same two stimulus sets, we meas- 
ure human fMRI responses when viewing these images and assess the interaction between shape and category 
along the visual ventral stream. Finally, we compare artif i cial representations with human fMRI responses for the 
same two stimulus sets, to evaluate how closely CNNs ref l ect biological representations.

In this study, the researchers sought to explore how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the human visual cortex deal with object categorization based on shape. CNNs are known to exhibit a 'texture-bias', relying heavily on local shape information for classification. However, the researchers question whether these networks may also be capitalizing on shape-based features over category information when classifying object images.
Research has shown that the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) in humans, a key category-selective area, can differentiate between categories like animate and inanimate objects. This process involves several stages of visual information processing along the ventral visual pathway. However, there is ongoing debate regarding whether the VTC encodes category-specific information or simply the low-level visual properties associated with category, such as color, shape, size, and texture.
The study aims to disentangle shape from category in two different sets of stimuli to understand (i) how CNNs represent object shape and category independently, and (ii) how these artificial representations align with those in the human visual cortex. This investigation involves assessing four top-performing CNNs' capability to independently represent categories from shape layer by layer, using the two stimulus sets. The researchers also plan to measure human fMRI responses when viewing these images and analyze the interplay between shape and category along the visual ventral stream. Ultimately, they aim to compare artificial representations with human fMRI responses for the same two stimulus sets to evaluate the extent to which CNNs mimic biological representations.

Deep convolutional neural networks (cnns) are gaining traction as the benchmark model of visual 
object recognition, with performance now surpassing humans. While cnns can accurately assign one 
image to potentially thousands of categories, network performance could be the result of layers that 
are tuned to represent the visual shape of objects, rather than object category, since both are often 
confounded in natural images. Using two stimulus sets that explicitly dissociate shape from category, 
we correlate these two types of information with each layer of multiple cnns. We also compare cnn 
output with fMRI activation along the human visual ventral stream by correlating artif i cial with neural 
representations. We fi nd that CNNs encode category information independently from shape, peaking 
at the fi nal fully connected layer in all tested CNN architectures. Comparing CNNs with fMRI brain data, 
early visual cortex (V1) and early layers of CNNs encode shape information. Anterior ventral temporal 
cortex encodes category information, which correlates best with the fi nal layer of CNNs. The interaction 
between shape and category that is found along the human visual ventral pathway is echoed in multiple 
deep networks. our results suggest cnns represent category information independently from shape, 
much like the human visual system. 
In recent years, the performance of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has improved signif i cantly, 
such that they are able to meet1���3, and even surpass4 human performance in classifying objects. In light of these 
impressive fi ndings, these artif i cial networks are increasingly compared to their biological counterparts, resulting 
in an accumulation of evidence for their use as a benchmark model of visual object recognition5,6. For example, 
the internal representations of CNNs show correspondence with human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) as meas- 
ured by fMRI, as well as with primate inferotemporal cortex (IT) measured using single cell recordings7���12. Th e 
correspondence between deep networks and neural representations along the visual pathway has even allowed for 
accurate neural response prediction of single-cell recordings in IT9 as well as fMRI13. Representational similarities 
have been further extended from the spatial into the temporal domain, with results showing a corresponding 
ordering of processing between CNNs and the human visual brain using MEG14. Th ese accumulating fi ndings 
showcase the ability of CNNs to model neurons from single unit responses to entire populations, spanning the 
multiple scales and dimensions used to study neural activity, and make CNNs some of the best models to date for 
studying vision in the human and primate brain. 
While these feats are impressive, it is unclear to what extent these results are easily interpretable in terms of 
categorical representations. Object category information can of t en be confounded with low-level visual features, 
such as colour, texture, and shape15. In this paper, we highlight the signif i cant interaction between shape and 
category that is known to occur in natural images16 and address the possibility that these networks may distin- 
guish between object categories by relying upon visual features, such as shape, rather than high-level category 
representations. Indeed, the shape similarity of objects has already been capitalised on in the machine learning 
fi eld to improve performance17. CNNs are prof i cient at representing the perceived shape of objects, as opposed 
to their physical shape18 and it has been claimed that CNNs rely heavily upon local shape information for classi- 
i cation19. Two-dimensional regular vs irregular shape representations have been found in monkey IT, which are 
highly comparable to late layers of CNNs12. Furthermore, CNNs mimic a behavioural bias in humans known as

This paper aims to investigate the processing of visual object recognition in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the human visual system. Despite their impressive performances in object classification, surpassing human abilities in some cases, CNNs' representation and interpretation of object categories remain unclear. There is a concern that CNNs might rely on low-level visual features, such as shape, rather than high-level category representations, to distinguish between object categories.
This research uses two stimulus sets that explicitly separate shape from category. The investigators then correlate these two types of information with each layer of multiple CNNs. They also compare the output from the CNNs with fMRI activation along the human visual ventral stream by correlating artificial representations with neural responses.
The findings indicate that CNNs can encode category information independently from shape, with this representation peaking at the final fully connected layer in all tested CNN architectures. When compared to fMRI brain data, the early visual cortex (V1) and early layers of CNNs encode shape information, while the anterior ventral temporal cortex encodes category information, best correlating with the final layer of the CNNs.
The research suggests that the interaction between shape and category found along the human visual ventral pathway is mirrored in multiple deep networks. Therefore, CNNs might be capable of representing category information independently from shape, akin to the human visual system. This understanding could significantly enhance the interpretability and applicability of CNNs in visual object recognition tasks.

The article examines the mechanisms of visual object recognition in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the human visual system. It addresses the concern that CNNs, while highly successful in object categorization tasks, might be using low-level visual features, like shape, rather than higher-level category representations, to differentiate between objects.
To investigate this, the researchers created two stimulus sets that distinctly separate shape from category. They analyzed how these two types of information correlated with each layer of multiple CNNs. The researchers also compared the artificial representations in CNNs with fMRI activations along the human visual ventral stream, which is involved in object recognition.
Their findings suggest that CNNs can encode category information independently of shape information, with the strongest representation in the final fully connected layer across all tested CNN architectures. Comparatively, in the human brain, the early visual cortex and the early layers of CNNs are more focused on encoding shape information, while the anterior ventral temporal cortex, a later stage in the visual pathway, encodes category information.
In summary, this study proposes that CNNs, much like the human visual system, can represent category information independently of shape. This insight helps illuminate how CNNs process visual object recognition and suggests they might be closer to human cognitive processing than previously assumed.

This study offers valuable insights into how both human brains and artificial neural networks process visual information. The findings suggest that deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can distinguish between an object's category and its shape when processing visual information. This mirrors a similar processing distinction observed in the human visual system, where different parts of the brain are responsible for recognizing object shape and object category.
Such a conclusion has a few important implications:
Advancements in AI Modeling:
The ability of CNNs to independently process shape and category information, mirroring the human visual system, suggests that these models are becoming increasingly sophisticated and human-like in their operations. This could have significant implications for the development of future AI models, and supports the use of CNNs as benchmark models for understanding visual perception.
Neuroscience and AI Interactions:
The study adds to the growing body of research highlighting the parallels between artificial neural networks and biological neural systems. It underscores how research in AI can inform our understanding of the human brain, and vice versa.
Practical Applications:
This understanding can help improve the efficiency and performance of CNNs in visual recognition tasks. It might also influence how we train these models, with potential benefits in various applications ranging from autonomous vehicles to medical image analysis.
Remember, however, that while CNNs have shown impressive capabilities and can mimic certain aspects of human cognition, they are still fundamentally different from the biological brains in many respects. They lack many of the complexities and nuances of human cognition and perception, and their "understanding" is fundamentally different from human understanding.

Abstract
Recognizing materials and their properties visually is vital for successful interactions with our environment, from avoiding slippery floors to handling fragile objects. Yet there is no simple mapping of retinal image intensities to physical properties. Here, we investigated what image information drives material perception by collecting human psychophysical judgements about complex glossy objects. Variations in specular image structure���produced either by manipulating reflectance properties or visual features directly���caused categorical shifts in material appearance, suggesting that specular reflections provide diagnostic information about a wide range of material classes. Perceived material category appeared to mediate cues for surface gloss, providing evidence against a purely feedforward view of neural processing. Our results suggest that the image structure that triggers our perception of surface gloss plays a direct role in visual categorization, and that the perception and neural processing of stimulus properties should be studied in the context of recognition, not in isolation.

Main
Our visual experience of the world arises from light that has been reflected, transmitted or scattered by surfaces. From this light we can tell whether a surface is light or dark, shiny or dull, translucent or opaque, made from platinum, plastic or pearl (Fig. 1a). The quick and accurate recognition of materials and their intrinsic properties is central to our daily interactions with objects and surfaces, from inferring tactile information (is it smooth, heavy, soft?) to assessing function (is it edible, fragile, valuable?). Yet material perception is not trivial because the structure, spectral content and amount of light reaching our eyes depend not only on surface reflectance, transmittance and scattering properties, but also on complex interactions with the three-dimensional (3D) shape, position and orientation of surfaces with respect to each other, light sources and the observer. Thus, our ability to effortlessly discern a wide variety of materials that each have a potentially unlimited optical appearance is remarkable, and serves as a compelling example of an important but unresolved challenge in visual neuroscience: how does the brain disentangle the conflated factors contributing to the retinal image to perceive our visual world?

This article delves into how humans visually recognize materials and their properties, which is essential for effectively interacting with our environment. However, the process of determining physical properties from retinal image intensities is complex and not straightforward.
The researchers aimed to understand what image information triggers material perception by gathering human psychophysical judgments about complex glossy objects. They discovered that changes in the structure of specular (reflected) images, either via manipulating the properties of reflectance or directly altering visual features, led to categorical shifts in the appearance of materials. This suggests that specular reflections offer crucial information about various material classes.
Interestingly, the perceived material category seemed to mediate cues for surface gloss, arguing against a purely feedforward view of neural processing. The findings suggest that the image structure that sparks our perception of surface gloss directly impacts visual categorization. Therefore, the perception and neural processing of stimulus properties should be examined in the context of recognition and not in isolation.
Simply put, the research investigates how we perceive different materials visually, focusing on glossy objects. They found that the way an object reflects light gives us important information about what material it's made of. This is not a straightforward process, but rather involves the interplay of various factors, pointing towards a more complex mechanism of neural processing than previously thought.

Although there is a growing body of work investigating the visual perception of material properties such as colour, lightness, transparency, translucency and gloss1,2,3,4,5,6, there is comparatively little investigating the recognition of different material classes such as plastic, pearl, satin, steel and so on7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. For example, previous research has discovered a limited set of image conditions (photogeometric constraints) that trigger the perception of a glossy versus a matte surface, involving the intensity, shape, position and the orientation of specular highlights (bright reflections18,19,20,21,22,23,24) and lowlights (dark reflections25) with respect to diffuse shading. However, it remains unknown what image information triggers our perception of different materials. A possible reason for the disparate focus on material properties versus classes is that studying properties like colour and gloss seems more tractable than discovering the necessary and sufficient conditions for recognizing the many material classes in our environment. The challenge is that the perceptual space of materials is unspecified; there are many different optical ���appearances��� that can look like steel (think polished, scratched, rusted), or plastic (smooth and glossy or rough and dull).

Furthermore, a traditional feedforward view of neural processing is often assumed in which the recognition of objects and materials proceeds from the processing of low-level sensory information (image features) to the estimation of shape and surface properties (often referred to as mid-level vision2,3) to the high-level recognition of object and material categories26 (feedforward hypothesis; Fig. 1b, top). Within this framework it would make sense to first study how the visual system computes mid-level material properties like surface gloss and colour from images, because material class is thought to be subsequently computed from the high-dimensional feature space defined by these component mid-level properties9,10,11,12,27,28.

An alternative view suggests that the visual system does not try to recover physical surface properties like diffuse reflectance (seen as surface colour) and specular reflectance (seen as gloss) per se, but rather learns about statistical variations or regularities in image structure from which both material properties like gloss and material categories like plastic can be ���read out��� simultaneously5,6,29,30 (simultaneous hypothesis; Fig. 1b, bottom). For example, in Fig. 1c, systematic differences in the surface reflectance properties of otherwise identical objects produce variations in the appearance of specular highlights, such as their contrast, sharpness and coverage (Fig. 2). These variations in highlight appearance affect not only the quantitative level of surface gloss perceived (shiny to dull), but also the quality���or material category���of the surface altogether (rubber, plastic, ceramic or metal), and it is possible that the same visual features, or cues, directly underlie both processes. At present, however, the relationship between image structure, perceptual properties like surface gloss and material recognition is unclear.

This passage delves into the study of visual perception of different material classes (like plastic, pearl, satin, steel), an area that has not been as thoroughly investigated as the perception of material properties such as color, lightness, transparency, translucency, and gloss.
Traditionally, the view of neural processing has been feedforward, where the recognition of objects and materials begins with the processing of low-level sensory information (like image features), then estimation of shape and surface properties (referred to as mid-level vision), and finally, high-level recognition of object and material categories. In this framework, it's logical to study how the visual system computes mid-level properties like surface gloss and color from images first, because the material class is thought to be subsequently computed from the feature space defined by these mid-level properties.
However, an alternative view posits that the visual system doesn't aim to recover physical surface properties like color and gloss, but instead learns about variations or regularities in image structure. From these regularities, both material properties and categories can be deduced simultaneously. For instance, differences in surface reflectance properties can produce variations in the appearance of specular highlights (reflections), affecting not only the level of perceived surface gloss but also the material category of the surface. The relationship between image structure, perceptual properties like surface gloss, and material recognition remains unclear. This signifies that understanding the perception of material properties and the recognition of material categories might be more intertwined than previously thought.

Figure 1
a, Most objects that we see every day are made from materials whose specular reflectance properties produce a characteristic image structure. The appearance of these reflections is determined (and constrained) by the way in which these materials scatter light, in addition to other generative processes (Fig. 2). b, However, the extent and mechanism by which specular structure contributes to categorization remains unknown. A feedforward view of neural processing (top) assumes that categories are defined by combinations of estimated mid-level properties like gloss, colour and apparent shape, which the visual system tries to ���recover��� from the image67. By contrast, the simultaneous hypothesis (bottom) assumes that the visual system learns naturally about statistical variations (regularities) in image structure, from which the identity or category of a material can be ���read out��� simultaneously with surface qualities like gloss29. c, Some aspects of a surface���s appearance (such as perceived gloss) tend to correlate with physical properties (such as specular reflectance), all else being equal. Systematically manipulating the specular reflectance properties of otherwise identical objects causes salient visual differences in the appearance of highlights (Fig. 2), which affects perceived gloss in predictable ways. Specifically, increasing specular strength (bottom to top) increases the contrast of specular highlights, causing the dragon to appear more glossy; increasing specular roughness (from left to right) decreases the clarity (or sharpness) of the specular highlights, causing the dragon to appear less glossy. These manipulations also affect our qualitative (categorical) impressions: the surfaces resemble different materials like glazed ceramic, glossy plastic, dull plastic, rubber, polished metal and brushed metal. Because shape, surface colour and illumination conditions are held constant, all visual differences are caused by variations in specular reflectance properties, suggesting that specular structure may directly contain diagnostic information about material class, simultaneously with surface gloss (note that for some materials like gold, colour information also contributes to perceptual classification). d, Reflectance parameters manipulated in the experiments, and examples of how this affected the visual appearance of surfaces.

In Figure 1, the authors of the study use visual aids to illustrate and explain various hypotheses about how the human visual system recognizes materials and their properties.
(a) The first part of the figure illustrates that the appearance of most everyday objects is significantly influenced by their materials' specular reflectance properties, which produce a characteristic image structure. This appearance is determined by how these materials scatter light, among other generative processes.
(b) This part of the figure compares two hypotheses about how the visual system processes this information. The feedforward hypothesis (top) proposes that categories are defined by combinations of mid-level properties like gloss, color, and apparent shape, which the visual system tries to 'recover' from the image. The simultaneous hypothesis (bottom), on the other hand, posits that the visual system learns about statistical variations in image structure, and the material's identity or category can be 'read out' simultaneously with surface qualities like gloss.
(c) The third part of the figure demonstrates how manipulating specular reflectance properties of otherwise identical objects can affect perceived gloss in predictable ways and cause qualitative (categorical) differences in our impressions. For instance, increasing specular strength makes an object appear glossier, and increasing specular roughness makes it appear less glossy. These changes also make the surfaces resemble different materials. Because other factors like shape, surface color, and illumination conditions are constant, these visual differences are entirely due to variations in specular reflectance properties, suggesting that specular structure might contain diagnostic information about material class, simultaneously with surface gloss.
(d) The final part of the figure shows the reflectance parameters manipulated in the experiments and examples of how these manipulations affected the visual appearance of surfaces.

In Experiment 4, a new set of participants (n���=���22) performed an 18-AFC task identical to Experiment 2, but with the feature-transformed stimuli. The stimulus profiles were converted to factor scores to see which material dimensions best applied to the new stimuli. The average factor scores plotted in Fig. 7c,d show that participants agreed with our informal observations. For the first stimulus set (linear feature manipulations; Fig. 7c), stimuli that were intended to be uncoloured metals and velvety/silky materials actually had the quality of glazed ceramic and plastic, respectively. For the second stimulus set (nonlinear feature manipulations; Fig. 7d), the perceived materials align much better with the intended classes.

Discussion
In the present study we showed that the image structure produced by specular reflections not only affects how glossy a surface looks, it can also determine the quality, or category, of the material that is perceived. Critically, specular reflections provide more information than just distinguishing between surfaces that are matte versus glossy24, or plastic versus metal16; we found that the perceptual dimensionality of glossy surfaces defined by a diffuse and specular component is much larger than has been suggested previously34,35,36,37. This is probably because previous studies on gloss perception have manipulated stimulus parameters within a narrow range and used restricted tasks; for example, stimuli are simple, smooth shapes and/or their reflectance properties encompass only the range of plastic- and ceramic-looking materials, and participants judge the level of gloss or relative similarity between surfaces. Here, we used complex shapes, manipulated reflectance parameters within a wider range and asked participants to judge each object���s qualitative material appearance. This greatly expanded the number of dimensions required to account for perceptual differences between glossy surfaces relative to previous studies. Note that we did not sample the whole perceptual space of glossy objects defined by a diffuse and specular component (for example, we manipulated colour saturation within only one hue). The dimensionality of gloss appearance is likely to expand further upon sampling a wider range of reflectance parameters, shapes, mesostructure detail and environment lighting conditions.

Importantly, we found that changes in specular structure���caused by either generative sources or direct feature manipulation���led to qualitative shifts in material appearance beyond those expected by the reflectance function used. This demonstrates that features of specular image structure can be diagnostic for recognizing a wide range of materials. A potential reason for this is that a material���s surface reflectance properties create some of its most salient optical characteristics, and, because most surfaces reflect some light specularly, relying on such characteristics could have ecological importance when other cues to material are not available. For instance, the visual effects of translucency can be greatly diminished with frontal lighting38; in such cases, visual features caused by specular reflections might remain diagnostic of translucent materials (for example, porcelain). Similarly, mesoscale details like fibres on cloth or scratches on metal might not be visually resolvable when seen at a distance, yet such materials might still be recognized from specular image structure. Indeed, these additional sources of image structure (from mesostructure or translucency) are absent from the stimuli used in the present study, and although such details might render the materials more compelling (for example, when compared with a photograph), the stimuli nevertheless convincingly resemble silk-like, porcelain-like, wax-like, brushed metal-like materials and so on. Interestingly, these results are in line with findings from the computer graphics literature that show that visual effects from different types of fabrics come predominantly from specular reflections, and diffuse reflection and shadowing-masking play a much less pronounced role even for relatively matte-looking fabrics39.

Our data do not support the notion of a feedforward path to recognition, whereby the visual system combines estimates of physical properties that are first ���recovered��� from images; instead, our results are in line with the idea that vision assigns perceptual qualities to statistically varying image structure2,5,6,40,41. Specifically, we found that gloss was not a good indicator of a material���s class; instead, materials were differentiated directly based on measurable image-based specular reflection features, suggesting that material qualities like gloss are a perceptual outcome with���rather than a component dimension of���our holistic impressions. Indeed, the perception of material qualities like gloss might even be influenced by these holistic impressions, as suggested by the fact that the contribution of different cues to gloss was not stable across different materials, but covaried with the cues that predicted material class. The regions of feature space occupied by different material classes (different qualitative appearances) seemed to mediate the processing of those same features when estimating surface glossiness.

One potential mechanism is that emergent categories from our stimulus set could reflect cognitive decisions, and this cognitive interpretation has a ���top-down��� influence on which features are used to judge surface gloss. For example, ���chocolate��� and ���plastic��� could have similar contrast and sharpness of specular highlights (similar ���gloss types���) and the different labels might result from a cognitive decision by participants based on body colour (brown versus yellow). However, we cannot think of a principled reason why a feature���s influence on material category would affect how people choose to use that feature for gloss judgements.

Furthermore, we argue that such a clear perceptual scission of image structure into different layers (for example, a gloss layer and a body colour layer) and then subsequent ���cognitive reassembly��� is unlikely, especially for the complex-shaped stimuli and wide sampling of reflectance parameters used in the present study. This type of layered appearance of gloss, which can be construed as a form of transparency perception, probably applies only to smooth surfaces with little variation in surface curvature, such as spheres25. For our stimuli, specular image structure seems to combine interactively with diffuse shading to create a gestalt-like quality for each material, such that we may not even have perceptual access to individual cues (Supplementary Fig. 1). As with object recognition, this material quality can be given a label like ���gold��� or ���pearl���, but nonetheless reflects a holistic impression, rather than a cognitive combination of cues (also see Okazawa et al.42). Such holistic impressions are probably why we could successfully manipulate visual features to transform one category into another (Experiment 4), but why linear models like LDA and representational similarity analysis (Experiment 2) did not better account for the data.

We propose an alternative mechanism to explain the covariation between cues for surface gloss and material class, inspired by converging evidence from independent lines of psychophysical and neuropsychological research that suggest computations of stimulus properties are inherently coupled3,43. Specifically, monkey physiology studies have found that neurons in primate area V4 respond only to specific combinations of texture and shape, and not to these properties separately, suggesting joint representations of shape and surface properties43. In line with this, a series of human psychophysics studies have demonstrated that percepts of 3D shape and surface properties (for example, gloss or translucency) are mutually constrained by specific image gradient���contour relationships (that is, the cues for each are not separate)3. Similarly, transparency impressions triggered by low-contrast centre���surround displays are mutually constrained with the perception of surface lightness: a medium-grey patch surrounded by a slightly darker (homogenous) surface can appear whiteish with the quality of a flimsy transparent sheath, which occurs to the extent that luminance within the central patch is attributed to a foreground (patch) or background (surround) layer44. In the present study, the covariation between cues for gloss and material class could also reflect a mutual dependency (that is, their computations could be coupled). We suggest that a surface���s qualitative (categorical) appearance constrains how specular image structure is perceptually allocated to different aspects of material appearance such as specular reflections (versus say bright pigment, or illumination, or 3D shape45,46), and thus which cues are perceptually available to make a surface look ���glossy��� or ���shiny���.

Interactions between categorical, or ���holistic���, material impressions and the perception of different stimulus properties warrants further investigation because the underlying mechanism will influence how we study perception in multiple domains. Recently, unsupervised deep neural networks have generated excitement as a potential tool to uncover purported mid-level visual processes; for example, by providing evidence that the brain could potentially spontaneously discover the existence of properties like gloss, illumination direction and shape without previous knowledge about the world, but by learning to efficiently represent variations in image structure produced by these properties47. However, here we showed that with more complex stimuli, image information cannot be neatly mapped onto perceptual properties like gloss; this mapping is constrained by the qualitative or categorical appearance of surfaces. Some material classes occupy relatively homogeneous feature spaces (for example, gold) compared with other, more diverse classes (for example, plastic), which probably emerges through behavioural relevance. Thus, for unsupervised learning to generate useful hypotheses about perceptual processes, future work needs to consider how the behavioural relevance of stimuli might influence spontaneous learning about statistical image variations.

Neuropsychological results should also be interpreted in the context of qualitative, categorical material perception. For example, neurons in the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus in monkeys have been shown to respond preferentially to specific combinations of manipulated gloss parameters48. It is possible that different categorical or holistic material impressions are triggered by these specific combinations, driving this response. Moreover, research into object recognition49 often investigates how visual features like texture50 and form51 influence object category representations, but thus far have neglected the role of surface properties in recognition; for example, by not controlling for changes in surface properties51,52,53, or ���scrambling��� the images in a way that breaks the perception of surfaces50. Our results suggest that the specific photogeometric constraints on image structure that trigger our perception of surface gloss play an important role in visual categorization and recognition, and that a fruitful direction for neuropsychological research could be to focus on identifying the neural mechanisms that represent objects holistically54.

However, we think that this role extends beyond object identification. Just as surface gloss as a unitary concept is not a component dimension of material perception, we argue that material perception is not merely a component dimension of scene perception. A material���s qualitative appearance is useful for different aspects of navigation, such as identifying where we are (beaches have sand and water), choosing which paths to take (icy versus muddy versus concrete) and deciding which obstacles to avoid (solid rock versus flexible vegetation). We also need material perception for locating items among clutter (finding a metallic pot in the cupboard), evaluating an object���s function, usefulness or motor affordances (Can I eat it? Is it expensive or fake? How do I pick it up?) and predicting tactile properties and future states of objects (Is it heavy, sticky or wet? Will shatter, stretch or bounce?). Our results shed light on how image structure is transformed into our representations of surfaces with particular material ���appearances���, thereby making an important contribution towards bridging the gap between the early stages of visual information processing and behavioural goals such as categorization, action and prediction55,56

The experiment and subsequent discussion address the role of specular reflections - reflections of light on shiny surfaces - in the perception of different materials' quality or category. The researchers found that specular reflections contribute much more to our perception than simply distinguishing between shiny (glossy) and matte surfaces, or between plastic and metal surfaces.
One main argument is against the feedforward path to recognition concept, which suggests that our vision system combines estimates of physical properties from images. Instead, the study suggests that our perception of materials like gloss are perceptual outcomes that result from the overall image structure. Our vision system assigns perceptual qualities to statistically varying image structures, implying that materials are differentiated directly based on measurable image-based specular reflection features.
In their experiments, they manipulated the reflectance parameters of complex shapes, which they used in a wider range than previous studies, asking participants to judge each object's qualitative material appearance. This expanded the number of dimensions necessary to account for perceptual differences between glossy surfaces.
Another key finding was that changes in specular structure lead to qualitative shifts in material appearance beyond those expected by the reflectance function used, indicating that features of specular image structure can be diagnostic for recognizing a wide range of materials.
The results also indicate that the perception of material qualities might be influenced by these holistic impressions, suggesting that the computation of properties like gloss and material class could be coupled. That means, a surface's qualitative appearance could influence how specular image structure is allocated to different aspects of material appearance.
Furthermore, the research discusses the relevance of qualitative, categorical material perception in interpreting neuropsychological results and how it could be important in visual categorization and recognition. They argue that the perception of surface gloss could play an important role in object recognition and propose the need to focus on identifying the neural mechanisms that represent objects holistically.
In essence, the study suggests that the way we perceive materials is not just a mere component dimension of scene perception. It is crucial for different aspects of navigation, such as identifying our location, choosing paths, avoiding obstacles, locating items among clutter, evaluating an object's function, and predicting tactile properties and future states of objects.

ChatGPT
Both the previous article and this one discuss visual processing, but they focus on different aspects of this broad field.
The previous article discussed how visual categories are encoded in the brain and how they relate to the perception of shapes. It suggested that the brain encodes object categories in a more abstract way, separate from the perception of shape. In other words, the brain can recognize an object's category (for instance, whether it's a chair or a table) independently of recognizing its shape. This could indicate a division of labor in the brain where different aspects of visual information are processed in different ways or in different areas.
On the other hand, the research about specular reflections and material perception focuses on how we perceive the physical properties of objects and surfaces. This research suggested that the perception of glossiness, for instance, is not merely a component of material perception, but is more tied to the overall image structure, involving a more holistic impression of the material.
There are interesting connections between these two articles. Both studies seem to suggest that our visual perception is more complex and multifaceted than just recognizing shapes or materials. Rather, our brain appears to process different aspects of visual information separately yet in an interconnected manner.
For instance, the concept of holistic perception appears in both. In the category and shape research, there's a sort of holistic perception in that the brain can recognize an object's category without needing to analyze its shape in detail. In the specular reflections study, the authors talk about a gestalt-like quality for each material, where we may not even have perceptual access to individual cues.
Moreover, both articles underline the importance of context in visual perception. The object's category could influence how we perceive its shape, while the specular structure and the overall qualitative appearance of a surface could affect how we perceive its glossiness or shininess.
In essence, both studies highlight that our visual system doesn't just passively receive information but actively interprets it, based on various factors and features, and this interpretation process is likely distributed across different aspects or modules of the visual system.

Representation Similarity Analysis (RSA) Given a set of active patterns (biological,
behavioral, or artificial) under experimental conditions, RSA provides a useful and illus-
trative tool for computing the dissimilarity between patterns by 1 minus the correlation
between units that make up patterns. By comparing the performance of each CNN layer
with the behavior or neural activity data, the characterization geometric responses gener-
ated by different visual stimuli are studied, and whether the same category of images gen-
erates similar responses in the representation space is determined. Representational dis-
similarity matrix (RDM) of RSA comparison describes the representative information of
the brain or model: (Kheradpisheh et al. 2016; Wen et al. 2018b; Faghihi et al. 2019; Cichy
et al. 2016; Kheradpisheh et al. 2016; Cadieu et al. 2014; Orlov and Zohary 2018; Cichy

Artificial neural networks are inspired Oy the neurobiology that began to develop in the
mid-20th century. Artificial neurons are designed to simulate the basic functions of neu-
rons for receiving and transforming information. Convolutional networks simulate the hier-
archical information processing mechanism of the visual pathway. The main functions and
calculations are inspired by some early discoveries of visual systems. Meanwhile, many
recent studies in the field of neuroscience relate the DNN-based models to the visual cor-
tex, and they evaluated the performance consistency of the two in performing object rec-
ognition tasks through neural activation prediction (Zeman et al. 2020; Cadieu et al. 2014;
Kar et al. 2019) or object representation (Karimi-Rouzbahani et al. 2017; Ayzenberg and
Lourenco 2019; Pramod and Arun 2016). There is a corresponding relationship between
the hierarchical structure of the DNN-based model and the visual pathway, which can bet-
predict the neural activity of the visual cortex than other methods. The artificial neural
ter
network is gradually developed based on the interaction between visual neuroscience and
computer vision,
In contrast, the DNN-based object recognition model has a strong predictive ability for
9
the visual cortex. DNN can be exploited to deduce the working principle and understand
the information processing mechanism of the visual cortex. There are three approaches for
DNN to understand the visual system. Firstly, the success of the DNN- based model in the
object recognition task proves that the understanding of the visual cortex from the overall
and intuitive perspective 1s C correct basically. Secondly, based on the existing data, a reason-
able model that focuses on specific aspects can be established. Finally, the working mode
of the visual cortex is integrated into concrete calculation mathematical models. It is still
significant to provide insights into the general trend and limitations of the model behavior.
In summary, the DNN-based model provides a biologically credible technical element
for fast recognition of visual objects, which can explain the efficient computation of pat-
tern recognition components. However, they fail to explain how human beings understand
the semantic relationship between elements and the physical interaction between objects.

The text provided describes Representation Similarity Analysis (RSA) and its utility in understanding the neural processing of visual information. RSA offers an illustrative tool for comparing dissimilarity between patterns���these patterns could be biological, behavioral, or artificial. This is accomplished by calculating 1 minus the correlation between units that make up these patterns. This technique is used in conjunction with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to study geometric responses elicited by different visual stimuli and to determine whether the same category of images generates similar responses in representational space.
The Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM) that results from RSA comparison conveys the representational information of the brain or model. By comparing the performance of each CNN layer with behavioral or neural activity data, researchers can assess the extent to which these artificial systems mimic biological processes.
Artificial neural networks were inspired by neurobiology, particularly the way neurons receive and transform information. Convolutional networks simulate the hierarchical information processing mechanism of the visual pathway. Many recent studies in neuroscience relate these Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based models to the visual cortex, evaluating their performance consistency in object recognition tasks through neural activation prediction or object representation.
Interestingly, there's a corresponding relationship between the hierarchical structure of the DNN-based model and the visual pathway. The artificial neural network development has been influenced by the interaction between visual neuroscience and computer vision, leading to models that can predict the neural activity of the visual cortex more effectively than other methods.
The DNN-based object recognition model also shows a strong predictive capacity for the visual cortex and can be used to deduce its working principle and understand the information processing mechanism of the visual cortex. There are three approaches for DNNs to understand the visual system: an intuitive overall understanding of the visual cortex, a model that focuses on specific aspects based on existing data, and the integration of the visual cortex's working mode into concrete mathematical models.
However, it's important to note that while these DNN-based models provide a biologically credible element for quickly recognizing visual objects, they currently do not explain how humans understand the semantic relationship between elements or the physical interaction between objects. These limitations need to be addressed in future research to develop even more sophisticated and biologically plausible models for visual object recognition.

Therefore, based on the design source and outstanding performance of the deep convo-
lution neural network, some future development directions can be proposed. To under-
stand the processing mechanism of visual object recognition in the brain, it is necessary to
a
develop a theoretical framework for the visual behavior function that needs to be explained.
The brain-inspired computing model needs to be able to perform the functions that contrib-
ute to visual object recognition in primates. Also, the completeness and biological credibil-
in
ity of the model architecture can be effectively promoted based on the rich measurement
experiments of visual neural activities.
However, the current rapid development of artificial neural networks has gradually
moved away from the biological basis in terms of computation. This is mainly because
engineering breakthroughs have changed the field of computer vision in the past few years.
The success of these networks helps us think about the future of machine object recogni-
tion. On the one hand, the current engineering design of these networks has reached a satu-
ration point, that is, the optimization of layers, activation function, parameter adjustment, gradient function, and other aspects contributes to a less improvement of accuracy. For general applications, the biological vision system is far superior to any computer. On the other hand, although the ideological communication between neuroscience and computer vision has experienced ups and downs, it is difficult for us not to be enthusiastic about
the future of neuroscience-based computer vision. In many ways, there has never been so much ideological communication between the fields of neuroscience, computer vision,
and machine learning. The recent success of machine learning coincides with the recent advancement of neural science and technology, and these two fields may use each other's insights on an unprecedented scale.

The text concludes by suggesting potential future developments and challenges for brain-inspired object recognition models. For us to truly understand the processing mechanisms of visual object recognition in the brain, it's important to develop a theoretical framework that can explain the visual behavior function. Brain-inspired computing models need to be capable of performing the functions that contribute to visual object recognition in primates, and the completeness and biological credibility of these models can be effectively promoted with the aid of extensive experimental data on visual neural activities.
However, there is an ongoing challenge: the rapid evolution of artificial neural networks has increasingly diverged from biological basis in terms of computation, largely driven by engineering breakthroughs that have transformed the field of computer vision. While these advances have certainly been instrumental to the success of these networks in object recognition, there is a concern that they've reached a point of saturation in terms of architectural optimization (layers, activation function, parameter adjustment, gradient function, etc.) where further improvements do not significantly enhance accuracy.
Despite these computational models' successes, they are still outmatched by the biological vision system for general applications. However, there is optimism for the future of neuroscience-based computer vision. The communication between neuroscience and computer vision, though turbulent, has fostered considerable excitement about what the future might hold. Interdisciplinary collaboration is increasing, particularly among neuroscience, computer vision, and machine learning.
Recent successes in machine learning have been mirrored by advancements in neural science and technology, suggesting that these two fields could benefit significantly from each other's insights. This interdisciplinary approach has the potential to facilitate the development of more robust, biologically plausible models of visual object recognition and deepen our understanding of how the brain processes visual information.

Absolutely, the comprehensive summary you've provided encapsulates our previous discussions excellently and sets up a solid foundation for understanding the complex interplay between the neuroscience of visual perception and the current advancements in AI and computer vision.
Additionally, the evidence from neuropsychology has indeed identified these four specific stages in the process of object recognition. Let's briefly discuss them:
Processing of basic object components
: At this initial stage, our visual system identifies the basic features or components of an object. This might include lines, corners, or colors that are integral to the object's visual appearance.
Grouping of these components on the basis of similarity
: Once the basic features have been identified, they are grouped together based on their similarities. This is a process known as perceptual grouping, and it often operates according to principles such as proximity, similarity, closure, and continuity.
Figure-ground segregation
: This stage involves differentiating the object (the "figure") from its surrounding environment (the "ground"). This is a crucial step that allows us to focus our attention on the object rather than on the irrelevant background.
Recognition
: At the final stage, the brain recognizes the object by comparing the perceived image with stored images or templates in our memory. The recognition process involves associating the perceived image with previously learned information about similar objects.
These stages not only provide a roadmap for understanding how humans recognize visual objects but also serve as a blueprint for the development of artificial intelligence systems that mimic the human visual system. This understanding can lead to more robust and effective AI and computer vision technologies.

Representation Similarity Analysis (RSA) is a computational tool used to compare and understand different patterns of activity in biological or artificial systems. RSA is used in the study of visual perception to test hypotheses about the representational geometry, which is characterized by the representational dissimilarities among the stimuli. RSA can relate brain activity patterns to continuous and categorical multivariate stimulus descriptions. When the stimulus description is the internal representation in a computational model, RSA can be used to test the model. RSA can also relate brain representations to behavioral data, such as similarity judgments. RSA characterizes the representation in each brain region by a representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM). The RDM is a square symmetric matrix, indexed by the stimuli horizontally and vertically (in the same order). The diagonal entries reflect comparisons between identical stimuli and are 0, by definition, in this type of RDM. Each off-diagonal value indicates the dissimilarity between the corresponding stimuli. RSA offers an attractive way of abstracting from the spatial layout and even from the linear basis of the representation, allowing researchers to relate fine-grained activity patterns. RSA is an innovative approach used to compare neural representations across individuals, and it can reveal the representation of stimuli in the brain.

Absolutely, Representation Similarity Analysis (RSA) is a powerful tool that bridges the gap between artificial systems like neural networks and biological systems such as the brain. It enables researchers to systematically compare and understand the representational geometries in these systems.
One of the key strengths of RSA is its flexibility and generality. It can be applied to any kind of representation, whether it be brain activity patterns, behavioral data, or the internal representations of a computational model. This universality allows researchers to compare representations across vastly different domains.
The RSA method primarily involves constructing a representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM) that contains dissimilarity values between all pairs of conditions or stimuli. These dissimilarity values provide a quantified measure of how distinct the representations of different stimuli are in a given system. By comparing these RDMs across different systems (e.g., a biological brain and an artificial neural network), we can gain insights into how similarly (or differently) these systems perceive and process information.
Moreover, by linking the representational geometries with behavioral data, RSA allows us to understand how differences in representation might translate to differences in behavior. This can be particularly important when trying to design artificial systems that can mimic human-like perception and cognition.
Despite its many strengths, it's important to note that RSA is a correlational method and cannot provide direct evidence about the causal mechanisms underlying the observed representations. Nonetheless, when used in conjunction with other methods, RSA offers a powerful way to explore the complex landscape of information representation in both biological and artificial systems.

Absolutely, these methods offer valuable insights into how the brain processes visual information, from basic pattern recognition to more complex object identification and categorization. Let's elaborate a little more on these methods:
Combined neuroimaging methods: As you've mentioned, combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with other techniques like electroencephalography (EEG) offers a more comprehensive look into brain activity. fMRI provides high spatial resolution, allowing us to identify which areas of the brain are active during certain tasks, while EEG offers superior temporal resolution, letting us see when these activations occur. Combining these methods provides a more complete picture of the dynamics of visual processing.
Magnetic Source Imaging (MSI): MSI measures the magnetic fields produced by electrical activity in the brain. Like EEG, MSI has excellent temporal resolution, but it also offers better spatial resolution than EEG. This makes it useful for localizing the source of brain activity, which can be especially helpful in diagnosing conditions like epilepsy or studying the spatial organization of visual processing.
Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA): As discussed, RSA offers a way to compare and contrast the way different systems (biological or artificial) represent and process information. By comparing these representational geometries, we can gain a better understanding of the commonalities and differences between these systems, and also link these representations to behavior.
Deep Learning Networks: These artificial neural networks are capable of learning complex patterns and representations, making them highly useful in tasks involving visual recognition. They offer a way to study how layered, hierarchical processing (similar to what's seen in the brain) can contribute to object recognition and other aspects of visual perception.
Each method has its strengths and limitations, and choosing the right one depends on the research question at hand. Using a combination of these techniques can often provide the most comprehensive insights. The continual development and refinement of these methods will undoubtedly lead to even deeper understandings of visual perception in the future.

Representation Similarity Analysis for Efficient Task taxonomy & Transfer Learning
Kshitij Dwivedi, Gemma Roig
Download PDF
Transfer learning is widely used in deep neural network models when there are few labeled examples available. The common approach is to take a pre-trained network in a similar task and finetune the model parameters. This is usually done blindly without a pre-selection from a set of pre-trained models, or by finetuning a set of models trained on different tasks and selecting the best performing one by cross-validation. We address this problem by proposing an approach to assess the relationship between visual tasks and their task-specific models. Our method uses Representation Similarity Analysis (RSA), which is commonly used to find a correlation between neuronal responses from brain data and models. With RSA we obtain a similarity score among tasks by computing correlations between models trained on different tasks. Our method is efficient as it requires only pre-trained models, and a few images with no further training. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method for generating task taxonomy on Taskonomy dataset. We next evaluate the relationship of RSA with the transfer learning performance on Taskonomy tasks and a new task: Pascal VOC semantic segmentation. Our results reveal that models trained on tasks with higher similarity score show higher transfer learning performance. Surprisingly, the best transfer learning result for Pascal VOC semantic segmentation is not obtained from the pre-trained model on semantic segmentation, probably due to the domain differences, and our method successfully selects the high performing models.

The paper "Representation Similarity Analysis for Efficient Task Taxonomy & Transfer Learning" by Kshitij Dwivedi and Gemma Roig, submitted on 26th April 2019, explores the use of Representation Similarity Analysis (RSA) in the context of transfer learning in deep neural network models. Transfer learning is commonly employed when there are limited labeled examples available. The typical approach involves taking a pre-trained network on a similar task and fine-tuning its parameters blindly or selecting the best-performing model from a set of pre-trained models through cross-validation.
The authors propose a novel approach using RSA to assess the relationship between visual tasks and their task-specific models. RSA is a technique commonly used to find correlations between neuronal responses from brain data and models. In this context, RSA is used to compute similarity scores among tasks by measuring correlations between models trained on different tasks. The method is efficient, requiring only pre-trained models and a few images with no further training.
The effectiveness and efficiency of this approach are demonstrated through experiments on the Taskonomy dataset, where it generates task taxonomy. Furthermore, the relationship between RSA and transfer learning performance is evaluated for Taskonomy tasks and a new task: Pascal VOC semantic segmentation. The results indicate that models trained on tasks with higher similarity scores exhibit higher transfer learning performance. Interestingly, the best transfer learning result for Pascal VOC semantic segmentation is not obtained from the pre-trained model on semantic segmentation, likely due to domain differences. The proposed method successfully selects the high-performing models for transfer learning.
In summary, the paper introduces an innovative approach using RSA to assess the relationship between visual tasks and their models for efficient transfer learning in deep neural networks. The results highlight the importance of task similarity in transfer learning performance and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in selecting high-performing models for specific tasks.
