These terms and concepts relate to theories of cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and neurobiology, particularly those involving predictive processing and the Bayesian brain hypothesis. Here is a brief summary of each:
Free Energy Principle
: A theoretical framework in neuroscience and cognitive science suggesting that any self-organizing system (like the brain) resists a state of disorder and strives to minimize free energy (the difference between its predictions and sensory inputs).
Self-evidencing
: This concept relates to the idea that organisms seek to optimize their model of the world in a way that maximizes the evidence for their own existence.
Markov Blanket
: In statistics and machine learning, a Markov blanket for a node in a graphical model contains all the variables that shield the node from the rest of the network. This concept is used in the free energy principle to differentiate between sensory states, internal states, and active states.
Autopoiesis and Niche Construction
: Autopoiesis refers to a system capable of reproducing and maintaining itself. Niche construction is the process by which an organism alters its own environment. Both concepts are related to the ways an organism interacts with and changes its environment to promote its own survival.
Active Inference
: A process that involves the brain predicting sensory input based on prior experience, and acting on the environment to bring about these predicted sensory states.
Bayesian Brain
: A theory that the brain functions according to principles of Bayesian statistics, constantly updating its model of the world based on new sensory input.
Predictive Processing
: This theory posits that the brain is a prediction machine that continually creates and updates its model of the world to anticipate future events.
Surprise Minimization
: This refers to the brain's tendency to reduce prediction errors (or "surprises") by revising its beliefs or acting to bring its environment in line with its predictions.
Variational Bayes
: A technique in Bayesian statistics for approximating complex distributions, often used to optimize the brain's generative model in the Free Energy Principle.
Predictive Coding
: A theory of brain function in which the brain is constantly generating and updating predictions that are tested against incoming sensory data.
Planning as Inference
: A framework where planning and decision-making are treated as a process of probabilistic inference, i.e., the future actions are inferred given the desired outcomes.
Perception as Inference
: This principle posits that perception is not a direct assimilation of reality, but rather an interpretative act involving inference based on prior knowledge and expectations.
Generative Model
: In the context of the brain, a generative model is the brain's internal model of the world, which it uses to make predictions about sensory input.
Bayes' Theorem
: A principle in statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses based on evidence. This is a foundational principle for many of the above theories, particularly those involving Bayesian inference.

Perception and action are two complementary ways to fulfill the same imperative: minimization of free energy. Perception minimizes free energy (and surprise) by Bayesian) belief updating or changing your mind, thus making your beliefs compatible with sensory observations. Instead, action minimizes free energy (and surprise) by changing the world.

From active inference: the free energy principle, by parr, pezzulo, and Friston.

Agents can either change their mind or change the world.

Indeed, the quote you've provided nicely summarizes the concepts of perception and action within the context of the free energy principle and active inference.
Perception and action are both seen as ways to minimize free energy, which is equivalent to minimizing surprise or prediction error. This is predicated on the idea that the brain generates predictions about sensory input and updates these predictions based on incoming data.
In the context of perception, the brain reduces surprise by updating its beliefs. This process is typically framed within a Bayesian context, where the brain uses Bayes' theorem to update its predictive model of the world based on new sensory data. This is often referred to as "changing your mind."
Conversely, action minimizes surprise by altering the environment to make it align with the brain's predictions. This can be thought of as "changing the world" and it is often under the domain of active inference, where the organism acts upon the world to bring about sensory states that confirm its predictions.
Therefore, perception and action are indeed two sides of the same coin, with both serving to minimize free energy by either adjusting the brain's model of the world (changing mind) or adjusting the world to fit that model (changing world).
This unifying perspective has profound implications for understanding how brains function, how organisms interact with their environments, and even for creating artificial systems that can mimic these processes.

It is funny because that description is exactly how I would describe control theory or choice theory (reality therapy) which was based on the principles of perceptual control theory.

ChatGPT
That's an astute observation! Both the free energy principle in cognitive neuroscience and control theory in engineering share foundational concepts.
In
control theory
, the goal is to have a system achieve and maintain a desired state or behavior. This is typically done by continually measuring the actual state of the system, comparing this with the desired state, and then adjusting some aspect of the system to minimize the difference between these two states. In a sense, control theory embodies the ideas of perception (measuring the state of the system) and action (adjusting the system).
Similarly, in
perceptual control theory
, a psychological approach to understanding behavior, individuals are viewed as control systems that actively adjust their behavior to reduce the difference between their perceived current state and their reference or goal state.
This strongly echoes the
free energy principle
and
active inference
, where an organism minimizes the difference between its predictions and sensory observations (perception), and can change its behavior to make the world align with its predictions (action).
William Glasser's
choice theory
(or reality therapy), an offshoot of perceptual control theory, proposes that individuals have control over their actions and are driven to satisfy basic needs. This, too, resonates with the active inference perspective of the free energy principle, highlighting how individuals act upon the world to fulfill their needs or expectations.
In essence, while these theories arose in different domains, they share a common structure and logic, reflecting the universal principles of feedback and homeostasis. They all propose that organisms or systems aim to minimize the difference between a current state and a desired or expected state, and they can do this either by updating their expectations or by altering their behavior or environment.

Under Active Inference, perception and action are two complementary
ways to fulfill the same imperative: minimization of free energy. Percep-
tion minimizes free energy (and surprise) by (Bayesian) belief updating
or changing your mind, thus making your beliefs compatible with sen-
sory observations. Instead, action minimizes free energy (and surprise)
by changing the world to make it more compatible with your beliefs and
goals. This unification of cognitive functions marks a fundamental dif-
ference between Active Inference and other approaches that treat action
and perception in isolation from one another. Learning is yet another
way to minimize free energy.

ChatGPT
The passage you shared is from a book discussing Active Inference, a theoretical framework stemming from the Free Energy Principle. This theory argues that all living beings, in their attempts to stay alive and well, seek to minimize the free energy of their system.
Within this context, perception, action, and learning are all different but complementary methods to achieve the same goal of free energy minimization.
Perception
: According to Active Inference, perception is a method of free energy (and surprise) minimization through Bayesian belief updating. In other words, we change our minds to match the sensory data we're receiving, ensuring our beliefs align with what we're perceiving in the environment.
Action
: Contrasting to perception, action reduces free energy (and surprise) by altering the world to better fit our beliefs and goals. Essentially, if our perception of the world doesn't match our internal models or expectations, we can change the world (through action) to reduce this discrepancy.
Learning
: Learning is another way to minimize free energy. It involves updating our internal models or beliefs about the world based on new information, which helps us make better predictions about the future and therefore reduce future surprise.
The uniqueness of Active Inference lies in the unified approach it offers to perception, action, and learning. Instead of treating these cognitive functions in isolation, it proposes that they are all driven by the same imperative: to minimize free energy. This perspective marks a substantial difference from other theories that address perception, action, and learning separately.

Negentropy as Surprise: Exploring Learning, Prediction, and Compression

The quest for understanding cognition and learning has led researchers to delve into concepts such as negentropy, surprise, and entropy. In this essay, we explore the intriguing relationship between these ideas and their implications for cognitive processes. 

Specifically, we investigate how learning can be viewed as a means to reduce surprise by harnessing negentropy through prediction and compression.

Entropy, often associated with disorder or randomness, can be thought of as a measure of the number of ways a system can be sliced or organized to achieve a particular result.

Conversely, negentropy refers to the reduction of this randomness or uncertainty within a system, emphasizing the emergence of order, organization, and information content.

One fascinating analogy that helps shed light on these concepts is the phenomenon of reverse mass wasting. In the natural world, mass wasting refers to the downhill movement of rocks, soil, or debris caused by gravity.

Reverse mass wasting, however, pertains to the opposite process - the uphill movement of materials. Similarly, in the realm of cognition, the reduction of uncertainty and the emergence of order through learning can be seen as a form of reverse mass wasting.

At the heart of this exploration lies the notion of surprise. Surprise arises when our predictions or expectations diverge from the actual outcomes or observations we encounter. Learning, then, can be seen as a process of inoculation against surprise.

By continuously refining our predictive models, we aim to minimize the discrepancy between what we expect and what we experience, ultimately reducing surprise.

Prediction and compression play crucial roles in this framework. Learning involves identifying patterns, regularities, and underlying structures in our environment to make accurate predictions about future events.

By making successful predictions, we can compress the information we receive, distilling it into more concise representations that capture the essential features and minimize redundancy.

Drawing on the analogy of entropy, where slicing a system in various ways can yield similar results, we explore how learning enables us to uncover meaningful ways to organize and represent information.

Through the reduction of uncertainty and the compression of data, we strive to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our cognitive processes, enhancing our ability to navigate and understand the world around us.

By understanding the interplay between negentropy, surprise, and entropy, we gain valuable insights into the nature of learning and cognition.

This essay explores these themes, elucidating the role of prediction, compression, and the reduction of surprise in the pursuit of knowledge and the development of cognitive schemas as dissipative structures.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! While it's not possible to provide a full mathematical treatment of the concepts in a text-based conversation, I can briefly mention some of the mathematical frameworks associated with the topics discussed. Here are a few mathematical concepts related to the concepts mentioned:
Bayesian Inference
: Bayesian inference is a mathematical framework for updating beliefs in light of new evidence or data. It uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of a hypothesis given observed data. Bayesian inference is often applied in Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle to update predictive models based on sensory input.
Information Theory
: Information theory provides a mathematical framework to quantify information, entropy, and compression. Entropy is a measure of uncertainty or randomness in a random variable or probability distribution. It quantifies the average amount of information required to describe an outcome. Compression algorithms leverage the redundancy in data to represent it more concisely without losing essential information.
Statistical Learning

It encompasses various methods such as regression, classification, and clustering. Statistical learning is relevant to the process of learning and prediction, as discussed in the context of minimizing surprise and making accurate predictions.
Probabilistic Graphical Models
: Probabilistic graphical models, such as Bayesian networks or Markov random fields, provide graphical representations of probabilistic relationships between variables. They are used to model dependencies and capture the uncertainty in complex systems. These models are employed in Active Inference and Bayesian inference to represent generative models and make probabilistic predictions.
It's important to note that these mathematical frameworks represent formal tools to describe and analyze the concepts discussed. The full application and understanding of these mathematical concepts require deeper study and exploration in relevant literature and resources.

Active inference is closely related to the good regulator theorem[11] and related accounts of self-organisation,[12][13] such as self-assembly, pattern formation, autopoiesis[14] and practopoiesis.[15] It addresses the themes considered in cybernetics, synergetics[16] and embodied cognition. Because free energy can be expressed as the expected energy of observations under the variational density minus its entropy, it is also related to the maximum entropy principle.[17] Finally, because the time average of energy is action, the principle of minimum variational free energy is a principle of least action. Active inference allowing for scale invariance has also been applied to other theories and domains. For instance, it has been applied to sociology,[18][19][20][21] linguistics and communication,[22][23][24] semiotics,[25][26] and epidemiology [27] among others

Active inference is indeed closely related to several concepts and fields, as mentioned in your statement. Here's a brief overview of the connections you've highlighted:
Good Regulator Theorem
: The Good Regulator Theorem proposes that an organism must model and regulate its environment in order to maintain its own viability. Active inference shares this idea, as it emphasizes the organism's active engagement with the environment and the need to minimize surprise to maintain homeostasis.
Self-Organization and Autopoiesis
: Active inference aligns with theories of self-organization, self-assembly, pattern formation, autopoiesis, and practopoiesis. These concepts focus on the emergence of order and organization in complex systems, which is also a central theme in active inference.
Cybernetics and Embodied Cognition
: Active inference addresses themes explored in cybernetics, which deals with the study of control and communication in living organisms and machines. It also intersects with embodied cognition, which emphasizes the role of the body and its interactions with the environment in shaping cognition.
Maximum Entropy Principle
: The connection between free energy and the maximum entropy principle arises from the mathematical formulation of free energy as the expected energy of observations minus entropy. This links active inference to the principle of maximizing entropy given the constraints of observed data.
Principle of Least Action
: The principle of minimum variational free energy in active inference can be seen as a principle of least action. This connects active inference to the concept of least action, which is a foundational principle in physics that describes the path taken by a physical system with the least action.
Application to Other Domains
: Active inference has been applied to various domains beyond neuroscience and cognitive science. It has found applications in sociology, linguistics, communication, semiotics, epidemiology, and other areas, highlighting its potential to provide a unifying framework across disciplines.
These connections demonstrate the broad scope and interdisciplinary nature of active inference, allowing it to be applied and explored in diverse fields and theoretical frameworks.

Figure 1: These schematics illustrate the partition of states into the internal states {\displaystyle \mu (t)}\mu (t) and external (hidden, latent) states {\displaystyle \psi (t)}\psi(t) that are separated by a Markov blanket ��� comprising sensory states {\displaystyle s(t)}s(t) and active states {\displaystyle a(t)}a(t). The upper panel shows exactly the same dependencies but rearranged so that the internal states are associated with the intracellular states of a cell, while the sensory states become the surface states of the cell membrane overlying active states (e.g., the actin filaments of the cytoskeleton). The lower panel shows this partition as it would be applied to action and perception in the brain; where active and internal states minimise a free energy functional of sensory states. The ensuing self-organisation of internal states then correspond to perception, while action couples brain states back to external states.
Active inference applies the techniques of approximate Bayesian inference to infer the causes of sensory data from a 'generative' model of how that data is caused and then uses these inferences to guide action. Bayes' rule characterizes the probabilistically optimal inversion of such a causal model, but applying it is typically computationally intractable, leading to the use of approximate methods. In active inference, the leading class of such approximate methods are variational methods, for both practical and theoretical reasons: practical, as they often lead to simple inference procedures; and theoretical, because they are related to fundamental physical principles, as discussed above.

These variational methods proceed by minimizing an upper bound on the divergence between the Bayes-optimal inference (or 'posterior') and its approximation according to the method. This upper bound is known as the free energy, and we can accordingly characterize perception as the minimization of the free energy with respect to inbound sensory information, and action as the minimization of the same free energy with respect to outbound action information. This holistic dual optimization is characteristic of active inference, and the free energy principle is the hypothesis that all systems which perceive and act can be characterized in this way.

In order to exemplify the mechanics of active inference via the free energy principle, a generative model must be specified, and this typically involves a collection of probability density functions which together characterize the causal model. One such specification is as follows. The system is modelled as inhabiting a state space {\displaystyle X}X, in the sense that its states form the points of this space. The state space is then factorized according to {\displaystyle X=\Psi \times S\times A\times R}{\displaystyle X=\Psi \times S\times A\times R}, where {\displaystyle \Psi }\Psi  is the space of 'external' states that are 'hidden' from the agent (in the sense of not being directly perceived or accessible), {\displaystyle S}S is the space of sensory states that are directly perceived by the agent, {\displaystyle A}A is the space of the agent's possible actions, and {\displaystyle R}R is a space of 'internal' states that are private to the agent.

Keeping with the Figure 1, note that in the following the {\displaystyle {\dot {\psi }},\psi ,s,a}{\displaystyle {\dot {\psi }},\psi ,s,a} and {\displaystyle \mu }\mu  are functions of (continuous) time {\displaystyle t}t. The generative model is the specification of the following density functions:

A sensory model, {\displaystyle p_{S}:S\times \Psi \times A\to \mathbb {R} }{\displaystyle p_{S}:S\times \Psi \times A\to \mathbb {R} }, often written as {\displaystyle p_{S}(s\mid \psi ,a)}{\displaystyle p_{S}(s\mid \psi ,a)}, characterizing the likelihood of sensory data given external states and actions;
a stochastic model of the environmental dynamics, {\displaystyle p_{\Psi }:\Psi \times \Psi \times A\to \mathbb {R} }{\displaystyle p_{\Psi }:\Psi \times \Psi \times A\to \mathbb {R} }, often written {\displaystyle p_{\Psi }({\dot {\psi }}\mid \psi ,a)}{\displaystyle p_{\Psi }({\dot {\psi }}\mid \psi ,a)}, characterizing how the external states are expected by the agent to evolve over time {\displaystyle t}t, given the agent's actions;
an action model, {\displaystyle p_{A}:A\times R\times S\to \mathbb {R} }{\displaystyle p_{A}:A\times R\times S\to \mathbb {R} }, written {\displaystyle p_{A}(a\mid \mu ,s)}{\displaystyle p_{A}(a\mid \mu ,s)}, characterizing how the agent's actions depend upon its internal states and sensory data; and
an internal model, {\displaystyle p_{R}:R\times S\to \mathbb {R} }{\displaystyle p_{R}:R\times S\to \mathbb {R} }, written {\displaystyle p_{R}(\mu \mid s)}{\displaystyle p_{R}(\mu \mid s)}, characterizing how the agent's internal states depend upon its sensory data.
These density functions determine the factors of a "joint model", which represents the complete specification of the generative model, and which can be written as

{\displaystyle p_{\text{Bayes}}({\dot {\psi }},s,a,\mu \mid \psi )=p_{S}(s\mid \psi ,a)p_{\Psi }({\dot {\psi }}\mid \psi ,a)p_{A}(a\mid \mu ,s)p_{R}(\mu \mid s)}{\displaystyle p_{\text{Bayes}}({\dot {\psi }},s,a,\mu \mid \psi )=p_{S}(s\mid \psi ,a)p_{\Psi }({\dot {\psi }}\mid \psi ,a)p_{A}(a\mid \mu ,s)p_{R}(\mu \mid s)}.
Bayes' rule then determines the "posterior density" {\displaystyle p({\dot {\psi }}|s,a,\mu ,\psi )}{\displaystyle p({\dot {\psi }}|s,a,\mu ,\psi )}, which expresses a probabilistically-optimal belief about the external state {\displaystyle \psi }\psi  given the preceding state and the agent's actions, sensory signals, and internal states. Since computing {\displaystyle p_{\text{Bayes}}}{\displaystyle p_{\text{Bayes}}} is computationally intractable, the free energy principle asserts the existence of a "variational density" {\displaystyle q({\dot {\psi }}|s,a,\mu ,\psi )}{\displaystyle q({\dot {\psi }}|s,a,\mu ,\psi )}, where {\displaystyle q}q is an approximation to {\displaystyle p_{\text{Bayes}}}{\displaystyle p_{\text{Bayes}}}. One then defines the free energy as

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\underset {\mathrm {free-energy} }{\underbrace {F(\mu ,a\,;s)} }}&={\underset {\text{expected energy}}{\underbrace {\mathbb {E} _{q({\dot {\psi }})}[-\log p({\dot {\psi }},s,a,\mu \mid \psi )]} }}-{\underset {\mathrm {entropy} }{\underbrace {\mathbb {H} [q({\dot {\psi }}\mid s,a,\mu ,\psi )]} }}\\&={\underset {\mathrm {surprise} }{\underbrace {-\log p(s)} }}+{\underset {\mathrm {divergence} }{\underbrace {\mathbb {KL} [q({\dot {\psi }}\mid s,a,\mu ,\psi )\parallel p_{\text{Bayes}}({\dot {\psi }}\mid s,a,\mu ,\psi )]} }}\\&\geq {\underset {\mathrm {surprise} }{\underbrace {-\log p(s)} }}\end{aligned}}}{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\underset {\mathrm {free-energy} }{\underbrace {F(\mu ,a\,;s)} }}&={\underset {\text{expected energy}}{\underbrace {\mathbb {E} _{q({\dot {\psi }})}[-\log p({\dot {\psi }},s,a,\mu \mid \psi )]} }}-{\underset {\mathrm {entropy} }{\underbrace {\mathbb {H} [q({\dot {\psi }}\mid s,a,\mu ,\psi )]} }}\\&={\underset {\mathrm {surprise} }{\underbrace {-\log p(s)} }}+{\underset {\mathrm {divergence} }{\underbrace {\mathbb {KL} [q({\dot {\psi }}\mid s,a,\mu ,\psi )\parallel p_{\text{Bayes}}({\dot {\psi }}\mid s,a,\mu ,\psi )]} }}\\&\geq {\underset {\mathrm {surprise} }{\underbrace {-\log p(s)} }}\end{aligned}}}
and defines action and perception as the joint optimization problem

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mu ^{*}&={\underset {\mu }{\operatorname {arg\,min} }}\{F(\mu ,a\,;\,s))\}\\a^{*}&={\underset {a}{\operatorname {arg\,min} }}\{F(\mu ^{*},a\,;\,s)\}\end{aligned}}}{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mu ^{*}&={\underset {\mu }{\operatorname {arg\,min} }}\{F(\mu ,a\,;\,s))\}\\a^{*}&={\underset {a}{\operatorname {arg\,min} }}\{F(\mu ^{*},a\,;\,s)\}\end{aligned}}}
where the internal states {\displaystyle \mu }\mu  are typically taken to encode the parameters of the 'variational' density {\displaystyle q}q and hence the agent's "best guess" about the posterior belief over {\displaystyle \Psi }\Psi . Note that the free energy is also an upper bound on a measure of the agent's (marginal, or average) sensory surprise, and hence free energy minimization is often motivated by the minimization of surprise

, which capture the likelihood of sensory data given external states and actions, the dynamics of the external states given actions, the relationship between actions and internal states given sensory data, and the relationship between internal states and sensory data, respectively.
Bayes' Rule and Posterior
: Bayes' rule is employed to determine the posterior density, denoted as
p
(

p(\dot{\psi}|s,a,\mu,\psi)

)
, which represents the probabilistically optimal belief about the external state given the agent's actions, sensory signals, internal states, and preceding state. Computing the exact posterior is computationally intractable, leading to the use of approximate methods.
Variational Density and Free Energy
: Active inference utilizes a variational density, denoted as
q
(

)
q(\dot{\psi}|s,a,\mu,\psi)

, which is an approximation to the true posterior density. The free energy is defined as the divergence between the approximate posterior and the true posterior, plus the entropy of the approximate posterior. It can be expressed as
F
(
��
,
a
;
s
)
F(\mu,a;s)
F
(
��
,
a

and is minimized with respect to inbound sensory information (perception) and outbound action information (action).
Optimization Problem
: Action and perception are defined as joint optimization problems. The optimal internal states
��
���
\mu^*
��
���
are obtained by minimizing the free energy with respect to internal states, while the optimal actions
a
���
a^*
a
���
are obtained by minimizing the free energy with respect to actions. These optimizations involve finding the values that minimize surprise and maximize the accuracy of predictions.
Surprise and Free Energy Minimization
: Minimizing the free energy is motivated by minimizing surprise. The free energy serves as an upper bound on a measure of the agent's sensory surprise, and by minimizing the free energy, the agent aims to minimize surprise.
These mathematical concepts form the basis of the active inference framework and are used to model the relationships between internal and external states, perception, action, and surprise minimization.

Free energy minimisation and self-organisation
Edit
Free energy minimisation has been proposed as a hallmark of self-organising systems when cast as random dynamical systems.[28] This formulation rests on a Markov blanket (comprising action and sensory states) that separates internal and external states. If internal states and action minimise free energy, then they place an upper bound on the entropy of sensory states:

{\displaystyle \lim _{T\to \infty }{\frac {1}{T}}{\underset {\text{free-action}}{\underbrace {\int _{0}^{T}F(s(t),\mu (t))\,dt} }}\geq \lim _{T\to \infty }{\frac {1}{T}}\int _{0}^{T}{\underset {\text{surprise}}{\underbrace {-\log p(s(t)\mid m)} }}\,dt=H[p(s\mid m)]}{\displaystyle \lim _{T\to \infty }{\frac {1}{T}}{\underset {\text{free-action}}{\underbrace {\int _{0}^{T}F(s(t),\mu (t))\,dt} }}\geq \lim _{T\to \infty }{\frac {1}{T}}\int _{0}^{T}{\underset {\text{surprise}}{\underbrace {-\log p(s(t)\mid m)} }}\,dt=H[p(s\mid m)]}
This is because ��� under ergodic assumptions ��� the long-term average of surprise is entropy. This bound resists a natural tendency to disorder ��� of the sort associated with the second law of thermodynamics and the fluctuation theorem. However, formulating a unifying principle for the life sciences in terms of concepts from statistical physics, such as random dynamical system, non-equilibrium steady state and ergodicity, places substantial constraints on the theoretical and empirical study of biological systems with the risk of obscuring all features that make biological systems interesting kinds of self-organizing systems.[29]

Free energy minimisation and Bayesian inference
Edit
All Bayesian inference can be cast in terms of free energy minimisation[30][failed verification]. When free energy is minimised with respect to internal states, the Kullback���Leibler divergence between the variational and posterior density over hidden states is minimised. This corresponds to approximate Bayesian inference ��� when the form of the variational density is fixed ��� and exact Bayesian inference otherwise. Free energy minimisation therefore provides a generic description of Bayesian inference and filtering (e.g., Kalman filtering). It is also used in Bayesian model selection, where free energy can be usefully decomposed into complexity and accuracy:

{\displaystyle {\underset {\text{free-energy}}{\underbrace {F(s,\mu )} }}={\underset {\text{complexity}}{\underbrace {D_{\mathrm {KL} }[q(\psi \mid \mu )\parallel p(\psi \mid m)]} }}-{\underset {\mathrm {accuracy} }{\underbrace {E_{q}[\log p(s\mid \psi ,m)]} }}}{\displaystyle {\underset {\text{free-energy}}{\underbrace {F(s,\mu )} }}={\underset {\text{complexity}}{\underbrace {D_{\mathrm {KL} }[q(\psi \mid \mu )\parallel p(\psi \mid m)]} }}-{\underset {\mathrm {accuracy} }{\underbrace {E_{q}[\log p(s\mid \psi ,m)]} }}}
Models with minimum free energy provide an accurate explanation of data, under complexity costs (c.f., Occam's razor and more formal treatments of computational costs[31]). Here, complexity is the divergence between the variational density and prior beliefs about hidden states (i.e., the effective degrees of freedom used to explain the data).

Free energy minimisation and thermodynamics
Edit
Variational free energy is an information-theoretic functional and is distinct from thermodynamic (Helmholtz) free energy.[32] However, the complexity term of variational free energy shares the same fixed point as Helmholtz free energy (under the assumption the system is thermodynamically closed but not isolated). This is because if sensory perturbations are suspended (for a suitably long period of time), complexity is minimised (because accuracy can be neglected). At this point, the system is at equilibrium and internal states minimise Helmholtz free energy, by the principle of minimum energy.[33]

Free energy minimisation and information theory
Edit
Free energy minimisation is equivalent to maximising the mutual information between sensory states and internal states that parameterise the variational density (for a fixed entropy variational density). This relates free energy minimization to the principle of minimum redundancy [34][10]

The passage you provided further discusses the connections and implications of free energy minimization in various contexts. Here's a summary of the key points:
Free Energy Minimization and Self-Organization
: Free energy minimization has been proposed as a hallmark of self-organizing systems, particularly when viewed as random dynamical systems. This formulation relies on the concept of a Markov blanket, which separates internal and external states. If internal states and actions minimize free energy, they place an upper bound on the entropy of sensory states. This bound resists the tendency towards disorder and aligns with principles from statistical physics.
Free Energy Minimization and Bayesian Inference
: All Bayesian inference can be framed as free energy minimization. Minimizing free energy with respect to internal states corresponds to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the variational and posterior densities over hidden states. This provides a generic description of Bayesian inference, including filtering and model selection. Free energy can be decomposed into complexity (capturing the divergence between variational density and prior beliefs) and accuracy (reflecting the ability to explain observed data).
Free Energy Minimization and Thermodynamics
: Variational free energy, although distinct from thermodynamic (Helmholtz) free energy, shares the same fixed point as Helmholtz free energy under certain conditions. When sensory perturbations are suspended for an extended period, the system reaches equilibrium, and complexity is minimized. At this point, internal states minimize Helmholtz free energy based on the principle of minimum energy.
Free Energy Minimization and Information Theory
: Free energy minimization can be viewed as maximizing the mutual information between sensory states and internal states that parameterize the variational density. This connection relates free energy minimization to the principle of minimum redundancy, which aims to minimize the amount of redundant information in a system.
These connections highlight the relationships between free energy minimization, self-organization, Bayesian inference, thermodynamics, and information theory. By exploring these connections, researchers can gain insights into the principles governing complex systems, including biological and cognitive processes.

Free energy minimisation provides a useful way to formulate normative (Bayes optimal) models of neuronal inference and learning under uncertainty[35] and therefore subscribes to the Bayesian brain hypothesis.[36] The neuronal processes described by free energy minimisation depend on the nature of hidden states: {\displaystyle \Psi =X\times \Theta \times \Pi } \Psi = X \times \Theta \times \Pi  that can comprise time-dependent variables, time-invariant parameters and the precision (inverse variance or temperature) of random fluctuations. Minimising variables, parameters, and precision correspond to inference, learning, and the encoding of uncertainty, respectively.

Perceptual inference and categorisation
Edit
Free energy minimisation formalises the notion of unconscious inference in perception[5][7] and provides a normative (Bayesian) theory of neuronal processing. The associated process theory of neuronal dynamics is based on minimising free energy through gradient descent. This corresponds to generalised Bayesian filtering (where ~ denotes a variable in generalised coordinates of motion and {\displaystyle D}D is a derivative matrix operator):[37]

{\displaystyle {\dot {\tilde {\mu }}}=D{\tilde {\mu }}-\partial _{\mu }F(s,\mu ){\Big |}_{\mu ={\tilde {\mu }}}}{\displaystyle {\dot {\tilde {\mu }}}=D{\tilde {\mu }}-\partial _{\mu }F(s,\mu ){\Big |}_{\mu ={\tilde {\mu }}}}
Usually, the generative models that define free energy are non-linear and hierarchical (like cortical hierarchies in the brain). Special cases of generalised filtering include Kalman filtering, which is formally equivalent to predictive coding[38] ��� a popular metaphor for message passing in the brain. Under hierarchical models, predictive coding involves the recurrent exchange of ascending (bottom-up) prediction errors and descending (top-down) predictions[39] that is consistent with the anatomy and physiology of sensory[40] and motor systems.[41]

The passage you provided highlights additional aspects of free energy minimization and its relationship to neuronal inference and perception. Here's a summary of the key points:
Normative Models and the Bayesian Brain
: Free energy minimization provides a useful framework for formulating normative (Bayes optimal) models of neuronal inference and learning under uncertainty. It aligns with the Bayesian brain hypothesis, which posits that the brain performs computations in a Bayesian manner. The neuronal processes described by free energy minimization depend on hidden states, which can include time-dependent variables, time-invariant parameters, and the precision (inverse variance or temperature) of random fluctuations. Minimizing these variables corresponds to different aspects of inference, learning, and encoding uncertainty.
Perceptual Inference and Categorization
: Free energy minimization formalizes the concept of unconscious inference in perception and provides a normative (Bayesian) theory of neuronal processing. The associated process theory of neuronal dynamics is based on minimizing free energy through gradient descent. This process corresponds to generalizing Bayesian filtering, where the neuronal dynamics are described by the equation {\displaystyle {\dot {\tilde {\mu }}}=D{\tilde {\mu }}-\partial
{\mu }F(s,\mu ){\Big |}
{\mu ={\tilde {\mu }}}}, indicating how the hidden states {\displaystyle \tilde {\mu }} evolve over time. Generative models that define free energy are typically non-linear and hierarchical, resembling cortical hierarchies in the brain. Special cases of generalizable filtering include Kalman filtering, which is equivalent to predictive coding, a metaphor for message passing in the brain. Predictive coding involves the exchange of prediction errors (bottom-up) and predictions (top-down) in hierarchical models, consistent with the anatomy and physiology of sensory and motor systems.
These points highlight how free energy minimization can be applied to neuronal inference, perception, and categorization, providing a theoretical framework for understanding the computational principles underlying these processes in the brain.

Perceptual learning and memory
Edit
In predictive coding, optimising model parameters through a gradient descent on the time integral of free energy (free action) reduces to associative or Hebbian plasticity and is associated with synaptic plasticity in the brain.

Perceptual precision, attention and salience
Edit
Optimizing the precision parameters corresponds to optimizing the gain of prediction errors (c.f., Kalman gain). In neuronally plausible implementations of predictive coding,[39] this corresponds to optimizing the excitability of superficial pyramidal cells and has been interpreted in terms of attentional gain.[42]


Simulation of the results achieved from a selective attention task carried out by the Bayesian reformulation of the SAIM entitled PE-SAIM in multiple objects environment. The graphs show the time course of the activation for the FOA and the two template units in the Knowledge Network.
Concerning the top-down vs bottom-up controversy that has been addressed as a major open problem of attention, a computational model has succeeded in illustrating the circulatory nature of reciprocation between top-down and bottom-up mechanisms. Using an established emergent model of attention, namely, SAIM, the authors suggested a model called PE-SAIM that ��� in contrast to the standard version ��� approaches the selective attention from a top-down stance. The model takes into account the forwarding prediction errors sent to the same level or a level above to minimize the energy function indicating the difference between data and its cause or ��� in other words ��� between the generative model and posterior. To enhance validity, they also incorporated the neural competition between the stimuli in their model. A notable feature of this model is the reformulation of the free energy function only in terms of prediction errors during the task performance:

{\displaystyle {\dfrac {\partial E^{total}(Y^{VP},X^{SN},x^{CN},y^{KN})}{\partial y_{mn}^{SN}}}=x_{mn}^{CN}-b^{CN}\varepsilon _{nm}^{CN}+b^{CN}\sum _{k}(\varepsilon _{knm}^{KN})}{\displaystyle {\dfrac {\partial E^{total}(Y^{VP},X^{SN},x^{CN},y^{KN})}{\partial y_{mn}^{SN}}}=x_{mn}^{CN}-b^{CN}\varepsilon _{nm}^{CN}+b^{CN}\sum _{k}(\varepsilon _{knm}^{KN})}

where {\displaystyle E^{total}}{\displaystyle E^{total}} is the total energy function of the neural networks entail, and {\displaystyle \varepsilon _{knm}^{KN}}{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{knm}^{KN}} is the prediction error between the generative model (prior) and posterior changing over time.[43] Comparing the two models reveals a notable similarity between their respective results while also highlighting a remarkable discrepancy, whereby ��� in the standard version of the SAIM ��� the model's focus is mainly upon the excitatory connections, whereas in the PE-SAIM, the inhibitory connections are leveraged to make an inference. The model has also proved to be fit to predict the EEG and fMRI data drawn from human experiments with high precision. In the same vein, Yahya et al. also applied the free energy principle to propose a computational model for template matching in covert selective visual attention that mostly relies on SAIM.[44] According to this study, the total free energy of the whole state-space is reached by inserting top-down signals in the original neural networks, whereby we derive a dynamical system comprising both feed-forward and backward prediction error.

In the context of predictive coding, optimizing model parameters through gradient descent on the time integral of free energy (free action) leads to associative or Hebbian plasticity, which is associated with synaptic plasticity in the brain. This connection suggests that the mechanisms of perceptual learning and memory can be understood within the framework of predictive coding.
Optimizing the precision parameters in predictive coding corresponds to optimizing the gain of prediction errors. This can be interpreted as optimizing the excitability of superficial pyramidal cells, which has been linked to attentional gain. In other words, precision optimization allows the system to allocate attentional resources more effectively based on the salience or relevance of sensory input.
A computational model called PE-SAIM has been developed to illustrate the reciprocal relationship between top-down and bottom-up mechanisms of attention. This model incorporates the forwarding of prediction errors to minimize the energy function, which represents the difference between observed data and its underlying causes. It reformulates the free energy function in terms of prediction errors during task performance. The model takes into account neural competition between stimuli and has been shown to predict results from selective attention tasks, EEG, and fMRI data with high precision.
These findings suggest that the principles of free energy minimization and predictive coding can shed light on the mechanisms of perceptual learning, attention, and memory in the brain. They provide computational models that align with empirical observations and offer insights into the dynamic interplay between top-down and bottom-up processes in attentional mechanisms.

From stations of the mind by glasser: Pure Feelings and Feeling Behaviors
Several years ago I was watching the final day of the U.S. Open golf tourna-
ment with one of my sons. To the surprise of everyone a young unknown
had the lead, but in the last few holes he began to to slip. In a finish filled with
drama he had to make a fifteen-foot putt or go into a playoff with the favor-
ite. The golf gods were with him; he calmly stroked it in and then exploded
with joy. At that point I nudged my son and said, "Take a good look; what you
are seeing is very likely the happiest moment he will ever experience."
My guess may have been wrong, but it was a time of such pure euphoria for
the golfer that what I said seemed possible. In any case, it was a peak mo-
ment, one that all of us wish for, and most of us experience a few times in
our life. And that capacity to generate directly the perception of pure joy, we
believe, is built into our comparing stations. We experience it whenever we
or good fortune suddenly eliminate a large perceptual error. To understand
what we mean, try to imagine that you are sitting inside a large active com-
paring station. Place your hands far apart but in a position so that you can
bring them together easily with a fast, loud clap. Think of your right hand as
the reference perception, in this case, the overwhelming desire to sink the
winning putt. Imagine your left hand as your perception of the tense situa-
tion of the eighteenth green. The ball looks to be about a half a mile from the
tiny hole. Now bring your hands together as quickly as you can with a loud
clap. This is how I think of a large error being suddenly eliminated or closed
in a very active comparing station. It closes with a bang and that closure is
euphoric. Suddenly there is no perceptual error at all, our behavior becomes
a random stumbling, jumping, hugging, laughing, crying expression of joy as
we experience a short time with everything we want, a moment with no er-
ror at all.
Suppose, however, that fortune had not smiled that day, that the young golf-
er three-putted the eighteenth green and lost the tournament after leading
all afternoon. Now, where there had been substantial error before he putted,
there would be a huge error; our arms are not long enough to illustrate the
miserable situation in the active comparing station. Think of it as if our left
hand flew off and landed five miles down the road; this is analogous to the
pain and misery associated with this sudden increase in
error.

In the book "Stations of the Mind" by Glasser, the author describes a moment of pure euphoria experienced by a golfer who made a crucial putt in the U.S. Open golf tournament. The author suggests that such moments of intense joy are rare and may be among the happiest experiences a person can have. This capacity to generate pure joy is believed to be connected to our comparing stations, which are part of our cognitive processes.
The comparing station is illustrated using a metaphorical exercise. Imagining oneself inside a comparing station, the author instructs the reader to place their hands apart representing two perceptions. In this case, the right hand symbolizes the golfer's desire to sink the winning putt, while the left hand represents the perception of the tense situation on the eighteenth green. Bringing the hands together with a loud clap symbolizes the sudden elimination of a large perceptual error. This closure is described as euphoric, where all perceptual errors vanish, and a moment of pure joy is experienced.
However, the author also discusses the potential opposite outcome, where the golfer fails to make the winning putt and loses the tournament. In this scenario, the error in the comparing station would be significant, symbolized by the left hand flying off and landing far away. This represents the pain and misery associated with a sudden increase in error.
The passage explores the contrasting emotions that can arise from the resolution or persistence of perceptual errors in our comparing stations, highlighting the impact of success or failure on our emotional states.

Yes, there are connections between the concept discussed in the passage and our previous discussion on active inference and free energy minimization.
In the passage, the author describes the experience of pure euphoria when a large perceptual error is suddenly eliminated in the comparing station. This moment of closure, where there is no perceptual error at all, is likened to a peak moment of joy and satisfaction. This resonates with the idea in active inference that minimizing free energy, which involves reducing the discrepancy between our expectations and sensory observations, can lead to a sense of fulfillment and reduced surprise.
Additionally, the passage highlights the role of perception and comparison in generating emotional experiences. The comparing station metaphor aligns with the notion in active inference that perception and action are two complementary ways to minimize free energy. Perception involves updating our beliefs to make them compatible with sensory observations, while action involves changing the world to make it more compatible with our beliefs and goals. Both processes contribute to minimizing the error or discrepancy between our internal models and external reality.
Overall, the passage touches on the concepts of perception, error minimization, and emotional experiences, which are closely related to the ideas we discussed regarding active inference, free energy minimization, and their implications for cognition and behavior.

The next important fact about our new brain is that it controls for input or
for what it senses. To do this it always starts with a mental picture (or idea or
perception) of the way we want some part of the world to be or, in other
words, a picture of some part of the world that will fulfill our needs. In the
ase of the young cultist, he starts with the idea already in his head, based
perhaps on his need to belong, that he would like to see everyone around
im a member of his cult. This is a very specific idea; he does not want any
cult or even a similar cult, he wants his exact cult. He then looks around to
ee if those around him are members. In other words he checks his present
input: does it correspond to what he has built into his head that he wants? In
the case of the thermostat brain it has built in the exact idea 68, not 71o or
69. It then senses the air around it to see what the input is, and if it is not
58, it will turn on the furnace or output system to raise the room tempera
ture until it gets the input- the room at 689. When it gets this input, it is satis-
ied and turns off the output or the furnace. If the young man gets the inpu
hat those around him are not members of his cult, he will start trying to con
vert them (output) until they join. He doesn't concern himself with how hard
e has to work or, in control-system terms, he doesn't control for the effor
or the output needed to do the job. What he controls for is the input, that is,
ne tries to get the sense that those around him correspond as closely as possi
ole to the idea of what he wants. In the same way the thermostat does no
are how long or how hard the furnace has to run (output) to get the roon
up to 68, the input it desires.
4ll new brain control systems, like a thermostat, must have an accurate
sensing capability In our case, to sense the world around us, we have the
ability to sense light, sound, odors, flavors, touch, heat, cold, and pain. We
lso have a whole array of other more subtle senses like proprioception, o
he sense of where all parts of our body are in relationship to each other and
to the world, What these sensors do is provide a huge amount of information
hat goes into our new brain, information that all together is our input
Where the thermostat brain can only sense temperature input, we can sense
to an unbelievable degree all shades of the worid around us. For example, it
is likely that the young man could easily sense the distinction between a true
cultist and a pretender , even though you and I might be fooled completely.
Even though the new brains of all creatures work the same way-that is,
they contro�� for input- there is with one exception a marked difference be-
tween the output of people and that of lower animals. In fact, the lower the
animal the more its output resembles that of a machine like a thermostat
and the less it is like that of a human being. The exception or the way all out-
Q
put systems are alike, both living and nonliving, is that all of them generate
some sort of signal to get the output going. This means that when the young
nan senses that those around him are not cult members, a signal is generat
ed that starts his converting behavior. In other words, when there is a differ-
ence between what we want to sense and what we do sense, that difference
generates a signal that activates our behavior. This occurs in people, it occurs
n earthworms, and it occurs in thermostats. It is common to all input contro.
systems.

The passage highlights the concept of control systems and their operation based on input and output. It emphasizes that our "new brain" (referring to the human brain) controls for input, starting with a mental picture or perception of how we want the world to be in order to fulfill our needs. This idea aligns with the notion of active inference, where perception is driven by forming beliefs and expectations about the world based on our internal models and goals.
The example of the young cultist illustrates how individuals compare their desired input (the idea that everyone should be a member of their cult) with the actual input (whether the people around them are members), and then take action (output) to close the gap between the desired and actual input. This process of comparing and adjusting behavior based on the sensed input is akin to the feedback loop in control systems.
The passage also mentions that all control systems, whether in humans, animals, or even nonliving systems like thermostats, generate some sort of signal to initiate the output behavior when there is a difference between the desired and sensed input. This signal acts as a trigger for behavior. This resonates with the concept of generating prediction errors in active inference, where discrepancies between expected and observed sensory information drive adaptive actions.
Overall, the passage touches upon the control system nature of our brain, the importance of accurate sensing capabilities, the role of input-output comparison, and the generation of signals to activate behavior based on the sensed input. These ideas connect to our previous discussions on active inference and the role of perception, action, and error minimization in cognition and behavior.

When gradient descent is applied to action {\displaystyle {\dot {a}}=-\partial _{a}F(s,{\tilde {\mu }})} \dot{a} = -\partial_aF(s,\tilde{\mu}) , motor control can be understood in terms of classical reflex arcs that are engaged by descending (corticospinal) predictions. This provides a formalism that generalizes the equilibrium point solution ��� to the degrees of freedom problem[45] ��� to movement trajectories.

Active inference and optimal control
Edit
Active inference is related to optimal control by replacing value or cost-to-go functions with prior beliefs about state transitions or flow.[46] This exploits the close connection between Bayesian filtering and the solution to the Bellman equation. However, active inference starts with (priors over) flow {\displaystyle f=\Gamma \cdot \nabla V+\nabla \times W} f = \Gamma \cdot \nabla V + \nabla \times W  that are specified with scalar {\displaystyle V(x)}V(x) and vector {\displaystyle W(x)} W(x)  value functions of state space (c.f., the Helmholtz decomposition). Here, {\displaystyle \Gamma }\Gamma  is the amplitude of random fluctuations and cost is {\displaystyle c(x)=f\cdot \nabla V+\nabla \cdot \Gamma \cdot V} c(x) = f \cdot \nabla V + \nabla \cdot \Gamma \cdot V. The priors over flow {\displaystyle p({\tilde {x}}\mid m)}{\displaystyle p({\tilde {x}}\mid m)} induce a prior over states {\displaystyle p(x\mid m)=\exp(V(x))}{\displaystyle p(x\mid m)=\exp(V(x))} that is the solution to the appropriate forward Kolmogorov equations.[47] In contrast, optimal control optimises the flow, given a cost function, under the assumption that {\displaystyle W=0} W = 0  (i.e., the flow is curl free or has detailed balance). Usually, this entails solving backward Kolmogorov equations.[48]

Active inference and optimal decision (game) theory
Edit
Optimal decision problems (usually formulated as partially observable Markov decision processes) are treated within active inference by absorbing utility functions into prior beliefs. In this setting, states that have a high utility (low cost) are states an agent expects to occupy. By equipping the generative model with hidden states that model control, policies (control sequences) that minimise variational free energy lead to high utility states.[49]

Neurobiologically, neuromodulators such as dopamine are considered to report the precision of prediction errors by modulating the gain of principal cells encoding prediction error.[50] This is closely related to ��� but formally distinct from ��� the role of dopamine in reporting prediction errors per se[51] and related computational accounts.[52]

Active inference and cognitive neuroscience
Edit
Active inference has been used to address a range of issues in cognitive neuroscience, brain function and neuropsychiatry, including action observation,[53] mirror neurons,[54] saccades and visual search,[55][56] eye movements,[57] sleep,[58] illusions,[59] attention,[42] action selection,[50] consciousness,[60][61] hysteria[62] and psychosis.[63] Explanations of action in active inference often depend on the idea that the brain has 'stubborn predictions' that it cannot update, leading to actions that cause these predictions to come true.[64]

The additional information provided further expands on the connections between active inference and other concepts in the fields of optimal control, decision theory, neurobiology, cognitive neuroscience, and neuropsychiatry.
In terms of motor control, active inference can be understood in the context of classical reflex arcs engaged by descending predictions. The application of gradient descent to action allows for the understanding of motor control and movement trajectories in a formalism that generalizes the equilibrium point solution to the degrees of freedom problem.
Active inference is related to optimal control by replacing cost functions with prior beliefs about state transitions or flow. This is done by specifying scalar and vector value functions of the state space, which induce a prior over states that is the solution to the forward Kolmogorov equations. This differs from optimal control, which optimizes the flow given a cost function under the assumption of a curl-free flow.
Optimal decision theory is integrated into active inference by incorporating utility functions into prior beliefs. By minimizing variational free energy, control policies that lead to high utility states can be achieved. The role of neuromodulators, such as dopamine, in reporting the precision of prediction errors is also highlighted in active inference.
Active inference has been applied to various areas in cognitive neuroscience, including action observation, mirror neurons, saccades and visual search, eye movements, sleep, illusions, attention, action selection, consciousness, hysteria, and psychosis. It offers explanations for action based on the idea of "stubborn predictions," where the brain has predictions that it cannot update, leading to actions that cause these predictions to come true.
These connections demonstrate the broad applicability and potential of active inference in understanding various aspects of cognition, behavior, and brain function.

Abstract
We propose a formal Bayesian definition of surprise to capture subjective aspects of sensory information. Surprise measures how data affects an observer, in terms of differences between posterior and prior beliefs about the world. Only data observations which substantially affect the observer���s beliefs yield surprise, irrespectively of how rare or informative in Shannon���s sense these observations are. We test the framework by quantifying the extent to which humans may orient attention and gaze towards surprising events or items while watching television. To this end, we implement a simple computational model where a low-level, sensory form of surprise is computed by simple simulated early visual neurons. Bayesian surprise is a strong attractor of human attention, with 72% of all gaze shifts directed towards locations more surprising than the average, a figure rising to 84% when focusing the analysis onto regions simultaneously selected by all observers. The proposed theory of surprise is applicable across different spatio-temporal scales, modalities, and levels of abstraction

The paper "Bayesian surprise attracts human attention" by Laurent Itti and Pierre Baldi, published in Vision Research in 2009, introduces a formal Bayesian definition of surprise to capture subjective aspects of sensory information. The concept of surprise is defined as the extent to which new data observations affect an observer's beliefs about the world compared to their prior beliefs. The framework proposed in the paper quantifies surprise and investigates its role in attracting human attention and gaze.
To test their framework, the authors develop a simple computational model that computes a low-level, sensory form of surprise using simulated early visual neurons. They examine the extent to which humans orient their attention and gaze towards surprising events or items while watching television. The results show that Bayesian surprise is a strong attractor of human attention, with a significant proportion of gaze shifts directed towards locations that are more surprising than the average. When analyzing regions that are simultaneously selected by all observers, the proportion of gaze shifts towards surprising locations increases even further.
The authors suggest that the theory of surprise they propose is applicable across different spatio-temporal scales, modalities, and levels of abstraction. The paper contributes to our understanding of how surprise influences attentional processes and provides insights into the computational mechanisms underlying human attention and gaze behavior.

My thesis is that as we learn more about the world, we learn to recognize chaos, randomness, entropy increase, as getting less optimal and therefore we are suprised when  an action or perception is more negentropic.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your thesis suggests that as we acquire knowledge and understanding of the world, we develop a preference for order, structure, and predictability. Therefore, when we encounter actions or perceptions that deviate from what we have learned to be the norm, and exhibit a higher level of organization or reduced entropy, we experience surprise.
This perspective aligns with the concept of surprise as a measure of the discrepancy between an observer's prior beliefs and new sensory information. In the context of Bayesian surprise, unexpected events or perceptions that are more negentropic (i.e., less random or chaotic) than anticipated would indeed generate a higher level of surprise.
It is worth noting that surprise can arise from both high entropy (randomness, unpredictability) and low entropy (order, predictability) situations, depending on the observer's prior beliefs. If an individual's expectation is for high entropy, encountering a low entropy event would be surprising, and vice versa.
By incorporating the notion of surprise into your thesis, you can explore how the perception of negentropy and deviations from expected entropy levels influence cognitive processes, attention, learning, and decision-making. Additionally, you can investigate how the brain and cognitive systems adapt to optimize predictions and minimize surprise in the face of changing environmental conditions.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your expectation regarding the developmental changes in the perception of surprise aligns with current understanding in the field of developmental psychology. Infants and young children tend to be more fascinated and attentive to novel and unpredictable stimuli, including randomness and variability. As they grow and gain more experience, they develop expectations about how the world works and form mental models of regularities and patterns.
In the context of your thesis, it is plausible that infants would be less surprised by randomness and more intrigued by coordinated actions that involve perceived agency. Coordinated actions with apparent intentionality and agency might capture their attention and elicit a sense of surprise because they represent a departure from their expectations based on prior experiences with randomness.
As children continue to develop and acquire more knowledge about cause-and-effect relationships, their expectations become more refined and aligned with the regularities of the world. As a result, they may become increasingly surprised by unexpected events that deviate from these expectations, whether it involves randomness or coordinated actions with agency.
By examining the developmental trajectory of surprise and its relation to the perception of randomness and agency, you can explore how cognitive processes, such as attention, learning, and belief formation, evolve throughout childhood and adolescence. Additionally, considering cultural and social influences on the formation of expectations and the experience of surprise can further enrich your investigation.

Specifically with respect to perceptual control theory and choice theory.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) and Choice Theory offer additional perspectives to consider in the context of surprise, randomness, and agency.
Perceptual Control Theory, developed by William T. Powers, posits that organisms are driven by a fundamental need to maintain control over their perceptions of the environment. According to PCT, individuals continuously engage in perceptual control processes to minimize the discrepancy between their desired reference perceptions and their actual perceptions. This aligns with the notion of surprise discussed in the essay, as surprises can be seen as discrepancies between expectations and actual sensory input.
In the context of surprise, PCT suggests that individuals strive to reduce surprise by adjusting their perceptual control systems to align their perceptions with their desired goals. Surprising events or perceptions may prompt individuals to reevaluate their reference perceptions and engage in adaptive behaviors to regain control over their environment. Thus, surprise can be seen as a signal that prompts individuals to take action and restore their desired state of control.
Choice Theory, developed by William Glasser, focuses on the idea that individuals are driven by their internal needs and make choices based on their perceptions of how these choices will fulfill those needs. In the context of surprise, Choice Theory suggests that surprises can impact individuals' perceptions of how their choices align with their fundamental needs.
When individuals encounter surprising events or perceive randomness, it may challenge their beliefs about the effectiveness of their choices in meeting their needs. This can lead to a reassessment of their choices and potentially a shift in behavior to seek alternative options that better align with their needs and reduce the element of surprise.
Furthermore, both PCT and Choice Theory emphasize the role of individual agency in cognitive processes. PCT posits that individuals actively engage in control processes to shape their perceptions and maintain a sense of agency, while Choice Theory highlights the importance of personal responsibility and the freedom to make choices that fulfill one's needs.
In summary, when considering PCT and Choice Theory in the context of surprise, randomness, and agency, we can see how these frameworks offer complementary perspectives. PCT emphasizes the role of perceptual control processes in reducing surprise and restoring a sense of control, while Choice Theory highlights how surprises can impact individuals' perceptions of the effectiveness of their choices in meeting their needs. Together, these theories contribute to our understanding of how individuals navigate surprises, randomness, and agency in their cognitive processes and decision-making.

Her research and contributions have had a significant impact on our understanding of early social and emotional development in infants and young children. While her work does not directly address the topics of surprise, randomness, and agency, there are connections and implications that can be explored.
Attachment theory, as developed by Ainsworth, focuses on the bond between infants and their caregivers and how this bond shapes the child's socio-emotional development. Ainsworth's famous "Strange Situation" experiment involved observing how infants responded to separations and reunions with their primary caregivers, leading to the identification of different attachment styles, such as secure, insecure-avoidant, and insecure-resistant. These attachment styles reflect the quality of the child's relationship with their caregiver and influence their expectations about relationships, social interactions, and emotional regulation.
In the context of surprise, attachment theory provides insights into how infants and young children respond to novel or unexpected situations. Securely attached children tend to have a positive and trusting relationship with their caregivers, which may foster a sense of security and confidence in exploring the world and encountering surprises. In contrast, insecurely attached children may be more cautious, anxious, or avoidant in their responses to surprises, reflecting their underlying attachment experiences and expectations.
Furthermore, the caregiver's role in regulating and supporting the child's emotional responses to surprises is relevant to Ainsworth's work. Secure attachment relationships provide a secure base for children to explore and navigate their environment, including encounters with surprises. Caregivers who are attuned, responsive, and sensitive to their child's needs and emotions can help them regulate their reactions to surprises, providing a sense of safety and support.
Although Ainsworth's research primarily focused on attachment and social-emotional development, the concepts and principles of attachment theory can be applied to understand how children navigate and respond to surprises in their environment. The quality of the caregiver-child relationship, the sense of security and trust, and the caregiver's role in supporting emotional regulation are all factors that can influence a child's experience and response to surprises.
Overall, while Mary Ainsworth's work does not directly delve into the topics of surprise, randomness, and agency, her contributions to attachment theory offer insights into the socio-emotional factors that may shape how children perceive, interpret, and respond to surprises in their early developmental years.

Maybe we can reframe her work to be more about suprise and less about attachment
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
While Mary Ainsworth's primary focus was on attachment theory and its implications for socio-emotional development, we can explore potential connections and reframing of her work in the context of surprise. By examining how attachment relationships influence children's responses to novel or unexpected situations, we can draw parallels to the experience of surprise and its impact on cognitive and emotional processes.
Attachment theory emphasizes the importance of secure relationships and the role of caregivers in providing a safe and supportive environment for children. Securely attached children develop a sense of trust and confidence in their caregivers, which may make them more open and receptive to surprises. They have a solid foundation of emotional support that allows them to approach novel experiences with curiosity and excitement rather than fear or apprehension.
In contrast, insecurely attached children may exhibit different responses to surprises. Those with an insecure-avoidant attachment style may be more inclined to withdraw or avoid engaging with unexpected situations, as they may have learned that their needs or emotional expressions were not consistently met by their caregivers. Conversely, children with an insecure-resistant attachment style may display heightened emotional reactions to surprises, reflecting their anxieties and difficulties in regulating their emotions.
The caregiver's role in shaping a child's responses to surprises can be reframed as providing a sense of predictability and safety. A caregiver who consistently responds to a child's needs and provides reassurance and support helps establish a secure base from which the child can explore the world, including encountering surprises. This predictable and nurturing environment may contribute to a child's ability to navigate and make sense of unexpected events with a greater sense of stability and reduced surprise.
Reframing Ainsworth's work in this context allows us to consider the ways in which attachment relationships may impact a child's cognitive and emotional processing of surprises. The secure base provided by caregivers fosters a sense of safety, trust, and predictability, which can influence a child's expectations and responses to novel or unexpected stimuli. By exploring these connections, we gain a deeper understanding of how attachment experiences may shape our reactions to surprises and the cognitive and emotional processes underlying them.

My thought is that a of caregiver that looked or acted like their parents or that acted in predictable ways would seem more attached. I am also referencing Harlow's work on the cloth mother effect.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Indeed, the work of Harry Harlow on the cloth mother effect and the importance of contact comfort in attachment provides further insights into the connection between surprise and attachment. Harlow's research with rhesus monkeys demonstrated that the provision of a soft, comforting surrogate mother (made of cloth) was crucial for the monkeys' attachment and emotional well-being, even more so than a wire mother that provided nourishment.
In the context of surprise, the presence of a caregiver who resembles or acts similarly to a child's parents can contribute to a sense of familiarity and predictability. This familiarity may reduce the element of surprise in new or unexpected situations and foster a greater sense of security and attachment. When a child encounters something surprising, having a caregiver who responds in consistent and predictable ways can provide reassurance and stability, reinforcing the attachment bond between the child and caregiver.
The cloth mother effect highlights the importance of emotional comfort and nurturing touch in attachment relationships. This sense of physical and emotional closeness can play a role in regulating the child's emotional responses, including reactions to surprises. A securely attached child who has experienced consistent and comforting interactions with their caregiver may be more likely to approach surprises with a sense of curiosity and confidence, knowing that they have a reliable source of support to help them navigate unexpected situations.
On the other hand, the absence of a caregiver who resembles or acts like the child's parents, or the presence of unpredictable and inconsistent caregiving, can disrupt the attachment process and increase the element of surprise. Insecure attachment patterns may emerge, where the child's expectations and reactions to surprises are influenced by their previous experiences of inconsistent or unreliable caregiving.
By considering Harlow's work on the cloth mother effect alongside Ainsworth's attachment theory, we can deepen our understanding of how attachment experiences shape not only a child's emotional well-being but also their responses to surprises. The presence of a caregiver who resembles the parents and provides consistent and nurturing care can create a secure base from which the child can explore and respond to surprises in a more adaptive and resilient manner.

Certainly! Let's delve deeper into topics 12 and 13: connections to Mary Whiton Calkins, Montessori, and Alison Gopnik, as well as connections to Mary Ainsworth and attachment theory.
Connections to Mary Whiton Calkins, Montessori, and Alison Gopnik:
Mary Whiton Calkins was a pioneering American psychologist known for her work on self-psychology and the study of the self. Her ideas on self-regulation and the control of attention align with the concepts we have discussed, such as cognitive control and self-regulation.
Maria Montessori was an Italian physician and educator known for her educational approach based on self-directed learning and hands-on experiences. Her emphasis on creating a conducive environment for learning, allowing children to actively engage and explore, resonates with the ideas of cognitive control and self-regulation.
Alison Gopnik is a developmental psychologist and philosopher known for her research on children's cognitive development and the role of play in learning. Her work highlights the importance of curiosity, exploration, and imaginative play in children's cognitive and social development, which aligns with the themes of active learning and self-regulation.
Connections to Mary Ainsworth and attachment theory:
Mary Ainsworth was a developmental psychologist known for her groundbreaking work on attachment theory. Attachment theory focuses on the emotional bond between infants and their caregivers and how it influences development. While attachment theory primarily explores the socio-emotional aspect of development, there are connections to cognitive processes, such as the role of perception, attention, and learning in the formation and maintenance of secure attachments.
Attachment theory suggests that infants develop internal working models based on their early attachment experiences, which shape their expectations and beliefs about relationships. These internal working models can influence attentional biases, information processing, and cognitive control in later life.
The connections between these theorists and the topics we have discussed lie in their exploration of cognitive development, self-regulation, learning environments, and the interplay between cognitive and socio-emotional processes. These perspectives provide valuable insights into understanding the complex interactions between cognition, perception, emotion, and learning throughout development.

Certainly! Here are the connections between the discussed topics:
Perceptual control theory and choice theory: Both theories emphasize the role of internal control processes in shaping behavior and maintaining homeostasis. They highlight the importance of individuals actively seeking to control their perceptions and make choices based on their needs and values.
Bayesian surprise and attention: The concept of Bayesian surprise, which measures how data affects an observer's beliefs, is closely related to attention. Surprising or unexpected information tends to attract attention, as it represents a deviation from prior expectations and may require further processing and updating of beliefs.
Free energy minimization and self-organization: Free energy minimization is a principle that drives self-organizing systems to maintain stability and minimize surprise. It provides a framework for understanding how biological systems, including the brain, can organize themselves and adapt to changing environments while minimizing uncertainty.
Active inference and optimal control: Active inference is closely related to optimal control theory, as both approaches aim to optimize behavior based on internal models and minimize prediction errors. They provide computational frameworks for understanding how organisms make decisions and engage in goal-directed behavior.
Cognitive models and understanding intelligence: The essay on "Cognitive Models Unveiled" explores the challenges of defining and understanding intelligence, particularly in the context of emerging forms of intelligence in AI and bioengineering. It highlights the importance of considering factors such as goal-directedness, stress, and the concept of "Care" in assessing moral responsibility and relationships with different beings.
Connections with Prigogine and Schmidhuber: Prigogine's work on dissipative structures and non-equilibrium thermodynamics is relevant to understanding self-organization and complexity in cognitive systems. Schmidhuber's contributions to artificial intelligence and machine learning, including the concept of a reward-based curiosity drive, have implications for understanding learning and exploration in cognitive processes.
Connections with Mary Ainsworth and attachment theory: While attachment theory primarily focuses on socio-emotional development, there are connections to cognitive processes. Attachment experiences shape internal working models that influence attentional biases, information processing, and cognitive control. This highlights the interplay between cognitive and socio-emotional factors in development.
These connections demonstrate the interdisciplinary nature of the topics discussed and how they intersect with various fields of psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. They offer insights into understanding cognition, perception, learning, self-regulation, and the complex dynamics of adaptive behavior.
