Conversation with Bard
The story that unfolded
after that morning did not
have a triumphant conclu-
sion. Several molecules isolated-scotophobin
were being the best known-that
were alleged to have behav-
ioral effects. Other peptides
were shown to be neuroac-
tive beyond the shadow of a
doubt.

And I did go on to
have a modestly successful
and rewarding career in
science. But scotophobin's
discoverer, Georges Ungar,
died in greater ignominy
and less honor than his
considerable
accomplishments warranted.

Scotophobin was discred-
ited but never fully ex-
plained. And those of us
who worked even briefly on
the disreputable notion of
biochemical transfer
memory found it a ride we
would never forget.

On the Compresence of Tropes
Arda Denkel
Philosophy and Phenomenological Research
Vol. 57, No. 3 (Sep., 1997), pp. 599-606 (8 pages)
Published By: International Phenomenological Society
Abstract
Once we assume that objects are bundles of tropes, we want to know how the latter cohere. Are they held together by a substratum, are they linked by external relations or do they cling to one another by internal relations? This paper begins by exploring the reasons for eliminating the first two suggestions. Defending that the third option can be made plausible, it advances the following thesis: Maintaining that tropes are held in a compresence by appropriately qualified internal relations avoids the consequence that such properties will be essential to the object. The specific targets of the second part of the paper include, first, a more precise description of the notion of a cohesive internal relation, and second, an explanation of how alteration is possible in an object the particular properties of which hold together by qualified internal relations
1) Theories of Cohesion. Once we assume that substances are (at least) comp-
 resences of particular properties (or "tropes"), we become liable to the ques-
 tion "How do properties hold together (or "'cohere") in bundles?" In an inter-
 esting paper,' Peter Simons discusses a number of alternative answers to this
 question. First, he considers attempts to explain the cohesion of the elements
 of a compresence by external relations, and criticizes them mainly for the im-
 plausibly large number of such relations they entail. He also rejects the ex-
 planation of concrete bundles which views properties bonded to particular po-
 sitions: The latter type of account reveals its implausibility when we take
 motion into account. How, on such a view, can the same substance, and
 hence the same tropes in the same bundle, be said to change position? A third
 explanation of cohesion hypothesizes a substratum bearing the tropes and
 lending them unity within a single concrete entity. Simons' objection is that
 such bare particulars are "...inconsistent in that it is essential to them that
 they have no properties ..essentially, and essential that they be not in more
 than one substance at once".2
 Let us note here that there exist yet other reasons for rejecting theories of
 cohesion that appeal to external bonds between tropes, whether or not they
 also appeal to substrata: For example any such view is bothered by some

 Phenomenological Research 54 (1994), pp. 553-75.

Summary of the Text: "On the Compresence of Tropes"
This article discusses the concept of
tropes
in metaphysics, specifically how they cohere to form substances. The author, Arda Denkel, explores three main theories of cohesion:
1. External Relations:
This theory proposes that tropes are held together by external relations between them. However, it is rejected due to the implausibly large number of relations it would require.
2. Concrete Bundles:
This theory suggests that tropes are bonded to specific positions within a substance. However, it is criticized for its difficulty in explaining how substances can change position while maintaining the same tropes.
3. Substratum:
This theory posits the existence of a substratum, a bare particular that bears the tropes and grants them unity. Denkel argues against this view, stating that such substrata would be inconsistent because they would have no essential properties and could not be part of multiple substances.
Denkel then proposes an alternative theory:
qualified internal relations
. He argues that the compresence of tropes can be explained by internal relations that are specific to the particular tropes involved. These relations are not essential to the tropes themselves, avoiding the problem of essential properties.
The second part of the article further elaborates on this theory by:
Providing a more precise description of cohesive internal relations.
Explaining how alteration is possible in an object whose properties are held together by these relations.
Overall, the article argues that tropes cohere through qualified internal relations, offering a solution to the problem of cohesion that avoids the shortcomings of other theories.

The paper titled "Reliable Adversarial Distillation with Unreliable Teachers" by Jianing Zhu et al. introduces a new approach called reliable introspective adversarial distillation (IAD) for training student networks with unreliable teachers. In traditional distillation, student networks are trained using soft labels provided by pretrained teacher networks, with the expectation that students will outperform their teachers since soft labels are stronger supervision than hard labels. However, when considering adversarial robustness, teachers may become unreliable as they are pretrained on their own adversarial data, and it is unrealistic to expect them to be good at every adversarial data queried by students. 

In response to this challenge, the authors propose IAD, which allows students to partially trust their teachers. IAD distinguishes between three cases when a query consists of a natural data (ND) and its corresponding adversarial data (AD): 
(a) If a teacher is good at AD, its soft label is fully trusted by the student.
(b) If a teacher is good at ND but not AD, its soft label is partially trusted, and the student also takes its own soft label into account.
(c) Otherwise, the student relies solely on its own soft label.

Experimental results show that IAD is effective in improving the adversarial robustness of student networks compared to their teachers.

Summary of "Reliable Adversarial Distillation with Unreliable Teachers" by Jianing Zhu et al.
This paper introduces a new approach called
Reliable Introspective Adversarial Distillation (IAD)
to address the challenge of training student networks with unreliable teachers in the context of adversarial robustness.
Problem:
Traditional distillation uses soft labels from pretrained teachers to train students, expecting them to surpass teachers.
This fails when considering adversarial robustness because:
Teachers are pretrained on their own adversarial data, which may not generalize to students' queries.
Expecting teachers to be good at every adversarial data queried by students is unrealistic.
Solution: IAD
Allows students to partially trust teachers, distinguishing three cases:
Teacher good at AD:
Student fully trusts teacher's soft label.
Teacher good at ND but not AD:
Student partially trusts teacher's soft label and also considers its own.
Teacher unreliable:
Student relies solely on its own soft label.
Benefits:
IAD improves students' adversarial robustness compared to their teachers.
It addresses the issue of unreliable teachers in adversarial distillation.
Key Points:
IAD adapts traditional distillation to handle unreliable teachers for improved adversarial robustness.
It leverages a flexible approach based on teacher performance on specific adversarial data.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of IAD in enhancing student networks' resilience to adversarial attacks.

How do you think it works?
edit
volume_up
Unfortunately, I don't have enough information to fully understand the specific implementation details of IAD. However, based on the provided summary, I can offer some insights into its likely working principles:
1. Teacher Evaluation:
IAD likely involves a mechanism for evaluating the teacher's performance on both natural data (ND) and its corresponding adversarial data (AD). This evaluation could involve metrics like accuracy or robustness to specific adversarial attacks.
2. Soft Label Generation:
Depending on the teacher's performance, IAD generates different types of soft labels for the student network:
Full Trust:
If the teacher performs well on both ND and AD, its soft label is directly used by the student.
Partial Trust:
If the teacher performs well on ND but not AD, its soft label is combined with the student's own soft label for training.
No Trust:
If the teacher is unreliable on both ND and AD, the student relies solely on its own soft label derived from the training data.
3. Student Training:
The student network is trained using the chosen soft labels, incorporating both the teacher's knowledge and its own learning. This allows the student to benefit from the teacher's expertise while also adapting to potential adversarial challenges that the teacher may not have encountered.
4. Iteration and Refinement:
The teacher evaluation and soft label generation process could be iterative. As the student learns and improves, its own performance on both ND and AD can be used to evaluate the teacher's reliability, potentially leading to adjustments in the trust level and soft label generation.
5. Adaptive and Robust Learning:
This dynamic approach allows the student to actively assess and adapt to the reliability of its teacher, ultimately leading to a more robust and effective learning process in the presence of adversarial attacks.
For a more comprehensive understanding of the technical details and nuances of IAD, it would be helpful to access the full paper by Jianing Zhu et al. This would provide a deeper dive into the specific algorithms, evaluation methods, and experimental results that support the effectiveness of IAD.

Reliable Adversarial Distillation with Unreliable Teachers:
We discussed the IAD approach, which helps train student networks even when their teacher models are unreliable. We explored how IAD distinguishes between different cases based on the teacher's performance and how it generates different types of soft labels for the student network.
How IAD Works:
We delved into the possible mechanisms behind IAD, including the evaluation of the teacher's performance, the generation of various soft labels based on trust level, and the adaptive and robust learning process facilitated by dynamic trust adjustments.
Overall, this conversation highlighted the complex and interconnected nature of knowledge representation, learning, and the various elements that contribute to our understanding of the world.
