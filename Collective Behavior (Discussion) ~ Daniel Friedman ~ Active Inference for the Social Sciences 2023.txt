Hello and welcome. It's August 16th, 2023. We're in the Collective Behavior Discussion
section of the Active Inference for the Social Sciences course in 2023. So perhaps let us
all go around and give an opening introduction and or reflection and see who joins and what happens
from there. But just so that everybody has said hello.
Hi everyone, I'm Bryn. I'm PM in South Africa and yeah, just excited to be here and see what happens.
Hi, I'm Andrew. I'm a graduate student in Indiana and I guess my field of interest now is the
knowledge management and I think that figuring out how we collectively learn and can
share information is a really interesting topic and I'd like to see how this would apply.
Hi, I'm Regina and I'm from Guatemala, but I'm living in Spain studying and doing
experiments related to this topic and trying to learn a little bit of the
theory that's behind it so we can advance better. I'm excited.
Hello, my name is Sasha. I'm calling in from California. I'm also a graduate student.
Yeah, just really enjoyed the spirited presentation last week. I'm looking forward to discussion.
All right. Well, how about anyone can give a first reflection on collective behavior? What
was their thought or context before and where are they at as we kind of begin? Yeah, Regina.
Okay, so I just want to make sure that I understand because I took like two big lessons from your
lesson, right? And the first one is that you know, this famous model of active inference that has
the agent and the environment and the mark of blanket in the middle, right? And just interacts
with everything, right? So I think what I got from what you discussed, maybe I didn't have a good
definition of an agent, but first that you can have that agent not be just an individual, but
also your definition of an individual changes depending on what you want to
study in the behavior, right? So an agent can be an ant. It can be an ecosystem. It can be an
eye looking at something or it can be as a society, for example. And I think that's a big take for me
because it changes a lot the concept of how to study things and use active inference,
just by changing how big the agent can be. So I don't know if I got that right, right? So first
that clarification. So what is an agent?
Yeah, so I don't know if there's like a formal definition of an agent in active inference,
right? But if we if we want to study whatever we want to study, because I'm not going to study
because I have to do experiments. That's like my goal, whatever I'm doing. So I want to study
whatever I have to choose what's going to be my agent and the environment it has.
So choosing the agent, you can do it to create a model or to make an experiment, whatever,
but the choice you make, it will depend on your
and what you understand as an individual or as an agent, I think so, right?
Awesome. Anyone have a thought on that?
No. If I continue with just to add something else, and this would be my mind.
And then I'm thinking is that also a big problem that we have, or I think I have, is that since
I am part of the environment, you know, the perspective of whoever is studying whatever
it is, it's also going to be an effect in it. So maybe maybe scientists already decided,
but I don't know that we can never have an objective way of studying something if you're
part of the environment of the agent. So I don't know we already forgot it, or we already decided
that's it. We cannot have objective observations of behavior in general. But you know, you always
think about like the agent environment, and you start in it as something else, but the something
else is also affecting it. So I see that as a problem, or maybe something that has to be said,
like we are not objective, because we're part of what it's affecting our agents in the behavior
collectively too. So those are the thoughts I have to share.
Regina, I'm also new to all of this. So my preliminary understanding of what is an agent
is anything that has any good reason to self evidence and to itself or to survive
that doesn't want to dissipate, that might delineate the boundary of what an agent is
that then sets up the boundaries with which it will, as you described, start interacting
with the world, the environment. So if something, as I understand it, if something has a reason to
go on being to survive, then it is an agent in the world.
Okay, but that agent could be anything, right? Like is that what you're saying, right? Like if
you want to survive, it can be an ant surviving individually or a cell or a group. Okay, yeah,
that's a good, that's like a good definition.
Okay.
Yeah, Sasha.
Great points, Regina. So much to say there. It's something that I have experience with as
a researcher in biology is deciding the kind of
the statistics or sampling approach to use, whether we're taking, you know, one cell
from one individual or we're taking many cells from many individuals and how to do the statistics
and kind of sampling approach on that. That is a, you know, an evergreen question that we're always
reevaluating to see how to think about the dependencies within biological systems.
And then another thing that you mentioned was about the individual being part of the ecosystem.
And that makes me think a lot about complexity science and something that is addressed there
in thinking about the interplay of the scientists and what they're studying.
Yeah, thank you for those points.
Yeah, Sasha can, sorry, I'm not raising my hand. I'm just unmuting.
That's okay. Can you say a bit more about what you mean by complexity science is
maybe muted. Oh, can't speak at the moment.
Yeah, complexity science has looked at agent, agent based modeling as a fundamental tool.
John Holland signals and boundaries focusing on what from an active inference side, we might say
as like message passing or communication for the messages and then boundaries with
the whole discussion around the boundaries in the world, map territory, map territory fallacy,
map territory fallacy, fallacy doing iterative modeling.
Sasha brought up limited experimental resources in the scientific setting.
And that's kind of analogous to the limited energy budget or attentional budget, ultimately,
or just decision making budget of the kinds of active entities that make sense to model,
the ones that kind of have those characteristics. This is really the question of what makes
something first principles or what are the first principles. One aspect of it as brought up
is the censoring of the persistence. So from the outside, that's kind of like an empiricist's view
of persistence, like is it measurable, but not saying that something is necessarily that,
which is the statistical tool. And then the sort of like inside out implementation type.
But there's a lot more to say in that who wants to bring in some new angle or
how do they see collective behavior? Why do we talk about collective behavior?
Why not just behavior, recognize that behavior is multi scale or or is social?
What's really being communicated with the collective?
I mean, I believe that we chose those levels so we can make it more simple for our brains to
understand it. Because if we talk about collective behavior actually is the universe
behaving in the particles and everything, right? So I don't know if that's a little bit just based on
I don't know what's the word like just in the material world and how it physically moves.
And that's like the terministic or whatever, right? But I think we chose to have those
limitations so we could understand the world. But also we should acknowledge that are limited
because we're part of the system. I'm having a little trouble on my kind of understanding the
I guess the where the schism lies between kind of the Markov blanket and the Umwelt
in semiotics of like the animals sensory experience.
Anyone have a maybe maybe someone could Daniel do you know
like the difference between that too?
Um, can you be a little louder? Thank you though. Andrew, anyone have a thought on that?
I'll bring in a definition of Umwelt and then and then we can see but meanwhile does anyone
have a thought? Sorry, I was just muted on Zoom. Andrew, you're a little quiet.
But I'm going to bring in a definition of Umwelt and then meanwhile does anyone have a thought?
I hope I'm not
further diluting Andrew's question. Um, but I think of collective behavior in kind of like a
I don't know football team or soccer team. And what that provides
the group who is a share some common ethos and what that does to be
how that regulates the their collective or individual and collective free energies
and during a match or throughout the season and how that that gives some
yeah some charge to some investments because it's my team against yours and we have to
um try and win and so you know without it without that collective behavior
um it's it might be far harder to achieve groups goals if they aren't able to collaborate and share
um you know implicitly and explicitly certain traits, behaviors, thoughts, feelings, ideals,
ideologies, whatever they might be and how that then allows us to compete in the world.
I see what you think it's it's been. Yes. Okay, okay, I see what you're saying
especially because we're watching the World Cup, right? Women's World Cup.
Right. Yeah, so it's very relevant. Yeah, but I see that in all the
these things you've said it seems that for you behavior needs to have like a goal
and I don't know if I if I agree with that it's either survival or winning
but for me it's just something that happens and maybe the consequence is surviving
but it's not the goal to survive or to win the game I mean in in the football it is right
but in general um maybe there's no goal to the behavior collectively
just just the thought. It's interesting.
Yeah, a lot of great comments. Well the paper of Conor Hines at all on the collective behavior as
a surprise minimization that points the way towards using the act in fontology
these kinds of modeling approaches for collective behavioral situations
and really just recognizing them as a certain type of behavioral modeling
the simplest case might just be a single closed system
all part of the composition that leads to the ability to describe at very least
a lot of different kinds of systems just like a linear model can describe a lot of systems so then
it's also really interesting a topic that came up in one of the recent textbook groups
with what's normative about active inference because the term of the process theory even
of active inference being normative is mentioned multiple times and that's definitely a topic
that connects to the social sciences one can imagine the kind of niche normativity
or niche regularities in a broad sense and then the real minute particulars of how
they play out which kind of hints at the kind of descriptive or causal minimum
to start making some anything but toy specific generative models
so it's been an interesting theme to see even already in avals and bends
lectures and discussions this question between description process of describing
which is what i associated with professor gordon's approach to ant watching
how that descriptive process which is what we can say that we have for active inference
just like a linear modeling ecosystem could say about their linear modeling in principle
um and how to then articulate the normativities of the framework if that concept if that separation
can even exist from the behavioral normativities that include the basis of social fabric in
all different kinds of communities
so
here's another question so what is the role of any technical detail in in the social sciences
whether more on the statistical connecting with data or more category theoretic like
just formal what's the role of formal methods in different kinds of academic or practical
expressions about social systems
does it matter at all
how we think about a framework at all
well for formalizing
aspects of a social system that and i would say that the purpose is for
communication between individuals because just you know we can't verify that
well formalizing it is just setting a system on top of what you're observing
but there is no explicit guarantee that you're saying encompasses everything of the phenomena
you're observing and just like you know kind of going back to Taoism of like the name that can
be named is not the true eternal name and so it's just a way of you know it's a slice of what we
can observe and the way to you know maybe you can make predictions or maybe you can generate
something that acts like the phenomena you're observing but so it's just it's a way to kind of
it's just a way to kind of approximate our understanding of some phenomena and
you have to slice it in a specific way but also understanding that it is a slice or
you know it is a tangent line that you're approximating as opposed to
encompassing the whole system from verbalizing it
um i was at maybe it's not the goal but something that happens out of
describing any system like Andrew said it's like um the goal to modify it or to
or to corrupt it in some way to gain control or whatever if you know the model you know how to
play the game kind of so you write instructions and try to see if you can outsmart someone else
i mean it sounds kind of dark right but maybe it's one of the goals to or something that just
happens out of knowing the rules that nobody else's knows
i mean i guess when you when you talk about control there is a
there is a shade that can be um gained from that specific wording but control in terms of you
know control theory or you know that that comes from electrical engineering it's really just
what um what shapes the behavior or what are the what are the inputs that drive the the behavior
and when you're talking about control it's really just about um well if you change these inputs
how does that change the end behavior and so you can actually you know from electrical engineering
of controlling uh some sort of electromechanical system but then you can make analogous statements
on like control into society which doesn't necessarily mean like the dark negative control
but like you know maybe there's some pathological behavior in in in a society or you know even
pathological um pathological responses within the brain and it's like well what is what is
driving that and is it possible to to change those those change the drivers of that to have
something that is uh more uh beneficial to the system
yeah just just to add um to what andrew's saying because it matters
sometimes how you manipulate um uh you know a a system or it matters how you
affect a brain so it cannot be random i mean uh you know we've come a long way for example from
lobotomy uh which had disastrous effects and and you it matters to a system how you affect it and so
to know more formally uh the most effective way to create a desired effect whatever that might be
um it's essential that it's not just kind of poking and prodding there's like that that is yeah
as much as that is part of the scientific method to update that method in accordance
with what you're learning so it is is important um
no i i think you're both right you don't have to be dark but uh also something else that andrew
said about predicting i think that's one of also the the big goals trying to predict whether to
be prepared to or or just to i mean couldn't be to control right but if you if you can somehow
predict how people respond to this or how a system will behave in this other scenario
you can you know change what input is or prepare for whatever comes i guess
yeah a lot of great points some of the commonly held not not equally by everyone everyone but
some of the tenets of science being to explain predict designing control
where explanation and prediction are on the pathway towards uh systems designing and and
maintenance and other other words that people can add but that's the pragmatic utility oriented view
which doesn't have to be an absolutist view but certainly there are regimes of attention socially
now and seemingly for long long times where people were wanting to retain and to constrain
the variance distribution on what we would say is their generative model some norm and then other
times engaging in these functions and that instrumentalist usage of active inference is
like we're going to be able to model it with a pretty minimum framework that's commonly used
in statistical systems where some things we observe and some we don't and at least we know
and how all the pieces are connected and then that is an artifact in model-based design
as people develop that line through time socially just like probably has been always the case for
complex projects and scientific collaboration there's a few other interesting pieces but yeah please
please i'm just i'm just wondering if well now that i'm thinking a lot isn't that like a problem
for confirmation bias right like there's a paper of in here here because we create the
knowledge and we tell everyone the knowledge this is the model this is how everything behaves
and then we update our knowledge about it and then we look for everything to just
you know confirm it and and yeah maybe there's another system that will not let us be
getting knowledge so slowly because if everybody just agrees on something we teach it to everyone
and we confirm the model and then we just try to look for evidence for that model
then we go slowly if there's any better thing or better model that comes along
yeah a lot to say about that like if we believe that trees exist or that people exist and then
we come to see them so there's kind of this sense where problem confirmation bias which
i think it's a great term a great topic to bring in with definitely also what's called like the
golden nail syndrome or something if all you have is the hammer then everything's a nail
and there's definitely attention there because it's like how much of what you can do are you supposed
to do something that you can't do or but then at least you could do what you needed to do to get
there so that's actually within your scope of what you can do so it's it's not that there are things
that you can't do that you can't do if just from measurement perspective so like how does it look
or how do we recognize across systems or how do we have awareness in situations as limited
individuals who do have all of these cognitive phenomena how to make decisions or sense making
or infrastructure or whatever it is the socialness the the system of interest of the social sciences
make that and then dot dot dot normatively what
i think it's there's some protection built into into the problem of confirmation bias because
all knowledge generation is happening in in a in an open system and so there's always going to be
an agent outside of your your own mind and it's and what it's perceiving that can then challenge
or add to the you know like the the the the lk 99 um uh the semiconductors that have
has been all the rage recently and and how and other scientists have now kind of
um discredited it uh quite convincingly and it's because of this open they might have had degrees
of confirmation bias that they were egging each other on but it's it's ultimately being refuted
which is uh this built-in kind of protection because it's all operating in a in a in an open
system fortunately yeah a lot to say there uh monday morning reviewer doing how how do we
again go from any given description of a communicative event like the kind of specific unfolding of
the lk 99 narrative as yet uncompleted in in the minds of some which is real enough
to be real socially and uh so how do we go from any descriptive anything about that
total observation to core screening then how do we come to uh work with that interface with
what whatever that is hands that to us
what is the social behavior or some some classic or some novel social behaviors
maybe ones that seem pretty obvious due to recency bias
I'll I'll just mention one aspect that Andrew and I have also talked about is the autopoetic
nature of information systems
Andrew do you have any thought on this or about where autopoiesis comes into
like social sciences or these kinds of models
that Daniel Andrew just left a note that he's uh
okay okay oh oh oh totally he just wasn't looking at the time funny stuff
anyone else have a thought on that
okay just just to kind of carry forward then basically the the ability of social systems
that include written niche modification cumulative culture their increasing
extent of control as discussed earlier that that definitely is a bit of a overloaded or at
least doubly meant term in different settings because it can just simply mean modeling it
with control theory which is a pretty limited philosophical statement relative to any statistical
method or control like the kind that people are unhappy with and the kind that's described in
thinking like a state and a lot of other works that I know Mao and Lorena and Avel are going to be
definitely going into more detail on so when societies can model
and introspect or or self reflect formally much better
and that can happen through anything from free and open source
better aided protocols there's many limited formats of self meaning making but cryptography
definitely allows those explorations and that doesn't necessarily mean computer cryptography
that could also be like linguistic encoding and all these other ways of niche
sub-differentiation in multi-scale systems you just do not see a system that is cookie cutter
it's very rare in ecosystems there are algal blooms and things like that
so when we really think about the developmental and the cognitive and the selective niche
which is a concept that Axel constant and others have differentiated in some of their
like ecological active inference work like that niche is very embodied extended in culture etc etc
it's just like a kind of cool direct way to open up to that challenge of modeling and just
bring some
closures with different accounts or compatibilities with different accounts
so like all just to give one right of example but maybe it'd be interesting what what other people
think all the expressions that people make in social settings can just simply be their
expressions or modeled as such that is in one way implicitly what was always in play but now
it's describable and legible and autonomous so how do we take this active inference collective
behavior crossover and think about what it really means in how we're going to be like
thinking differently even just this discussion forward or like more locally our our understandings
with collective behavior or with behavior
so
then you can you ask the the question again i i didn't actually catch the
um how do we the question start how do we start to adapt some of these general
comments or or frames that are in some ways disconnected from descriptions of real systems
how do we think about that and and what it means now
what do you mean on the
yeah good that's okay do you mean on the document in front of us
these these just these disconnected things in front of us there on on the on the document
i don't know whatever you think or whatever you want to say
okay
yeah i i there's a lot and i again i hope i'm not
you know and fully understanding the question i hope i'm not steering away
too much but i've got a had a general sense of what i think you were saying and
i think it's an enormous problem with the amount of
um information sharing um just in a in a with let's just take
the generative generative models of um social media and all of the platforms that are available
to us how much information we are privy to in any given moment and
um and i'm kind of forgetting the question that i that you asked them but but but how do you
it's almost as if there is such a a high rate of information and data flow that it's really
hard to know what to do with all of it and at least as a human being i'm not saying from machines
but um but as a psychologist i'm certainly interested in
how humans are able to tolerate and respond to um the amount and rate of sort of information
that's our okay
so
i mean this is not the first time this happens right like when we went from talking to writing
information then everyone wrote their information and then we have books and then we have libraries
and that's all available and again we have access if you can read right to all the information in
the world so we adapted to i don't know to get careers so we could specify in which type of
information you are going to know more so maybe we need some sort of new career types i don't
know more specification with more information but is it not uh is the rate of information
uh flow and increases are not there's a not exponential is it not uh um i don't know it's
it's a crazy amount on our brains cannot do anything about it so we have to do multi-disciplinary
things and work together with others if we want to make something but yeah i don't know maybe we
will die of excess of information
how do people feel like active inference brings something to the discussion relative to
how they want to work towards
ans yeah well isn't that the provocative question too but like any system that's
that's the question everyone is going to have their own memes and themes and and systems that they
have spent time with and did field work with and all this other like particularity because the
system that doesn't have particularity is just not going to be hosting a broad enough niche for
for phenotypic diversity it's just riding on the edge of a razor instead of more like
a fabric that continues to unfold i think
there's a lot of work to do with the social sciences and active inference just from what i was
like reading trying to find things for this
discussion and just i personally wondered what is is meaningful or interesting
or useful what's epistemic and pragmatic value for different audiences how does it go from kind of
bringing citations that were not linked together in some more theoretical or more
generative model oriented work in active inference like epistemic foraging or the inference model
or any other kind of specific model what what are these different kinds of scientific artifacts do
for who
i guess i'm still learning very
very
crudely ploddling along here Daniel to try and answer that because it's quickly realized that the field
is it's so multi-nodal it has so much the free energy principle the Bayesian brain
even just to psychology has so much applicability and everyone seeing everyone i meet at these
discussions is coming at it from a different angle and it can be a bit confusing to hear
how other people are applying it how other people are making use of it
and in all manner of ways and so i'm still learning how to apply to kind of ring fence
the free energy principle and connect it to psychological processes including collective
behavior and because there's a lot of psychopathology in group think in collective behavior but i'm
also very very interested in its application at the interface of what happens between a
therapist and a patient and i'm often unlike other professions who seem who are just by
nature of the scientific method are able to extract a lot more data to work with to analyze
to you know in a in a that's very hard to do i feel very limited other than just making kind
of theoretical leaps and inferences about how to apply the free energy principle to psychology
it's i can't have a session with my brain hooked up to an fmri machine to get data and to see
when a patient says boo go bar that's a spike on the the spike trains which represents
you know surprising and we can then solve for that in some way i'm i don't have access to that
sort of data flow so it feels limited but i'm still learning how to apply it and
yeah and trying to collaborate with colleagues on that the inference group
you
what are people wondering about collective behavior even if we're totally of course
not going to address it but just what what are the kinds of things that people
what makes you look up collective behavior instead of just behavior or individual behavior
for me it's about safety and need to belong
for me it's um
i think that um it depends where you come from and in the country you are but
there are places that are more collective and there are places that are more individualistic and
i think mostly non-western countries have a lot of collective behavioral knowledge and
spirits already right that they're already new these things that we think are new for us right
how the collective thing works for example i don't know you don't make a decision for yourself
you make a decision for the group like marrying you marry because you want an addition and you
want to interact with someone or other group and that's something that affects the the collective
not just you so arranged marriage makes sense something like that right so for me making that
distinction about individual collective comes from understanding that i don't know there are
other places that are already ahead in what collective means in terms of human beings and
how to interact and the worst through all we have all this individualistic thing which is
very interesting because why do we have a same species and then we have very different approaches
of how to understand ourselves in terms of what the individual is and why it matters
yes there's so much loaded on different understandings among people including even the the essence of
the social which is who are people and what is the the obligation and how do we view that that
relationship that's a very very deep area and and again the part that just kept returning to me
in the lecture and when i was trying to think about how to how to even reflect part of this very
large area is like what is the adjective doing and what what is what's the reference point by
which this is being said in the speech acts like people often will dismiss i don't mean to um you
know straw people but dismiss collective behavior by saying well we are explaining individual behavior
what are you explaining beyond the nest mates in the colony and then the exterior like that is it
and so that can feel like looking at the same thing from two different sides
and there are different methods like some methods blur over individuals a lot more
like statistical methods that might correspond to demographics and then on the other hand like
more agent-based models but how much variability in what shared variability
and white general synchronies amongst different quantum reference frames all these nested
if these possibilities that are grounded in wanting to explore mathematical and scientific
possibilities as as the literature of linear regression is full of so many incredible
extensions and and and similar and then that's i i think what the course is even beginning to
to try to express and what what i understand in the works of the the other teachers and
like a lot of your backgrounds and everything like that is where is that
moment where it is not only science because science is not simply the social
so science has an activity and then as there's a diffusion away from science
and and i think that or or at least that relationship between social and science is
right there in the title maybe that's kind of like a science major's take but but it is itself
in a way a um presenting a dilemma with what science means there and then that's the frame game
who's doing social science who's doing not social science and that's that's where um
in in the culture i'm sitting in slash in the technical side of that it is related
to statistics and formality it's the xkcd comic and the way that formalisms and and details
are taken as under some regimes of attention basically definitive
and yet there's like a yearning and a counter balancing that's expressed also in many ways
and so that's and science maybe some people feel like certain social scientific methods
that's like not far enough in this dimension and then the others feel like they're too far in this
direction but it's like just like any uh like that academic field let alone any other community
of diverse agents like of course there's going to be distributions of perspectives at different times
and at an apt takes rate of apt take by those different perspectives and
no yeah daniel could do you think uh these first principles
would be able to explain why uh an ant colony exists uh i know that was your
a kind of area of interest of study uh why an ant colony exists uh in in the way that it
is as a kind of operating as a collective and why another animal is able to survive
and achieve its goals as an individual only relying on the environment and its actions
and sensations to get its needs met and to no doubt minimize its free energy but could first
principles explain why the one has to survive as a group and the other has to survive or is
able to survive um under different conditions yeah that's a super interesting question and
it's very core to this individual individuation and multi-scale individuation concept like is the
nest made the individual and then the colony is the social because then for sure it's super
collaborative or is the colony the organism and the nest mates are tissues and then are they social
across colony boundaries not where i was in arizona but they're often friendly across different
species and they avoided conflict more often than not so it's like well and then go it why
does it even matter what's happening on this plot of lands in this in this area from like a
biomimic perspective we might learn new algorithms it's a sandbox for learning new techniques and
observation all these other like richnesses so it's to say though like what comes away from that
science that makes it social science and i think there's a lot of disciplinary ways of
understanding that which which i'm definitely not expert in in in the um professional fields like
like counseling um but probably in in all the different humanities and histories and all these
other fields all these different maps the kind of social um the epistemic organizing question
and then the social organizing question yeah and and the way like technology is also in that
tangle and yeah someone pointed out like this is not a new problem and uh but then it's like well
what parts are new and then what's our model by which we're saying that it's like new or two
individualists or two collective on what scale what if they're like really collectivist at this
scale but not at this scale or another an example of an ambiguous or at least like um poly poly
submits phenotype of colonies is in some colonies there's partial reproductive activation
of like non reproductive nest mates and that has often been modeled from like a position of like
zero is the law and how are they cheating above this but it's also been approached from a colony
level strategic bed hedging so without super deep knowledge of really some of the specifics of
the regularities that that colony algorithm had to persist for so long and to have gotten swept
off the table if it was even it's like that's that's a very integrated problem so it helps you
approach collective systems and and learn about them but it's like there's a lot to say about
humidity loss in foraging and humidity loss isn't even the whole picture and human foraging is a
lot more sophisticated from just like a perception cognition influence perspective
so those are just some ant related thoughts but it's it just centers a lot of discussions that
really matter and I think the really interesting piece is not always in the way that they're
thought to by some yeah and it's and it's very hard to get any kind of
cross pollination or to see cross pollination uh studying one agent it's it's quite for at least
in my mind very difficult to kind of generalize things across different agents and it starts
getting a bit uh yeah tricky to infer one collectives and uh how and why and and how
they survive and how another agent does it's tricky so I'm almost just kind of an agent
human beings as hard as they are to study and just try and run with it as far as possible
yeah otherwise it's just information overload
body is a complex place too and digital technology virtuality these are such um
richly developed topics in the social sciences I only know the tiniest amount from
but I think that through participation and inclusion in collaboration and in conversations
and everything there's going to be a lot of interesting connections and paths um and
and it's being approached seemingly uh multiple layers like within the the two layers that just
we can focus most narrowly on it's like within the realm of science what is science which is
kind of like playing this other um role with inertia in some people's minds and in systems
what is science who gets to decide what social sciences I don't know I'm I'm not in social
science but it's system of interest in society and certainly I'm a part of that um so it's like
what is the what is good technically what is social scientific and then what is that social
scientific how does that going to interface into the the metaphysical questions and and the normative
ethical and um decision making with trade-offs and the real reflexive complex decisions that matter
also while recognizing this increasingly nuanced way of thinking about different social intelligences
what's any other random thought or curiosity about collective behavior
one point that I would have added into the uh lecture was just that in distributed systems
whether as modeled or as such all behavior is arising from interactions local to individuals
even if it's sent through some wireless mechanism it's like all about the local interactions
and so that is a an arising type process that gives the modeler like one hands-off layer
at least if not much more another nice feature about them um they are in a way
waiting to be composed because they intrinsically contain like at least two layers of consideration
now whether there's kind of like a forcing function of one layer and just sort of dangling
a bottom layer or whether there's a lot of what we would call emergence or discussive in in that way
like that more arising function can be modeled but in either way then you can kind of wrap
that two-layer system and then compose them so that's like what enables in certain situations
like parallelization or at least you know that's obviously a big area but that's what allows multi
agent simulation frameworks to do well on certain very challenging
sense making and action selection problems not by guarantee or default because any given
slicing and dicing of any given um prompting of information may not help you adapt
but there are paths that do and don't help persist or not and that's this kind of persistence
starting place that we began with Sasha um can I really resonate with what you mentioned about
the local interactions that even if information is transmitted over long distances then the agents
behave in a way that is locally relevant and integrates that information and it actually
makes me think a lot about the like psychology therapy angle that while you try to get information
about persons like um sort of local environment and behavior um or like perhaps you know demographics
and age that um their informational environment and like wealth of what kind of information they
consume might also be really telling about their uh psychological and like behavior interactions or
pathologies um and then to bring it kind of full circle back to um that the researcher is part of
the ecosystem that they are uh studying um yeah I I think it's just um such a difference in
perspective to see that as like a positive and a gift that um the way that you would design and
run an experiment today is not the way that you would do it two years from now with more experience
and so um that is a a a benefit and like a bonus in the system and not um like a negative
perspective of bias that it's detracting from some underlying uh truth or reality
so just a few thoughts
oh very interesting anyone want to add something
I think we didn't fully resolve this early question about the umvelte um term from ethology
behavioral research observation science uh using the term to describe the world as its
experience by a particular organism I think a few different pieces and there's a lot of
discussion in discourse or just just to give you like a super short overview the world we might
connect to world modeling and there's a lot of interesting work in all kinds of different like
pros focus on qualitative systems as well as some artificial or synthetic intelligence
world modeling as it experienced as it is experienced is one of the sticky and deep ones
because this is the area of phenomenology and so this is like a kind of semi-eternal
discussion point so whether whether active inference delivers on world modeling is kind
of empirical and just plain whereas as it is experienced is going to be a philosophical
question and then by a particular organism that specificity we get by actually making the
generative model even if we're just speculating about it it's like talking about experience without
an experiencer would be like talk talking about um some agent's behavior without reference to its
niche and then where there is like that complex negotiation I think the humanities and a lot
of the social sciences have identified a lot of the structural top down and also the personal
bottom up motifs of of things being blurred and made complex and so I think part of the social
and the scientific as coming only from the scientific side is like to to meet in the third
space and or at least make it work to have a mutual compromise where it's like
certain social science social oriented claims based upon this scientific measure
that is going to be a judgment call but understanding that conversation where is it a
mutual compromise in like what dimensions not simply along the kind of like rigor accessibility
or implications access there's just very many things in play in these iterated relationships
in ecosystems
like having a researcher as part of the ecosystem well what is it here's here's the forager question
you see the nest made on the ground it's a forager but then we step back it's like okay well
it's foraging and then that's the allocation of the forager then it's foraging is still
part of this sense making is generative sense making with like process understanding
even of a trace which is something that Bruno Latour and others have have explored with like
following a trace in a social setting and using that to to trace networks
so in our digital ecosystems though our information ecosystems is not research happening
and so what what does that really mean and then what what are those social
normativities there's going to be like a meeting or a handoff with with where that really is happening
or maybe it's a knocking on the door that's ignored
or it could be whatever metaphor in that setting it actually is there's no general metaphor because
that'd be like oh what's the general metaphor on this experiment which experiment just the general
action that we plan to take oh hard to say
okay well in our last like sections I guess if anybody types a question live chat we'll look
at it otherwise what are any other thoughts or like what what can we learn more about about
collective behavior or what will it mean for our sense making decision making if we understand
collective behavior better
you
what else are people excited about for the rest of the course
like based upon the sections that we've done so far
and and how how we can even even start to approach this in an acknowledged limited finite way
yeah Sasha then than anyone else
I just added a question to the very bottom of the notes and it makes me think about
how working on this document collaboratively throughout the last hour
we're able to kind of leave a stigma trick trace of things we've discussed and what sort of
traits or practices should individual humans I guess I should specify humans should be
embody in order to improve cohesion in collective behavior it makes me think of
certain psychology traits or descriptions of like openness or conscientiousness
what will make individual humans better participants in collective behavior
yeah I think to add to that to just emphasize the importance again only with human agents
specifically who have the capacity to think and reflect and the only ones that have that those
really advanced capabilities that we know of as yet but to really kind of leverage
in order to make the collective better there's a responsibility on the individual
despite being part of a collective and on many different on many different fronts to be able to
leverage and utilize their own internal states and what they have learned and to be able to think
in a to retain the individual the individual's mind and think about the collective
I think is so important if the collective is to become healthier Sasha to your point and to improve its
you have to become more conscientious and become more responsible or whatever that might be
so to always try and maintain a thinking
self is crucial
unless you you can very easily be usurped into the collective as is
if you just go on any social media media platform you will see
individuals rarely thinking
for themselves and seemingly kind of just purely each other and that causes massive problems
so an individual mind is strikes me as being just the most important thing in the future going forward
yeah this dialectic with individuation and collectivization as these like ongoing
negotiated compromises that can be also viewed many ways however however they are
you
cognitive science coming into play
maybe historical processes or philosophies were
used in many settings for
or even approaching these kinds of social questions and now with computer science and technology
it even like is a discussion more about the capacities of measurement and action
not that those are new in and of themselves like but thinking like a state like the development of the apparatus
the development of the social social systems that can be run on on open source hardware open
source software things like that so I don't know if something's generalized across all such groups
but
understanding what environments at least initially things are beginning at
is just a realist starting point probably no guarantee since most things slash all things are
swept off the table in their specifics anyway so and how to deal with that kind of like skin
on the line type of decision making it is very interesting how it's pursued in the in the sciences
because often like many runs are presented or that kind of like like catastrophic failure
mode of models is is not considered just like part of the training starting naive
so just the way the different social considerations
are are converged upon it's never it's not like reduced to one
one feature of the social because the social is such an open space
as a scientist always impressed by how that writing could kind of open up
the um situations which are like mundane but also of course very deep and meaningful
also though mundane
um
Any other thoughts? Or otherwise on collective behavior or on the social sciences course
or anything? Otherwise, people can have any last words if they want.
Yeah, awesome. Thank you all for participating. David, want to add anything?
Thanks, Tim.
Yeah, well, I look forward to more questions being asked on the course website and everybody's
engagement with the course is very much appreciated. So keep up the collective
possible by scale learning and it's a fun course. Really happy that we could have done
the session and very happy to have concluded the session.
All right, thank you. Bye.
Bye, Vern. Ciao.
