Computation as a Planetary Scale Phenomenon 
Computation as a Planetary Scale Phenomenon 
Payoshini Pandey, Western University

Theory and Criticism

Summary for Lay Audience 
Computers are a lot more than personal devices that entertain or inform us; the sum total of 
computational devices (anything from vehicles, phones, refrigerators, to buildings and roads) 
forms a megastructure across our planet. Is the growth and continuous expansion of this 
megastructure a mere accident? Are there deeper logics to be found that account for this? In 
this thesis, I argue that this is not mere happenstance. I treat computation as an 
���epistemological technology��� that expands across the planet by gathering and processing 
information in continual loops. Even though information ���feels��� intangible and abstract at 
first blush, it is a deeply material thing that enables us engineer novel infrastructures on and 
beyond Earth (for instance, satellites). To really understand why it becomes so impactful on 
such a large-scale, I look at various historical and philosophical factors that have been 
instrumental in shaping it. I put together a number of these accounts to prove that 
computation is, by design, a force that seeks to manifest on a planetary-scale. Ultimately, if 
we are to truly understand its potential, and redesign for the collective good, we must first 
understand its planetary nature.

The thesis presented by Payoshini Pandey at Western University, under the supervision of Dr. Antonio Calcagno and Dr. Nick Dyer-Witheford, explores the concept of computation beyond the confines of personal use, describing it as a planetary-scale phenomenon. This work suggests that the extensive network of computational devices ��� from phones to buildings and even satellites ��� forms a global infrastructure, not by mere chance, but as a deliberate expansion driven by specific epistemological and technological motivations.
Pandey treats computation as an 'epistemological technology'���a tool for knowledge gathering and processing that is both expansive and inherently material, despite its intangible feel. The thesis argues that to comprehend the significance of computation on such a vast scale and potentially harness it for collective benefit, one must first recognize and understand its design as a force meant to operate globally. This perspective is supported by a mix of historical and philosophical analyses that underscore the deliberate, designed nature of computational growth and its potential implications for future infrastructural developments on Earth and beyond.
