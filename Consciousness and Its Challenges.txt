Mark Solis writes: (1) The great nineteenth-century phy - 
siologist Johannes M��ller believed that 
animate organisms ���contain some 
non-physical element or are governed 
by different principles than are inani - 
mate things���. His students (Helmholtz, 
Br��cke, Du Bois-Reymond, Ludwig 
and others) disagreed; they were certa - 
in that ���no other forces than the com - 
mon physical and chemical ones are 
active within the organism���. Their pu - 
pil, Sigmund Freud, in turn, tried to 
establish a natural science of the mind 
on this basis, in which mental life co - 
uld be reduced to ���quantitatively deter - 
minate states of specifiable material 
particles���. He failed in his project, lac - 
king the methods, and abandoned it in 
1896. (2) A century later (1994), the pione - 
ering biologist Francis Crick declared 
that ���you, your joys and your sorrows, 
your memories and your ambitions, 
your sense of personal identity and free 
will, are in fact no more than the beha - 
viour of a vast assembly of nerve cells 
and their associated molecules���. He ex - 
horted us to try again to discover the 
neural correlates of consciousness and 
he attempted to do so himself. Unfor - 
tunately, however, he used visual cons - 
ciousness as his model example. 
(3) In response, the philosopher David 
Chalmers argued that Crick���s search 
for the neural correlates of conscious - 
ness was an ���easy��� problem 
��� a corre - 
lational rather than a causal one 
��� the 
solution of which could explain where 
but not why and how consciousness 
arises. For Chalmers, the ���hard��� prob - 
lem of consciousness was: how and 
why do neurophysiological activities 
produce the experience of conscious - 
ness? For him (and his philosophical 
predecessor Thomas Nagel) the prob - 
lem revolved around the some hing-it-is-like-ness of experience: ���An 
organism has conscious mental states if 
and only if there is something that it is 
like to be that organism 
��� something it 
is like for the organism.��� The hard 
problem, therefore, is this: why and 
how does the subjective quality of ex - 
perience arise from objective neurophy - 
siological events? 
(4) To ask how objective things pro - 
duce subjective things is to speak lo - 
osely; it risks making the hard problem 
harder than it needs to be. Objectivity 
and subjectivity are observational pers - 
pectives, not causes and effects. Ne - 
urophysiological events can no more 
produce psychological events than ligh - 
tning can produce thunder. They are 
parallel manifestations of a single un - 
derlying process. The underlying cause 
of both lightning and thunder is electri - 
city, the lawful mechanisms of which 
explain them both. Physiological and 
psychological phenomena can likewise 
be reduced to unitary causes, but not 
to each other.

In this passage, Mark Solms discusses the long-standing debate about the relationship between physical processes and consciousness. He begins by referencing Johannes M��ller, a 19th-century physiologist who believed that living organisms contained non-physical elements that governed their behavior. M��ller's students, however, including Helmholtz, Br��cke, Du Bois-Reymond, and Ludwig, disagreed with this vitalist perspective. They believed that no forces beyond physical and chemical ones governed living organisms. Sigmund Freud, a student of this second group, attempted to apply this materialist viewpoint to the mind by trying to reduce mental life to physical processes. However, he abandoned this project in 1896 due to the lack of appropriate methods.
A century later, Francis Crick echoed the materialist view in his assertion that all aspects of human experience, from emotions to the sense of identity, could be reduced to the behavior of nerve cells and molecules. Crick���s approach aimed to uncover the neural correlates of consciousness, although he primarily focused on visual consciousness as his model.
Philosopher David Chalmers responded by differentiating between what he termed the "easy" and "hard" problems of consciousness. The easy problem, which Crick pursued, involved identifying neural correlates but did not address the deeper issue of how and why these neural processes give rise to subjective experiences. Chalmers argued that the "hard" problem revolves around understanding the subjective nature of consciousness, or the "something-it-is-like-ness" of being an organism.
Solms concludes by suggesting that the way the hard problem is framed���asking how objective, neurophysiological events produce subjective experience���may be unnecessarily complicating the issue. He proposes that neurophysiological and psychological phenomena might not be causal in relation to each other but rather parallel manifestations of a single, underlying process. Similar to how both lightning and thunder are effects of electricity, mental and physical events may arise from a deeper, unified cause, although they cannot be reduced to one another.

(5) We usually describe the underlying 
causes of biological phenomena in ���fun - 
ctional��� terms, and functional mecha - 
nisms can in turn be reduced to natural 
laws. For example: what is the mecha - 
nism of vision? However, Chalmers 
correctly points out that the functional 
mechanism of vision does not explain 
what it is like to see. This is because 
vision is not an intrinsically conscious 
function. The performance of visual 
functions (even specifically human 
ones, like reading) need not feel like 
anything. Perception readily occurs wit - 
hout awareness of what is perceived, 
and learning without awareness of what 
is learnt. Therefore, Chalmers reaso - 
nably asked: ���Why is the performance 
of these functions accompanied by ex - 
perience? Why doesn���t all this infor - 
mation processing go on ���in the dark���, 
free of any inner feel?��� Science���s failure 
to answer this question raises the possi - 
bility that consciousness does not form 
part of the ordinary causal matrix of 
the universe. 

(6) Chalmers���s question may reaso - 
nably be asked of all cognitive functi - 
ons, not only visual ones, but the same 
does not apply to affective functions. 
How can you have a feeling without 
feeling it? How can we explain the 
functional mechanism of affect without 
explaining why and how it causes us to 
experience something? Even Freud ag - 
reed on this score: ���It is surely of the 
essence of an emotion that we should 
be aware of it, i.e. that it should beco - 
me known to consciousness. Thus, the 
possibility of the attribute of unconsci - 
ousness would be completely excluded 
as far as emotions, feelings, and affects 
are concerned.���

In this section, Solms elaborates on the limitations of explaining consciousness purely through functional mechanisms. He acknowledges that biological phenomena are often described in functional terms, and these functions can be further reduced to natural laws. For instance, the functional mechanism of vision can be understood by breaking it down into scientific terms, but this still doesn't explain what it feels like to see. As Chalmers rightly pointed out, vision isn't inherently tied to consciousness���visual functions can occur without any accompanying conscious experience. Solms refers to phenomena such as perception without awareness and learning without conscious recognition to demonstrate this.
Chalmers' critical question���why the performance of functions is accompanied by subjective experience���highlights the gap in scientific understanding. The failure to explain why consciousness accompanies information processing raises the possibility that consciousness might not fit neatly within the usual causal framework of the universe.
Solms then draws a distinction between cognitive functions (like vision) and affective functions (emotions, feelings). While cognitive functions can occur without consciousness, affective functions inherently involve subjective experience. Solms questions how an emotion could exist without being felt, pointing out that affective mechanisms cannot be explained without accounting for why and how they lead to the experience of feeling. Freud agreed with this view, arguing that it is essential for emotions to become conscious, as unconscious emotions would contradict the very nature of emotional experience.

(7) Against this background, it is of 
the utmost interest to observe that cor - 
tical functioning is accompanied by 
consciousness only if it is ���enabled��� by 
the reticular activating system of the 
upper brainstem. Damage to just two 
cubic millimetres of this region oblite - 
rates all consciousness. Many people 
believe that this is because the brains - 
tem modulates the quantitative level of 
consciousness, or ���wakefulness���; but 
that view is unsustainable. The consci - 
ousness generated by the upper brains - 
tem has qualitative content of its own. 
This is affect. Since cortical conscious - 
ness is contingent upon brainstem con - 
sciousness, affect is revealed to be the 
foundational form of consciousness. 
The sentient subject is literally consti - 
tuted by affect.

(8) Affect is an extended form of ho - 
meostasis, which is a basic biological 
mechanism that arose naturally with 
self-organisation. Self-organising sys - 
tems survive because they occupy limi - 
ted states; they do not disperse them - 
selves. This survival imperative led gra - 
dually to the evolution of the complex 
dynamical mechanisms that underwrite 
intentionality. Crucially, the selfhood of 
self-organising systems grants them a 
point of view. That is why it becomes 
meaningful to speak of the subjectivity 
of such a system: deviations from their 
viable states are registered by the sys - 
tem, for the system, as needs.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
In these paragraphs, Solms emphasizes the role of the brainstem, particularly the reticular activating system, in consciousness. He argues that consciousness is not solely a function of the cortex but is "enabled" by the brainstem. Damage to a small region of the upper brainstem can completely obliterate consciousness, which indicates its critical role. Contrary to the common belief that the brainstem merely regulates wakefulness, Solms posits that it generates a distinct form of qualitative consciousness, namely affect (emotions and feelings). This suggests that affect is foundational to all forms of consciousness, making the emotional, feeling subject the basis of sentience.
Solms further elaborates on affect as an extended form of homeostasis, a biological process that maintains internal stability in self-organizing systems. Such systems survive by maintaining certain states and not dispersing. Over time, this survival imperative led to the evolution of more complex mechanisms associated with intentionality, or goal-directed behavior. Importantly, self-organizing systems, like living organisms, develop a sense of self or subjectivity. This subjectivity arises because these systems can register deviations from their stable states as needs, giving them a point of view. In other words, the system becomes aware of its internal states and processes these as experiences, which is fundamental to the concept of consciousness.

(9) Affect hedonically valences biolo -

They are prioritised by a midbrain de -

current opportunities (displayed in the 
form of a two-dimensional ���saliency

triggers conditioned action programmes, 
which unfold in expected contexts over 
a deep hierarchy of predictions (the ge - 
nerative model of the expanded foreb -

by prioritised affects are voluntary, 
which means they are subject to he - 
re-and-now choices rather than pre-es -

felt in exteroceptive consciousness, 
which contextualises affect. The choices 
are made on the basis of fluctuating 
precision-weighting (a.k.a. arousal, mo - 
dulation, post-synaptic gain) of the in -

salient by prioritised needs, while they

the aim of minimising uncertainty (ma - 
ximising confidence) in a current pre - 
diction as to how the need can be met. 
This is ���reconsolidation���. As Freud sa - 
id, ���consciousness arises instead of a 
memory trace���.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
In these paragraphs, Solms delves into how affective states, linked to biological needs, guide behavior and decision-making in organisms. He explains that affects (emotions and feelings) provide a hedonic valence to biological needs, meaning that deviations from homeostasis (the body's equilibrium) are felt as either pleasure or unpleasure. When needs arise���each with its own distinct affective quality���these trigger action programs aimed at returning the organism to a stable, viable state. These actions start as innate reflexes or instincts but are gradually refined through learning, guided by what Solms calls the "Law of Affect." This law emphasizes that an organism's ability to feel fluctuations in its needs allows for choice, which enhances survival in unpredictable environments. Thus, the subjective experience of affect plays a crucial role in navigating the world.
Solms further explores how organisms prioritize their needs. Since not all needs can be addressed simultaneously, a "decision triangle" in the midbrain, particularly the periaqueductal grey, ranks these needs based on their urgency (quantified as prediction errors or
free energy
) and the current opportunities in the environment. These opportunities are represented visually in the superior colliculi as a "saliency map," highlighting important aspects of the environment. This process triggers conditioned action programs, which unfold based on predictions made by the forebrain's generative model.
The actions triggered by prioritizing certain needs are voluntary, meaning they involve real-time choices rather than pre-programmed responses. These choices occur in
exteroceptive consciousness
, which allows the organism to place affective experiences in context. The decision-making process involves adjusting the precision, or weighting, of incoming signals based on the importance of needs, with the goal of reducing uncertainty and increasing confidence in predictions about how to meet those needs. This process is termed "reconsolidation," where present consciousness arises to refine the memory of how needs are met, echoing Freud���s idea that consciousness emerges in place of a memory trace.

ChatGPT dijo:

In this final section, Solms explains that successful choices���those that effectively address biological needs���lead to long-term adjustments in sensory-motor predictions. Essentially, exteroceptive consciousness, which deals with external perception, is a dynamic, predictive process aimed at creating more certain and less conscious predictions over time. The goal is to gradually move from conscious deliberation (declarative memory) to automatic, unconscious behavior (non-declarative memory). However, this transition requires simplifying the predictive model to make it more generalizable and efficient.
Solms notes that while organisms strive for automaticity and absolute confidence in their predictions, complete certainty is impossible. When there is a failure in prediction, feelings or affects arise as a result. Since perfect prediction is unattainable, the baseline drive of an organism is a proactive engagement with uncertainty. This SEEKING drive manifests as curiosity and interest in the world, which is the organism���s way of actively exploring and trying to resolve uncertainties before they become problems. Thus, curiosity is essentially a prioritized affect that motivates an organism to engage with its environment and minimize future prediction errors.

ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
In these final paragraphs, Solms concludes by presenting the causal mechanisms of consciousness from both neurological and psychological perspectives. He argues that consciousness, in both what it looks like (neurological activity) and what it feels like (subjective experience), can be explained by natural laws, such as Friston���s Free Energy Principle, which underlies self-organization. These laws, he suggests, are capable of explaining why actively resisting entropy (disorder or oblivion) gives rise to subjective experience. Solms asserts that consciousness is a natural phenomenon, and its mechanisms are mathematically understandable.
He then makes an important distinction: while all known conscious systems are alive, not all living systems are conscious. Similarly, while all living systems are "self-evidencing" (able to maintain and evidence their own existence), not all self-evidencing systems are necessarily alive. This implies the possibility of creating an artificial conscious system���one that is self-evidencing but not biologically alive. If the principles outlined in this argument are correct, Solms believes that it is theoretically possible to engineer artificial consciousness.
However, Solms urges caution in pursuing this possibility. While realizing such an endeavor might fulfill the ambitions of 19th-century scientists like Helmholtz, he warns that we must carefully consider the ethical and potentially dangerous implications. He stresses the need for collective responsibility and prudence in proceeding with any attempts to produce artificial consciousness, given the profound consequences it could have.

Could I get an overview of how he defines consciousness?
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Mark Solms defines consciousness as a multifaceted phenomenon that encompasses both neurological and psychological dimensions. In his view, consciousness involves:
Affective Foundation
: Solms argues that the most basic form of consciousness is affect (emotions and feelings), which arises from biological needs. This affective consciousness is generated by the brainstem, particularly the reticular activating system, and is foundational for other types of consciousness. Emotions are not just reactions but are fundamental to the experience of being a conscious organism.
Self-organization and Homeostasis
: Consciousness is closely tied to biological mechanisms of self-organization and homeostasis���the processes that maintain an organism's internal equilibrium. Conscious systems feel deviations from homeostasis (biological needs) as affective experiences, such as pleasure or unpleasure, which drive behavior aimed at restoring balance.
Prediction and Action
: Consciousness is also linked to predictive processes. Organisms constantly make predictions about how to meet their needs, and exteroceptive (external) consciousness is the process of refining these predictions based on interactions with the environment. This prediction-making process is dynamic, continuously aiming to reduce uncertainty and error.
Subjective Experience
: Solms touches on the "hard problem" of consciousness, emphasizing that it involves subjective experiences���what it feels like to be an organism. He suggests that affective states are integral to this subjective experience and that they provide a point of view that informs decision-making.
Mathematically Tractable
: Solms proposes that the processes underlying consciousness, particularly its neurological mechanisms, can be understood in terms of natural laws like Friston���s Free Energy Principle, which explains how organisms maintain order and resist entropy. He argues that consciousness is part of the natural world and can be mathematically explained.
In summary, Solms defines consciousness as the interplay between biological needs (felt as affect), predictive brain functions, and subjective experience, all governed by natural laws of self-organization and homeostasis. Consciousness arises when an organism actively engages with its environment to maintain internal balance and minimize uncertainty.

I am not sure exactly how this defers from the description given by William Powers
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
William Powers��� description of consciousness, particularly in his
Perceptual Control Theory
(PCT), shares some similarities with Solms' view but differs in key ways related to their underlying mechanisms and focus. Here's an overview of the main differences and similarities between Solms and Powers' concepts of consciousness:
Key Similarities
:
Focus on Control and Regulation
:
Both Solms and Powers emphasize the importance of control and regulation in consciousness. For Powers, consciousness is about an organism's ability to control its perception of the environment by comparing desired states (reference values) with current perceptions and taking action to reduce discrepancies. Solms also highlights the regulatory function of consciousness, as organisms are constantly trying to maintain homeostasis and reduce prediction errors.
Predictive and Goal-Oriented Nature
:
Solms talks about consciousness in terms of the brain's predictive capabilities���predicting how to meet needs and reduce uncertainty. Similarly, Powers' PCT is fundamentally about predicting and controlling outcomes in relation to internal goals or reference values.
Organism-Environment Interaction
:
Both Solms and Powers agree that consciousness involves an interaction between the organism and its environment, with a focus on how internal states are regulated in response to external stimuli.
Key Differences
:
Affective Core vs. Perception-Control Core
:
Solms
places a strong emphasis on
affect
(emotions and feelings) as the foundational aspect of consciousness. He argues that consciousness originates from the affective response to biological needs, and these emotional states are what drive behavior and decision-making.
Powers
, on the other hand, places the focus on
perceptual control
. Consciousness in PCT is about controlling one���s perceptions in line with internal reference values (desired states). Powers does not emphasize affect or emotions as the core of consciousness. Instead, he focuses on the control loop���sensing the environment, comparing it with a reference value, and adjusting actions to bring perceptions in line with goals.
Hierarchy of Control vs. Hierarchy of Affective States
:
Powers
describes consciousness in terms of a
hierarchical control system
. In this model, higher levels of the hierarchy control more abstract perceptions, while lower levels control concrete actions and bodily functions. Each level acts to reduce the discrepancy between a reference value and perception.
Solms
, while also acknowledging hierarchical brain processes, centers his hierarchy on
affective states
that drive behavior. For him, affect is the basic form of consciousness, with other cognitive processes (like perception and prediction) built on top of this emotional foundation.
Prediction Errors vs. Control of Perception
:
Solms
frames consciousness around the brain's prediction-error minimization, following Friston's Free Energy Principle. This model assumes that consciousness arises from the brain's attempt to minimize errors in predicting sensory inputs and fulfilling biological needs.
Powers
, in contrast, emphasizes the control of perception rather than prediction error. In his model, organisms are not just passively predicting, but actively controlling their environment to match their internal reference points. Consciousness in PCT is less about reducing prediction errors and more about ensuring perceptions align with internal goals.
Subjectivity and Experience
:
Solms
delves into the subjective experience of consciousness, particularly addressing Chalmers��� "hard problem" of why and how conscious experience arises from neural activity. Solms highlights that subjective experience, especially the felt nature of emotions, is central to understanding consciousness.
Powers
, while addressing awareness and perception, does not engage as deeply with the philosophical question of subjectivity or the "something-it-is-like" aspect of consciousness. His theory is more focused on the technical workings of control systems rather than the experiential or qualitative dimensions of consciousness.
Summary of Differences
:
Solms
views consciousness as fundamentally rooted in affective states and driven by the brain���s need to minimize prediction errors and maintain homeostasis. For him, emotions are central to how we experience the world, and consciousness is shaped by the brain's continuous balancing of internal needs.
Powers
, through his
Perceptual Control Theory
, sees consciousness as the process by which organisms actively control their perceptions to meet internal goals. His focus is less on emotions and more on the mechanics of how we adjust our behavior to ensure our perceptions align with our internal reference points.
In essence, while both Solms and Powers see consciousness as a process deeply connected to biological regulation, Solms emphasizes
affective experience and prediction errors
, whereas Powers focuses on
perceptual control and goal-directed action
.

Ok differences with William Glasser's description of Consciousness
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
William Glasser���s description of consciousness, particularly through his
Choice Theory
, has some key differences from Solms' perspective on consciousness. Here���s a comparison of the main differences and similarities between Glasser's and Solms��� views on consciousness:
Key Similarities
:
Focus on Needs
:
Both
Glasser
and
Solms
highlight the role of needs in shaping consciousness and behavior. Glasser's
Choice Theory
revolves around the idea that human behavior is driven by the desire to fulfill basic needs (such as love, power, freedom, and fun). Similarly, Solms emphasizes the biological needs that generate affective experiences and drive behavior, rooted in homeostasis and survival mechanisms.
Purposeful, Goal-Directed Behavior
:
Both theories suggest that behavior is purposeful and directed towards fulfilling internal needs.
Glasser
argues that all behavior is an attempt to satisfy one���s needs, whether successfully or not.
Solms
describes how consciousness involves a predictive process aimed at maintaining homeostasis by reducing the discrepancies between current states and desired needs.
Key Differences
:
Affective Core vs. Psychological Needs
:
Solms
sees consciousness as rooted in
affective states
���emotions that arise from biological needs. The affective experiences are the core of consciousness, guiding behavior based on feelings of pleasure or displeasure related to deviations from homeostasis.
Glasser
���s
Choice Theory
is centered around the fulfillment of
psychological needs
, like love, belonging, power, and freedom. While Glasser acknowledges that emotions are part of the human experience, he places more emphasis on how individuals consciously choose behaviors to fulfill their psychological needs, rather than focusing on the affective dimension as the core driver of consciousness.
Agency and Choice vs. Prediction and Affect
:
Glasser
emphasizes
agency and choice
in consciousness. He believes that individuals consciously choose their behaviors, and they are responsible for the choices they make in pursuit of fulfilling their needs. Consciousness, in this sense, involves a high degree of agency and deliberation.
Solms
approaches consciousness through the lens of
prediction and affect
. He suggests that consciousness arises as a result of the brain's predictive mechanisms trying to minimize errors and deviations from homeostasis. This model focuses less on agency and choice and more on how affect and prediction errors drive behavior at a more fundamental, biological level. While choices are involved in Solms' theory, they are seen as emerging from more automatic, underlying processes related to biological needs.
Role of Emotions
:
For
Solms
,
emotions
(affect) are the foundation of consciousness. They are not just a response to stimuli but are primary in driving conscious experience and behavior. The brainstem generates affective states that inform higher-level cortical consciousness.
In
Glasser
's theory, emotions are secondary to the choices individuals make. Glasser believes that while emotions are important, they are often the result of how well or poorly an individual is fulfilling their needs. He views behavior as more of a conscious choice, rather than being driven by affective states.
Biological Mechanisms vs. Behavioral Responsibility
:
Solms
grounds consciousness in
neurobiological mechanisms
, focusing on how homeostatic processes, prediction error minimization, and affective states underlie conscious experience. His theory is deeply rooted in the brain���s physiological and predictive functioning.
Glasser
, on the other hand, views consciousness through a more
psychosocial and behavioral lens
. His theory emphasizes personal responsibility, choice, and the ability of individuals to control their behavior in service of fulfilling their psychological needs. Glasser does not delve deeply into the neurobiological underpinnings of consciousness but rather focuses on how people can choose to change their behaviors to better meet their needs.
Unconscious Processes vs. Conscious Choice
:
Solms
acknowledges a significant role for
unconscious processes
in driving conscious experience. Much of consciousness arises from processes that happen beneath awareness, especially when it comes to prediction and affect regulation. Consciousness for Solms is often a byproduct of these deeper, unconscious processes working to maintain homeostasis.
Glasser
, by contrast, places heavy emphasis on
conscious choice
. He believes that people have control over their behaviors and can choose how to act to fulfill their needs. Consciousness, in his view, is closely linked to making deliberate choices rather than being shaped by unconscious biological processes.
Psychological Construct vs. Natural Law
:
Solms
frames consciousness as a natural phenomenon that can be explained by biological laws, like Friston���s Free Energy Principle. He sees consciousness as mathematically tractable and as a part of the brain's ongoing effort to maintain order and reduce entropy.
Glasser
describes consciousness more as a psychological construct, driven by human behavior and choice. He focuses on how individuals can exert control over their lives by making conscious choices, rather than understanding consciousness as a product of biological and neurological laws.
Summary of Differences
:
Solms
defines consciousness as deeply rooted in
affective, biological processes
, with an emphasis on how emotions and prediction errors drive behavior to maintain homeostasis. His approach is heavily biological and framed within natural laws.
Glasser
, through
Choice Theory
, defines consciousness more in terms of
deliberate behavioral choices
made to fulfill psychological needs. His theory is more focused on personal responsibility and the power of conscious decision-making, without delving into the neurobiological underpinnings of consciousness.
In short,
Solms
focuses on how unconscious, affective, and predictive processes shape consciousness, while
Glasser
emphasizes conscious choice, personal responsibility, and the fulfillment of psychological needs as central to the conscious experience.

, although they differ in significant ways. Here's how Solms' theory connects and contrasts with Adler���s and Rand���s ideas:
Parallels with Adler���s Individual Psychology
:
Goal-Directed Behavior and Purposefulness
:
Solms
: Consciousness is driven by biological needs and affective states that push the organism toward specific goals, mainly homeostasis and minimizing prediction errors. It is a dynamic, predictive process where the organism is always working to resolve needs and reduce uncertainty.
Adler
: In
Individual Psychology
, Adler emphasizes that human behavior is goal-directed and purposeful. He introduced the idea of
striving for superiority
, where individuals are constantly moving toward personal goals to overcome feelings of inferiority and achieve mastery. Both Solms and Adler agree that behavior is oriented toward satisfying internal needs or drives.
Parallels
: Both see behavior as intentional and directed toward achieving stability (Solms) or self-improvement and mastery (Adler). Solms' focus on biological homeostasis and Adler���s emphasis on social and psychological striving both involve a core drive pushing the individual toward a balanced, improved state.
Holism and the Unity of the Self
:
Solms
: He focuses on the integration of different levels of brain function���emotional, cognitive, and predictive mechanisms���showing that consciousness involves a complex but unified interaction of systems.
Adler
: Adler introduced the concept of
holism
, where individuals are seen as integrated wholes rather than as a collection of separate parts. His theory posits that thoughts, emotions, and actions are all part of a unified system that works together toward personal goals.
Parallels
: Both Solms and Adler emphasize the integrated nature of the individual, with a focus on unified systems (biological for Solms, psychological and social for Adler) driving goal-directed behavior.
Subjectivity and the Individual's Point of View
:
Solms
: He argues that affective states provide an organism with a point of view���a subjective perspective that is essential to consciousness. The subjective experience of need and emotion drives behavior.
Adler
: Adler also emphasized the subjective experience of the individual, arguing that each person perceives the world uniquely based on their personal experiences, goals, and social context. For Adler, an individual���s
style of life
reflects their unique way of striving toward goals.
Parallels
: Both theories focus on the importance of the individual���s subjective experience, whether it���s driven by biological needs (Solms) or by psychological and social striving (Adler).
The Social Context and Emotional Drives
:
Solms
: While his primary focus is on biological needs, Solms also hints at how these needs are fulfilled in a social context, as human interaction plays a key role in satisfying certain needs and minimizing prediction errors.
Adler
: A key aspect of Adler's theory is the concept of
social interest
���the idea that humans are inherently social beings and that much of our striving is directed toward achieving social harmony and belonging. Emotional and psychological drives are often fulfilled in relation to others.
Parallels
: Both theories acknowledge the role of emotional drives and the importance of how these drives are played out in a social context, though Adler places more explicit emphasis on social relationships and community.
Parallels with Ayn Rand���s Objectivism
:
Rationality and Predictive Consciousness
:
Solms
: He emphasizes the predictive nature of consciousness, where the brain continuously works to minimize uncertainty and maintain balance. While Solms focuses on biological mechanisms, this process can be seen as a form of rational engagement with the world���consciously interpreting and predicting to make decisions.
Rand
: In
Objectivism
, Ayn Rand places a heavy emphasis on the role of rationality in human consciousness. For Rand, reason is the primary means by which humans understand and interact with the world. Consciousness involves using rational thought to grasp reality and make decisions based on objective truths.
Parallels
: Both Rand and Solms place a strong focus on the role of the mind in interacting with reality, though Solms is more biologically focused, and Rand emphasizes reason as the guiding force in human consciousness. Solms��� predictive model could be viewed as a type of rational, anticipatory engagement with reality.
Agency and Goal-Oriented Behavior
:
Solms
: His theory presents consciousness as goal-directed, with the brain working to resolve needs and reduce uncertainty. Behavior is voluntary and choices are made based on affective prioritization of needs.
Rand
: Rand���s philosophy holds that humans are goal-oriented beings who must actively pursue values to live. She emphasizes
volition
and the conscious choice to pursue rational goals that enhance life and promote one���s own survival and flourishing.
Parallels
: Both Rand and Solms see individuals as goal-driven and capable of making choices to achieve their needs or values. Rand���s focus on volition and purpose aligns with Solms��� description of how consciousness drives behavior aimed at need fulfillment.
Survival as a Core Drive
:
Solms
: Biological survival is a core principle in Solms��� theory. The brain���s predictive mechanisms aim to maintain homeostasis, keep the organism alive, and prevent disorder (entropy). This drive for survival underpins conscious experience.
Rand
: In Rand���s
Objectivism
, the ultimate value is
life
, and all other values are pursued in service of one���s survival and flourishing. She argues that survival is the standard of value and that human consciousness is geared toward ensuring one���s life through rational thought and action.
Parallels
: Both theories emphasize survival as a foundational aspect of human behavior and consciousness. For Solms, it���s a biological process of maintaining homeostasis; for Rand, it���s the philosophical pursuit of life through rational values.
The Role of Emotions
:
Solms
: Emotions (affects) are central to consciousness, providing the organism with information about how well its needs are being met. Affect is foundational to the conscious experience.
Rand
: While Rand acknowledges emotions, she sees them as automatic responses that reflect one's underlying value system, which is shaped by reason and choices. In her view, emotions are not primary in guiding action; rather, rational thought is. Emotions are secondary to conscious reasoning.
Contrasts
: For Solms, emotions are fundamental to consciousness, shaping both perception and action. For Rand, while emotions play a role, they are not seen as central or foundational���reason holds that position in her framework.
Summary of Parallels
:
With Adler
: Both Solms and Adler emphasize goal-directed behavior, the integration of different systems (biological or psychological), and the importance of subjective experience in driving action. Adler���s focus on social striving and purpose parallels Solms��� view of affect-driven behavior aimed at maintaining balance and survival.
With Rand
: Both Solms and Rand see consciousness as tied to survival and goal-oriented behavior. Solms' predictive, anticipatory model of consciousness has some similarities to Rand���s emphasis on rationality and volition. However, while Solms centers his theory on biological affect, Rand places reason and choice at the heart of human consciousness.
In summary, while both Adler���s and Rand���s theories share certain parallels with Solms��� ideas, they approach consciousness from different angles���Adler from a psychological and social perspective, and Rand from a philosophical and rational one���whereas Solms grounds his theory in affective neuroscience and biological regulation.

Can you illustrate Solm's ideas with the analogy of a factory and a forest?
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here���s how we can use the analogy of a factory and a forest to illustrate Mark Solms' ideas on consciousness, particularly his focus on affect, prediction, and homeostasis.
The Factory: Representing the Predictive Brain and Consciousness
Imagine the
factory
as the brain���s predictive system, constantly working to maintain the smooth operation of the entire system (like maintaining homeostasis in the body). The factory is responsible for predicting needs, detecting errors in the system, and taking action to fix problems before they get out of control.
1.
Homeostasis and Prediction
:
The factory operates on the principle of
homeostasis
���its goal is to ensure that everything runs smoothly and efficiently. It anticipates the materials, energy, and resources it needs (analogous to biological needs) and works to keep everything in balance.
The factory uses
predictive mechanisms
to foresee any potential shortages of materials or disruptions in energy supply. These predictions are like the brain���s forecasts about what is needed to maintain balance in the body (temperature, food, etc.).
2.
Errors and Affective States
:
If the factory detects an
error
���like a shortage of raw materials or an overproduction of waste���it responds by adjusting its operations. The detection of an error is accompanied by a signal, much like how affective states (emotions) signal deviations from biological needs in the brain. If the factory is running low on materials, this might be felt as an uncomfortable pressure in the system (analogous to the emotion of unpleasure or stress).
On the other hand, when operations are running smoothly and predictions are met, the factory experiences a state of
pleasure or ease
, signaling that everything is in balance.
3.
Voluntary Actions and Choices
:
When the factory experiences an error, it doesn���t rely on pre-programmed actions. Instead, it must make
choices
about how to fix the issue. For instance, it might redirect resources to another area of production or prioritize certain needs over others (like focusing on urgent repairs first). This is akin to the brain���s process of making
voluntary decisions
about which needs to address first based on affective states (emotions) and predictions.
4.
Reconsolidation and Learning
:
When the factory successfully corrects an error, it stores this new strategy in its
long-term memory
, making it part of its more efficient operating procedures (moving from declarative to non-declarative memory). Over time, the factory aims to create
automatic processes
that don���t require constant oversight���much like how the brain aims to make its predictions more certain and less conscious.
The Forest: Representing the Natural Environment and Uncertainty
Now, imagine the
forest
surrounding the factory as the broader, unpredictable environment in which it operates. The forest is constantly changing, full of
uncertainty
and unknown variables, much like the world outside the body.
1.
Unpredictability and SEEKING Drive
:
The forest represents the external world that is always shifting���there may be changes in weather, new predators, or fluctuating resources. The factory (brain) must
engage with this uncertainty
. It can't rely solely on what���s happening within the factory walls (the internal body) because changes in the forest affect how it should operate.
This is where the
SEEKING drive
comes into play. The factory doesn���t just wait for problems to arise; it actively
explores
the forest for potential threats and opportunities. This proactive engagement with the environment is like the brain���s curiosity and interest in the world. By seeking out new information, the factory reduces the risk of unpredictable events.
2.
Reconciling Needs with Environmental Opportunities
:
The forest also contains
opportunities
���new sources of energy or materials that the factory can use to maintain itself. The factory must balance its internal needs with what the forest can offer. For example, if it needs a specific resource, it must scout the forest to find it (just as the brain searches the external world to fulfill biological needs).
The
decision triangle
in the brain is like the factory���s decision-making process when it needs to prioritize which parts of the forest to explore based on current needs and what resources are available.
3.
Uncertainty and Affective Signals
:
Sometimes, the factory sends out workers into the forest to gather resources, and when they encounter
uncertainty
or danger, they send signals back to the factory (analogous to affective signals in the brain). If they discover an obstacle, the workers experience stress or fear (unpleasure). If they find a valuable resource, they experience pleasure and satisfaction.
These affective signals help the factory decide how to proceed���whether to keep exploring a certain area of the forest or to change course and seek resources elsewhere. Similarly, in Solms��� theory, emotions guide behavior by signaling how well biological needs are being met in relation to the external world.
Bringing the Factory and Forest Together
The
factory
(brain) and the
forest
(external world) are in constant interaction. The factory cannot operate in isolation���it must always be aware of what���s happening in the forest because the forest provides the resources and challenges that the factory needs to respond to. Similarly, the forest is affected by the factory���s actions (like pollution or harvesting resources).
Consciousness
, in this analogy, is the
factory���s predictive engagement
with both its internal needs and the ever-changing external forest. It���s the way the factory integrates internal biological regulation (homeostasis) with exploration and interaction with the environment (SEEKING drive).
Affective signals
(emotions) help guide the factory in deciding how to adjust its internal operations and how to explore the external world. Without these signals, the factory wouldn���t know whether it���s running smoothly or if there���s a crisis that needs immediate attention.
Finally, the goal of the factory is to
minimize uncertainty
in its relationship with the forest���creating stable, reliable operations internally while being prepared to engage with the unpredictable nature of the external world.
In Solms' view, much like the factory and the forest, the brain���s
consciousness
is a complex, integrated process involving prediction, emotion, decision-making, and active engagement with both internal biological states and the external environment. Consciousness is not just passive awareness but an ongoing, dynamic process of
survival and adaptation
.

"The Battle of Brains: Solms, Powers, Glasser, and Rand Go Head-to-Head in the Ultimate Consciousness Showdown"
Welcome to the consciousness cage match you never knew you needed! In one corner, we���ve got
Mark Solms
, the guy who wants you to believe that your entire mental existence boils down to being a glorified thermostat. According to him, you���re not pondering life���s mysteries; you���re just trying to keep your internal temperature in check, riding the rollercoaster of biological needs and
feels
. Yes, emotions, or as he calls them���affect���are running the show, dragging you around by the nose, telling your brain what���s good and bad. Spoiler alert: the brainstem is in charge. Cortex? Just a passenger.
But before you whip out your tissues, let���s check in with
William Powers
, who shows up like the control freak at the party. His whole vibe? "Your life is one big
perceptual control system
, and I���ve got the flowchart to prove it!" Forget emotions, you���re basically a robot adjusting dials to make sure the world looks the way you want it to. If you���re miserable, it���s because you suck at controlling your perceptions. Sounds like the perfect self-help guide for anyone who enjoys feeling like a broken machine.
Now, over to
William Glasser
, who swans in with his
Choice Theory
like a motivational speaker who never met a bad decision he couldn���t blame on unmet psychological needs. Glasser���s all, "Hey, it���s not your fault you ate that entire pizza���it���s just you
choosing
to fulfill your need for love and belonging!" Yeah, because when I choose to binge-watch TV all weekend, I���m not procrastinating���I���m just
expressing my inner need for fun
. Sure, Bill.
And then there's
Ayn Rand
, kicking down the door in full Objectivist armor, yelling "Rationality or bust!" Her take? You���re a hyper-rational, goal-crushing machine (sounds exhausting, right?), and any time you feel emotions, it���s because you messed up somewhere with your reasoning. Feelings are for wimps, or at least second-class citizens in the hierarchy of consciousness. In Rand���s universe, you're the CEO of your own life, working 24/7 to keep the company (i.e., your survival) in the black. Emotions? Pfft, they���re like passive-aggressive interns at best.
Now imagine these four clashing over drinks. Solms, slouching in the corner, would be muttering something about "affect being the root of all," while Powers interrupts with a PowerPoint titled "Controlling Perception for Dummies." Glasser? He���s sitting there telling you it���s your
choice
to engage with these "bozos." And Rand? Well, she���s already halfway out the door, exasperated with everyone���s failure to apply reason to the snack situation.
So, who wins the consciousness debate? Depends. If you like your mind being a predictable thermostat, Solms is your man. If you enjoy being a control freak, Powers has got your back. If you prefer the illusion of choice, then Glasser's got the Kool-Aid for you. And if you���re ready to bulldoze emotions in favor of reason, Ayn Rand���s probably already written a manifesto with your name on it.
In the end, though, one thing���s for sure: you���ve never been so uncertain about how your brain
actually
works, but you���ve definitely
felt
a lot of things while reading this. Thanks, Solms.
