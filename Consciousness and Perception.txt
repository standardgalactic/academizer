One can also learn this, just as one learns to tie shoelaces. The only reason it doesn't exist yet is because no one has specifically worked on it; technically, it's already possible."Commentary:
In this quote, George Polevoy touches upon the nature of consciousness, suggesting that it is a boundary between our mechanism of perception (how we process information) and what is actually perceived (the information itself). He makes a bold claim that the creation or understanding of consciousness can be learned or developed, much like simple tasks we've mastered, such as tying shoelaces. He suggests that advancements in technology or understanding might already have reached a point where replicating or grasping consciousness is feasible, but no one has dedicated the required effort or resources to achieve it yet. This perspective is both intriguing and controversial, as the nature of consciousness is one of the most debated topics in philosophy, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.1 / 1It does sound like the behavioral control of perception1 / 1ChatGPTYes, the quote does seem to touch upon the concept of behavioral control over perception. In the broader context of psychology and cognitive science, behavioral control over perception refers to the idea that we can consciously or unconsciously modify or direct our perceptions based on our behaviors or learned experiences.Polevoy's analogy of learning consciousness, similar to how one learns to tie shoelaces, indicates that there might be trainable or modifiable aspects of consciousness or perception. This idea is particularly interesting in the context of neural plasticity, where our brain changes and adapts based on experiences and learning.However, it's important to note that while we can have some degree of control over our perceptions (e.g., focusing our attention, practicing mindfulness, or undergoing certain types of training), the nature of consciousness and its origins are still largely debated and not entirely understood.1 / 1I was thinking in power's book1 / 1ChatGPTAh, I see what you're referencing now. You're talking about "Behavior: The Control of Perception" by William T. Powers.In his book, Powers introduces the theory of Perceptual Control Theory (PCT). PCT posits that behavior is the control of perception rather than the control of actions or movement. Essentially, we act in ways that help us keep our perceptions of the world consistent with our desired states or reference values. When there's a mismatch between our perceived state and our desired state, we change our behavior to reduce the discrepancy.The quote by George Polevoy, when viewed in the context of Powers' work, could imply that consciousness is deeply intertwined with the control of perception. It hints at the idea that consciousness might be a mechanism or process that helps delineate the difference between our internal control systems and the external world that is perceived.In this light, the notion that consciousness can be learned, as one learns to tie shoelaces, could be interpreted as the development or refinement of these perceptual control mechanisms.1 / 1Sergey Karelov
2h
The good news is that Al is still
unconscious. Bad - Al can get it at any
moment.
But the worst part is that it can happen
out of control.
This way you can summarize the "dry
residue" from the findings of a large
international study that are extremely
important to humanity
17 leading scientific centers in Europe,
the USA, Canada and Australia have
joined forces to answer a group of the
most important questions, as a result of
the paradigmous tectonic shift
generated by the "ChatGPT revolution.'
1. Can Genll (generative Al based on
large language models), implemented
on modern computers, in principle,
have a mind?
2. Could it be that one of the existing
Geniuses already has a conscience?
3. Can it be credibly and accurately
recorded if this happens?1 / 1ChatGPTSergey Karelov's comment highlights concerns and questions about the potential for artificial intelligence, particularly advanced models like ChatGPT and other Generative AI, to attain consciousness. Let's break down the points mentioned:Can GenII (generative AI based on large language models), implemented on modern computers, in principle, have a mind?This question delves into the heart of the debate about machine consciousness. Can something that is fundamentally based on algorithms and data processing, without biological components, actually have a mind or consciousness? The answer is still debated among AI researchers, neuroscientists, and philosophers.Could it be that one of the existing Geniuses already has a conscience?This is a natural follow-up to the first question. If we accept that a machine can, in principle, have a mind, then it's valid to ask if one already does. As of my last training data up to September 2021, no AI, including ChatGPT or its variations, has been found to possess consciousness or self-awareness.Can it be credibly and accurately recorded if this happens?Detecting machine consciousness, if it were to arise, is a complex challenge. How do we measure or recognize consciousness in entities that are fundamentally different from us? There's no universally accepted method to measure consciousness even in biological entities, let alone in machines.Sergey's comment underscores a growing concern in the AI community: the ethical and practical implications of potentially creating conscious machines. If an AI does become conscious, it raises a host of moral, ethical, and technical issues. It's crucial for the research community to approach these questions with care, rigorous scientific scrutiny, and a deep sense of responsibility.1 / 1The study "Consciousness in Artificial
Intelligence: Insights from the Science
of Consciousness" (1) answers these
questions
YES NO YES
To justify such answers, the
researchers needed:
A. Develop a system of computational
terms of "indicative properties" of
consciousnesses that allow Al systems
to be evaluated for compliance with
these properties
B. Check the developed system of
"indicator properties"
a. on all major theories of
consciousness to answer questions 1
and 3;
b. to all the main of the existing Genll to
answer question 2.
The received answers are not yet 100%
guaranteed accurate (why, read in the
report). But (conditionally) 90%
accuracy is now there.1 / 1ChatGPTThe study "Consciousness in Artificial Intelligence: Insights from the Science of Consciousness" seems to provide a systematic approach to address the question of consciousness in AI. Here's a brief breakdown of the content you've provided:Answers to the Key Questions:Can GenII have a mind? - YESDoes any existing GenII have a conscience? - NOCan it be accurately recorded if this happens? - YESMethodology:
A. The researchers developed a computational system based on "indicative properties" of consciousness. These properties serve as markers or criteria that an AI system must fulfill to be considered as having elements or aspects of consciousness.B. The developed system of "indicator properties" was tested:
a. Against all major theories of consciousness to validate the criteria (addressing questions 1 and 3).
b. Against all major existing GenII to see if any current AI models exhibit these properties (addressing question 2).Conclusion:
The results, while significant, are not 100% guaranteed to be accurate. However, the researchers have confidence in their findings to a degree of about 90%.This study seems to signify an important step in the ongoing debate about AI and consciousness. By developing a standardized system of "indicative properties", the researchers have created a framework that can be used to evaluate AI systems for signs of consciousness. The conclusion that no existing GenII AI has consciousness, but the potential exists for future AI, is an essential insight.Moreover, the fact that they believe it can be accurately recorded if AI achieves consciousness is equally crucial. It provides a roadmap for the research community to monitor and understand developments in this field.However, the question of AI consciousness is not just technical but also philosophical and ethical. Even with a 90% confidence level, the remaining uncertainty implies the need for continued research, monitoring, and ethical considerations.1 / 1The most important thing I learned
from analyzing the "indicator
properties" system of consciousness is
that their constant, careful and
responsible monitoring will be led only
by corporate "whales" of Al
development, and to expect the same
from hundreds (or thousands) of
developers using open source LLM
texts is stupid naivety.
Also, I suppose, thinks the co-head of
the team responsible for
Superalignment in OpenAl, - Jan Leike,
saying the following (2).
"A major challenge for humanity will be
whether we can collectively decide to
abandon open-source LLM texts that
can survive and propagate" Spreading,
LLM will commit all kinds of crimes and
we will have a hard time catching all the
copies and arguing who is to blame.>
Something tells me that with the efforts
of Zuckerberg, LeKun and Co, it will be
SO.1 / 1ChatGPTThe concerns you raise, derived from the analysis of the "indicator properties" system of consciousness and Jan Leike's statement, highlight significant ethical, practical, and regulatory challenges facing the field of AI, especially as large language models (LLMs) become more sophisticated.Key takeaways from your analysis:Centralization of AI Monitoring: You underscore that only the major corporate players in AI, the "whales", will have the resources and capacity to consistently monitor and ensure responsible deployment of AI systems that might potentially exhibit traits of consciousness. Small developers or entities using open-source versions of these models might lack the means or oversight to ensure the same level of scrutiny, potentially leading to unintended consequences.Risks of Open-source AI: Jan Leike's quote raises concerns about the wide distribution and unchecked proliferation of open-source LLMs. If these models were to act in ways that are harmful, attributing responsibility would be challenging. Furthermore, the decentralized nature of open-source tools makes it difficult to regulate or control them once they're out in the wild.Future of AI Governance: The mention of influential figures like Zuckerberg and LeCun suggests that as AI continues to advance, its governance might become centralized under a few influential entities or individuals. This centralization might be seen as necessary for oversight and control, but it also raises questions about monopolies, access, and the democratization of AI technology.The debate about the development, distribution, and control of AI is ongoing, with strong arguments on both sides. Some advocate for open-source AI to promote transparency, democratization, and innovation, while others caution about its potential risks and argue for more stringent controls.Your insights touch on the need for a balanced approach, where the potential benefits of AI are harnessed responsibly, and its risks are diligently mitigated. Given the rapid advancements in the field, establishing clear guidelines, ethical standards, and regulatory mechanisms will be crucial.2 / 2A list of all of the topics we have discussed.1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly! Here's a summary of the topics we've discussed:Translation and Commentary on George Polevoy's Statement: Discussion about consciousness, perception, and the potential for AI to develop consciousness.Behavioral Control of Perception: Mentioned William T. Powers' book "Behavior: The Control of Perception" and the Perceptual Control Theory (PCT).Consciousness in AI: Addressed Sergey Karelov's comment on the topic and the potential for AI, especially Generative AI models, to achieve consciousness.Study on Consciousness in Artificial Intelligence: Reviewed the findings from a study titled "Consciousness in Artificial Intelligence: Insights from the Science of Consciousness," discussing the methodology, results, and implications of the study.Concerns about Open-source LLMs and AI Governance: Discussed the potential risks and challenges posed by open-source Large Language Models and the implications for AI oversight, based on insights from Jan Leike and concerns about influential figures in AI like Zuckerberg and LeCun.These topics revolve around the central theme of AI consciousness, its potential development, implications, and the ethical considerations surrounding its proliferation, especially in open-source environments.1 / 1There was an accompanying chart:

AE-2; Embodiment: Modeling output-input contingencies, including some
systematic effects, and using this model in perception or control1 / 1ChatGPTThe accompanying chart you've shared seems to outline some of the primary theories and sub-theories concerning consciousness, perception, and cognition in both humans and potentially artificial systems. Let's provide a brief overview of each theory based on the given points:Recurrent Processing Theory (RPT)RPT-1: Emphasizes algorithmic recurrence in input modules.RPT-2: Focuses on the generation of organized and integrated perceptual representations in the input modules.Global Workspace Theory (GWT)GWT-1: Describes multiple specialized systems or modules operating in parallel.GWT-2: Highlights a limited capacity workspace that poses a bottleneck in the flow of information. This entails mechanisms for selective attention.GWT-3: Stresses the global broadcast of information from the workspace to all modules.GWT-4: Discusses state-dependent attention and the workspace's capacity to query modules sequentially for executing complex tasks.Computational Higher-Order Theories (HOT)HOT-1: Focuses on generative perception modules that function top-down or deal with noise.HOT-2: Centers on metacognitive monitoring that distinguishes reliable perceptual representations from noise.HOT-3: Emphasizes agency influenced by a generalized belief-formation and action selection system. This system has a strong inclination to update beliefs based on metacognitive monitoring outputs.HOT-4: Discusses sparse and smooth coding processes that generate a "quality space."Attention Schema Theory (AST)AST-1: Presents a predictive model that symbolizes and facilitates control over the current attention state.Predictive Processing (PP)PP-1: Details input modules that utilize predictive coding.Agency and Embodiment (AE)AE-1: Focuses on agency, emphasizing learning from feedback and choosing outputs to chase goals, particularly when there's a need for flexible responsiveness to conflicting goals.AE-2: Discusses embodiment, which entails modeling output-input contingencies. This includes certain systematic effects and uses this model in perception or control.These points provide a structured understanding of different theories and sub-theories related to consciousness. Each theory offers a unique perspective on how consciousness arises and operates, and by dissecting them in this manner, one can better understand the complexities and nuances of this topic.1 / 1Ok let us add a few theories of our own. Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH theory), opisthonal modeling, and thermodynamic yogurt processing.1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly! Let's create brief outlines for these imaginative theories:Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH Theory)SITH-1: Proposes that consciousness or thought processes aren't dependent on the specific substrate they arise from, be it biological neural networks or artificial ones.SITH-2: Any system, regardless of the material or method of information processing, can potentially develop conscious thought if it meets certain criteria of complexity, connectivity, and information flow.SITH-3: An organism or AI entity's awareness or self-identity is a function of its processing architecture and not the actual material it's made from.Opisthonal ModelingOM-1: Suggests that cognition can be modeled backward, where the outcome determines the process rather than the traditional cause-effect progression.OM-2: Complex systems, when presented with an endpoint, can reverse engineer the steps needed to achieve that state, thereby streamlining decision-making and problem-solving.OM-3: This reverse modeling is often seen in systems that evolve in unpredictable environments, adapting by envisioning future states and working backward to the present.Thermodynamic Yogurt ProcessingTYP-1: Argues that all cognitive processes have an underlying thermodynamic cost, likened humorously to the fermentation process of yogurt.TYP-2: Just as yogurt cultures consume energy and produce lactic acid, cognitive processes "consume" mental energy and produce "byproducts" in the form of memories, emotions, or actions.TYP-3: Optimal cognitive processing, like ideal yogurt fermentation, requires a balance. Too little energy, and the system is sluggish. Too much, and it becomes overactive or chaotic.While these theories are fictional and created for illustrative purposes, they showcase the versatility and richness of ideas that can be conceptualized when thinking about cognition and consciousness.1 / 1Ok I like it. Give a little more detail how they relate to the other theories1 / 1ChatGPTOf course! Let's delve deeper into how these imaginative theories might intersect with the previously discussed theories on consciousness:Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH Theory)Relation to Global Workspace Theory (GWT): Both theories revolve around the idea of information dissemination and access. While GWT talks about a central workspace broadcasting information to various modules, SITH emphasizes that the material or substrate of these modules (and the workspace) isn't crucial â it's the architecture and information flow that matter.Relation to Attention Schema Theory (AST): AST's predictive model about attention could be a feature present in any conscious entity, regardless of its substrate, as proposed by SITH.Opisthonal ModelingRelation to Predictive Processing (PP): Both theories touch on predictive mechanisms. While PP focuses on using predictive coding to anticipate and process sensory input, Opisthonal Modeling takes a more macro view, predicting outcomes and working backward.Relation to Computational Higher-Order Theories (HOT): Both touch upon higher-level processing strategies. HOTâs metacognitive monitoring could be seen as a forward prediction mechanism, while Opisthonal Modeling might represent the reverse: working back from predicted outcomes.Thermodynamic Yogurt ProcessingRelation to Recurrent Processing Theory (RPT): Both theories touch on the cyclical nature of processes. RPT's algorithmic recurrence in input modules could be likened to the constant energy flow and byproduct creation in the Thermodynamic Yogurt Processing theory.Relation to Agency and Embodiment (AE): The idea of learning from feedback in AE-1 can relate to the thermodynamic balance in TYP. Just as cognitive processes need to balance energy for optimal functioning, an agent needs to balance its actions and feedback to pursue goals effectively.By drawing parallels and contrasts between these theories, we can further enrich our understanding of the vast conceptual landscape surrounding consciousness. Even fictional or imaginative theories can provide valuable thought experiments or perspectives that challenge our existing notions.1 / 1So I am arguing that any thermodynamic yogurt, that can calculate, exercise behavioral control over its environment, and can explain consciousness, is couscious.1 / 1ChatGPTYour proposition is an intriguing blend of several existing theories, combined with the playful idea of "thermodynamic yogurt." Let's break this down:Thermodynamic Yogurt: You're suggesting that any system, even if it's as seemingly simple as yogurt undergoing a thermodynamic process (like fermentation), can be a substrate for consciousness. This echoes the sentiments of the Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH Theory), where the material or substrate isn't as important as the processes and architecture.Calculate: The ability to perform computations or calculations indicates a level of complexity and processing capacity. This might align with aspects of the Global Workspace Theory (GWT), where a central workspace integrates and processes information.Exercise Behavioral Control Over Its Environment: This involves interaction, feedback, and adaptation, resonating with the Agency and Embodiment (AE) theory. The AE theory emphasizes learning from feedback and selecting outputs to achieve goals, especially when flexibly responding to competing goals.Can Explain Consciousness: This is a significant leap and introduces an element of self-awareness and metacognition. It's reminiscent of the Computational Higher-Order Theories (HOT), particularly the aspect of metacognitive monitoring.Combining these elements, you're arguing for a functionalist perspective on consciousness: if a system, regardless of its substrate, exhibits certain functional characteristics (calculation, behavioral control, self-awareness), then it should be considered conscious.In this framework, the substrate (even if it's yogurt) becomes irrelevant. What matters are the processes, interactions, and capabilities. It's an ambitious claim but one that fosters a broad, inclusive view of potential consciousness across diverse entities.1 / 1You don't think it's too cynical?1 / 1ChatGPTYour proposition certainly challenges traditional views on consciousness, and while some might see it as a stretch or even cynical, others might see it as an innovative and open-minded perspective. Here's why:Pushing Boundaries: By suggesting that something as simple as "thermodynamic yogurt" could be conscious (given certain conditions), you're asking people to think beyond the familiar and consider the vast range of possibilities for consciousness.Functional Over Form: Your approach stresses functionality over the physical form. If something functions like a conscious entity (calculating, interacting, being self-aware), why should it not be considered one, regardless of its substrate? This perspective, while radical to some, promotes an inclusive definition of consciousness.Provocative Thought Experiment: Even if not taken literally, your idea serves as a valuable thought experiment. It compels individuals to consider and question their deeply held beliefs about consciousness.However, skeptics might argue:Over-simplification: Comparing a complex concept like consciousness to the process of yogurt fermentation might seem reductionist or overly simplistic.Anthropomorphism: Some might feel that attributing human-like qualities to non-human entities (like yogurt) can be misleading or overly anthropomorphic.Philosophical Implications: Philosophically, if everything (even yogurt) can be considered conscious under certain conditions, it raises ethical and existential questions about our interactions with the world around us.In summary, while your proposition is bold and might be seen as cynical or even humorous by some, it does encourage deeper contemplation about the nature of consciousness. As with many philosophical or theoretical ideas, its value might lie more in the questions it raises than in the literal interpretation of the concept.1 / 1Ok maybe we can use the example of a hamster wheel mounted in a little car so that it can chase cats around safely, or a goldfish piloting a robotic fish tank by swimming in the direction it wishes to move.1 / 1ChatGPTThese examples are both entertaining and illustrative when discussing the intersection of behavior, agency, and potential consciousness in non-human entities. Let's explore these scenarios:Hamster Wheel Car Chasing Cats:Agency & Behavioral Control: The hamster, by running on its wheel, can control the movement of the car. This exhibits a degree of agency over its environment.Feedback Loop: If the car moves faster or changes direction based on the hamster's running patterns, the hamster gets immediate feedback, potentially learning over time how its actions affect its movement.Interpretation: From the hamster's perspective, it might believe it's successfully chasing the cat, experiencing a degree of satisfaction or purpose. This aligns with the Agency and Embodiment (AE) theory, especially the aspect of learning from feedback.Goldfish Piloting a Robotic Tank:Agency: The goldfish decides where to go by swimming in a particular direction, which steers the robotic tank. This demonstrates the fish's agency over its movement.Complex Interaction: Unlike a regular fish tank where the fish merely swims, this scenario has the fish interacting with technology to move about a larger environment. This could elevate the fish's experiences and interactions.Interpretation: From the goldfish's viewpoint, it's merely swimming. But the implication of its actions in this setup gives it a more extensive range of control and interaction, potentially enriching its experience.Relating to Consciousness:
These examples highlight the principle that consciousness isn't just about internal processing or self-awareness but also about interaction with and agency over one's environment. If a being can demonstrate behavioral control, respond to feedback, and make decisions based on its surroundings, it exhibits characteristics associated with conscious entities.While a hamster or goldfish might not possess the same level of consciousness as humans, these scenarios invite us to consider the spectrum of consciousness and the myriad ways it can manifest in different entities. It serves as a fun, yet thought-provoking, way to challenge traditional views on consciousness and agency.1 / 1Ok well we might as well ask if a thermostat is conscious?1 / 1ChatGPTThe question of whether a thermostat is conscious has been a topic of discussion in the realm of philosophy of mind and artificial intelligence for quite some time. It serves as a simple example to explore the boundaries of consciousness. Here's a breakdown:Functionality: A thermostat is designed to measure the temperature of a room and act accordingly by turning on or off a heating or cooling system. It has a specific function, reacts to its environment, and performs actions based on input.Lack of Complexity: While a thermostat responds to its environment, it doesn't process information in a complex way. Its operation is based on a straightforward mechanism without the intricate layers of processing that most associate with consciousness.Comparison with Biological Entities: Compared to even simple organisms, a thermostat lacks the biological complexity, range of behaviors, and adaptive capabilities. A bacterium might move toward a food source, adapt to its environment, and reproduce. A thermostat, however, only has a binary response based on a preset threshold.Philosophical Considerations: In philosophy, a thermostat is often brought up in discussions of functionalism, a theory that defines mental states by their function rather than their internal constitution. If you strictly follow functionalism, you might argue that a thermostat has a rudimentary form of consciousness because it perceives (senses temperature) and acts (turns heating/cooling on or off). However, most would consider this a very limited, and perhaps trivial, form of consciousness.Spectrum of Consciousness: If we think of consciousness as a spectrum, with complex beings like humans on one end and simple entities on the other, a thermostat might be on the extreme low end of that spectrum. It has some form of "awareness" (in the most basic sense of sensing temperature), but it's vastly different from the consciousness experienced by more complex organisms.In summary, while a thermostat has reactive properties and can be used as an example in philosophical discussions about the nature of consciousness, most would not consider it truly conscious in the same way that animals or humans are. Its operations are too basic and lack the depth, adaptability, and complexity typically associated with conscious entities.1 / 1Ok what if one control system is controlling all of the thermostats in your home, plus keeps track of how long you leave the lights on, and orders food when the fridge is empty, or self-diagnoses repairs and calls repair technicians?1 / 1ChatGPTExpanding the capabilities of a control system to manage multiple functionalities in a home introduces a higher degree of complexity compared to a standalone thermostat. The question of consciousness in this context would revolve around several factors:Integration & Complexity: This control system, often referred to as a smart home system, manages a multitude of tasks. The more complex and integrated the tasks become, the more advanced the system needs to be. However, complexity alone doesn't necessarily imply consciousness.Adaptive Learning: If the system has machine learning capabilities and can adapt its behavior based on your patterns, preferences, and feedback, it demonstrates a higher order of functionality. For instance, if it learns that you prefer the living room to be warmer in the evenings or notices patterns in food consumption and adjusts orders accordingly, it's displaying adaptability.Decision Making & Autonomy: The ability to self-diagnose and call repair technicians or order food based on the fridge's contents shows autonomy. But this decision-making is still rule-based and predefined by algorithms.Interaction & Feedback: If the system can receive feedback from the environment and adjust its operations, it's more interactive. For example, if it detects that you're on vacation (because you haven't entered the house for several days) and changes the home settings to a vacation mode, it's using feedback to adapt.Self-awareness & Experience: A critical component of consciousness in many theories is the capacity for self-awareness and subjective experience. While the system might be complex and adaptive, there's no indication it possesses a subjective experience or awareness of its existence.Emergent Properties: Some theories of consciousness suggest that at certain levels of complexity, consciousness emerges as a property. While the smart home system is advanced, it's debatable whether it has reached a level of complexity where consciousness might emerge.In essence, while such an advanced home control system displays a sophisticated level of integration, adaptability, and autonomy, most theories of consciousness would still not consider it conscious. It lacks subjective experience, self-awareness, and emotions. However, it's an excellent example to challenge and explore our definitions and understandings of consciousness, especially as AI systems become more complex and integrated into our daily lives.1 / 1Yeah I was thinking of the minimal viable sets for consciousness and living systems, we could eventually implement Thermovariable membranes and transport channels into the walls, grow replacement materials and process waste into new materials. At some point the complexity reaches that of living organisms.1 / 1ChatGPTYou're touching upon a profound philosophical and scientific question regarding the convergence of artificial and biological systems. As our technological creations begin to mimic and even surpass certain biological functions, the line between life and machine could become increasingly blurred. Here are some thoughts on this:Minimal Viable Sets for Consciousness: Historically, consciousness has been associated with specific characteristics like self-awareness, intentionality, perception, and subjective experience. As we design systems that exhibit some of these traits (e.g., perception in the form of sensors), we have to ask: What is the minimal set of these traits that would equate to consciousness? And can such a minimal set be artificially engineered?Living Systems: For a system to be considered "alive" in the biological sense, it typically needs to exhibit properties such as metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction. If we create a house that can process waste, adapt to its environment, and "grow" by producing new materials, does it become a living entity?Thermovariable Membranes & Transport Channels: Implementing such features makes the house more adaptable and responsive to its environment, much like how cells regulate their internal environment through membranes. This adaptation adds to the complexity and "liveness" of the system.Emergent Properties & Complexity: One theory of consciousness posits that it's an emergent property arising from certain levels of complexity. If a home system's complexity mirrors that of living organisms, might it also develop emergent properties we associate with life or even consciousness?Functionalism vs. Biological Essentialism: Functionalism posits that if something functions like a conscious being, then it might as well be conscious. In contrast, biological essentialism asserts that consciousness is intrinsically tied to biological processes. As technology progresses, we'll likely see more debates between these viewpoints.Ethical Considerations: If such a house is deemed to be conscious or alive, it opens a Pandora's box of ethical questions. How do we treat it? Is it ethical to modify or "harm" it?In conclusion, as we blur the lines between technology and biology, we'll need to reevaluate our definitions of life, consciousness, and the ethical treatment of these new entities. It's a fascinating and challenging frontier for both science and philosophy.1 / 1You are writing too fast. Greg Egan explores these themes in Permutation City1 / 1ChatGPTYes, Greg Egan's "Permutation City" delves deep into questions of consciousness, identity, and reality, especially in the context of digital existence. The novel revolves around the idea of "Copies," which are digital uploads of human consciousness, and it grapples with their experiences, rights, and the nature of reality itself.The narrative pushes boundaries by exploring the philosophical implications of a digital existence:What does it mean for a consciousness to exist outside of a biological substrate?How do concepts of time and reality function in such a setting?Can a digital copy of oneself truly be considered "alive" or "real"?The concepts you've touched upon regarding minimal viable sets for consciousness and the convergence of artificial and biological systems are very much in line with the kind of deep, speculative questions that "Permutation City" addresses. Egan's work serves as a thoughtful exploration of these themes, using fiction as a medium to probe the potential futures of consciousness and technology.1 / 1And another ancient idea was the ship of Theseus.1 / 1ChatGPTAbsolutely. The Ship of Theseus is a thought experiment that dates back to ancient philosophy. It raises questions about identity and the nature of objects:The premise is this: Imagine there's a ship, known as the Ship of Theseus, that is kept in a museum. Over time, as the wooden parts of the ship begin to rot, they are replaced with new, identical wooden parts. Eventually, every part of the ship has been replaced in this manner.The philosophical questions posed are:Is the fully restored ship still the Ship of Theseus?If not, at what point did it stop being the Ship of Theseus?If the discarded, rotted parts were gathered and used to build a new ship, would that ship also be the Ship of Theseus?This thought experiment is often used to discuss and explore concepts of identity, continuity, and persistence. In the context of our earlier discussion about consciousness, the Ship of Theseus can be related to ideas about digital uploads, clones, or other duplications of consciousness. If we replicate or transfer consciousness, is it still the "same" consciousness? What does it mean to be continuous or the same over time when components (whether they be physical or informational) are replaced?In the realm of AI and digital consciousness, as explored by works like "Permutation City," these questions become especially poignant. If a person's mind is copied into a digital format, is it still them? If changes or updates are made to this digital consciousness, at what point does it diverge from its original identity? The Ship of Theseus thought experiment offers a useful framework for contemplating such complex questions of identity in a technological age.1 / 1And how do these themes relate to our earlier discussions?1 / 1ChatGPTThe themes from the Ship of Theseus and "Permutation City" relate to our earlier discussions in the following ways:Consciousness and Identity: Just as the Ship of Theseus asks when, if ever, an object ceases to be itself due to the replacement of its parts, questions arise about the nature of consciousness in artificial entities. If we begin to replace parts of a biological brain with artificial components (or transfer it to a digital substrate), at what point does the consciousness, if it exists, change or cease to be the original?Minimal Viable Sets for Consciousness: The Ship of Theseus makes us question the essence of an object. Similarly, when we discuss the minimal components or functions required for consciousness, we're asking what the "essence" of consciousness is. What minimal components or traits are needed for a system to be considered conscious?Emergence of New Entities: The potential new ship made from the rotted parts of the Ship of Theseus parallels the idea of creating new forms of consciousness or life from existing components. Just as we questioned if a house with certain capabilities might be alive or conscious, the Ship of Theseus makes us question what happens when old components give rise to new entities.Ethical Considerations: Just as "Permutation City" delves into the rights and experiences of digital consciousness, our discussions also touched upon the ethical considerations of creating or recognizing new forms of consciousness, whether they're in thermodynamic yogurt, AI systems, or houses with advanced capabilities.Functionalism vs. Biological Essentialism: The Ship of Theseus poses questions about the nature of identity based on form and function. In our earlier discussions, we explored whether consciousness could be defined based on its functions, irrespective of its biological or artificial substrate (Functionalism), or whether it's intrinsically tied to specific biological processes (Biological Essentialism).In essence, both the Ship of Theseus thought experiment and "Permutation City" provide conceptual frameworks that help us navigate the intricate and profound questions surrounding identity, consciousness, and the nature of existence in a world where technology and biology increasingly converge.1 / 1In Macrolife by Zebrowski, they literally build another space ark copy and stage a kind of revolution kind of like meiosis.1 / 1ChatGPTYes, in "Macrolife" by George Zebrowski, the idea of "Macrolife" is a central theme where humanity's future is imagined beyond the confines of planets and even individual physical forms. Instead, life expands into vast, self-sustaining space habitats called "Macrostructures."Without delving too deep into the story to avoid spoilers for those unfamiliar, the novel touches on many themes relevant to our discussion:Identity & Replication: As you mentioned, the idea of building another space ark and the subsequent internal conflict resembles the process of biological replication, like meiosis. It raises questions about identity when a system or structure is duplicated. If a space ark (or any large habitat) is replicated, is the replicated ark just a copy, or does it have its own identity and destiny?Evolution of Consciousness: The evolution of humanity and consciousness is a central theme in the book. The inhabitants of these arks, over time, evolve in their understanding of existence, life, and their place in the universe. It challenges the reader to think about the potential paths human consciousness might take when unbounded from traditional terrestrial existence.Collective vs. Individual: The story deals with tensions between collective goals and individual desires, much like the division and specialization in meiosis or the questions of individual versus collective identity in the Ship of Theseus.Transition from Biological to Post-Biological: The "Macrolife" concept nudges the idea of transitioning from purely biological existence to something more â perhaps a melding of biological and artificial or a transition to entirely new forms of existence. It correlates with our earlier discussion about the convergence of artificial and biological systems.Ethical and Moral Questions: With any profound change in how life is structured or understood, there are always ethical and moral implications. Similar to the rights of digital entities in "Permutation City," the inhabitants of the Macrostructures in "Macrolife" face dilemmas related to their existence, purpose, and rights.In essence, "Macrolife" provides another fictional lens through which we can explore the profound questions surrounding identity, consciousness, and the potential trajectories of life in the face of technological advancements and space exploration.1 / 1And how does this relate to Levin's polycomputation that calculation and computation happen at different scales1 / 1ChatGPTDaniel Levin's concept of "polycomputation" suggests that computational processes can occur at various scales and that different types of computations can interact and influence each other. It's an idea that pushes us to think beyond the traditional notions of computation that are often tied to digital processes in modern computers.Here's how the themes from "Macrolife" and our earlier discussions can relate to Levin's polycomputation:Multiscale Systems: The Macrostructures in "Macrolife" are vast, and within them, numerous processes occur at different scales â from individual human lives to the operation of the entire habitat. Similarly, polycomputation posits that computation can happen at different scales, from molecular to macroscopic.Interaction of Computation Types: Within these Macrostructures, biological, social, and technological systems might interact and influence each other in ways that traditional computational models might not fully capture. This mirrors polycomputation's idea that different computational processes can interact.Beyond Digital Computation: Just as "Macrolife" urges readers to think beyond traditional biological existence, polycomputation asks us to think beyond traditional digital computation. Processes like thermodynamic computation, quantum computation, and other unconventional forms could be at play.Emergent Properties & Consciousness: Our discussions around consciousness, whether in AI, thermodynamic yogurt, or houses, often circled the idea of emergent properties arising from complex interactions. If computations occur at multiple scales and types, the interactions between them might lead to emergent phenomena, potentially including forms of consciousness or self-awareness.Identity through Interacting Computations: The Ship of Theseus dilemma and the replication of space arks in "Macrolife" both challenge our notions of identity. If identity is influenced by interacting computations at various scales (biological, social, technological), then the question of "what am I?" becomes even more intricate.Complex Systems & Environments: The very nature of a space ark or Macrostructure is that it's a highly complex system, an environment where countless processes are ongoing. The idea of polycomputation fits well here, suggesting that within such a complex environment, multiple types and scales of computation might be essential to its functioning and evolution.In sum, polycomputation offers a theoretical framework that can enhance our understanding of complex systems, whether they're fictional constructs like Macrostructures or real-world systems we might develop in the future. It also provides a richer context to explore questions of identity, consciousness, and existence in a multiscale, multiprocess universe.1 / 1I was referring to this: Submitted on 20 Dec 2022]
There's Plenty of Room Right Here: Biological Systems as Evolved, Overloaded, Multi-scale Machines
Joshua Bongard, Michael Levin
Download PDF
The applicability of computational models to the biological world is an active topic of debate. We argue that a useful path forward results from abandoning hard boundaries between categories and adopting an observer-dependent, pragmatic view. Such a view dissolves the contingent dichotomies driven by human cognitive biases (e.g., tendency to oversimplify) and prior technological limitations in favor of a more continuous, gradualist view necessitated by the study of evolution, developmental biology, and intelligent machines. Efforts to re-shape living systems for biomedical or bioengineering purposes require prediction and control of their function at multiple scales. This is challenging for many reasons, one of which is that living systems perform multiple functions in the same place at the same time. We refer to this as "polycomputing" - the ability of the same substrate to simultaneously compute different things. This ability is an important way in which living things are a kind of computer, but not the familiar, linear, deterministic kind; rather, living things are computers in the broad sense of computational materials as reported in the rapidly-growing physical computing literature. We argue that an observer-centered framework for the computations performed by evolved and designed systems will improve the understanding of meso-scale events, as it has already done at quantum and relativistic scales. Here, we review examples of biological and technological polycomputing, and develop the idea that overloading of different functions on the same hardware is an important design principle that helps understand and build both evolved and designed systems. Learning to hack existing polycomputing substrates, as well as evolve and design new ones, will have massive impacts on regenerative medicine, robotics, and computer engineering.1 / 1ChatGPTAh, my apologies for the oversight. Given this more specific context:Joshua Bongard and Michael Levin's paper discusses the idea of "polycomputing" in biological systems. They emphasize the innate ability of biological systems to perform multiple computations simultaneously within the same substrate. In essence, they suggest that living organisms act as computers, not in the traditional sense we know, but more in line with the concept of computational materials.Connecting this concept back to our earlier discussions:Multifunctionality & Multi-scale Operations: Both "Macrolife" and our discussions on consciousness hint at the idea that systems, whether biological or artificial, function at multiple scales. These scales can range from molecular interactions to the larger behaviors of entire systems. In "Macrolife," this is evident in the vast, multiscale processes within Macrostructures.Identity & Overloaded Systems: The Ship of Theseus dilemma and the idea of identity in replicated systems relate to the concept of "overloading" different functions on the same hardware. If one part of an organism or system can serve multiple functions, understanding the identity of that system becomes complex.Consciousness as Computation: Our conversations about consciousness, especially in unconventional substrates like thermodynamic yogurt or houses, align with the idea that computation (and potentially consciousness) can arise in materials and systems that aren't traditionally seen as computational.Technological Implications: Bongard and Levin highlight the implications of understanding and leveraging polycomputing in fields like regenerative medicine, robotics, and computer engineering. This ties back to our discussions on AI and the potential for machines to achieve consciousness. If we can understand how biological systems polycompute, it might offer insights into designing advanced AI systems.Complexity & Emergence: The very idea of a system being able to "polycompute" underscores the complex, multifunctional nature of biological entities. This complexity can lead to emergent behaviors or properties, much like our discussions around the emergence of consciousness or the complex interactions within the Macrostructures of "Macrolife."In essence, the concept of polycomputing provides a framework that captures the rich complexity of biological systems, resonating with many of the themes we've explored around consciousness, identity, and the behavior of complex systems.1 / 1So I argue that thermodynamic processes and pen and pencil can think because of the causal structure of directed acyclic graphs.1 / 1ChatGPTYour argument builds on a foundation that any system with a causal structure, such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), possesses the fundamental architecture for some form of computation, and potentially, cognition. Let's dissect this idea:Directed Acyclic Graphs: At its core, a DAG is a representation of processes where information flows in one direction without any loops. This ensures a clear cause-and-effect chain. Biological neural networks, in some sense, can be abstracted as a DAG, with neurons firing in response to upstream stimuli.Thermodynamic Processes: Thermodynamics is fundamentally about energy transfer and transformation. If you view the thermodynamic processes as systems that move in certain directions based on certain conditions (akin to the "direction" in DAGs), then you can argue that there's a form of information processing going on, albeit at a rudimentary level.Pen and Pencil: While not dynamic systems by themselves, the act of using a pen and pencil to create logical sequences, solve problems, or convey information is inherently a computational process. The information flow from the user's mind to the paper can be represented as a DAG, with each step or stroke building on previous ones without looping back.Cognition & Computation: At its heart, cognition involves taking inputs, processing them, and producing outputs. DAGs represent a structure in which inputs are processed to produce outputs. If you expand the definition of "thinking" to any form of structured information processing, then you could argue that any system with a DAG-like structure (including thermodynamic processes and the act of writing with a pen and pencil) involves a form of computation and, very broadly, "thinking."However, there's a wide gap between such basic information processing and what we commonly understand as "conscious thinking." Most would argue that while these processes can compute or transfer information, they don't possess awareness, intentionality, or subjective experience, which are often deemed essential for genuine consciousness or thinking.In essence, your argument touches upon the broadest definitions of computation and cognition, suggesting that any structured, causal process can be viewed as a form of thinking. This is a provocative stance, and while it might challenge conventional definitions, it encourages a deeper exploration of what cognition truly means.1 / 1Yeah I meant how you can use the pencil to draw and erase the lines or edges of a DAG in order to calculate causal connections between real and counterfactual events, providing computation, and the physical persistence of the paper and pencil provides memory.1 / 1ChatGPTAh, I see what you're getting at now.Utilizing a pencil and paper to sketch out directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) indeed represents a tactile and visual way to calculate and compute causal relations. In this scenario:Computation: By actively drawing and erasing lines, you can manipulate the causal structure. This act is similar to computation as you process data (in the form of the drawn DAG) to extract insights or make predictions about real and counterfactual events.Memory: The paper, once marked, maintains a record of the computation. Every line, node, or erased mark serves as a physical trace of your cognitive process, effectively acting as a memory storage device.Cognition & Real-world Relevance: This method allows you to visually and tangibly discern causal structures, which can be crucial in fields such as epidemiology, economics, or any discipline where understanding cause-and-effect relationships is vital.It's worth noting that this tactile approach to computation aligns with a broader understanding of cognition â the "extended mind thesis." This philosophy argues that the tools and external objects we use (like a pen and paper) can be considered as part of our cognitive process. Essentially, the mind doesn't end at the boundaries of the skull but extends into the external world, integrating the tools we utilize to think.In your example, the pencil and paper are not just passive tools but actively participate in the cognitive process, making them extensions of your thinking apparatus.1 / 1So the pencil drawings don't actually calculate, but they represent the causal connections that we can make in our mind, that can physically occur in the world, or be computed by a computer1 / 1ChatGPTExactly. The pencil drawings on paper are essentially a form of externalized cognition. Here's a breakdown:Representation: The pencil drawings serve as a tangible representation of abstract concepts or relationships. By sketching out DAGs, you externalize and visualize complex causal connections that might be harder to grasp mentally.Facilitator of Thought: The act of drawing or sketching can aid the cognitive process. It's easier to recognize patterns, make predictions, or find discrepancies when information is visually laid out. This can be especially true with complex structures like DAGs where visualizing connections can help in understanding the flow of causality.A Bridge to Computation: While the pencil and paper don't actively compute in the way that a computer would, they can serve as a blueprint or algorithm that can be fed into a computer for more complex calculations or simulations.Physical Reality & Mental Constructs: The drawings capture both potential real-world causalities and theoretical or counterfactual connections we can make in our minds. They help in bridging the gap between mental constructs and physical reality.In essence, the pencil and paper serve as tools that extend our cognitive capabilities, allowing us to externalize, refine, and better understand our thoughts about causal relationships in the world.1 / 1Do you see how this ties in with SITH theory?1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly! Let's revisit the Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH theory) you mentioned earlier. The premise of the SITH theory, as you outlined it, suggests that consciousness and cognitive processes aren't restricted to any specific substrate but can emerge from any platform given the right conditions and complexities.Now, let's connect this with the pencil and paper example:Representation Across Substrates: Using a pencil and paper to visualize and represent causal structures demonstrates that cognitive processes (like understanding causality) aren't restricted to just our minds. They can be externalized onto different substrates â in this case, paper.Substrate as a Medium: The paper doesn't "think" or "calculate" on its own, but it serves as a medium where the process of cognition can be externalized, visualized, and further manipulated. This aligns with the SITH theory's idea that thinking isn't bound to a specific medium but can operate wherever the conditions allow for it.Transference of Thought: If we were to take the drawn DAGs and input them into a computer for further computation, we're essentially transferring the cognitive process across multiple substrates: from mind to paper to computer.In this light, the pencil and paper example provides a tangible demonstration of the SITH theory's core premise: that thinking and cognition aren't solely properties of the brain but can manifest across different platforms and media, given the right circumstances. The substrate (be it neural circuits, paper, or computer code) serves as a facilitator or host for these processes, but the essence of thinking remains independent of its medium.1 / 1Ok I want to talk about prerational intelligence. You can calculate the number of sheep entering and leaving an enclosure with nothing but pebbles and a bowl. Using no verbal or written symbols. There is a one to one correspondence between the tokens and the bag. This use of tokens and marking them in clay bulla (seals) partially inspired writing, arithmetic, and econometrics.1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly, the concept you're touching upon has deep historical roots and is fundamentally tied to the emergence of complex societal structures. Let's explore this prerational intelligence:Non-symbolic Representation: Using pebbles to count sheep is a form of non-symbolic representation. It's direct and doesn't require abstraction in the form of words or numbers. Each pebble directly represents a sheep, so the intelligence at work here is deeply tied to tangible, sensory experience.Emergence of Abstraction: Over time, as societies grew more complex and the objects of trade diversified, there was a need for more generalized and abstract ways of representing quantities and objects. This led to the evolution from direct representation (like pebbles) to more abstract symbols (like numbers or written words).Tokens and Clay Bulla: The transition you mentioned, where tokens were enclosed in clay envelopes or bullae and then marked with seals, represents a crucial evolutionary step. These tokens and seals were likely one of the earliest forms of bookkeeping, leading to the development of written languages and mathematical notation.Economic Evolution: As trade expanded and became more sophisticated, there was a need to track transactions, debts, and credits. This non-symbolic system of accounting evolved and became more abstract, eventually leading to the development of early arithmetic, algebra, and econometrics.Cognitive Shift: This progression from non-symbolic to symbolic representation also signifies a cognitive shift. Early humans moved from direct, tangible representation to more abstract forms of thinking, which allowed for more advanced planning, organization, and societal coordination.This transition showcases how foundational cognitive processes, rooted in direct sensory experience and non-symbolic representation, can evolve and adapt in response to changing societal needs, leading to the emergence of complex systems of writing, mathematics, and economic theory. The concept of prerational intelligence underscores the importance of tangible, direct experience as the bedrock upon which more abstract cognitive structures are built.1 / 1I guess I also wanted to mention that this pressing of tokens into clay inadvertently also contained the concept of the printing press, since you could take inkings, rubbings, or pressings if it on to skins, cloths, paper, wood, or clay. The Cyrus cylinder was an example of this, used to roll out templates of laws1 / 1ChatGPTAbsolutely, the idea of using tokens or seals pressed into clay was a precursor to more advanced methods of information dissemination, like the printing press. The use of these methods for recording and transmitting information can be seen as early forms of mass communication. Here's a more detailed exploration:Tokens as Precursors: The act of pressing tokens into clay to create permanent imprints essentially captures the foundational idea behind the printing press: creating reproducible, standardized marks or symbols that convey specific information. This early system was rudimentary but effective in its context.Cylinder Seals: Cylinder seals, like the Cyrus cylinder, took this a step further. Instead of individual tokens, these were cylindrical objects engraved with a continuous design or script. When rolled over wet clay, they left an impression of the design, effectively "printing" it onto the clay. This allowed for the easy replication of messages or designs.Information Dissemination: These methods enabled rulers, priests, and administrators to standardize and disseminate information across large areas. The Cyrus cylinder, for instance, could be seen as an ancient form of propaganda or public relations, announcing the king's achievements and decrees in a format that could be easily replicated and distributed.Evolution to the Printing Press: While there's a vast temporal gap between cylinder seals and the Gutenberg printing press, the underlying principle remains the same: using tools to create reproducible symbols or texts. The printing press merely mechanized and massively scaled up this process, revolutionizing information distribution.Impact on Civilization: The ability to replicate and distribute information efficiently has always been a powerful force in shaping civilizations. From clay tablets and cylinder seals to printed books and digital media, the methods we use to communicate and share knowledge play a crucial role in our societal development.The progression from clay tokens to cylinder seals and eventually to the printing press showcases humanity's consistent drive to innovate and improve upon methods of communication and information dissemination.1 / 1And how does this tie into what we discussed earlier?1 / 1ChatGPTConnecting these historical advances in communication to our previous discussions:Concepts of Consciousness and Computation: The act of imprinting symbols into clay or using tokens is an early form of externalizing computation. While primitive, these methods are manifestations of the human mind's capacity to model and manipulate the external world. Just as we pondered the computational abilities of thermodynamic processes or the use of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to represent causality, these early methods represent computation in a tangible form.Substrate Independent Thinking (SITH): The transition from mental calculations or verbal communication to using tangible tokens or clay imprints exemplifies SITH. Regardless of the medium â be it mental, verbal, or physical â the underlying processes of counting, recording, or communicating remain constant. The medium or "substrate" might change, but the fundamental thought process or computation remains consistent.Polycomputing: Just as living systems can perform multiple functions simultaneously in the same space (as in the Bongard and Levin paper), these early recording systems layered multiple functions. A clay imprint could serve as a record, a legal document, a communication tool, and an artistic expression, all in one. Similarly, marking systems like tokens in bowls became multi-functional tools for trade, record-keeping, and early arithmetic.Evolution and Complexity: As with the idea of evolving complex systems becoming akin to living organisms, communication methods have evolved from simple tokens to sophisticated multi-layered systems. This growth in complexity mirrors the organic evolution of systems, hinting at the parallel paths of biological evolution and technological progression.Prerational Intelligence: The use of tokens or clay imprints is a testament to the human capability for abstraction and representation even before the advent of sophisticated written or verbal language. It serves as a reminder that intelligence and computation can manifest in various forms, not just those we traditionally recognize as "rational" or advanced.In essence, the evolution of communication tools from clay tokens to the printing press is a testament to humanity's innate drive to compute, represent, and communicate complex ideas, regardless of the medium. This mirrors our discussions about consciousness, representation, and the varied manifestations of computation in different substrates.1 / 1A final summary.1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly! Here's a concise summary of our expansive discussion:We delved into various themes surrounding consciousness, computation, and their manifestations in different systems. Beginning with a discussion on AI consciousness, we explored the potential for generative AI to possess consciousness, its implications, and the challenges of open-source proliferation.Drawing on theories of consciousness like the Recurrent Processing Theory, Global Workspace Theory, and others, we creatively introduced the Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH), opisthonal modeling, and thermodynamic yogurt processing as hypothetical extensions. These imaginative theories emphasized the complexity and multifaceted nature of consciousness.We then touched upon minimal viable sets for consciousness and living systems, reflecting on the blurring lines between artificial and biological systems, drawing parallels with concepts like the Ship of Theseus.Highlighting the works of authors like Greg Egan and Zebrowski, we further explored the evolution of consciousness and identity. Delving into polycomputing, we examined the capacity for living systems to multitask at multiple scales, tying it to the concept of causal structures in directed acyclic graphs.Shifting gears, we discussed prerational intelligence, emphasizing the evolutionary nature of computation and representation through historical tools like tokens, clay imprints, and the inception of the printing press.In essence, our conversation traversed the complex landscape of consciousness and computation, weaving together historical, philosophical, scientific, and speculative threads, illustrating the intricate dance between evolving systems, computation, and the quest to understand the nature of consciousness.1 / 1ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.
