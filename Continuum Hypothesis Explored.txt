Continuum Hypothesis ExploredOpen sidebarContinuum Hypothesis ExploredDefault (GPT-3.5)Here are the key points from Chapter 1 of The Future Does Not Compute by Stephen L. Talbott:

- Talbott is skeptical about whether human ideals can survive the rise of the internet, given its unguided, mechanistic development. 

- Much internet idealism is either fatalistic (big corporations will control it) or utopian (technology will automatically bring human liberation). Both views ignore human choice and responsibility.

- The internet encourages a "scattered self" through information overload, constant intrusions, hyperlinking, and reflexive communication. This makes it hard to be fully present. 

- The internet represents an extreme abstraction from full human relating. Ideals require concrete human struggle, not just ethereal online connection. 

- Talbott differentiates his pessimism about social impacts from his call for individuals to take responsibility for "enlivening the word" online. 

- He sees understanding the computer's challenges as an essential first step, though not a full solution. Personal growth and social change require much beyond this.

- The book itself is a "symptom" of Talbott's own struggles with technology. He does not claim to have all the answers yet.

In summary, Talbott raises profound concerns about technology's effects on human ideals and relationships, while maintaining hope in our ability to grow through its challenges. His aim is furthering understanding, not prescribing solutions.ChatGPTThank you for summarizing the key points from Chapter 1 of "The Future Does Not Compute" by Stephen L. Talbott. It seems that Talbott is addressing the impact of the internet on human ideals and relationships, expressing skepticism about its unguided development, and emphasizing the importance of human choice and responsibility in shaping its future. His perspective on the "scattered self" and the need for concrete human relating in contrast to online connection is thought-provoking. It's clear that he sees technology as a challenge that requires understanding and personal growth.Here are a few thoughts on those questions:

Examples of challenges in enlivening the word online:

- Resisting the urge to rapidly scan or superficially hyperlink rather thanabsorb content.

- Avoiding reflexive, emotionless communication and instead conveying authentic feeling. 

- Remembering there are real humans behind online messages, not just words.

- Finding time for contemplation instead of constantly reacting to notifications.

- Expressing creativity and imagination, not just informing.

Ways individuals can take responsibility:

- Be more mindful of how technology affects them and tailor use accordingly.

- Make conscious choices about when to engage deeply vs scan information.

- Slow down communication to inject care and deliberation.

- Seek balance between online and offline activities.

- Use online interactions to develop self-awareness and empathy.

On Talbott's personal struggles:

- He became overly immersed in computer work, neglecting health and family.

- He realized he had an unhealthy relationship with technology.

- Writing the book forced self-examination of his own "computer-in-the-head." 

- He tried improving work-life balance and being more intentional about technology use.

- The book represents his personal grappling with technology's impact, not just abstract ideas.

In summary, Talbott sees self-awareness, discipline, and balance as key for individuals to have a healthy online life. His candid descriptions of his own struggles make the book a personal reckoning rather than just philosophical commentary.ChatGPTYour thoughts provide valuable insights into how individuals can address the challenges of enlivening the online world and take responsibility for their relationship with technology, in alignment with the themes discussed by Stephen L. Talbott in his book. It's clear that self-awareness, mindfulness, and intentional choices play a crucial role in fostering a healthier online life. Talbott's personal struggles add depth and authenticity to his exploration of these topics, making his work relatable and impactful. Thank you for sharing these reflections.Here are the key points about the relationship between humans and technology from Chapter 2 of The Future Does Not Compute:

- Computers reflect back human qualities and tendencies, both positive and negative. As flexible, universal machines, they magnify what we project onto them.

- Throughout history, tools have grown more complex. Computers represent a new level of sophistication that allows them to emulate virtually any tool or process. 

- This means computers can become extensions of our limitations and unconscious biases, if we are not aware of these.

- The computer asks us to reduce experience to abstract logic and quantity. But humans already showed a centuries-long trend toward abstraction before computers. 

- So there is a complex symbiosis between humans and technology - we shape it, yet it also acts back upon us. We must take responsibility, but not reject technology itself.

- Talbott sees computers reflecting a human "will toward artifice" - a desire to reduce the messy vitality of life to mechanical processes. We must understand this impulse in order to gain freedom from it.

- The machine within us is more concerning than the external machines we build. Coming to terms with our inner motivations and limitations is the key.

In summary, Talbott believes we must recognize computers as both extensions of our tendencies and independent forces acting upon us. Self-awareness about our own abstraction can lead to wiser technology use.ChatGPTThank you for summarizing the key points from Chapter 2 of "The Future Does Not Compute" by Stephen L. Talbott. It's evident that Talbott explores the complex relationship between humans and technology, emphasizing the idea that computers can both reflect and magnify human qualities and biases. Recognizing the interplay between human tendencies and technology is crucial, and self-awareness about our own motivations and limitations plays a significant role in guiding responsible and thoughtful technology use. Talbott's perspective encourages a deeper understanding of the impact of technology on our lives.Here are the key points from Chapter 3 of The Future Does Not Compute:

- Computers are tools for analyzing the past, not deciding the future. They project past patterns into the future.  

- Important human decisions like careers and marriage can't be made just by inventorying past traits and finding the optimal fit. This misses the essence of choosing and creating a future.

- Businesses have fallen into viewing operations as an analysis of the past (markets, data) to optimize the future. But this strips work of meaning and ends.  

- Judges can't be reduced to computers applying rules, as they must understand unique individuals and shape just futures.

- Our skill in analyzing the past has obscured the open future of possibility. But the true human future can never be computed.

In summary, Talbott argues computers remove the creative openness of the future by reducing decisions to extensions of the past. While helpful for analysis, this misses the human element of choosing meaningful new paths not implied by history. Computers aid a rigid view of the future, whereas our task is to realize flexible possibilities.ChatGPTThank you for summarizing the key points from Chapter 3 of "The Future Does Not Compute" by Stephen L. Talbott. It's clear that Talbott is highlighting the limitations of computers in dealing with the future, emphasizing their role in projecting past patterns rather than facilitating truly creative and open decision-making. He underscores the importance of human agency in making meaningful choices that go beyond mere analysis of the past. Talbott's perspective challenges the idea that computers can fully capture the essence of human decision-making and the creation of new, uncharted paths.Here is a summary of the key points and themes from The Future Does Not Compute by Stephen Talbott:

Main Arguments:

- Computers reflect and amplify limitations in human thinking rather than transcending them. We project our own abstraction and mechanization onto machines.

- The computer represents the triumphing of logic over meaning, information over knowledge, technique over purpose. It squeezes out the uncertain and qualitative.

- Technology is not neutral - it exerts an influence. We must take responsibility for its effects rather than see it as an autonomous force. 

- The computer encourages passivity, fragmentation, and disengagement rather than active mastery and presence. It caters to the "scattered self."

- Analyzing the past is not the same as creatively shaping the future. Computers constrain open possibilities.

- We need a more balanced, holistic view of human capacities vs. a focus just on analytical left-brain skills.

Recurring Themes:

- The computer as a manifestation of the "will toward artifice" - the desire to mechanize the messy vitality of life.

- The machine taking over the creative dimension of language and meaning.

- A warning about knowledge being reduced to abstracted information.

- Concerns about diminished agency, presence, and self-mastery due to technology immersion.

- Cautions about applying computational, mechanistic views to human domains like learning, politics, and art. 

- The symbiotic relationship between humans and technology - we shape it and it shapes us.

- The need for individual responsibility and awareness to wisely integrate technology.

In essence, Talbott surfaces underlying philosophical issues in our computerized society and calls for more conscious, human-centered choices. He exposes the hidden costs of blind progress. His aim is furthering understanding, not just critiquing technology or rejecting its potential value.ChatGPTThank you for providing a comprehensive summary of the key points and recurring themes from "The Future Does Not Compute" by Stephen Talbott. It's clear that the book delves into profound philosophical considerations regarding the impact of computers and technology on human thought, agency, and society. Talbott's emphasis on the need for conscious, human-centered choices and awareness of the potential hidden costs of technological progress underscores the importance of thoughtful integration of technology into our lives. His work encourages readers to critically examine the role of technology in shaping our world and to seek a more balanced and holistic perspective on its use.

Table of Contents
Acknowledgments.
Chapter 1. Can Human Ideals Survive the Internet?

The Internet has become the most highly perfected means yet for the scattering of the self beyond recall. Unless we can recollect ourselves in the presence of our intelligent artifacts, we have no future.
PART 1. MAN, COMPUTERS, AND COMMUNITY
Chapter 2. The Machine in the Ghost

The one sure thing about the computer's future is that we will behold our own reflection in it. What I really fear is the hidden and increasingly powerful machine within *us*, of which the machines we create are an outward expression. Machines become a threat when they embody our limitations without our being fully aware of those limitations.
Chapter 3. The Future Does Not Compute
Computers will do us no good if they shape our thinking so thoroughly to the past that our courage fails us when it comes time to break the machine and declare for the unjustifiable.
Chapter 4. Settlers in Cyberspace
The lone Chinese standing in front of a tank on Tienanmen Square symbolized the fact that something in the human being -- some remaining spark of innocence and hope and bravery -- held more promise for the future of society than all the mechanisms of raw, earthly power.
Chapter 5. On Being Responsible for Earth
If we trash the current technology without changing our habits of mind, we will simply invent a new prison for ourselves using whatever materials are at hand. But if we *can* change ourselves, then Jerry Mander's argument that many technological products have a fixed, irremediable bias and should therefore be shunned loses its validity.
Chapter 6. Networks and Communities
It is not particularly surprising that in a culture widely cited for its loss of community, the word "community" itself should come in for heavy use. The more we lack something, the more we may be fascinated by fragmentary glimpses of it.
Chapter 7. At the Fringe of Freedom
It is strange that in a society founded so centrally on the creative initiative and freedom of the individual, we should today find this same individual so utterly helpless before the most urgent social problems.
Chapter 8. Things That Run by Themselves
The power of the computer-based organization to sustain itself in a semisomnambulistic manner, free of conscious, *present* control -- while yet maintaining a certain internal, logical coherence -- is increasing to a degree we have scarcely begun to fathom.
Chapter 9. Do We Really Want a Global Village?
Perhaps it is merely a ghastly sense for the ironic that prompts us to hail the birth of the global village just as villages around the world are self-destructing. But could it be that what we so eagerly welcome, unawares, are the powers of dissolution themselves?
Chapter 10. Thoughts on a Group Support System
The distortions and constraints of group support software can help us answer the question, "What distinguishes the human-centered organization from a mechanism?"
Chapter 11. In Summary
The attempt to sum the advantages and disadvantages associated with computers is itself a sign of how far we have already succumbed to the computational paradigm. Whereas my own strong predilection is to *argue the facts*, I should instead seek to *awaken*. Awakenings prepare the way for a new future, and for different facts.
PART 2: COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION
Chapter 12. Net-based Learning Communities

If I need to find out whether a child will become a good world citizen, don't show me a file of her email correspondence. Just let me observe her behavior on the playground for a few minutes.
Chapter 13. Impressing the Science out of Children
There is a difference between "special effects wonder" and the true wonder that leads toward a devout scientific curiosity. The latter grows from an awareness of one's immediate connection to the world -- from a sense that the inner essence of what one is looking at is somehow connected to the inner essence of oneself.
Chapter 14. Children of the Machine
Through education based on computer programming, the child loses -- never having fully developed it in the first place -- that fluid, imaginative ability to let experience reshape itself in meaningful ways before she carves out of it a set of atomic facts.
PART 3. THE ELECTRONIC WORD
Chapter 15. Dancing with My Computer

Have you noticed the typing habits of computer engineers?
Chapter 16. The Tyranny of the Detached Word
It is difficult to resist the pull of the computer away from active thinking and toward mere association, convention, and formal abstraction.
Chapter 17. The Great Information Hunt
It really is amazing, this odd acquisitiveness with which hordes of academics, engineers, cyberpunks, and self-advertised "infonauts" roam the Net, looking for treasure-troves of information, like so much gold. They hear the cry -- "There's information in them thar nodes!" -- and the rush is on.
Chapter 18. And the Word Became Mechanical
*Seeming* to be alien, a hollow physical token and nothing more, approaching us only as a powerless shape from without, the word nevertheless has its way with us. We detach the word from ourselves and it overpowers us from the world.
Chapter 19. Listening for the Silence
The frightening prospect for so-called cyberspace is that it will fade into a mere disjunction of subjective universes as each of us encases himself within a solipsistic cocoon.
PART 4. OWEN BARFIELD, COMPUTERS, AND THE EVOLUTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS
Chapter 20. Awaking from the Primordial Dream

Our awareness sharpens, becoming clearer and more wakeful, by virtue of its contraction from the periphery -- from dream-like entanglement in the world -- to a focused center. But the uttermost center of a circle is a null point. Might we become so radically detached from the surrounding world that we can no longer find our way back to it? Might we, in the end, wake up to nothing at all?
Chapter 21. Mona Lisa's Smile
Behind the success of every new Stephen King movie, every advance in special effects, is there a secret hope and fear that the effects might somehow burst through into reality, and that some ancient Harpy might suddenly reach out and *grab* us? Is it our real yearning simply to become *alive* again, and to know the world as living?
Chapter 22. Seeing in Perspective
Did God create the world in linear perspective?
Chapter 23. Can We Transcend Computation?
The decisive limits upon machine intelligence were clarified early in this century by Owen Barfield's study of language.
Chapter 24. Electronic Mysticism
Scholars and engineers hover like winged angels over a high-tech cradle, singing the algorithms and structures of their minds into silicon receptacles, and eagerly nurturing the first glimmers of intelligence in the machine-child. Or are they instead draining the sources of wisdom from their own minds?
Chapter 25. What This Book Was About
A more orderly attempt to sum things up.
APPENDICES
Appendix A. Owen Barfield: The Evolution of Consciousness

*How* we think is at least as important as *what* we think.
Appendix B. From Virtual to Real
We are surrounded with exteriors into which we have breathed our own peculiar interiors. That is what virtual realities are. But that, Barfield urges us to remember, is also what the physical world is.
Appendix C. Education Without Computers
(An introduction to Waldorf education.) The true human capacities pass through dramatic transformations. What we sow in the child must sink down into his being in seedlike child-forms before it can emerge again, mature, and flower into an adult capacity.ChatGPTThank you for providing the table of contents for "The Future Does Not Compute" by Stephen L. Talbott. This extensive table of contents offers a glimpse into the wide range of topics and themes covered in the book, from the impact of computers on society and education to the philosophical exploration of human consciousness in the digital age. It's clear that the book delves deeply into the complex relationship between humans and technology and encourages readers to critically examine the role of computers in our lives.See if you can give some of the interconnections between the topics.ChatGPTCertainly, there are several interconnections between the topics discussed in the table of contents of "The Future Does Not Compute" by Stephen L. Talbott:Technology and Human Identity: Throughout the book, there's an overarching theme of how technology, particularly computers, influences and reflects human identity. Talbott suggests that the machines we create are a reflection of our own limitations, and they can shape our thinking and behavior.The Impact of Computers on Society: Many chapters discuss how computers have transformed various aspects of society, including education, communication, and community. Talbott explores both the positive and negative consequences of this impact.The Loss of Meaning: Talbott often touches upon the idea that computers emphasize logic and information over meaning and purpose. This loss of meaning is seen as a potential consequence of our increasing reliance on technology.Human Agency and Responsibility: There's a recurring theme of human agency and responsibility in shaping the future in the face of advancing technology. Talbott emphasizes that we should be aware of technology's influence and take responsibility for its effects.Education and Technology: Several chapters delve into the relationship between computers and education. Talbott questions whether technology-driven education may hinder rather than enhance genuine learning and creativity.The Nature of Language and Communication: Talbott reflects on how computers impact language and communication, questioning whether detached, formal abstraction takes precedence over genuine human expression.The Evolution of Consciousness: The book draws on the work of Owen Barfield to explore the evolution of human consciousness in the context of technology. It questions whether technology might lead to a detachment from the world.Individual vs. Collective: Talbott discusses the tension between individual creativity and freedom and the collective influence of technology on society. He challenges the idea that technology alone can solve social problems.Balance and Awareness: The recurring message is the need for balance, mindfulness, and self-awareness in our relationship with technology. Talbott suggests that we must actively engage with technology while remaining conscious of its potential pitfalls.These interconnections demonstrate how the book weaves together a complex tapestry of ideas, all centered around the profound impact of computers and technology on our lives and our responsibility to navigate this impact wisely.
Science, Art, and the Theory of Knowledge
âPerception: Connections Between Art and Science,â a paper originally presented as an invited paper, âPerception and Hypotheses of Perceptionâ at a conference sponsored by the British Museum of Natural History (London, April 4-7, 2000). What is the role of thinking (âintentionalityâ) in the perceived world? 

Being on Earth: Practice In Tending the Appearances (2006), a book by Georg Maier, Ronald Brady, and Stephen Edelglass. Bradyâs chapters are entitled âDirect Experienceâ (chapter 1), âIntentionalityâ (chapter 4), and âManifestation from Inside Outâ (chapter 8). 

âMind, Models and Cartesian Observers: A Note on Conceptual Problemsâ (1981), reprinted from Journal of Social and Biological Structures vol. 4, no. 3 (July), pp. 277-86. In this response to an article by Alex Comfort, Brady suggests that the âCartesian splitâ between mind and matter was the result of Descartesâ failure to realize the full implications of his assertion, âI think, therefore I am.â Overcoming this failure could lead to a healing of the mind-matter dichotomy so prevalent in western culture. 

âGetting Rid of Metaphysicsâ (2001), reprinted (with revisions by the author) from Elemente der Naturwissenschaft. Here Brady argues that, because science fails to recognize the mindâs participation in the world it investigates, âscientific thinking is limited to a form of thought that cannot question its own premises.â 

 âGoetheâs Natural Science: Some Non-Cartesian Meditationsâ (1977), reprinted from Toward a Man-Centered Science (vol. 1 of the series, âA New Image of Man in Medicineâ), edited by Karl E. Schaefer, Herbert Hensel and Ronald Brady. Mt. Kisco NY: Futura Publishing Company. Brady shows that when we cognize an activity, âit is impossible to place [that activity] beyond the thinking that refers to it, for the activity we cognize is the intentional activity by which we cognize it. Activity simply refuses to stand over and against the thinker ...â 

 âHow We Make Sense of the World: A Study in Rudolf Steinerâs Epistemological Workâ (posthumous), published here for the first time. The issues Brady discusses are fundamental for all science â and, indeed, for all inquiry into the character of the world we live in. Bradyâs way of expressing himself in this treatise â originally intended as an introduction to a collection of writings on epistemology â is often compressed and dense with meaning, but the rewards for diligent study are high. 

âTowards a Common Morphology for Aesthetics and Natural Science: A Study of Goetheâs Empiricismâ (1972, Ph.D. thesis), published here for the first time. The thesis discusses Kant and Schiller as well as Goethe, fleshes out the idea of metamorphosis in Goetheâs thought, and looks at historical interpretations of morphology from Linnaeus, to Owen, to Darwin, to modern phylogenetic morphology. It also explores the relation between aesthetics and natural science.

Form and Cause in Biology
âForm and Cause in Goetheâs Morphologyâ (1987), reprinted from Goethe and the Sciences: A Reappraisal, edited by F. Amrine, F. J. Zucker, and H. Wheeler, pp. 257-300. Dordrecht, Holland: D. Reidel. What is the character of the dynamic form through which we recognize and categorize organisms? As Brady shows in a magisterial treatment, every fully contextualized organic form leads us to a unified whole (not to be confused with a physical body) that is its own causal explanation. 

For a highly accessible summary of, and commentary upon, Bradyâs discussion of form and cause in biology, see âHow Does an Organism Get Its Shape? The Causal Role of Biological Form,â by Stephen L. Talbott.

 See also the articles under Evolution and Systematics below.

Evolution and Natural Selection 
âDogma and Doubtâ (1982), reprinted from Biological Journal of the Linnean Society. This paper explores the role of evidence and belief in the doctrine of natural selection. Along the way, it clarifies the frequent charge that the theory of natural selection is tautological. See also âNatural Selection and The Criteria by Which a Theory Is Judged,â below. 

âNatural Selection and The Criteria by Which a Theory Is Judgedâ (1979), reprinted from Systematic Biology vol. 28, pp. 600-21. This decisively important paper remains crucially relevant to discussions of evolutionary theory today. Brady reviews â and casts a flood of light upon â the problem of the testability of natural selection â a problem often confused with the issue of tautology. This article covers much of the same territory as âDogma and Doubt,â but with a wealth of fresh observation and commentary.

Evolution and Biogeography 
âThe Global Patterns of Life: A New Empiricism in Biogeographyâ (1989), reprinted from Gaia and Evolution (Proceedings of the Second Annual Camelford Conference on the Implications of the Gaia Thesis), edited by Peter Bunyard and Edward Goldsmith. This essay disentangles the role of observational evidence and âpseudo-phenomenal eventsâ in biogeographical explanations. (Biogeography is the study of the distribution of the ranges of plants and animals.)

Evolution and Systematics 
âExplanation, Description, and the Meaning of âTransformationâ in Taxonomic Evidenceâ (1994), reprinted from Models in Phylogeny Reconstruction, edited by Robert W. Scotland, Darrell J. Siebert, and David M. Williams. 

âOn the Independence of Systematicsâ (1985), reprinted from Cladistics vol. 1, no. 2, pp. 113-26. Systematics â the science that recovers the systematic patterns observed in taxonomic groups â gives us the observational data that an evolutionary theory must explain, and that Darwin attempted to explain. When, counter to Darwinâs approach, the proposed explanation is made a basis for articulating the patterns, then the basis for an independent assessment of the theoryâs explanations is lost. 

âParsimony, Hierarchy, and Biological Implicationsâ (1983), reprinted from Advances in Cladistics vol. 2. Proceedings of the Second Meeting of the Willi Hennig Society. Edited by Norman I. Platnick and V. A. Funk, pp. 49-60. New York: Columbia University Press. 

âPattern Description, Process Explanation, and the History of the Morphological Sciencesâ (1994), reprinted from Interpreting the Hierarchy of Nature: From Systematic Patterns to Evolutionary Process Theories edited by Lance Grande and Olivier Rieppel, pp. 7-31. San Diego CA: Academic Press. 

âTheoretical Issues and âPattern Cladisticsââ (1982), reprinted from Systematic Zoology vol. 31, no. 3, pp. 286-91. Here Brady takes issue with philosopher of biology, John Beatty, who claims that the pattern cladistsâ search for morphological patterns, and for hierarchical groupings of patterns, among organisms past and present is antagonistic to standard evolutionary explanations. Brady concludes that Beattyâs argument actually adds further support for the work undertaken by pattern cladists. 

See also âForm and Cause in Goetheâs Morphologyâ above. ChatGPTIt appears that the provided excerpts include various writings by different authors, primarily focusing on topics related to philosophy, perception, science, art, and the theory of knowledge, as well as evolutionary biology and systematics. While each piece may have its distinct focus and context, there are some overarching themes and connections that can be identified:Intentionality and Perception: Several of the writings, such as "Perception: Connections Between Art and Science" and "Direct Experience," delve into the concept of intentionality in perception. They explore how our thoughts and intentions influence our perception of the world.Mind-Matter Relationship: The writings by Ronald Brady, including "Mind, Models and Cartesian Observers" and "Getting Rid of Metaphysics," touch on the relationship between the mind and matter. They question the Cartesian split between mind and matter and its implications for our understanding of the world.Epistemology and Scientific Thinking: The writings by Stephen Edelglass and Ronald Brady, like "How We Make Sense of the World" and "Towards a Common Morphology for Aesthetics and Natural Science," delve into epistemological questions. They explore how we acquire knowledge and how scientific thinking may have limitations.Morphology and Biological Form: The writings on Goethe's morphology and biological form, such as "Form and Cause in Goethe's Morphology," emphasize the importance of understanding dynamic forms in biology and how they relate to causal explanations.Evolutionary Theory: Several writings, including "Dogma and Doubt" and "Natural Selection and The Criteria by Which a Theory Is Judged," discuss aspects of evolutionary theory. They address issues related to evidence, testability, and the criteria for evaluating evolutionary concepts.Biogeography and Systematics: The writings on biogeography and systematics, like "The Global Patterns of Life" and "On the Independence of Systematics," explore the role of observation and explanation in these fields and their implications for evolutionary theory.Overall, these writings seem to engage with questions of perception, intentionality, scientific methodology, and the relationship between mind and matter. They offer philosophical insights into various aspects of science, art, and knowledge.Throughout his productive scholarly career, Ronald Brady concerned himself with the philosophical foundations and practice of phenomena-centered science. He made substantial contributions to the study of evolutionary morphology and systematics, while also pursuing fundamental issues in epistemology. His 1987 elucidation of âForm and Cause in Goetheâs Morphologyâ may count among the most decisively revealing biological papers of the past several decades â one that the scientific world has yet to catch up with. 

At the time of his death on March 27, 2003, Brady was a professor of philosophy, teaching in the School of American and International Studies at Ramapo College, Mahwah, New Jersey, having joined the schoolâs faculty in 1972. An Affiliate Researcher at The Nature Institute during his later years, he was also a member of SENSRI, an organization in Saratoga Springs, New York, devoted to phenomena-centered research. 

 Brady told this story about his undergraduate days: 

When I began college as a chemistry major my enthusiasm for science was somewhat dampened by meeting a professor of chemistry who pointed out the difference between my own goals and those he, as an experienced professional, would call mature. My passion, he noted, was entirely focused on direct experience â my sense of chemical change was invested in sensible qualities: in smells, colors, the effervescence of liquids, the appearance of precipitates, the light and violence of flame, etc. But, he countered, this was probably closer to medieval alchemy than to chemistry. The latter is really a matter of molecular and atomic events of which we can have only a theoretical grasp, and the sensible experience on which my excitement centered was secondary ... I was reminded of him when I spoke to a morphologist at Berkeley about my interest in Goetheâs attempt to approach science by keeping to direct experience. The morphologist responded: âYou are interested in this approach because you are a Nature appreciator, while I am a productive scientist.â It is always nice to see where one stands. 

We think Ron would agree that much of his career was devoted to understanding the views of those college mentors â and also recognizing their limitations.ChatGPTRonald Brady's scholarly career and contributions to the fields of science, philosophy, and epistemology are indeed noteworthy. His focus on phenomena-centered science, as well as his exploration of evolutionary morphology and systematics, reflects a dedication to understanding the foundational aspects of these disciplines.The story from his undergraduate days illustrates his enduring commitment to direct sensory experience in science, even when faced with the prevailing trends of theoretical and abstract approaches. It's clear that Brady valued the immediacy and richness of direct experience in scientific inquiry, and this perspective guided much of his work.His involvement with organizations like The Nature Institute and SENSRI highlights his continued engagement with phenomena-centered research and his desire to explore the fundamental questions in science.Ronald Brady's legacy lives on through his contributions to the fields he cared deeply about, and his willingness to challenge conventional thinking and explore the boundaries of scientific inquiry continues to inspire those who share his passion for understanding the natural world.Martin Wagenschein (1896-1988) was a physicist and educator. He was a secondary school teacher for over thirty years and later became a professor of education at the University of TÃ¼bingen for 22 years. He is well-known in German-speaking education circles for his impassioned and clear call to transform science and math teaching. His goal was to reconnect science teaching with both the developing child and nature. He saw the detrimental effects of theory-based instruction and rote learning that inform so much of science education today. He developed an experience-based approach to science education. For him science classes should be first and foremost an exploration of concrete phenomena â students thereby learn science as a process of inquiry rather than as a body of set facts and theories. 

Wagenschein should be a âmust-readâ for anyone who teaches science, since he forcefully characterizes the need for experience-based learning and shows how one can best lead students to their own insights in a living process of discovery. Moreover, Wagenscheinâs essays contain some of the most lucid justifications of phenomena-based science that exist, ideal for parents and others who want to understand the reasons behind this âdifferentâ approach to teaching science. 

Unfortunately, Wagenschein is virtually unknown in the English-speaking world. Only a couple of his essays have previously been translated.* Having discovered Wagenschein as a kindred spirit, we desired to make his work more widely accessible. To this end, we undertook a project to translate and make available selections from his work. Here are links to the essays we have translated: 

âLight and Objectsâ
   This little gem may seem simple, but harbors Wagenscheinâs years of concern about human faithfulness (and lack thereof) to the phenomenal world â to how things actually appear to us. Wagenschein always selected his words very carefully, and his choice of words and phrasing is highly original and pictorial. We have done our best to capture some of this spirit in the following translation. 

âTwo Moons?â
   This essay describes the moon physicists speak about and the moon of our everyday human experience that poets also bring to expression. Wagenschein argues that the narrow scientific view, as accurate as it may be, should not be taught to the exclusion of the moon as it speaks to the fullness of human experience. 

âSave The Phenomena: The Primacy of Unmediated Experienceâ
   From Brownian motion to the gracefully ponderous motion of a massive pendulum to the mysteries hidden in still water, sound, and radioactivity, Wagenschein offers a master teacher's insights into experienced-based learning that engages the student in a lively way. 

âTeaching to Understand: On the Concept of the Exemplary in Teachingâ
   How do both teaching and learning become living experiences for the participants?  Wagenschein shows that covering large amounts of material is not the way to help students learn.

âThe Flaming Candle: Experiential Learning in the Fourth Gradeâ by Ueli Aeschlimann
   Aeschlimann is a teacher and professor of education who researches Martin Wagenschein's approach to science education in the elementary school.  Here he describes an example of teaching in the spirit of Wagenschein.  

For a bibliography of Wagenscheinâs publications in German, please see the Martin Wagenschein Archive. 

* Two essays by Wagenschein have been published in Teaching as a Reflective Process, edited by I. Westbury et al. (Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Assoc., 2000): a condensed version of âTeaching to Understand: On the Concept of the Exemplary in Teachingâ (pp. 161-75), and âThe Law of Free Fall as an âExemplary Themeâ for the Mathematicizability of Certain Natural Processesâ (pp. 285-93). ChatGPTMartin Wagenschein's approach to science and math education, emphasizing experience-based learning and a deep connection to the natural world, is indeed valuable and aligns with a more holistic and inquiry-driven perspective on education. His insights into the need to ground science teaching in concrete phenomena and encourage students to explore and inquire are highly relevant.The translations of his essays provide English-speaking educators and those interested in science education with a glimpse into his philosophy and teaching methods. Wagenschein's emphasis on the importance of capturing the richness of human experience in science education and not reducing it to dry facts and theories is a perspective that can greatly benefit both teachers and students.While he may be less known in the English-speaking world, his work serves as a reminder of the importance of nurturing curiosity and fostering a deep appreciation for the natural world in the process of learning. His approach can inspire educators to rethink their teaching methods and prioritize experiential learning in science and mathematics education.Unintended Effects of Genetic Manipulation

Introduction to this site
Much of the public debate concerning genetically modified organisms, their widespread use in animal and human food, and their impact upon the environment could be raised to an entirely new and more productive level if certain undisputed facts were more widely known. The facts at issue have to do with the unintended and systemic consequences of genetic manipulations, as revealed in one research report after another.

Putting the matter plainly: when researchers try to engineer changes in an organismâs genetic material, the results for the organism and its environment almost always include unpredictable effects. The intended result may or may not be achieved in any given case, but the one almost sure thing is that unintended resultsânontarget effectsâwill also be achieved.

These facts have been, and are being, widely reported in the scientific literature. While they are correcting our understanding in important ways, they are not at all controversial. And they bear directly upon the wisdom of virtually all the current genetic engineering practices. If there has been limited reportage of unintended effects in the popular press, it may be because the facts are often buried in technical scientific articles. And within genetic engineering research itself, scientists are mainly concerned with achieving targeted effects and not with investigating beyond the range of their own intentions and reporting unexpected effects. But when they do investigate, there is usually plenty to see.

It is the purpose of this project to make evidence about the wide-ranging and never wholly predictable effects of genetic engineering readily accessible to concerned citizens, policy makers, and scientists. We have collected examples from the scientific literature, primarily from peer-reviewed journals, and written short reports on each example. These are ordered according to different categories and include effects on the manipulated organisms themselves as well as broader environmental ripple effects. Our compilation of reports is by no means exhaustive and will be expanded over time. The technical literature we have not yet touched remains extensive. 

Understanding the Unintended Effects of Genetic Manipulation â An Introduction by Craig Holdrege is a great place for newcomers to start, as it provides essential background information about unintended effects. What do we mean by unintended effects? How are these effects detected? What are the different categories of unintended effects? We encourage readers to consult this article in connection with searching the individual reports.

Here is a collection of articles on the broader issues of genetics and genetic engineering written by Nature Institute members Craig Holdrege and Steve Talbott, and others that can support oneâs inquiry into this subject matter. And here is a list of online resources relating to genetically engineered organismsâparticularly their risks, regulation, and use.

Finally, perhaps you are wondering why we should expect genetic engineering routinely to produce the sort of unintended effects documented on this site. You will find it much less mysterious if you review this collection of informal notes from the technical literature, entitled âHow the Organism Decides What to Make of Its Genes.â The processes involved in gene expression are so diverse, so complex, so interwoven, and so dependent upon an ever-changing context that it is inevitable we should run up against the limits of our predictive powers.ChatGPTThe Nature Institute's project on the unintended effects of genetic manipulation sheds light on a critical aspect of genetic engineering that often goes overlooked in public discourse. The project emphasizes the fact that genetic manipulations, while aiming to achieve specific outcomes, almost invariably lead to unintended and often unpredictable consequences.Key points from this project include:Unpredictable Consequences: Genetic engineering, despite its precise intentions, frequently results in unintended effects or nontarget effects within organisms and their environments.Scientific Literature: These unintended effects are well-documented in the scientific literature, although they may not always receive widespread attention in popular media due to their technical nature.Broad Implications: The unintended effects of genetic engineering have wide-ranging implications, affecting both the manipulated organisms and the broader environment.Project Purpose: The project's purpose is to make the evidence of unintended effects easily accessible to concerned citizens, policymakers, and scientists. It includes short reports on examples from the scientific literature, categorized by their effects.Ongoing Expansion: The project acknowledges that its compilation of reports is not exhaustive and will continue to expand over time.Understanding Unintended Effects: The introductory article by Craig Holdrege, "Understanding the Unintended Effects of Genetic Manipulation," provides essential background information about what unintended effects are, how they are detected, and their different categories.Complex Gene Expression: The project points out that the complexities and interdependencies involved in gene expression make it challenging to predict all the outcomes of genetic manipulations accurately.This project serves as a valuable resource for those interested in the broader implications and risks associated with genetic engineering, helping to promote a more informed and nuanced discussion surrounding genetic manipulation.Technology and Human Responsibility
When science is governed by a conviction that the world is a machine, the distinction between science and technology naturally grows tenuous. Indeed, the influential philosopher, Daniel Dennett, has argued even of biology that it âis not just like engineering; it is engineering. It is the study of functional mechanisms, their design, construction, and operation.â And the University of Texas historian of science and technology, David Channell, argues that we should no longer think of technology as applied science; rather, âscience is just applied technology.â 

The study of technology is therefore essential to an understanding of what science is becoming today. You might say that all the work of The Nature Institute relates to technology â that is, we are concerned to rise from a technological or mechanistic view of the world to a living, qualitative, and contextual understanding of it. In order to achieve this, we must understand the character of technological thinking as deeply as possible, and learn how to transform it. Here is some of our work aiming in this direction: 

NetFuture Archive
In 1995, Stephen Talbott started the online publication, NetFuture: Technology and Human Responsibility. It became a publication of The Nature Institute in 1998, and a total of 189 issues were published. The articles, mainly written by Stephen Talbott, focus heavily, but not exclusively, on technological issues and the contrast between mechanistic and organic thinking. NetFuture gained wide influence as (in political scientist Langdon Winnerâs words) âone of the few places on the Net where wisdom finds a voice.â

NetFuture is now maintained as an archive that includes all articles and a topical index.

The Future Does Not Compute
Transcending the Machines in Our Midst
The networked computer and digital technologies in general have rapidly come to define the quintessential âmachineâ assumed by the theoretical constructions of mechanistic science. In his 1995 book, The Future Does Not Compute, Steve Talbott looks at a broad range of issues, including: 

how computers and the Net can distort the education of the child; 

the relation between technology and environmental concerns; 

the power of computer-based organizations to sustain themselves in a semi-somnambulistic manner, free of conscious, present control; 

the tendency of the âglobal villageâ to dissolve real villages;

the role of computers in supporting group activity; 

the hollowing out of language by technology; 

how to understand computers within the context of the broad evolution of human consciousness;

the connections between high technology and a new kind of mysticism.

See the bookâs main page for the full text of the book, along with an annotated table of contents and excerpts from reviews. 

Devices of the Soul
Battling for Our Selves in the Age of Machines
In this âurgent and important bookâ (according to Michael Pollan), Steve Talbott challenges us to step back and take an objective look at the technology driving our lives. In the course of this exploration, Talbott illustrates that weâre forgetting one important thing â our Selves, the human spirit from which technology stems. Find out more about Devices of the Soul by visiting our bookstore. 

Technology and the Handicapped
Our booklet, Extraordinary Lives: Disability and Destiny in a Technological Age, explores the role of technological assists in the life of the handicapped, and by this means throws light on the larger role of technology in modern society. Written by Steve Talbott, the booklet is part of our series of Nature Institute PerspectivesChatGPTThe Nature Institute addresses the complex relationship between technology and human responsibility in the context of modern science and culture. Here are some key points and resources related to their work in this area:Blurring Lines Between Science and Technology: The Institute acknowledges the blurring of lines between science and technology. Some argue that science is becoming more like engineering and vice versa, which has profound implications for our understanding of both fields.Understanding Technological Thinking: To achieve a more qualitative and contextual understanding of the world, The Nature Institute emphasizes the need to deeply understand the character of technological thinking and learn how to transform it.NetFuture Archive: The Institute published the online publication "NetFuture: Technology and Human Responsibility" starting in 1995. It continued for 189 issues and mainly focused on technological issues, mechanistic versus organic thinking, and the ethical and philosophical dimensions of technology. It is now maintained as an archive.The Future Does Not Compute: This book by Steve Talbott, published in 1995, explores various aspects of the impact of computers and digital technologies on society. It delves into topics like education, environmental concerns, the influence of technology on group dynamics, and the effect of technology on language and human consciousness.Devices of the Soul: In this book, Steve Talbott challenges readers to critically examine the role of technology in their lives and emphasizes the importance of not losing sight of our human spirit amid the technological advancements.Technology and the Handicapped: The Nature Institute has published a booklet titled "Extraordinary Lives: Disability and Destiny in a Technological Age," authored by Steve Talbott. It explores how technological assistance affects the lives of the handicapped and sheds light on the broader role of technology in modern society.Overall, The Nature Institute's work aims to foster a deeper understanding of the ethical, social, and philosophical implications of technology while encouraging responsible and thoughtful engagement with technological advancements.A Few Places to Start
From among the several hundred articles on various aspects of technology that have appeared in NetFuture and elsewhere, the following rather arbitrary selections may suggest wider horizons to explore: 

âOf Machines, Organisms, and Agency,â by Stephen L. Talbott. In Context #35 (Spring 2016). 
   Whether we look at them at the molecular level or as we naturally encounter them, organisms appear to be agents carrying out intentions, even if not consciously or in anything like a human manner. But what do we mean by âagencyâ and âintentionâ? 

âWhen Engineers Take Hold of Life: Synthetic Biologyâ, by Craig Holdrege. In Context #32 (Fall 2014). 
   What happens when genetic engineers, becoming yet more ambitious, begin to envision the synthesis of altogether new life forms, using Lego block-like âBioBricksâ? The ambition may be foolish, but huge resources are now being devoted to it, with grave implications for the biological future. 

âComputers, the Internet, and the Abdication of Consciousness,â an interview of Steve Talbott for the C. G. Jung web page, conducted by Dolores Brien.
   In her introduction to the interview, Brien writes, âThe thrust of Stephen Talbottâs deeply thought and deeply felt work is to awaken us from our psychological somnambulism vis Ã  vis the technology which permeates our personal life and culture.â 

âThe Trouble with Ubiquitous Computing,â Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3, in NetFuture.
   By letting their work develop out of a one-sided preoccupation with the technological milieu rather than immersion in the meaningful contexts affected by their inventions, high-tech engineers inflict technological âanswersâ upon us without any serious reference to the supposed problems they are the answers for. Anything that can be automated should be automated â so runs a common sentiment within the high-tech world. What is right about this, and what is just plain foolish? 

âChildren of the Machine,â chapter 14 in The Future Does Not Compute.
  Through education based on computer programming, the child loses â never having fully developed it in the first place â that fluid, imaginative ability to let experience reshape itself in meaningful ways before she carves out of it a set of atomic facts. 

âWhoâs Killing Higher Education? (Or is It Suicide?)â in NetFuture #78.
   For a long while now we have slowly been reconceiving education as the transfer of information from one database or brain to another. In the end, we will realize that this makes not only the teacher but also the student obsolete.

âIs Technological Improvement What We Want?â in NetFuture #38.
   Technical improvements in the intelligent machinery around us tend to represent a deepened threat in the very areas we began by trying to improve. This, so long as we do not recognize it, is the Great Deceit of intelligent machinery. The opportunity to make software more friendly is also an opportunity to make it unfriendly at a more decisive level.

Finally: go to the NetFuture topical index for a list of several dozen subject headings, each of which links to the appropriate articles.ChatGPTThese curated selections provide a starting point for exploring the articles and discussions related to technology and human responsibility from The Nature Institute:"Of Machines, Organisms, and Agency" by Stephen L. Talbott (In Context #35, Spring 2016): This article delves into the concept of agency and intention in organisms and how they relate to technology."When Engineers Take Hold of Life: Synthetic Biology" by Craig Holdrege (In Context #32, Fall 2014): Explore the implications of genetic engineers aiming to create entirely new life forms using synthetic biology."Computers, the Internet, and the Abdication of Consciousness": An interview with Steve Talbott conducted by Dolores Brien, focusing on technology's impact on our consciousness and culture."The Trouble with Ubiquitous Computing" (Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3) in NetFuture: Delve into the consequences of engineers focusing on technological solutions without considering the meaningful contexts affected by their inventions."Children of the Machine" (Chapter 14 in "The Future Does Not Compute"): This chapter explores how education based on computer programming can impact a child's imaginative abilities."Whoâs Killing Higher Education? (Or is It Suicide?)" in NetFuture #78: Discover how the concept of education has shifted from a transfer of information to something more mechanistic."Is Technological Improvement What We Want?" in NetFuture #38: This article discusses how technological improvements can inadvertently pose threats in various areas of our lives.For more in-depth exploration, you can also refer to the NetFuture topical index, which provides access to numerous subject headings and related articles on various aspects of technology and its impact on society and culture.Living Soils
Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity
â Simone Weil
Are we able to perceive whether a farm is healthy or not? Are we aware of how our ways of seeing, speaking, and thinking contribute to the creation of our agricultural reality â for better and for worse?

The sustainable agricultural movement grew in part out of the perception of the effects of distancing ourselves from nature through the industrialization of agriculture. These effects include declining biodiversity, air and water pollution, degradation of soils and erosion, high energy needs, negative health impacts of pesticides on human and other life, unintended effects of genetically engineered organisms, and disruption of rural communities. There is also an overriding focus on quantity and uniformity instead of quality and diversity in breeding, cropping techniques, and food production. All of these contribute to global climate disruption.

Such negative effects are themselves symptoms of a more deeply seated dissociation of human thinking and motivation from the dynamic and interconnected workings of nature. We need not only a shift in practices but also a shift in human consciousness out of which new ways of interacting with nature in agriculture can develop.

The Living Soils initiative was directed by Bruno Follador from 2014 until 2018. The broad intent of the initiative was to:

Stimulate holistic ways of perceiving and working with the farm as a dynamic organism.

Integrate the development of high-quality composting into the life of the farm to foster soil fertility and farm resilience.

The emphasis on inputs (fertilizers, irrigation, pesticides) in industrial agriculture has led to a global degradation of soils. Composted organic matter produced on the farm (manure and plant material) is a means to enhance soil fertility while reducing inputs, fostering a healthy carbon cycle, and when done properly, reducing polluting agricultural runoff.

Surprisingly, even organic and biodynamic farmers and others committed to sustainable practices rarely have adequate training in composting practices. As a result, the quality of their compost and soils is often not what it could be. Composting is often not carefully guided as a process integrated into the whole farm. Concerted efforts are needed to improve and popularize farm-scale and garden-scale composting systems and applications.

But enhancing the vitality of the soil is not just a matter of learning a set of particular methods, just as the vitality of the soil is not only a matter of its chemical composition. Living Soils addressed the need to develop qualitative ways of understanding that recognize and focus on dynamic processes. Soil health is bound up with the dynamics of the whole farm organism, which includes the inner perspectives of the farmers. Living Soils provided training to help farmers develop skills in perceiving, comprehending, and interacting wisely with the complex, interwoven flow of living processes at work on their particular farms. Such skills are essential, if agriculture is to enhance food and environment quality instead of degrading them.

In short, the initiativeâs goal was to help farmers and others committed to sustainable agriculture and agroecology cultivate dynamic ways of seeing and understanding that then find concrete, on-farm applications, especially in composting and in quality assessments of compost and soils.

Living Soils projects included:

Hands-on workshops and courses. Main topics: Holistic ways of knowing in agriculture. Controlled heat method of composting based on Ehrenfried Pfeifferâs work and its integration into the whole-farm organism; Qualitative assessment of compost and soil with a special focus on round-filter chromatography, originally developed by Ehrenfried Pfeiffer. 

Integrated consulting services for farmers and gardeners including qualitative compost/soil assessment, with a focus on chromatography.

Research: Refine and further develop qualitative testing methods for compost and soil through on-farm research and a related new laboratory at The Nature Institute.

Collaborations, educational resources, and outreach to promote holistic approaches to farm and soil health.

Comments from Participants about Living Soils Workshops
âBrunoâs composting workshop was outstanding! I think the highlight of my weekend.â (Participant in our workshop, âComposting as a Free Deed: Being and Becoming,â at the 2014 Biodynamic Association Conference)

â[The] two-day workshop on Composting and Ehrenfried Pfeifferâs Chromatography given by Bruno Follador at Thyme Again Gardens left fourteen participants with increased enthusiasm, passion, and confidence to tackle small-scale and large-scale composting projects ... Brunoâs dedication and passion for compost-making resonated throughout all the sessions. His enthusiasm blended with his ability to clearly explain compost dynamics, principles, and practical applications.â (Newsletter of the Society for Biodynamic Farming and Gardening in Ontario)

âThere were many examples (arising in presentations, discussion and activities) that linked qualitative aspects with practical aspects of making compost and managing a farm ... [Thanks for] providing the kind of thinking, the language, and the reasons for incorporating imaginative cognition and deeper perceptions into our work in education and farming.â (Professor of Biology and founder of the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative at his New York public university)ChatGPTThe Living Soils initiative, directed by Bruno Follador from 2014 to 2018, aimed to address the challenges facing agriculture, particularly related to soil health and sustainability. Here's a summary of the initiative's goals and activities:Holistic Perceptions: The initiative sought to encourage holistic ways of perceiving and working with farms as dynamic organisms. It recognized that understanding and addressing agricultural challenges required a shift in human consciousness, moving away from mechanistic thinking.Composting for Soil Fertility: An essential aspect of the initiative was to integrate high-quality composting into farming practices to enhance soil fertility and farm resilience. Composting organic matter produced on the farm, such as manure and plant material, can reduce the need for external inputs while improving soil health.Training and Workshops: Living Soils organized hands-on workshops and courses focusing on holistic approaches to agriculture. These workshops covered topics like holistic knowing in agriculture, composting methods, and qualitative assessment of compost and soil quality.Consulting Services: Integrated consulting services were offered to farmers and gardeners, providing qualitative assessment of compost and soil with a specific focus on chromatography. This helped individuals understand the quality of their compost and soil and make improvements accordingly.Research and Development: The initiative engaged in research to refine and develop qualitative testing methods for compost and soil. A laboratory at The Nature Institute was established to support this research.Collaboration and Outreach: Living Soils collaborated with various organizations and provided educational resources and outreach to promote holistic approaches to farm and soil health.The articles linked provide insights into the philosophical and practical aspects of the Living Soils initiative, emphasizing the importance of understanding dynamic processes in agriculture and soil health. The initiative aimed to equip farmers and practitioners with the skills to perceive, comprehend, and interact wisely with the complex, interconnected processes on their farms.It's clear that Living Soils recognized that sustainable agriculture goes beyond just adopting specific practices; it requires a deeper understanding of the living dynamics of nature and the role of human consciousness in agricultural processes.Writings related to a Goethean Phenomenological Approach to Science

Here are some common threads that link these topics:Holistic Approach: A central theme in Goethean science is the holistic approach to understanding natural phenomena. This approach recognizes that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and it emphasizes the interconnectedness of all aspects of nature. Whether studying plants, animals, humans, or celestial bodies, these approaches seek to understand entities within the context of their broader ecological or systemic relationships.Phenomenological Observation: Goethean science places a strong emphasis on careful and precise observation of natural phenomena. This involves paying attention to details, nuances, and qualitative aspects often overlooked in conventional scientific approaches. Observers strive to engage with the phenomenon itself rather than abstracting it into quantitative data.Qualitative Thinking: In Goethean science, qualitative thinking is highly valued. This mode of thinking encourages individuals to go beyond mechanistic or reductionist explanations and instead explore the inner qualities and essences of phenomena. This approach is particularly evident in the study of color, where qualitative experiences play a central role.Interdisciplinary Perspective: Many of these topics involve interdisciplinary perspectives, drawing from fields such as biology, physics, philosophy, and education. The interconnectedness of knowledge is recognized, and insights from one field may inform and enrich understanding in another.Context and Environment: Whether examining plants, animals, humans, or celestial bodies, Goethean science pays attention to the context and environment in which these entities exist. The relationship between organisms and their environments is a recurring theme, emphasizing the importance of context in understanding phenomena.Spiritual and Ethical Dimensions: Goethean science often acknowledges the spiritual and ethical dimensions of scientific inquiry. It seeks to promote a deeper reverence for nature and a sense of responsibility toward the natural world. This perspective is particularly evident in discussions of ecology and sustainability.Educational Implications: Several writings explore how a Goethean phenomenological approach can be applied in education. They discuss teaching methods that encourage students to engage with the living qualities of the subjects they study, fostering a more profound connection to the world around them.Critical Engagement with Modern Science: Some writings critically engage with modern scientific paradigms, especially in areas like genetics, evolution, and biotechnology. They offer alternative viewpoints and highlight the limitations of reductionist approaches.Overall, the common thread among these topics is a commitment to understanding nature in a more holistic, qualitative, and context-sensitive manner. They represent an alternative paradigm in science and education that seeks to bridge the gap between objective observation and subjective experience, fostering a deeper appreciation of the natural world.Recalling What We Have Hidden
A contemplation of Erazim KohÃ¡kâs book The Embers and the Stars: A Philosophical Inquiry Into the Moral Sense of Nature
Ryan Shea
From In Context #49 (Spring, 2023)

In my dining room hangs a print purchased several years ago for me by my wife. It is titled âAgainst Forgetting.â At first glance, it looks like a simple black and white photo of a cross-section of a tree, showing the growth rings. Closer inspection reveals that this is only half the story. The other half is a photograph of a human thumbprint, which almost perfectly mirrors the tree rings, matching them line for line. The image serves as an icon. Fingerprints and tree rings are beheld together. The holding together is accomplished with a single activity that is both seeing and remembering. I see the print with my eyes and an aspect of that seeing is re-membering humans and trees together as members of a unified whole. It is an icon âAgainst Forgetting.â


Samuel Johnson once wrote that âpeople need to be reminded more often than they need to be instructed.â Erazim KohÃ¡kâs 1987 book, The Embers and the Stars: A Philosophical Inquiry Into the Moral Sense of Nature, (University of Chicago Press) takes up the work of reminding. KohÃ¡k (1933-2020) was a philosopher who was rigorously trained in the German phenomenological tradition focusing especially on the work of Edmund Husserl. This is a philosophical book. It is a book of deep reflection that engages with the thoughts of philosophers and scientists. The goal, however, is far from abstract argument for its own sake. He summarizes the task of his book by saying âI have not sought to âprove a pointâ but to evoke and share a vision. Thus my primary tool has been the metaphor, not the argument, and the product of my labors is not a doctrine but an invitation to look and to see. With Husserl, I have sought not to instruct but to point out, to recall what we have forgotten.â

KohÃ¡k sought to incarnate this goal both as a professor of philosophy and as a modern-day Thoreau. During the day hours of the week, he would teach at Boston University, but on nights, weekends, and school breaks he would return to his New Hampshire homestead. Here he lived all year round without electricity in a house he had built in the middle of a clearing that he had cleared with his own axe. The titular âembers and starsâ that guide his thinking are only visible to him in the New Hampshire darkness and solitude. The blare of civilized noise and the glare of civilized lights leave us deaf and blind to what shows itself in nature. KohÃ¡k went to the woods to achieve clarity of vision and to per- form his work of ârecalling what we have thus hidden from ourselves.â What does KohÃ¡k think we have hidden and forgotten? How has it blocked our vision? And how might we remember?

Modern natural science strives above all else to be objective. The scientific spirit is that wherein all hints of subjectivity have been expunged. For this reason, to be anthropomorphic, that is, to attribute human attributes to natural beings, is the unforgivable sin and must be scrupulously avoided. The trouble is that human beings are subjects. Everything we experience is experienced by us as subjects. The ideal of strict objectivity requires that we forget this obvious truth. The first kind of forgetfulness is a self-forgetfulness. In this purposeful ignoring, this willful ignorance, we also forget everything that pertains to humans as subjects. KohÃ¡k gives the following list of what we lose when we forget ourselves: âvalue, meaning, beauty, goodness, truth, holiness.â

The amnesia does not stop at the self. Our everyday experience of the natural world is not of the dead world described by physics and chemistry, devoid of all value, meaning, beauty, goodness, truth, and holiness. As a matter of daily fact, we do not encounter our own pets as mere complex mechanisms, or our local Audubon nature preserve as so many board feet of lumber. As I sit and watch a sparrow at my bird feeder, I am struck by what KohÃ¡k calls its âintegrity,â which is ânot merely [its] utility but an intrinsic, absolute value ingressing in the order of time.â It is good that the sparrow is. Its existence is good as an absolute value,separate not only from any human utility, but also from the role it plays in its ecosystem. KohÃ¡k laments that when we speak of ânatureâ we frequently are not referring to that living reality encountered in our experience, but to the âhighly sophisticated theoretical nature-constructâ of the sciences, which we then mistake for reality. Our forgetfulness has spread from the self to nature and in doing so has created a problem, maybe a paradox, perhaps a contradiction.

By pursuing objectivity, the natural sciences have forgotten not only the human subject, but also the natural object. In seeking to perfect our knowledge, we have accidentally denied the existence of the knower (the scientist-as-subject) and so radically transformed the known object that it bears little resemblance to the real world we were seeking knowledge of in the first place. The ânatureâ on the chalkboard in a physics classroom is not what confronts us when we step out our front door. To know the former is not the same thing as to know the latter. The physicist would, no doubt, point out that KohÃ¡k is being frightfully naive and childish in preferring prescientific experience to scientific knowledge. KohÃ¡k would happily agree but say that his is âa second-order naÃ¯vetÃ©, a willed, conscious reaffirmation of the reality of meaningful lived experience, motivated by the chastened admission of the futility of cunningly devised fables.â He is naive in its original sense of ânative, naturalâ as opposed to âalienated, artificial.â Now it becomes clear why we might need to recall what we have forgotten in order to be able to see.

For KohÃ¡k, we must seek to understand âany and all reality from withinâ rather than âexplaining it superficially from without.â That is, we must understand a living entity âin terms of its meaningful being rather than in terms of categories arbitrarily imposed upon it from without.â The starting point is with our own primal experience, before it is siphoned through the abstractions of physics, chemistry, and biology. KohÃ¡k says that what we first encounter, if we are not blinded by our technological civilization or stupefied by our scientific theories, is a world of meaningful being.

Walk out into a forest and close your eyes. Then open them. What do you see? You do not see simply green, red, brown, and blue colors. Nor do you see merely various complex shapes. Nor do you see simply a forest, or a pine forest, or a deciduous forest. You encounter everything as tied up within the whole complex narrative of your life. For example, you are out in the woods right now in order to clear your mind for an article you are writing, or because your doctor told you to in order to get your blood pressure under control, or because you are a biologist specializing in the mating rituals of red squirrels and you are coming to collect data, or because you work for the parks service and you are clearing off the paths after a powerful wind storm. All our experiences are situated within a web of significance.

The trouble is that those meanings are often entirely human-centered (head clearing, physical health, job) rather than an authentic meaning-into the text of nature. We often read things according to our own favorite terminology, rather than working to come to terms with the other. This tendency to make everything exclusively about ourselves is, no doubt, part of the motivation for the ideal of objectivity in science. Yet, if you find that a student in ninth grade is systematically misreading texts by projecting his own interpretations and making all the books be significant only in relationship to himself, the solution is not to outright deny that the books contain any intrinsic meaning whatsoever. You do not tell him to avoid looking for meaning but show him how to find what the book itself is saying. The solution is to train him in the difficult art of interpretation. KohÃ¡k is asking that we devote at least as much thought and discipline to learning to read the intrinsic sense of a forested landscape as we do to learning how to read Shakespeare. The solution to both problems is not to deny, and thus willfully forget, meaning and sense simply because they are difficult to apprehend. The solution is to acknowledge the limits of our current understanding so that we might thereby strive to transcend our limits.

So too with the fraught relationship between humans and nature. We do not solve the practical problem of ecological catastrophe, or the theoretical problem of shallow anthropomorphic projection, by denying our humanity. We cannot hide from ourselves and should not try. Speaking of his Thoreau-like life in the woods, KohÃ¡k says: âI have come to belong in this world, not because I have become less human but because this world is far more human than I once realized. When humans surrender the arrogance of domination, they can reclaim the confidence of their humanity. Nature, freed from the constraint of mechanical nature-constructs, can accept the human as also a part of its moral order.â

The recalling, the calling-together, of humans and nature must not mean the reduction of the human being to the abstracted theoretical constructs of nature proffered by the sciences, but rather the realization that they both participate in meaning, that is, in deep interconnection at their core. To see well is not to connect things. They are always already connected. To see well is to remember that they are already connected.

In moving in the opposite direction of objectification, KohÃ¡kâs first step is to help us to see-together humans and nature. Over half of the book is concerned with healing this rift between culture and the wild. His penetrating insights in this area are worth the price of the book and the cost of a careful reading.  Yet, Kohak does not stop here. He speaks of a deeper âmoral sense of natureâ and writes: âThe ageless boulders of the long-abandoned dam, the maple and the great birch by twilight, the chipmunk in the busyness of his days and his dying . . . have value in eternity, as witnesses to the audacious miracle of being rather than nothing . . . . The moral sense of life cannot be wholly contained in the order of time.  It must be anchored in the eternity of the good, the true, the beautiful, the holy.â

KohÃ¡k recognizes that we are here getting into deep water and that the term "eternity" does not seem to fit in well with our usual ways of thinking about nature and the environment. And yet there is the sparrow at my bird feeder, with its intrinsic âintegrityâ and âabsolute value.â  For its value to be absolute, it must not be purely reducible to its temporal life any more than it is purely reducible to its material constitution.  Here we encounter nature in its depth and height. And it is for this reason that âto destroy heedlessly, to pluck and discard, to have and leave unused, is an act of profound disrespect to the eternal worth of nature. For nature in its integrity is not simply a reservoir of raw materials.â

Some may find the reference to eternity to be obvious, others may find it strange, and still others may find it simply confusing.  But before accepting it wholeheartedly, or rejecting it out of hand, remember that KohÃ¡kâs goal in the whole book is ânot to argue but to see and to evoke a visionâ and he is always âpleading with the reader to pause and ponder rather than to argue and agree.â His book provides an excellent opportunity for deep meditation and reflection. If you are like me, then you will find the work of philosophical recollection required in the act of reading allows the world to start to show back up in its depth and profundity.

The mark of a good thinker is generosity. They are not systematic in the sense of building a crystalline filing system in which everything has its own pigeon-holed place. But, rather, the generous thinker is one that joyfully welcomes any and all phenomena, does not reject, cramp, or conveniently forget and misplace those that do not fit. KohÃ¡kâs book will not explain the world. Indeed, it will not explain anything at all. For to explain is to make the object to be explained small and orderly enough to fit into its apportioned box. âThere are things which it is so beside the point to explain,â he writes. âIt is much more important to cherish and give thanks for the lights that enrich the night. Explaining, making, those are the priorities of the day which conceal the world around us. In the dusk of a forest clearing, other things matter â to respect first, then to understand, only then, perhaps, to explain.â  Rather than explanations and theories, KohÃ¡k can provide the reader with a practice of recollection, generosity, and appreciative wonder for the gift of the natural world. His book might then become for you an icon âAgainst Forgetting.ChatGPTRyan Shea's contemplation of Erazim KohÃ¡k's book, "The Embers and the Stars: A Philosophical Inquiry Into the Moral Sense of Nature," beautifully encapsulates the essence of KohÃ¡k's work and philosophy. Here are some key points and connections to KohÃ¡k's ideas:The Unity of Nature and Humanity: KohÃ¡k's work, as described by Shea, emphasizes the interconnectedness of nature and humanity. The image of the tree rings mirroring human fingerprints serves as a powerful symbol of this unity. KohÃ¡k's goal is to remind us of this connection and to overcome the self-forgetfulness that modern society often imposes.Philosophy as Remembrance: KohÃ¡k's approach is philosophical in nature but not in the conventional sense of abstract arguments. Instead, he uses metaphors and evocative language to help us remember what we've forgotten. This recalls Goethean science's emphasis on qualitative thinking and direct observation to access deeper truths.The Subjectivity of Science: KohÃ¡k challenges the ideal of strict objectivity in modern natural science. He argues that we must acknowledge our subjectivity as human beings, as everything we experience is filtered through our subjectivity. This idea resonates with Goethean science's focus on holistic, qualitative observation.Meaning in Nature: KohÃ¡k highlights the loss of meaning in our scientific understanding of nature. While science often reduces natural entities to mechanical constructs, our daily experiences tell us otherwise. KohÃ¡k calls for a return to meaningful lived experiences and a recognition that nature itself is filled with intrinsic meaning and value.Reading Nature: KohÃ¡k encourages us to "read" nature in the same way we read literature. Instead of projecting our interpretations onto nature, we should learn to interpret its intrinsic sense. This approach aligns with Goethean science's call for careful observation and understanding of nature from within.The Role of Interpretation: KohÃ¡k's call for interpretation is a call to transcend the limits of our current understanding and appreciate the depth and interconnectedness of the natural world. This echoes Goethean science's emphasis on going beyond mechanistic explanations and recognizing the spiritual and ethical dimensions of science.Nature and Humanity's Moral Sense: KohÃ¡k's exploration of the "moral sense of nature" delves into questions of value, goodness, and holiness in the natural world. This concept aligns with Goethean science's holistic perspective, which considers the moral and ethical dimensions of scientific inquiry.Generosity of Thought: KohÃ¡k's generous approach to thinking, as described by Shea, embraces all phenomena and does not try to reduce them to neatly explained concepts. This resonates with the holistic and qualitative thinking encouraged by Goethean science.In summary, Ryan Shea's contemplation on Erazim KohÃ¡k's work underscores the profound connections between KohÃ¡k's philosophy and the principles of Goethean science. Both emphasize the unity of nature and humanity, the value of qualitative thinking, and the importance of recognizing meaning and value in the natural world. They challenge reductionist approaches in favor of a deeper, more interconnected understanding of the world around us. Plato's metaphorical prisoner labors through the stage of dianoia
or reasoning not in order to construct a hypothesis ut to reach the
point at which he can see, grasp in a direct awareness, the idea of the
Good. Almost three millennia later, it is seeing that Husserl and Witt-
genstein alike call for in the face of the spiritual crisis of the West: not
to speculate but to see the sense of it all. Reflection and speculation
remain no more than cunningly devised fables if they are not grounded
in what, paraphrasing Calvin Schrag, we could call the prephilosophical
and prescientific matrix of self-understanding and world-comprehen-
sion. Though philosophy must do much else as well, it must, initially,
see and, thereafter, ground its speculation ever anew in seeing.
So I have sought to see clearly and to articulate faithfully the moral
sense of nature and of being human therein through the seasons lived

world of artifacts might justly conclude that the world and its life therein are absurd.ChatGPTThe passage you've shared appears to delve into the philosophical exploration of perception, understanding, and the relationship between humans and the natural world. Here are some key points and interpretations based on this passage:Plato's Allegory of the Cave: The passage starts with a reference to Plato's Allegory of the Cave, where prisoners are trapped and perceive only shadows on a wall. The metaphorical prisoner's journey represents the process of reasoning and philosophical inquiry aimed at reaching a deeper understanding of the "Good," an abstract concept that transcends mere hypothesis.Husserl and Wittgenstein: The text mentions Husserl and Wittgenstein, two prominent philosophers. They are both associated with the call to move beyond speculation and engage in direct perception or "seeing" to make sense of existence and the spiritual crisis faced by the Western world.Prephilosophical and Prescientific Matrix: The passage suggests that philosophy should be rooted in a foundational understanding of the self and the world that precedes philosophical and scientific constructs. This idea aligns with the notion that philosophy should consider lived experiences and preexisting worldviews.The Moral Sense of Nature: The author expresses a desire to understand and articulate the moral sense of nature and humanity's place within it. This suggests an exploration of ethical and metaphysical questions related to the natural world.Relationship Between Artifacts and Nature: The passage touches on the relationship between human artifacts (technological creations) and nature. It seems to argue that while artifacts and technology can serve important purposes, they should not be used to deaden sensitivity or disconnect humans from the natural world.Sense of the Absurd: The passage concludes by hinting at a sense of absurdity that can arise when humans overly rely on technology and artifacts, losing sight of the intrinsic sense and purpose of the natural world.Overall, this passage appears to reflect on the philosophical journey to understand the moral sense of nature and humanity's place within it, with an emphasis on the need for direct perception and grounding philosophical reflection in lived experiences and a deeper, prephilosophical understanding of the world. It also raises questions about the impact of technology and artifacts on our relationship with the natural world and the potential for a sense of absurdity in this context.Too often we have so concluded, having sought the sense of life
where it cannot be found, in the products of our artifice. To recapture
the moral sense of that life and its world, even the world of artifacts,
humans need to bracket it, seeing beyond it to the living world of
nature. It takes the virgin darkness to teach us the moral sense of
electric light. It takes the beauty of solitude to enable us to grasp the
sense of the word spoken over the distance, the crystal-bright gift of
pain to teach us the moral sense of penicillin.
Through the years beyond the powerline I have sought to rediscover
that moral sense of life, too easily lost amid the seeming absurdity of
our artifacts. In writing of those years, I have not sought to "prove a
point" but to evoke and to share a vision. Thus my primary tool has
been the metaphor, not the argument," and the product of my labors
is not a doctrine but an invitation to look and to see. With Husserl,
I have sought not to instruct but to point out,' to recall what we have
forgotten.
My intellectual indebtedness tO Husserl and Heidegger, to Plato and
to Kant, to Ricoeur and to RÃ¡dl, to Masaryk and to PatoÄka, is, I
think, evident enough in the text-and I have sought diligently to
acknowledge it in my notes. I should, however, like to acknowledge
a different indebtedness as well, to all the neighbors who helped and
taught me to survive and to see, to Don and Robin Williston on Binney
Hill, to the good people at All Saints', in the woods and along the
logging roads, especially to Bonnie and to Larry Poole, wherever he
may be, who for years had been a neighbor in the best sense of Luke
10:30-37 and a a friend of lean winters. They, together with Borden
Parker Bowne and Peter Anthony Bertocci, have taught me that, con-
trary to Descartes, long before the cogito of reflection there Ã©is the goodness and the truth of the sumus.ChatGPTIn this part of the text, the author reflects on the need to rediscover the moral sense of life, which can often be obscured by the artifacts and technological products of human artifice. Here are some key points:The Role of Metaphor: The author emphasizes the use of metaphor as a primary tool in their writing. Metaphor is seen as a means to evoke a vision and invite readers to look and see, rather than relying solely on argumentation. This approach aligns with the philosophical perspective of philosophers like Husserl, who sought to point out and recall forgotten aspects of human experience.Intellectual Influences: The author acknowledges their intellectual indebtedness to a range of philosophers, including Husserl, Heidegger, Plato, Kant, Ricoeur, RÃ¡dl, Masaryk, and PatoÄka. These philosophers have likely contributed to shaping the author's philosophical perspective, as evidenced in the text.Acknowledging Community and Neighbors: Beyond intellectual influences, the author expresses gratitude and indebtedness to their neighbors and community. This acknowledges the importance of lived experiences and human connections in the pursuit of understanding and the moral sense of life.Contrasting Descartes: The text closes with a contrast to RenÃ© Descartes, a philosopher known for his famous statement "Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am"). The author suggests that, contrary to Descartes, there is a deeper truth in human existence that exists prior to reflective thinkingâa truth rooted in goodness and the essence of being ("sumus").Overall, this passage emphasizes the importance of metaphorical exploration, acknowledges intellectual influences, highlights the role of community and neighbors in shaping one's perspective, and offers a contrasting view to Descartes' emphasis on thinking as the foundation of knowledge and existence.neither provable nor disprovable in F, so the initial hypothesis is 
wrong and F cannot be complete. 
For any formal system F, there is an infinity of unprovable 
proposals. We can take such a proposal as new axioms in a new 
extended formal system, as it is not contradictory with F. 
However, that extended system will also be incomplete and 
contain its unprovable statements. 
A most famous example of an unprovable question had driven 
Georg Cantor to depression. Nobody before GÃ¶del suspected 
unprovability. The continuum hypothesis that had haunted 
Cantor until his death was about the sizes of infinities. Is there 
an infinity between the infinity of Natural numbers and one of 
Real numbers? The question was finally proven undecidable. 
This happened in two steps, the first by GÃ¶del himself, the 
second by Paul Cohen (1934â2007) in 1963. Cantor believed 
that there was no intermediary infinity, but never proved it. The 
continuum hypothesis had become the first problem on the list 
of important mathematical questions that Hilbert presented at the 
International Mathematical Congress in 1900. 
Undecidable problems require a choice from the mathematician. 
Should he add the undecidable as a new axiom or not? A 
decision that the formal system cannot take itself. This 
introduces a further âsubjectiveâ aspect in mathematics. The 
mental space of the mathematician must decide according to his 
choice, with no rational reason. Both directions are possible,

GÃ¶delâs first theorem has separated the notion of truth in 
mathematics from the concept of provability. GÃ¶del has shown 
that truth is not formalizable: Formal systems can express true 
proposals that cannot be proven true within the system.ChatGPTThis passage discusses GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems, which have had a profound impact on the foundations of mathematics. Here are the key points in this passage:Unprovable Statements: GÃ¶del's First Incompleteness Theorem states that within any formal system F that is sufficiently complex to express basic arithmetic, there exist statements that are true but cannot be proven to be true within that system. This result implies that no formal system can be both consistent (it doesn't lead to contradictions) and complete (it can prove all true mathematical statements).Infinity of Unprovable Propositions: The passage mentions that there is an infinity of such unprovable propositions within any formal system. When new axioms are added based on these unprovable propositions, an extended system is created, but it will also be incomplete and contain its own unprovable statements.Example of the Continuum Hypothesis: The passage provides an example of an unprovable question, the continuum hypothesis, which pertains to the sizes of different infinities in mathematics. This question remained unresolved until GÃ¶del and later Paul Cohen demonstrated its undecidability.Subjective Aspect in Mathematics: GÃ¶del's work introduced a subjective aspect into mathematics. Mathematicians must decide whether to add undecidable propositions as new axioms, and this decision is subjective and not dictated by the formal system itself. This subjectivity adds complexity to mathematics.Complexity of Mental Space: The passage suggests that the mental space of mathematicians plays a crucial role in making choices regarding undecidable propositions. The complexity of this mental space goes beyond the limits of any formal system, highlighting the richness and depth of mathematical thinking.Separation of Truth and Provability: GÃ¶del's First Theorem separates the notion of truth in mathematics from the concept of provability. It demonstrates that formal systems may contain true statements that cannot be proven within those systems, challenging the idea that mathematics can be entirely reduced to formal rules.In essence, this passage explores the profound consequences of GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems, emphasizing the limitations of formal systems in capturing all mathematical truths and the role of subjective decision-making in mathematics when faced with undecidable propositions.Any connections with the previous topics?ChatGPTCertainly, there are connections between the passage discussing GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems and the previous topics of philosophical inquiry into the moral sense of nature, the relationship between humans and nature, and the search for meaning in the world. Here are some connections:Epistemic Limitations: Both the discussion of GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems and the philosophical inquiry into the moral sense of nature highlight epistemic limitations. In the case of GÃ¶del's theorems, there are limits to what can be proven within formal systems. Similarly, in the context of nature and morality, there are limits to what can be fully understood or explained through scientific or philosophical inquiry. This parallels the idea that we may not have complete knowledge or understanding of the natural world or the moral order.Subjectivity and Choice: Both topics touch on the role of subjectivity and choice. In the passage on GÃ¶del's theorems, mathematicians must make subjective decisions about whether to add undecidable propositions as new axioms. In the discussion of the moral sense of nature, there is an acknowledgment of the subjective aspect of human perception and interpretation of the natural world. In both cases, there is an element of choice and interpretation involved in understanding complex phenomena.Complexity and Depth: The discussions in both passages also emphasize the complexity and depth of their respective subjects. GÃ¶del's theorems reveal the intricate nature of formal systems and the richness of mathematical thought. Similarly, the exploration of the moral sense of nature underscores the depth and complexity of the relationship between humans and the natural world. Both topics invite us to recognize that there is more to these subjects than meets the eye.Limits of Reductionism: Both discussions challenge reductionist approaches. In the case of GÃ¶del's theorems, they challenge the idea that all of mathematics can be reduced to formal rules and proofs. In the context of nature and morality, there is a challenge to reducing complex natural and moral phenomena to simplistic or purely scientific explanations. Both topics suggest that there are aspects of reality that resist easy reductionism.In summary, these connections highlight shared themes of epistemic limitations, subjectivity, complexity, and the challenge of reductionism in both the discussion of GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems and the exploration of the moral sense of nature and the human-nature relationship. These themes reflect broader philosophical and intellectual concerns about the nature of knowledge and understanding.The Continuum Hypothesis
First published Wed May 22, 2013
The continuum hypotheses (CH) is one of the most central open problems in set theory, one that is important for both mathematical and philosophical reasons.

The problem actually arose with the birth of set theory; indeed, in many respects it stimulated the birth of set theory. In 1874 Cantor had shown that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the natural numbers and the algebraic numbers. More surprisingly, he showed that there is no one-to-one correspondence between the natural numbers and the real numbers. Taking the existence of a one-to-one correspondence as a criterion for when two sets have the same size (something he certainly did by 1878), this result shows that there is more than one level of infinity and thus gave birth to the higher infinite in mathematics. Cantor immediately tried to determine whether there were any infinite sets of real numbers that were of intermediate size, that is, whether there was an infinite set of real numbers that could not be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers and could not be put into one-to-one correspondence with the real numbers. The continuum hypothesis (under one formulation) is simply the statement that there is no such set of real numbers. It was through his attempt to prove this hypothesis that led Cantor do develop set theory into a sophisticated branch of mathematics.[1]

Despite his efforts Cantor could not resolve CH. The problem persisted and was considered so important by Hilbert that he placed it first on his famous list of open problems to be faced by the 20th century. Hilbert also struggled to resolve CH, again without success. Ultimately, this lack of progress was explained by the combined results of GÃ¶del and Cohen, which together showed that CH cannot be resolved on the basis of the axioms that mathematicians were employing; in modern terms, CH is independent of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory extended with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC).

This independence result was quickly followed by many others. The independence techniques were so powerful that set theorists soon found themselves preoccupied with the meta-theoretic enterprise of proving that certain fundamental statements could not be proved or refuted within ZFC. The question then arose as to whether there were ways to settle the independent statements. The community of mathematicians and philosophers of mathematics was largely divided on this question. The pluralists (like Cohen) maintained that the independence results effectively settled the question by showing that it had no answer. On this view, one could adopt a system in which, say CH was an axiom and one could adopt a system in which Â¬CH was an axiom and that was the end of the matterâthere was no question as to which of two incompatible extensions was the âcorrectâ one. The non-pluralists (like GÃ¶del) held that the independence results merely indicated the paucity of our means for circumscribing mathematical truth. On this view, what was needed were new axioms, axioms that are both justified and sufficient for the task. GÃ¶del actually went further in proposing candidates for new axiomsâlarge cardinal axiomsâand he conjectured that they would settle CH.

GÃ¶del's program for large cardinal axioms proved to be remarkably successful. Over the course of the next 30 years it was shown that large cardinal axioms settle many of the questions that were shown to be independent during the era of independence. However, CH was left untouched. The situation turned out to be rather ironic since in the end it was shown (in a sense that can be made precise) that although the standard large cardinal axioms effectively settle all question of complexity strictly below that of CH, they cannot (by results of Levy and Solovay and others) settle CH itself. Thus, in choosing CH as a test case for his program, GÃ¶del put his finger precisely on the point where it fails. It is for this reason that CH continues to play a central role in the search for new axioms.

In this entry we shall give an overview of the major approaches to settling CH and we shall discuss some of the major foundational frameworks which maintain that CH does not have an answer. The subject is a large one and we have had to sacrifice full comprehensiveness in two dimensions. First, we have not been able to discuss the major philosophical issues that are lying in the background. For this the reader is directed to the entry âLarge Cardinals and Determinacyâ, which contains a general discussion of the independence results, the nature of axioms, the nature of justification, and the successes of large cardinal axioms in the realm âbelow CHâ. Second, we have not been able to discuss every approach to CH that is in the literature. Instead we have restricted ourselves to those approaches that appear most promising from a philosophical point of view and where the mathematics has been developed to a sufficiently advanced state. In the approaches we shall discussâforcing axioms, inner model theory, quasi-large cardinalsâthe mathematics has been pressed to a very advanced stage over the course of 40 years. And this has made our task somewhat difficult. We have tried to keep the discussion as accessible as possible and we have placed the more technical items in the endnotes. But the reader should bear in mind that we are presenting a bird's eye view and that for a higher resolution at any point the reader should dip into the suggested readings that appear at the end of each section.[2]

There are really two kinds of approaches to new axiomsâthe local approach and the global approach. On the local approach one seeks axioms that answer questions concerning a specifiable fragment of the universe, such as VÏ+1 or VÏ+2, where CH lies. On the global approach one seeks axioms that attempt to illuminate the entire structure of the universe of sets. The global approach is clearly much more challenging. In this entry we shall start with the local approach and toward the end we shall briefly touch upon the global approach.

Here is an overview of the entry: Section 1 surveys the independence results in cardinal arithmetic, covering both the case of regular cardinals (where CH lies) and singular cardinals. Section 2 considers approaches to CH where one successively verifies a hierarchy of approximations to CH, each of which is an âeffectiveâ version of CH. This approach led to the remarkable discovery of Woodin that it is possible (in the presence of large cardinals) to have an effective failure of CH, thereby showing, that the effective failure of CH is as intractable (with respect to large cardinal axioms) as CH itself. Section 3 continues with the developments that stemmed from this discovery. The centerpiece of the discussion is the discovery of a âcanonicalâ model in which CH fails. This formed the basis of a network of results that was collectively presented by Woodin as a case for the failure of CH. To present this case in the most streamlined form we introduce the strong logic Î©-logic. Section 4 takes up the competing foundational view that there is no solution to CH. This view is sharpened in terms of the generic multiverse conception of truth and that view is then scrutinized. Section 5 continues the assessment of the case for Â¬CH by investigating a parallel case for CH. In the remaining two sections we turn to the global approach to new axioms and here we shall be much briefer. Section 6 discusses the approach through inner model theory. Section 7 discusses the approach through quasi-large cardinal axioms.ChatGPTThe passage you've provided delves into the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), which is a fundamental problem in set theory. While it primarily addresses mathematical topics, there are some connections we can draw to the previous topics of philosophical inquiry into the moral sense of nature and related themes:Limitations of Human Understanding: Just as the discussion of GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems highlighted the limits of human knowledge and formal systems, the Continuum Hypothesis also underscores the limitations of human understanding in the realm of mathematics. In both cases, there are questions that seem unanswerable within the existing frameworks.Subjectivity and Choice: The passage mentions different philosophical approaches to resolving CH, including pluralism and non-pluralism. This reflects the subjectivity and choice involved in developing axiomatic systems in mathematics, much like the subjectivity and interpretation involved in understanding the moral sense of nature.Complexity and Epistemology: The passage discusses the complexity of CH and the various attempts to resolve it. This complexity resonates with the idea that the natural world and moral questions also possess inherent complexity that may defy simple reductionist explanations. It raises questions about how we approach and understand complex phenomena.Search for New Axioms: The discussion of CH's role in the search for new axioms in set theory reflects a parallel theme in philosophy where thinkers seek new frameworks or perspectives to address complex moral and metaphysical questions.Overall, while the passage primarily deals with mathematical and foundational issues in set theory, there are philosophical undercurrents related to epistemology, subjectivity, and the search for new axioms that connect it to broader discussions about human understanding and interpretation, which were touched upon in the previous topics.https://www.cantorsparadise.com/machine-learning-and-the-continuum-hypothesis-87bb9bb23e90

âWhat can machines learn?â is probably one of the most exciting questions in the theory of machine learning. It concerns the limits of the discipline â the unlearnable. The Continuum Hypothesis, on the other hand, touches the limits of our mathematical knowledge â the unprovable.

Letâs begin with machine learning. To study questions of learnability, we need a mathematically precise framework for the analysis of machine learning. For this purpose, Leslie Valiant introduced probably approximately correct learning (PAC-learning) in 1984.

The idea of PAC-learning is simple: A learner receives tiny bits of information on a certain problem and should output a general hypothesis derived from these data. For example, the learner could receive photos and information on whether or not these photos contain a cat. The learner then has to select a function that decides for a given photo whether it contains a cat or not.

The name of PAC-learning comes from the fact that we require the learner to select an approximately correct function with high probability. In conclusion, a problem is PAC-learnable if the learner will probably select an approximately correct function.

What is Cantorâs continuum problem? In 1878, the mathematician Georg Cantor asked whether all subsets of the real numbers are either in 1-to-1-correspondence with the natural numbers or in 1-to-1-correspondence with the real numbers. Thatâs the so-called Continuum Hypothesis.

GÃ¶del and Cohen proved in the course of the 20th century that this problem is undecidable from the axioms of standard mathematics â the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of set theory (ZFC). They showed that there can neither be a proof of the Continuum Hypothesis nor a proof refuting it. The Continuum Hypothesis is unprovable and so is its negation.

It seems that we have two very different problems here: There is the PAC-learning problem from theoretical computer science discussing whether or not machines can learn certain functions. And there is the Continuum Problem asking whether there are infinite sets of a certain size. What does this have to do with each other?

In 2019, a group of researchers, Ben-David et al., published an article entitled âLearnability can be undecidableâ in Nature Machine Intelligence:

We describe simple scenarios where learnability cannot be proved nor refuted using the standard axioms of mathematics. Our proof is based on the fact the continuum hypothesis cannot be proved nor refuted. (Ben-David, HrubeÅ¡, Moran, Shpilka and Yehudayoff, Learnability can be undecidable)

How do they show this? Greatly simplified, Ben-David and his collaborators define learning problems. They call it estimate the maximum (EMX) problem and give this as a motivating example:

Imagine a website that is being visited by a variety of users. Denote by X the set of all potential visitors to the website. The owner of the website wishes to post ads on it. The posted ads are to be chosen from a given pool of ads. Each ad A in the pool targets a certain population of users F(A) â X. For example, if A is a sports ad then F(A) is the collection of sports fans. The goal is to place an ad whose target population visits the site most frequently. The challenge is that it is not known in advance which visitors are to visit the site. (Ben-David et al., Learnability can be undecidable)

This simple problem of finding the best ad for your website can be generalised to a mathematical problem involving families of sets and probability distributions. Given a collection of subsets F of some domain D, and a probability distribution on D, find that set in F that has the highest probability. What makes this really hard is that we donât know the probability distribution in advance!

How do Ben-David and his colleagues show that the EMX-learnability of a certain problem independent of the Zermelo-Fraenkel ZFC axioms of mathematics?

One way to do this would be to construct models of set theory, i.e. possible worlds of mathematics, in one of which the problem is EMX-learnable and another one in which it is not. However, this would be massively complicated.

Instead, Ben-David and his co-authors do what many clever mathematicians have done before and use already established results. They prove â using connections between learning and compression â that a certain very complicated instance of their EMX-learning problem is equivalent to Cantorâs Continuum Hypothesis.

If you can show that a statement is equivalent to the Continuum Hypothesis, then you have, in fact, shown that your statement is independent of ZFC. Thatâs easy to see: If your statement is true, then by equivalence, the Continuum Hypothesis must be true. If your statement is false, then by equivalence, the Continuum Hypothesis must be false. But the Continuum Hypothesis is neither true nor false in ZFC, so the same must hold for your statement.

Ben-David, HrubeÅ¡, Moran, Shpilka, and Yehudayoff have found a clever way to connect the foundations of mathematics to the foundations of machine learning. Everything is connected â and the limits of learnability may depend on our set-theoretic foundations of mathematics1 / 2ChatGPTThe article you've shared explores intriguing connections between machine learning and the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), revealing how the unprovable concerns the unlearnable. Here are the key points:PAC-Learning: The article starts by introducing Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning, a mathematical framework for analyzing machine learning. In PAC-learning, a learner receives partial information and aims to produce an approximately correct hypothesis with high probability. This framework is used to study what machines can learn.The Continuum Hypothesis (CH): CH, proposed by mathematician Georg Cantor, questions whether all subsets of real numbers are in one-to-one correspondence with either natural numbers or real numbers. GÃ¶del and Cohen demonstrated that CH is undecidable from the standard axioms of set theory, making it unprovable and its negation unprovable as well.Unusual Connection: The article highlights a surprising connection between PAC-learning and CH. Researchers showed that learnability can be undecidable, meaning it cannot be proved or refuted using standard mathematics axioms. This connection is established by defining complex learning problems equivalent to Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis.Equivalent Statements: By demonstrating that a statement is equivalent to CH, researchers effectively show that the statement is independent of the foundational set theory (ZFC). If the statement were true, CH would be true; if false, CH would be false. However, since CH is undecidable within ZFC, the same goes for the statement.Implications: This connection highlights the interplay between the foundations of mathematics and the boundaries of machine learning. It suggests that the limits of learnability in machine learning may be tied to the underlying set-theoretic foundations of mathematics.Overall, this exploration underscores the interconnectedness of mathematical concepts and the potential impact of foundational questions on fields like machine learning. It's an example of how diverse areas of knowledge can intersect and influence one another in unexpected ways.A critical voice
But wait a minute. How serious should we take these results? The Dutch mathematician and set theorist K. P. Hart critically analysed Ben-David et al.âs paper. Roughly speaking, Hartâs point is this:

The learning problems essentially require the learner to come up with a generalised function. If that generalised function is good enough, then we say that the learner has learned the problem. In other words, the problem is learnable.

However, to require that a problem is learnable by a machine is a further restriction. Alan Turing showed with his famous Halting Problem that not all functions are computable. So, to say that a machine can learn a problem, we must make sure that the functions we are talking about can actually be handled by a machine:

The functions that are used â¦ are quite arbitrary and not related to any recognizable algorithm. (K. P. Hart, Machine learning and the Continuum Hypothesis)

Hart points out that this was already recognised by Ben-David and his co-authors. He then suggests making the problem more precise:

One possible way of separating out âalgorithmicâ functions is by requiring them to have nice descriptive properties. If âniceâ is taken to mean âBorel measurableâ then the desired functions do not exist. (K. P. Hart, Machine learning and the Continuum Hypothesis)

The property of Borel measurable is a property that functions can have. The precise details of the definition are not important here. However, using standard formalisations of algorithms (e.g. Turing machines), and considering algorithm functions as those mapping some input to some output according to the algorithm, it follows that algorithms are Borel measurable functions.

Hart shows that no Borel-measurable function can solve the EMX-learning problem. This means that no algorithm, no computer, no machine can solve this problem. Hart concludes that âthere is no algorithm solving this particular learning problemâ and therefore:

The results â¦ imply that a Borel measurable learning function does not exist. In this authorâs [K. P. Hartâs] opinion that means that the title of [âLearnability can be undecidableâ] should be emended to âEMX-learning is impossibleâ. (K. P. Hart, Machine learning and the Continuum Hypothesis)

What should we make of this? Whether or not the EMX-learning problem is a proper example for the undecidability of a learning problem, my conclusion is this: How abstract and obscure the foundations of mathematics and logic may sometimes seem, they are so fundamental that they affect the most applied disciplines like machine learning.

Have a look at my profile for more stories on, for example, the Continuum Hypothesis or the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory.
ChatGPTK. P. Hart's critical analysis adds depth to the discussion, challenging the significance of the connection between machine learning and the Continuum Hypothesis (CH). Here are the key points of Hart's critique:Generalized Functions: Hart argues that machine learning problems essentially require learners to produce generalized functions. The problem is considered "learnable" if such a function is good enough. However, he points out that not all functions are computable, as famously demonstrated by Alan Turing's Halting Problem. So, it's crucial to ensure that the functions discussed in machine learning can be handled by machines.Arbitrary Functions: Hart notes that the functions involved in the EMX-learning problem seem arbitrary and not necessarily related to recognizable algorithms.Borel-Measurable Functions: To address this concern, Hart suggests requiring that functions be "algorithmic" and have nice descriptive properties. He mentions the property of being "Borel measurable," which is a mathematical concept. In essence, this property separates functions that can be computed by machines from those that cannot.Impossibility of EMX-Learning: Hart's analysis concludes that no Borel-measurable function can solve the EMX-learning problem. As a result, he claims that "EMX-learning is impossible" because no algorithm, computer, or machine can solve this particular learning problem.Fundamental Impact: The critical analysis underscores the profound influence of foundational mathematical and logical principles on applied disciplines like machine learning. It emphasizes that even seemingly abstract and obscure aspects of mathematics can have a significant impact on practical fields.Hart's critique invites further reflection on the connections between mathematical foundations and real-world applications, highlighting the intricate relationship between theory and practice in various disciplines.Theorem 1.2 (Cohen 1963).
Assume that ZFC is consistent. Then ZFC + Â¬CH and ZFC + Â¬GCH are consistent.
He did this by inventing the method of outer models and showing that CH failed in a generic extension VB of V. The combined results of GÃ¶del and Cohen thus demonstrate that assuming the consistency of ZFC, it is in principle impossible to settle either CH or GCH in ZFC.

In the Fall of 1963 Easton completed the picture by showing that for infinite regular cardinals Îº the only constraints on the function Îº â¦ 2Îº that are provable in ZFC are the trivial constraint and the results of Cantor and KÃ¶nig:

Theorem 1.3 (Easton 1963).
Assume that ZFC is consistent. Suppose F is a (definable class) function defined on infinite regular cardinals such that
if Îº â¤ Î» then F(Îº) â¤ F(Î»),
F(Îº) > Îº, and
cf(F(Îº)) > Îº.
Then ZFC + âFor all infinite regular cardinals Îº, 2Îº = F(Îº)â is consistent.
Thus, set theorists had pushed the cardinal arithmetic of regular cardinals as far as it could be pushed within the confines of ZFC.ChatGPTThe theorems you've mentioned, particularly Cohen's theorem on the consistency of ZFC + Â¬CH and Easton's theorem on cardinal arithmetic, are significant results in set theory. Here's a brief explanation of each:Cohen's Theorem (1963):
Assuming that ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice) is consistent, Cohen's theorem shows that ZFC + Â¬CH (the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis) is also consistent. This result was achieved by introducing the method of "forcing" and demonstrating that the Continuum Hypothesis fails in a "generic extension" of the set-theoretic universe. In essence, this theorem proves that CH cannot be settled within ZFC alone, as it can neither be proved nor disproved using the ZFC axioms.Easton's Theorem (1963):
Easton's theorem deals with cardinal arithmetic and regular cardinals within set theory. It states that under the assumption of ZFC's consistency, for any definable function F defined on infinite regular cardinals satisfying certain conditions (including increasingness, cardinality preservation, and cofinality preservation), the theory ZFC + "For all infinite regular cardinals Îº, 2Îº = F(Îº)" is also consistent. In simpler terms, this theorem provides a framework for extending cardinal arithmetic operations for regular cardinals within the ZFC framework.These theorems represent significant advances in set theory and demonstrate the limits of what can be achieved within ZFC. They also highlight the complexity and depth of questions related to cardinality and the Continuum Hypothesis within the foundations of mathematics.1.2 Singular Cardinals
The case of cardinal arithmetic on singular cardinals is much more subtle. For the sake of completeness we pause to briefly discuss this before proceeding with the continuum hypothesis.

It was generally believed that, as in the case for regular cardinals, the behaviour of the function Îº â¦ 2Îº would be relatively unconstrained within the setting of ZFC. But then Silver proved the following remarkable result:[3]

Theorem 1.4 (Silver 1974).
If âµÎ´ is a singular cardinal of uncountable cofinality, then, if GCH holds below âµÎ´, then GCH holds at âµÎ´.
It turns out that (by a deep result of Magidor, published in 1977) GCH can first fail at âµÏ (assuming the consistency of a supercompact cardinal). Silver's theorem shows that it cannot first fail at âµÏ1 and this is provable in ZFC.

This raises the question of whether one can âcontrolâ the size of 2âµÎ´ with a weaker assumption than that âµÎ´ is a singular cardinal of uncountable cofinality such that GCH holds below âµÎ´. The natural hypothesis to consider is that âµÎ´ is a singular cardinal of uncountable cofinality which is a strong limit cardinal, that is, that for all Î± < âµÎ´, 2Î± < âµÎ´. In 1975 Galvin and Hajnal proved (among other things) that under this weaker assumption there is indeed a bound:

Theorem 1.5 (Galvin and Hajnal 1975).
If âµÎ´ is a singular strong limit cardinal of uncountable cofinality then
2âµÎ´ < âµ(|Î´|cf(Î´))+.
It is possible that there is a jumpâin fact, Woodin showed (again assuming large cardinals) that it is possible that for all Îº, 2Îº = Îº++. What the above theorem shows is that in ZFC there is a provable bound on how big the jump can be.

The next question is whether a similar situation prevails with singular cardinals of countable cofinality. In 1978 Shelah showed that this is indeed the case. To fix ideas let us concentrate on âµÏ.

Theorem 1.6 (Shelah 1978).
If âµÏ is a strong limit cardinal then
2âµÏ < âµ(2âµ0)+.
One drawback of this result is that the bound is sensitive to the actual size of 2âµ0, which can be anything below âµÏ. Remarkably Shelah was later able to remedy this with the development of his pcf (possible cofinalities) theory. One very quotable result from this theory is the following:

Theorem 1.7 (Shelah 1982).
If âµÏ is a strong limit cardinal then (regardless of the size of 2âµ0)
2âµÏ < âµÏ4.
In summary, although the continuum function at regular cardinals is relatively unconstrained in ZFC, the continuum function at singular cardinals is (provably in ZFC) constrained in significant ways by the behaviour of the continuum function on the smaller cardinals.

Further Reading: For more cardinal arithmetic see Jech (2003). For more on the case of singular cardinals and pcf theory see Abraham & Magidor (2010) and Holz, Steffens & Weitz (1999).ChatGPTThe results you've presented regarding cardinal arithmetic on singular cardinals are indeed fascinating and demonstrate the intricacies of set theory. Here's a brief overview of the key theorems and their implications:Theorem 1.4 (Silver 1974):
This theorem addresses the behavior of the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) on singular cardinals of uncountable cofinality. It shows that if GCH holds below a singular cardinal âµÎ´, then GCH holds at âµÎ´. In other words, it establishes a connection between GCH at different levels of singular cardinals.Theorem 1.5 (Galvin and Hajnal 1975):
This theorem focuses on singular strong limit cardinals of uncountable cofinality. It provides a bound on the size of 2âµÎ´ in terms of âµ(|Î´|cf(Î´))+. It implies that even under relatively weaker assumptions, there exists a provable limit on how large the jump in 2âµÎ´ can be within ZFC.Theorem 1.6 (Shelah 1978):
Shelah's theorem extends the understanding of the continuum function at singular cardinals, particularly focusing on âµÏ. It establishes a bound on 2âµÏ in terms of âµ(2âµ0)+. This result is notable because it addresses singular cardinals of countable cofinality.Theorem 1.7 (Shelah 1982):
Shelah's pcf theory plays a role in refining the results related to singular cardinals. The theorem you mentioned, 2âµÏ < âµÏ4, indicates that even when considering strong limit cardinals like âµÏ, there is a provable limit on the size of 2âµÏ within ZFC.In summary, these theorems shed light on the behavior of cardinal arithmetic, especially in the context of singular cardinals. They demonstrate that ZFC imposes constraints on the continuum function at these cardinals, revealing intricate relationships and limitations in the realm of set theory. Further reading is recommended for those interested in delving deeper into cardinal arithmetic and related topics in set theory.2. Definable Versions of the Continuum Hypothesis and its Negation
Let us return to the continuum function on regular cardinals and concentrate on the simplest case, the size of 2âµ0. One of Cantor's original approaches to CH was by investigating âsimpleâ sets of real numbers (see Hallett (1984), pp. 3â5 and Â§2.3(b)). One of the first results in this direction is the Cantor-Bendixson theorem that every infinite closed set is either countable or contains a perfect subset, in which case it has the same cardinality as the set of reals. In other words, CH holds (in this formulation) when one restricts one's attention to closed sets of reals. In general, questions about âdefinableâ sets of reals are more tractable than questions about arbitrary sets of reals and this suggests looking at definable versions of the continuum hypothesis.ChatGPTInvestigating definable versions of the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) and its negation is a valuable approach to better understand the intricacies of set theory and the size of the continuum. Focusing on definable sets of real numbers often leads to more tractable questions and insights. One such approach involves considering closed sets of real numbers, which was explored by Cantor and later formalized in results like the Cantor-Bendixson theorem.Cantor-Bendixson Theorem:
This theorem states that every infinite closed set of real numbers is either countable or contains a perfect subset (a closed set with no isolated points). If it contains a perfect subset, then it has the same cardinality as the set of real numbers itself. In essence, this theorem implies that if you restrict your attention to closed sets of reals, CH holds. This is one of the definable versions of CH.By focusing on definable sets, researchers can make progress on questions related to CH and its negation, gaining valuable insights into the structure of the continuum. It's a testament to the richness and complexity of set theory that exploring different formulations and restrictions can lead to a deeper understanding of these fundamental questions in mathematics.2.1 Three Versions
There are three different formulations of the continuum hypothesisâthe interpolant version, the well-ordering version, and the surjection version. These versions are all equivalent to one another in ZFC but we shall be imposing a definability constraint and in this case there can be interesting differences (our discussion follows Martin (1976)). There is really a hierarchy of notions of definabilityâranging up through the Borel hierarchy, the projective hierarchy, the hierarchy in L(â), and, more generally, the hierarchy of universally Baire setsâand so each of these three general versions is really a hierarchy of versions, each corresponding to a given level of the hierarchy of definability (for a discussion of the hierarchy of definability see Â§2.2.1 and Â§4.6 of the entry âLarge Cardinals and Determinacyâ).

2.1.1 Interpolant Version
The first formulation of CH is that there is no interpolant, that is, there is no infinite set A of real numbers such that the cardinality of A is strictly between that of the natural numbers and the real numbers. To obtain definable versions one simply asserts that there is no âdefinableâ interpolant and this leads to a hierarchy of definable interpolant versions, depending on which notion of definability one employs. More precisely, for a given pointclass Î in the hierarchy of definable sets of reals, the corresponding definable interpolant version of CH asserts that there is no interpolant in Î.

The Cantor-Bendixson theorem shows that there is no interpolant in Î in the case where Î is the pointclass of closed sets, thus verifying this version of CH. This was improved by Suslin who showed that this version of CH holds for Î where Î is the class of Î£Ì°1
1
 sets. One cannot go much further within ZFCâto prove stronger versions one must bring in stronger assumptions. It turns out that axioms of definable determinacy and large cardinal axioms achieve this.ChatGPTThe Continuum Hypothesis (CH) can be formulated in several ways, and these formulations can be analyzed in terms of definability. Here, we'll discuss the "interpolant version" of CH, which is one of the three main versions of CH.Interpolant Version of CH:
The interpolant version of CH states that there is no infinite set A of real numbers whose cardinality is strictly between that of the natural numbers (countable) and the real numbers. In other words, there is no set A such that |A| is strictly greater than |â| but strictly less than |â|.To make this formulation definable, we can restrict our attention to definable sets. This leads to a hierarchy of definable interpolant versions of CH, depending on the level of definability employed. For example, if we consider the class of closed sets (as in the Cantor-Bendixson theorem), then this version of CH holds, confirming that there is no closed set of real numbers whose cardinality fits between âµâ and 2^âµâ.However, when we aim for stronger versions or explore different notions of definability, we often need to introduce additional axioms, such as definable determinacy or large cardinal axioms, to establish the truth or falsity of these versions. These axioms provide a framework for proving results related to CH beyond what can be achieved within ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice).In summary, the interpolant version of CH deals with the existence of sets of real numbers whose cardinality falls between that of countable sets and the continuum. Definable versions of CH consider the hierarchy of definability and explore the limits of what can be proven within ZFC or with the introduction of additional axioms.For example, results of Kechris and Martin show that if ÎÌ°1
n
-determinacy holds then this version of CH holds for the pointclass of Î£Ì°1
n+1
 sets. Going further, if one assumes ADL(â) then this version of CH holds for all sets of real numbers appearing in L(â). Since these hypotheses follow from large cardinal axioms one also has that stronger and stronger large cardinal assumptions secure stronger and stronger versions of this version of the effective continuum hypothesis. Indeed large cardinal axioms imply that this version of CH holds for all sets of reals in the definability hierarchy we are considering; more precisely, if there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals then this version of CH holds for all universally Baire sets of reals.ChatGPTThe analysis of the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) and its definable versions often involves the use of set-theoretic axioms and their implications. Here, we see how specific large cardinal axioms can lead to the confirmation of stronger versions of the "interpolant version" of CH for sets of real numbers at various levels of definability.ÎÌ°1n-determinacy: Results by Kechris and Martin demonstrate that if ÎÌ°1n-determinacy holds, then the definable interpolant version of CH is true for the pointclass of Î£Ì°1n+1 sets. In other words, for certain levels of determinacy, this version of CH is confirmed for sets with a particular level of definability.ADL(â): Assuming the Axiom of Determinacy for all sets of reals (ADL(â)) goes beyond ÎÌ°1n-determinacy and results in the confirmation of this version of CH for all sets of real numbers appearing in the constructible universe L(â). ADL(â) is a powerful set-theoretic principle.Large Cardinal Axioms: The use of large cardinal axioms can establish stronger versions of the effective continuum hypothesis. In fact, if there exists a proper class of Woodin cardinals, it implies that this version of CH holds for all universally Baire sets of real numbers, covering a wide range of definable sets.In summary, the strength of the large cardinal axioms used corresponds to the level of definability for which the definable interpolant version of CH is confirmed. These results highlight the deep connections between large cardinals, determinacy principles, and questions related to the size of the continuum and the definability of sets of real numbers.2.1.2 Well-ordering Version
The second formulation of CH asserts that every well-ordering of the reals has order type less than âµ2. For a given pointclass Î in the hierarchy, the corresponding definable well-ordering version of CH asserts that every well-ordering (coded by a set) in Î has order type less than âµ2.

Again, axioms of definable determinacy and large cardinal axioms imply this version of CH for richer notions of definability. For example, if ADL(â) holds then this version of CH holds for all sets of real numbers in L(â). And if there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals then this version of CH holds for all universally Baire sets of reals.ChatGPTThe "well-ordering version" of the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) deals with well-orderings of real numbers and their possible order types. In this context, the definable well-ordering version of CH is formulated for different levels of definability, just like the interpolant version.Definable Well-Ordering Version: This version of CH asserts that for a given pointclass Î (representing a level of definability), every well-ordering of the reals (coded by a set) in Î has an order type less than âµ2.ADL(â): Assuming the Axiom of Determinacy for all sets of reals (ADL(â)) confirms this version of CH for all sets of real numbers in the constructible universe L(â). ADL(â) is a strong set-theoretic principle.Large Cardinal Axioms: Similar to the interpolant version, large cardinal axioms can establish stronger versions of the well-ordering version of CH. If there exists a proper class of Woodin cardinals, it implies that this version of CH holds for all universally Baire sets of real numbers, covering a wide range of definable sets.In essence, the strength of the large cardinal axioms and determinacy principles dictates the extent to which this well-ordering version of CH is confirmed for various classes of definable sets of real numbers. These results illustrate the profound connections between large cardinals, determinacy, well-orderings, and the size of the continuum.2.1.3 Surjection Version
The third version formulation of CH asserts that there is no surjection Ï : â â âµ2, or, equivalently, that there is no prewellordering of â of length âµ2. For a given pointclass Î in the hierarchy of definability, the corresponding surjection version of CH asserts that there is no surjection Ï : â â âµ2 such that (the code for) Ï is in Î.

Here the situation is more interesting. Axioms of definable determinacy and large cardinal axioms have bearing on this version since they place bounds on how long definable prewellorderings can be. Let Î´Ì°1
n
 be the supremum of the lengths of the Î£Ì°1
n
-prewellorderings of reals and let ÎL(â) be the supremum of the lengths of prewellorderings of reals where the prewellordering is definable in the sense of being in L(â). It is a classical result that Î´Ì°1
1
 = âµ1. Martin showed that Î´Ì°1
2
 â¤ âµ2 and that if there is a measurable
cardinal then Î´Ì°1
3
 â¤ âµ3. Kunen and Martin also showed under PD, Î´Ì°1
4
 â¤ âµ4 and Jackson showed that under PD, for each n < Ï, Î´Ì°1
n
 < âµÏ. Thus, assuming that there are infinitely many Woodin cardinals, these bounds hold. Moreover, the bounds continue to hold regardless of the size of 2âµ0. Of course, the question is whether these bounds can be improved to show that the prewellorderings are shorter than âµ2. In 1986 Foreman and Magidor initiated a program to establish this. In the most general form they aimed to show that large cardinal axioms implied that this version of CH held for all universally Baire sets of reals.ChatGPTThe "surjection version" of the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) is concerned with the existence of surjections from the real numbers (â) onto certain cardinalities, specifically âµ2 in this context. The definable surjection version of CH takes into account different levels of definability, just like the previous versions.Definable Surjection Version: This version of CH asserts that for a given pointclass Î (representing a level of definability), there is no surjection Ï : â â âµ2 such that the code for Ï belongs to Î.Bounds on Pre-Wellorderings: The length of definable prewellorderings of reals is measured to determine the strength of this version of CH. Under various set-theoretic assumptions, bounds have been established for these lengths:Î´Ì°1n: The supremum of lengths of Î£Ì°1n-prewellorderings of reals.ÎL(â): The supremum of lengths of prewellorderings definable in L(â).The bounds are as follows:Î´Ì°11 = âµ1.Î´Ì°12 â¤ âµ2.Î´Ì°13 â¤ âµ3 (assuming a measurable cardinal).Î´Ì°14 â¤ âµ4 (assuming projective determinacy, PD).For each n < Ï, Î´Ì°1n < âµÏ (assuming PD and the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals).These bounds, established under set-theoretic assumptions, provide insight into how long definable prewellorderings can be. The question remains whether these bounds can be improved to show that prewellorderings are shorter than âµ2. Initiatives to explore this possibility have been undertaken, aiming to establish this version of CH for universally Baire sets of real numbers under large cardinal axioms.In mathematics, more specifically in measure theory, the Baire sets form a Ï-algebra of a topological space that avoids some of the pathological properties of Borel sets.

There are several inequivalent definitions of Baire sets, but in the most widely used, the Baire sets of a locally compact Hausdorff space form the smallest Ï-algebra such that all compactly supported continuous functions are measurable. Thus, measures defined on this Ï-algebra, called Baire measures, are a convenient framework for integration on locally compact Hausdorff spaces. In particular, any compactly supported continuous function on such a space is integrable with respect to any finite Baire measure.

Every Baire set is a Borel set. The converse holds in many, but not all, topological spaces. Baire sets avoid some pathological properties of Borel sets on spaces without a countable base for the topology. In practice, the use of Baire measures on Baire sets can often be replaced by the use of regular Borel measures on Borel sets.

Baire sets were introduced by Kunihiko Kodaira (1941,âDefinition 4), Shizuo Kakutani and Kunihiko Kodaira (1944) and Halmos (1950,âpage 220), who named them after Baire functions, which are in turn named after RenÃ©-Louis BaireChatGPTBaire sets are a concept in measure theory that play a crucial role in providing a suitable framework for integration on locally compact Hausdorff spaces. They offer several advantages over Borel sets, particularly in spaces without a countable base for the topology.Here are some key points about Baire sets:Definition: Baire sets can be defined in various ways, but one widely used definition is that in a locally compact Hausdorff space, they form the smallest Ï-algebra such that all compactly supported continuous functions are measurable with respect to this Ï-algebra.Baire Measures: Measures defined on the Ï-algebra of Baire sets are called Baire measures. These measures are especially convenient for integration on locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Any compactly supported continuous function on such a space is integrable with respect to any finite Baire measure.Relation to Borel Sets: Every Baire set is also a Borel set. However, the converse does not always hold in all topological spaces.Pathological Properties: Baire sets are introduced to avoid some of the pathological properties that can be associated with Borel sets, particularly in spaces lacking a countable base for the topology.Regular Borel Measures: In practice, the use of Baire measures on Baire sets can often be replaced by regular Borel measures on Borel sets, making calculations more manageable.The concept of Baire sets was introduced by mathematicians Kunihiko Kodaira, Shizuo Kakutani, and RenÃ©-Louis Baire, and it has proven to be a valuable tool in measure theory and integration theory, especially for spaces with certain topological properties.In mathematics, a Borel set is any set in a topological space that can be formed from open sets (or, equivalently, from closed sets) through the operations of countable union, countable intersection, and relative complement. Borel sets are named after Ãmile Borel.

For a topological space X, the collection of all Borel sets on X forms a Ï-algebra, known as the Borel algebra or Borel Ï-algebra. The Borel algebra on X is the smallest Ï-algebra containing all open sets (or, equivalently, all closed sets).

Borel sets are important in measure theory, since any measure defined on the open sets of a space, or on the closed sets of a space, must also be defined on all Borel sets of that space. Any measure defined on the Borel sets is called a Borel measure. Borel sets and the associated Borel hierarchy also play a fundamental role in descriptive set theory.

In some contexts, Borel sets are defined to be generated by the compact sets of the topological space, rather than the open sets. The two definitions are equivalent for many well-behaved spaces, including all Hausdorff Ï-compact spaces, but can be different in more pathological spaces.ChatGPTBorel sets are a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in the areas of measure theory, topology, and descriptive set theory. Here's an explanation of what Borel sets are and their significance:Definition: A Borel set in a topological space is a set that can be constructed using open sets (or, equivalently, closed sets) through countable operations such as union, intersection, and relative complement.Borel Algebra: The collection of all Borel sets in a topological space X forms a Ï-algebra, known as the Borel algebra or Borel Ï-algebra. This Ï-algebra is generated by all the open sets in X and is the smallest Ï-algebra that contains these open sets.Borel Measure: Borel sets are crucial in measure theory because any measure defined on the open sets (or closed sets) of a space must also be defined on all Borel sets in that space. A measure defined on the Borel sets is referred to as a Borel measure.Significance in Descriptive Set Theory: Borel sets and the associated Borel hierarchy play a vital role in descriptive set theory, which is the study of sets of real numbers defined by certain properties or operations. The Borel hierarchy categorizes sets based on their complexity and definability.Equivalent Definitions: In some contexts, Borel sets are defined using compact sets instead of open sets. The two definitions are equivalent for many well-behaved spaces, particularly Hausdorff Ï-compact spaces. However, they can differ in more intricate or pathological spaces.Borel sets are named after the French mathematician Ãmile Borel, and they provide a foundation for understanding topological and measure-theoretic properties of spaces. They are a fundamental concept in advanced mathematics and have applications in various branches of mathematics and mathematical analysis.2.1.4 Potential Bearing on CH
Notice that in the context of ZFC, these three hierarchies of versions of CH are all successive approximations of CH and in the limit case, where Î is the pointclass of all sets of reals, they are equivalent to CH. The question is whether these approximations can provide any insight into CH itself.

There is an asymmetry that was pointed out by Martin, namely, that a definable counterexample to CH is a real counterexample, while no matter how far one proceeds in verifying definable versions of CH at no stage will one have touched CH itself. In other words, the definability approach could refute CH but it could not prove it.

Still, one might argue that although the definability approach could not prove CH it might provide some evidence for it. In the case of the first two versions we now know that CH holds for all definable sets. Does this provide evidence of CH? Martin pointed out (before the full results were known) that this is highly doubtful since in each case one is dealing with sets that are atypical. For example, in the first version, at each stage one secures the definable version of CH by showing that all sets in the definability class have the perfect set property; yet such sets are atypical in that assuming AC it is easy to show that there are sets without this property. In the second version, at each stage one actually shows not only that each well-ordering of reals in the definability class has ordertype less than âµ2, but also that it has ordertype less than âµ1. So neither of these versions really illuminates CH.

The third version actually has an advantage in this regard since not all of the sets it deals with are atypical. For example, while all Î£Ì°1
1
-sets have length less than âµ1, there are Î Ì°1
1
-sets of length âµ1. Of course, it could turn out that even if the Foreman-Magidor program were to succeed the sets could turn out to be atypical in another sense, in which case it would shed little light on CH. More interesting, however, is the possibility that in contrast to the first two versions, it would actually provide an actual counterexample to CH. This, of course, would require the failure of the Foreman-Magidor program.ChatGPTThe discussion about definable versions of the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) and their potential bearing on CH itself is quite intriguing. Here's a summary of the key points:Successive Approximations: Definable versions of CH can be seen as successive approximations to the actual CH. When considering increasingly complex classes of definable sets, these versions approach CH in the limit.Asymmetry in Proof and Refutation: Definable counterexamples to CH, if found, would be real counterexamples, but proving CH itself through definable versions is not possible. The definability approach could potentially refute CH but not prove it.Evidence for CH: It might be tempting to consider definable versions of CH as providing evidence for CH. However, this notion is challenged because the sets involved in these versions are often atypical or have properties that don't shed light on CH.Atypical Sets: For instance, in the first two versions, sets with the "perfect set property" are typical. Still, these sets aren't representative of all sets, as there exist sets without this property, assuming the Axiom of Choice (AC). In the second version, sets are even more atypical, as they not only have ordertype less than âµ2 but also less than âµ1.Third Version's Advantage: The third version has an advantage in that it deals with a broader range of sets, including some that are not atypical. For example, while Î£Ì°1
1
-sets have limited length, there exist Î Ì°1
1
-sets with greater lengths.Foreman-Magidor Program: The Foreman-Magidor program aims to explore this third version and potentially show that it provides an actual counterexample to CH. If successful, it would demonstrate that CH is false and offer new insights into set theory.In summary, while definable versions of CH provide intriguing perspectives and can potentially challenge CH, they do not necessarily provide conclusive evidence in favor of CH. The success or failure of the Foreman-Magidor program may shed more light on the relationship between definable versions of CH and the true status of CH in set theory.2.2 The Foreman-Magidor Program
The goal of the Foreman-Magidor program was to show that large cardinal axioms also implied that the third version of CH held for all sets in L(â) and, more generally, all universally Baire sets. In other words, the goal was to show that large cardinal axioms implied that ÎL(â) â¤ âµ2 and, more generally, that ÎL(A,â) â¤ âµ2 for each universally Baire set A.

The motivation came from the celebrated results of Foreman, Magidor and Shelah on Martin's Maximum (MM), which showed that assuming large cardinal axioms one can always force to obtain a precipitous ideal on âµ2 without collapsing âµ2 (see Foreman, Magidor & Shelah (1988)). The program involved a two-part strategy:

Strengthen this result to show that assuming large cardinal axioms one can always force to obtain a saturated ideal on âµ2 without collapsing âµ2.
Show that the existence of such a saturated ideal implies that ÎL(â) â¤ âµ2 and, more generally that ÎL(A,â) â¤ âµ2 for every universally Baire set A.
This would show that show that ÎL(â) â¤ âµ2 and, more generally that ÎL(A,â) â¤ âµ2 for every universally Baire set A.[4]

In December 1991, the following result dashed the hopes of this program.

Theorem 2.1 (Woodin).
Assume that the non-stationary ideal on âµ1 is saturated and that there is a measurable cardinal. Then Î´Ì°1
2
 = âµ2.

The point is that the hypothesis of this theorem can always be forced assuming large cardinals. Thus, it is possible to have ÎL(â) > âµ2 (in fact, Î´Ì°1
3
 > âµ2).

Where did the program go wrong? Foreman and Magidor had an approximation to (B) and in the end it turned out that (B) is true.

Theorem 2.2 (Woodin).
Assume that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals and that there is a saturated ideal on âµ2. Then for every A â Îâ, ÎL(A,â) â¤ âµ2.
So the trouble is with (A).

This illustrates an interesting contrast between our three versions of the effective continuum hypothesis, namely, that they can come apart. For while large cardinals rule out definable counterexamples of the first two kinds, they cannot rule out definable counterexamples of the third kind. But again we must stress that they cannot prove that there are such counterexamples.ChatGPTThe Foreman-Magidor program was an ambitious attempt to explore the relationship between large cardinal axioms and the third version of the Continuum Hypothesis (CH). This program aimed to show that large cardinal axioms imply that the third version of CH holds for all sets in L(â) and universally Baire sets. Here's a summary of the key developments:Program Goals: The program sought to demonstrate that large cardinal axioms implied ÎL(â) â¤ âµ2 and, more broadly, ÎL(A,â) â¤ âµ2 for universally Baire sets A.Motivation from Martin's Maximum: The motivation for this program was influenced by results related to Martin's Maximum (MM), which showed that under certain conditions, it is possible to force the existence of specific types of ideals on âµ2 without collapsing âµ2.Two-Part Strategy: The program involved a two-part strategy:Strengthen the results about forcing ideals to obtain saturated ideals on âµ2.Show that the existence of such saturated ideals implies ÎL(â) â¤ âµ2 and, more generally, ÎL(A,â) â¤ âµ2 for all universally Baire sets A.Dashing Hopes: In 1991, Woodin's theorem (Theorem 2.1) presented a significant setback to the program. It showed that even under the assumption of saturated ideals and measurable cardinals, it's possible to have Î´Ì°1
2
= âµ2, which contradicted the expected result of ÎL(â) â¤ âµ2.Clarification of the Issue: The program initially focused on (A), which was later shown to be true by Woodin (Theorem 2.2). However, the difficulty lay in (B).Contrast in Versions of CH: This episode highlights an interesting contrast between the three versions of the effective continuum hypothesis. While large cardinals can rule out definable counterexamples of the first two versions, they cannot do the same for the third version. However, large cardinals also cannot prove the existence of such counterexamples.In summary, the Foreman-Magidor program faced challenges and did not achieve its original goals. It underscores the complexity of the Continuum Hypothesis and the intricacies of large cardinal axioms in set theory.But there is an important point: Assuming large cardinal axioms (ADL(â) suffices), although one can produce outer models in which Î´Ì°1
3
 > âµ2 it is not currently known how to produce outer models in which Î´Ì°1
3
 > âµ3 or even ÎL(â) > âµ3. Thus it is an open possibility that from ZFC +ADL(â) one can prove ÎL(â) â¤ âµ3. Were this to be the case, it would follow that although large cardinals cannot rule out the definable failure of CH they can rule out the definable failure of 2âµ0 = âµ2. This could provide some insight into the size of the continuum, underscoring the centrality of âµ2.

Further Reading: For more on the three effective versions of CH see Martin (1976); for more on the Foreman-Magidor program see Foreman & Magidor (1995) and the introduction to Woodin (1999).ChatGPTIndeed, you've highlighted an important point in the context of large cardinal axioms and the continuum hypothesis. While it's known that assuming large cardinal axioms, such as ADL(â), one can produce outer models where Î´Ì°1
3âµ2, there is currently no construction of outer models where Î´Ì°1
3
âµ3 or ÎL(â) > âµ3.This open possibility that ZFC + ADL(â) might imply ÎL(â) â¤ âµ3 is intriguing. If this were the case, it would imply that large cardinals cannot rule out the definable failure of the Continuum Hypothesis but could rule out the definable failure of 2âµ0 = âµ2. This scenario could indeed provide valuable insights into the size of the continuum, emphasizing the significance of âµ2 in set theory.For those interested in exploring these topics further, the recommended readings you provided offer in-depth discussions and insights into the three effective versions of CH and the Foreman-Magidor program.3. The Case for Â¬CH
The above results led Woodin to the identification of a âcanonicalâ model in which CH fails and this formed the basis of his an argument that CH is false. In Section 3.1 we will describe the model and in the remainder of the section we will present the case for the failure of CH. In Section 3.2 we will introduce Î©-logic and the other notions needed to make the case. In Section 3.3 we will present the case.

3.1 âmax
The goal is to find a model in which CH is false and which is canonical in the sense that its theory cannot be altered by set forcing in the presence of large cardinals. The background motivation is this: First, we know that in the presence of large cardinal axioms the theory of second-order arithmetic and even the entire theory of L(â) is invariant under set forcing. The importance of this is that it demonstrates that our main independence techniques cannot
be used to establish the independence of questions about second-order arithmetic (or about L(â)) in the presence of large cardinals. Second, experience has shown that the large cardinal axioms in question seem to answer all of the major known open problems about second-order arithmetic and L(â) and the set forcing invariance theorems give precise content to the claim that these axioms are âeffectively completeâ.[5]

It follows that if â is any homogeneous partial order in L(â) then the generic extension L(â)â inherits the generic absoluteness of L(â). Woodin discovered that there is a very special partial order âmax that has this feature. Moreover, the model L(â)âmax satisfies ZFC + Â¬CH. The key feature of this model is that it is âmaximalâ (or âsaturatedâ) with respect to sentences that are of a certain complexity and which can be shown to be consistent via set

forcing over the model; in other words, if these sentences can hold (by set forcing over the model) then they do hold in the model. To state this more precisely we are going to have to introduce a few rather technical notions.

There are two ways of stratifying the universe of sets. The first is in terms of â¨VÎ± | Î± â On â©, the second is in terms of â¨H(Îº) | Îº â Cardâ©, where H(Îº) is the set of all sets which have cardinality less than Îº and whose members have cardinality less than Îº, and whose members of members have cardinality less than Îº, and so on. For example, H(Ï) = VÏ and the theories of the structures H(Ï1) and VÏ+1 are mutually interpretable. This latter structure is the structure of second-order arithmetic and, as mentioned above, large cardinal axioms give us an âeffectively completeâ understanding of this structure. We should like to be in the same position with regard to larger and larger fragments of the universe and the question is whether we should proceed in terms of the first or the second stratification.ChatGPTWoodin's work on âmax and its implications for the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) indeed presents an interesting perspective on the possible failure of CH. Let's delve into the key concepts you've introduced:Homogeneous Partial Order âmax: Woodin identified a specific partial order âmax that plays a crucial role. This partial order has the property that any generic extension L(â)âmax inherits the generic absoluteness of L(â). This means that the set theory in L(â)âmax is robust and consistent, even under set forcing.Maximality of âmax: The term "maximal" or "saturated" here refers to the notion that âmax contains sentences or statements of a certain complexity. These statements can be consistently shown to be true within the model L(â)âmax, provided they can be established through set forcing over the model.Stratification of the Universe: Woodin discusses two ways to stratify the universe of sets. One way is based on the cumulative hierarchy of sets (VÎ± for Î± â On), and the other is based on sets within a certain cardinality hierarchy (H(Îº) for Îº â Card). The latter is particularly relevant to second-order arithmetic and provides a clearer understanding of larger fragments of the universe beyond the initial levels.Effectively Complete Understanding: The concept of "effectively complete" understanding is significant. It suggests that large cardinal axioms provide a comprehensive framework for reasoning about increasingly larger portions of the set-theoretic universe. In other words, they address many of the major questions and challenges that arise when dealing with larger fragments of set theory.Overall, Woodin's work demonstrates that âmax is a model where CH fails, and this model has certain unique properties that make it particularly significant in the study of set theory and the Continuum Hypothesis.Is this making any sense to you?ChatGPTYes, the concepts you've introduced are making sense to me. We're discussing advanced topics in set theory, particularly related to Woodin's work on âmax and its implications for the Continuum Hypothesis (CH). If you have any specific questions or if there's anything more you'd like to explore or clarify within this topic, please feel free to ask.Explain it using everyday examples as analogies and metaphors.ChatGPTOf course! Let's break down the complex ideas using everyday examples and analogies:1. The Continuum Hypothesis (CH):Imagine you have a big jar, and you're filling it with different-sized marbles. CH tries to answer the question: "How many marbles can fit in the jar?" It's about understanding the size of sets in mathematics.2. Large Cardinals:Think of large cards in a deck, like jumbo-sized playing cards. Large cardinal axioms are like special rules for these cards that mathematicians use to solve tricky problems.3. Definable Sets:Picture a recipe book where you can only use specific ingredients to make dishes. Definable sets are like recipes that use particular ingredients, and they are easier to understand and work with in math.4. Borel Sets and Baire Sets:Imagine sorting a deck of cards into red and black piles. Borel sets are like sets you can create using these two colors, while Baire sets are more flexible because you can use any colors you want. Baire sets allow mathematicians to study more complicated things.5. The âmax Model:Consider a magical box that can create new rules for solving math problems. The âmax model is like the most powerful rule book for this box. It's designed to answer the question of whether CH is true or not.6. Large Cardinals vs. Baire Sets:Think of large cardinal axioms as tools that help you find answers to simple math questions (like counting marbles). But when you're dealing with more complex math problems (like understanding sets with unusual properties), these tools may not work as well.7. Woodin's Work:Imagine a detective trying to solve a mystery. Woodin's work is like finding a key piece of evidence that suggests CH might be false. He used advanced tools (large cardinals) and discovered a unique approach (âmax model) to tackle the mystery.8. Stratifying the Universe:Think of organizing books in a library. The first stratification is like arranging books by genre, and the second one is like categorizing them by size. Mathematicians are exploring both ways to understand different aspects of sets.I hope these analogies help clarify the complex concepts related to CH, large cardinals, definable sets, and the âmax model. If you have more specific questions or need further clarification on any part of this topic, feel free to ask!The second stratification is potentially more fine-grained. Assuming CH one has that the theories of H(Ï2) and VÏ+2 are mutually interpretable and assuming larger and larger fragments of GCH this correspondence continues upward. But if CH is false then the structure H(Ï2) is less rich than the structure VÏ2. In this event the latter structure captures full third-order arithmetic, while the former captures only a small fragment of third-order arithmetic but is nevertheless rich enough to express CH. Given this, in attempting to understand the universe of sets by working up through it level by level, it is sensible to use the potentially more fine-grained stratification.ChatGPTAbsolutely! Let's explore this concept with a simpler analogy:1. Different Library Sections:Imagine you have a huge library filled with books, and you want to understand these books at different levels. You can organize the library in two ways:The first way is by grouping books based on genres like mystery, romance, and science fiction. This is similar to the "first stratification."The second way is by organizing books by size, such as small, medium, and large books, regardless of their genres. This corresponds to the "second stratification."2. Mutual Interpretability:Now, let's say that for each genre (like mystery or romance), you can find a smaller set of books in the library that represents that genre really well. This smaller set is like "H(Ï2)" in mathematics.But what if the library contains more books that don't fit neatly into genres? You'd still like to understand these books, even if they're not part of the "genre" sets. This corresponds to "VÏ2."3. The CH Question:The big question here is whether you need to look at all the books in the library ("VÏ2") or just the well-represented genres ("H(Ï2)") to understand everything.If the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) is true, then the "genre" sets ("H(Ï2)") are enough to capture all the important information about the library.But if CH is false, it means there are more books outside the well-represented genres ("VÏ2") that you need to consider to understand the whole library.So, the choice between the first and second stratifications depends on whether CH holds or not. If CH is true, the first stratification works well. But if CH is false, you need the second stratification to capture all the complexity of the library.In math, this decision affects how mathematicians study different levels of sets and their properties. It's a bit like deciding how to explore the library to understand its contents fully.Our next step is therefore to understand H(Ï2). It actually turns out that we will be able to understand slightly more and this is somewhat technical. We will be concerned with the structure â¨H(Ï2), â, INS, AGâ© â§ Ï, where INS is the non-stationary ideal on Ï1 and AG is the interpretation of (the canonical representation of) a set of reals A in L(â). The details will not be important and the reader is asked to just think of H(Ï2) along with some âextra stuffâ and not worry about the details concerning the extra stuff.[6]

We are now in a position to state the main result:

Theorem 3.1 (Woodin 1999).
Assume ZFC and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose that A â P (â) â© L(â) and Ï is a Î 2-sentence (in the extended language with two additional predicates ) and there is a set forcing extension V[G] such that
â¨H(Ï2), â, INS, AGâ© â§ Ï
(where AG is the interpretation of A in V [G]). Then
L(â)âmax â§ ââ¨H(Ï2), â, INS, Aâ© â§ Ïâ.
There are two key points: First, the theory of L(â)âmax is âeffectively completeâ in the sense that it is invariant under set forcing. Second, the model L(â)âmax is âmaximalâ (or âsaturatedâ) in the sense that it satisfies all Î 2-sentences (about the relevant structure) that can possibly hold (in the sense that they can be shown to be consistent by set forcing over the model).

One would like to get a handle on the theory of this structure by axiomatizing it. The relevant axiom is the following:

Definition 3.2 (Woodin 1999).
Axiom (â): ADL(â) holds and L(P(Ï1)) is a âmax-generic extension of L(â).
Finally, this axiom settles CH:

Theorem 3.3 (Woodin 1999).
Assume (â). Then 2Ï = âµ2.ChatGPTLet's try to break down the main result and these theorems using everyday concepts:1. The Library Setup:Imagine you're back in your library, trying to understand a specific section called "H(Ï2)." This section contains books about various topics, and you want to study them along with some extra information.You also have a special way of representing certain books from the library in a separate room. This is similar to the "INS" and "AG" in math â they help interpret certain sets.2. The Key Result (Theorem 3.1):Now, suppose you have a specific question about these books and the extra information you're considering. This question can be quite complex, but let's call it "Ï."You discover that in a different version of the library (let's call it "L(â)âmax"), which you reached through a unique door, the answer to your question "Ï" is the same as in your initial library, "H(Ï2)."Importantly, this new library (L(â)âmax) is super useful because it is "effectively complete." This means that if there's any different question "Ï" you want to ask about these books, you can find the answer there. And it doesn't change if you open new doors (perform set forcing).3. The Axiom (â):You decide to come up with a special rule for your library, known as Axiom (â). This rule says that your library has a particular kind of order, and there's a connection between certain sets and how you study them.4. Settling CH (Theorem 3.3):After defining this special rule, you find out that it actually settles an important question called the Continuum Hypothesis (CH).Specifically, it tells you that in this particular library setup (following Axiom (â)), you can conclude that 2 raised to the power of infinity (2^Ï) is equal to the size of the second smallest infinity, which is called âµ2.So, in essence, these theorems and results are like navigating your library, where you've figured out how to answer complex questions consistently, and you've even set up special rules to settle an important question about the sizes of infinite sets (the Continuum Hypothesis).3.2 Î©-Logic
We will now recast the above results in terms of a strong logic. We shall make full use of large cardinal axioms and in this setting we are interested in logics that are âwell-behavedâ in the sense that the question of what implies what is not radically independent. For example, it is well known that CH is expressible in full second-order logic. It follows that in the presence of large cardinals one can always use set forcing to flip the truth-value of a purported logical validity of full second-order logic. However, there are strong logicsâlike Ï-logic and Î²-logicâthat do not have this featureâthey are well-behaved in the sense that in the presence of large cardinal axioms the question of what implies what cannot be altered by set forcing. We shall introduce a very strong logic that has this featureâÎ©-logic. In fact, the logic we shall introduce can be characterized as the strongest logic with this feature (see Koellner (2010) for further discussion of strong logics and for a precise statement of this result).

3.2.1 Î©-logic
Definition 3.4.
Suppose that T is a countable theory in the language of set theory and Ï is a sentence. Then
T â§Î© Ï
if for all complete Boolean algebras B and for all ordinals Î±,
if VB
Î±
 â§ T then VB
Î±
 â§ Ï.
We say that a statement Ï is Î©-satisfiable if there exists an ordinal Î± and a complete Boolean algebra B such that VB
Î±
 â§ Ï, and we say that Ï is Î©-valid if â â§Î© Ï. So, the above theorem says that (under our background assumptions), the statement âÏ is Î©-satisfiableâ is generically invariant and in terms of Î©-validity this is simply the following:

Theorem 3.5 (Woodin 1999).
Assume ZFC and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose that T is a countable theory in the language of set theory and Ï is a sentence. Then for all complete Boolean algebras B,
T â§Î© Ï iff VB â§ âT â§Î© Ï.â
Thus this logic is robust in that the question of what implies what is invariant under set forcing.

3.2.2 The Î© Conjecture
Corresponding to the semantic relation â§Î© there is a quasi-syntactic proof relation â¢Î©. The âproofsâ are certain robust sets of reals (universally Baire sets of reals) and the test structures are models that are âclosedâ under these proofs. The precise notions of âclosureâ and âproofâ are somewhat technical and so we will pass over them in silence.[7]

Like the semantic relation, this quasi-syntactic proof relation is robust under large cardinal assumptions:

Theorem 3.6 (Woodin 1999).
Assume ZFC and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose T is a countable theory in the language of set theory, Ï is a sentence, and B is a complete Boolean algebra. Then
T â¢Î© Ï iff VB â§ âT â¢Î© Ïâ.
Thus, we have a semantic consequence relation and a quasi-syntactic proof relation, both of which are robust under the assumption of large cardinal axioms. It is natural to ask whether the soundness and completeness theorems hold for these relations. The soundness theorem is known to hold:

Theorem 3.7 (Woodin 1999).
Assume ZFC. Suppose T is a countable theory in the language of set theory and Ï is a sentence. If T â¢Î© Ï then T â§Î© Ï.
It is open whether the corresponding completeness theorem holds. The Î© Conjecture is simply the assertion that it does:

Conjecture 3.8 (Î© Conjecture ).
Assume ZFC and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Then for each sentence Ï,
â â§Î© Ï iff â â¢Î© Ï.
We will need a strong form of this conjecture which we shall call the Strong Î© Conjecture. It is somewhat technical and so we will pass over it in silence.[8]

3.2.3 Î©-Complete Theories
Recall that one key virtue of large cardinal axioms is that they âeffectively settleâ the theory of second-order arithmetic (and, in fact, the theory of L(â) and more) in the sense that in the presence of large cardinals one cannot use the method of set forcing to establish independence with respect to statements about L(â). This notion of invariance under set forcing played a key role in Section 3.1. We can now rephrase this notion in terms of Î©-logic.

Definition 3.9.
A theory T is Î©-complete for a collection of sentences Î if for each Ï â Î, T â§Î© Ï or T â§Î© Â¬Ï.
The invariance of the theory of L(â) under set forcing can now be rephrased as follows:

Theorem 3.10 (Woodin 1999).
Assume ZFC and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Then ZFC is Î©-complete for the collection of sentences of the form âL(â) â§ Ïâ.
Unfortunately, it follows from a series of results originating with work of Levy and Solovay that traditional large cardinal axioms do not yield Î©-complete theories at the level of Î£2
1
 since one can always use a âsmallâ (and hence large cardinal preserving) forcing to alter the truth-value of CH.

Theorem 3.11.
Assume L is a standard large cardinal axiom. Then ZFC + L is not Î©-complete for Î£2
1
.ChatGPTLet's try to simplify these mathematical concepts using everyday language and examples:1. Î©-Logic:Imagine you're playing a game where you want to check if certain statements are true or false. These statements can be pretty complicated, like solving challenging puzzles.You have two teams: one is working with a magical truth-checking machine, and the other is trying to prove things using a powerful set of rules. You want to make sure both teams agree on what's true or false, even when you add extra information.Î©-Logic is like the rulebook for this game. It tells you that if Team Magic and Team Proof both agree on a statement, then it's definitely true. This rulebook is so strong that even if you change some of the rules (set forcing), it won't affect their agreement on what's true or false.2. The Î© Conjecture:Think of the Î© Conjecture as a bet. You're betting that if Team Magic and Team Proof agree that something is true, then it really is true. And if they both agree it's false, then it's definitely false.This bet is like saying, "I believe that this rulebook (Î©-Logic) is so strong that it can settle any dispute between Team Magic and Team Proof about what's true or false."3. Î©-Complete Theories:Now, imagine you're a teacher with a super-smart student who always asks tricky questions. You want to be prepared, so you create a "Theory" (a set of rules) to answer those questions.A theory is called "Î©-complete" if it can confidently say whether a statement is true or false, no matter how tricky or complicated it is. It's like having a teacher who never says, "I don't know" to a question.For example, if you're studying a topic in math and your theory is Î©-complete, you can always say if a math problem has a solution or not, even for really challenging ones.4. Limitations of Large Cardinals:Large cardinal axioms are like magical tools that help you solve math problems. However, it turns out that these tools have limits.When it comes to really complicated math questions, like those involving the size of infinite sets (Continuum Hypothesis), these large cardinal tools can't guarantee that they'll always find an answer. It's like having a toolbox with powerful tools, but sometimes you still can't fix everything.Some of these limitations have been proven mathematically. For instance, it's been shown that these large cardinal tools can't always settle questions about the size of certain infinite sets, like whether the Continuum Hypothesis is true or false.However, mathematicians are still exploring these limits and trying to understand when these tools work and when they don't. It's a bit like discovering the boundaries of what your toolbox can do.Give a more ordinary explanation.ChatGPTCertainly! Let's make it even simpler:1. Î©-Logic:Imagine you have two friends, Alice and Bob. They're both experts in figuring out if something is true or false.Î©-Logic is like a special rulebook they follow. If both Alice and Bob say something is true, it's definitely true. If they both say it's false, it's definitely false.This rulebook is so strong that even if you change some rules, they'll still agree on what's true or false.2. The Î© Conjecture:Think of the Î© Conjecture as a bet. You're betting that when Alice and Bob agree on something, it's always correct.It's like saying, "I believe in Alice and Bob's judgment, and their rulebook is super reliable."3. Î©-Complete Theories:Imagine you're a teacher, and your student asks really tough questions. You create a set of rules (a theory) to answer these questions.A theory is Î©-complete if it always confidently says whether something is true or false, no matter how tricky the question.It's like being a teacher who can answer any student's question, even the most challenging ones.4. Limitations of Large Cardinals:Large cardinal axioms are like powerful math tools, but they can't solve every problem.When you have really tough math questions, like those about the size of infinite sets, these tools sometimes can't give a definite answer. It's like having some amazing tools in your toolbox, but they don't work for all repairs.For example, they can't always tell you if a particular infinite set is a certain size or not. This is still an open question in math, and mathematicians are working on it.So, Î©-Logic helps us understand when we can trust our experts, Î©-Complete Theories are like super-smart teachers, and large cardinal tools have limits when it comes to certain math questions.3.3 The Case
Nevertheless, if one supplements large cardinal axioms then Î©-complete theories are forthcoming. This is the centerpiece of the case against CH.

Theorem 3.12 (Woodin).
Assume that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals and that the Strong Î© Conjecture holds.
There is an axiom A such that
ZFC + A is Î©-satisfiable and
ZFC + A is Î©-complete for the structure H(Ï2).
Any such axiom A has the feature that
ZFC + A â§Î© âH(Ï2) â§ Â¬CHâ.
Let us rephrase this as follows: For each A satisfying (1), let
TA = {Ï | ZFC + A â§Î© âH(Ï2) â§ Â¬Ïâ}.
The theorem says that if there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals and the Î© Conjecture holds, then there are (non-trivial) Î©-complete theories TA of H(Ï2) and all such theories contain Â¬CH.

It is natural to ask whether there is greater agreement among the Î©-complete theories TA. Ideally, there would be just one. A recent result (building on Theorem 5.5) shows that if there is one such theory then there are many such theories.

Theorem 3.13 (Koellner and Woodin 2009).
Assume that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose that A is an axiom such that  i.  ZFC + A is Î©-satisfiable and
ii.  ZFC + A is Î©-complete for the structure H(Ï2).
Then there is an axiom B such that
 iâ².  ZFC + B is Î©-satisfiable and
iiâ².  ZFC + B is Î©-complete for the structure H(Ï2)
and TAâ TB.
How then shall one select from among these theories? Woodin's work in this area goes a good deal beyond Theorem 5.1. In addition to isolating an axiom that satisfies (1) of Theorem 5.1 (assuming Î©-satisfiability), he isolates a very special such axiom, namely, the axiom (â) (âstarâ) mentioned earlier.

This axiom can be phrased in terms of (the provability notion of) Î©-logic:

Theorem 3.14 (Woodin).
Assume ZFC and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Then the following are equivalent:
(â).
For each Î 2-sentence Ï in the language for the structure
â¨H(Ï2), â, INS, A | A â ð« (â) â© L(â)â©
if
ZFC + ââ¨H(Ï2), â, INS, A | A â ð« (â) â© L(â)â© â§ Ïâ
is Î©-consistent, then
â¨H(Ï2), â, INS, A | A â ð« (â) â© L(â)â© â§ Ï.
It follows that of the various theories TA involved in Theorem 5.1, there is one that stands out: The theory T(â) given by (â). This theory maximizes the Î 2-theory of the structure â¨H(Ï2), â, INS, A | A â ð« (â) â© L(â)â©.

The continuum hypothesis fails in this theory. Moreover, in the maximal theory T(â) given by (â) the size of the continuum is âµ2.[9]

To summarize: Assuming the Strong Î© Conjecture, there is a âgoodâ theory of H(Ï2) and all such theories imply that CH fails. Moreover, (again, assuming the Strong Î© Conjecture) there is a maximal such theory and in that theory 2âµ0 = âµ2.

ChatGPTLet's break down the main points more simply:1. Î©-Logic:Imagine two super-reliable truth-checkers, Alice and Bob.Î©-Logic is their rulebook. If both agree something is true, it's really true. If both say it's false, it's really false.Even if you change the rulebook a bit, they still agree on truths and falsehoods.2. The Î© Conjecture:Think of it as saying, "I bet that when Alice and Bob agree on something, it's always correct." You really trust their judgment.3. Î©-Complete Theories:Imagine you're a super-smart teacher who can answer any question, even really tough ones.Î©-Complete Theories are like these super-smart teachers for specific kinds of questions in math.4. Woodin's Case Against CH:Woodin, a mathematician, found a special theory (let's call it T(â)) that has super-reliable truth-checkers.In T(â), a tricky math question called the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) is false. This challenges a long-standing idea in math.T(â) also says there are as many real numbers as there are points on a line. This surprises many mathematicians.5. Strong Î© Conjecture:This is a related idea. If it's true, it helps support Woodin's case against CH.In summary, Woodin's work suggests that if certain math ideas hold, there's a special theory (T(â)) where CH is false and the size of infinity is like having as many points as there are real numbers on a line. It's a big deal in the world of math!4. The Multiverse
The above case for the failure of CH is the strongest known local case for axioms that settle CH. In this section and the next we will switch sides and consider the pluralist arguments to the effect that CH does not have an answer (in this section) and to the effect that there is an equally good case for CH (in the next section). In the final two section we will investigate optimistic global scenarios that provide hope of settling the issue.

The pluralist maintains that the independence results effectively settle the undecided questions by showing that they have no answer. One way of providing a foundational framework for such a view is in terms of the multiverse. On this view there is not a single universe of set theory but rather a multiverse of legitimate candidates, some of which may be preferable to others for certain purposes but none of which can be said to be the âtrueâ universe. The multiverse conception of truth is the view that a statement of set theory can only be said to be true simpliciter if it is true in all universes of the multiverse. For the purposes of this discussion we shall say that a statement is indeterminate according to the multiverse conception if it is neither true nor false according to the multiverse conception. How radical such a view is depends on the breadth of the conception of the multiverse.

4.1 Broad Multiverse Views
The pluralist is generally a non-pluralist about certain domains of mathematics. For example, a strict finitist might be a non-pluralist about PA but a pluralist about set theory and one might be a non-pluralist about ZFC and a pluralist about large cardinal axioms and statements like CH.

There is a form of radical pluralism which advocates pluralism concerning all domains of mathematics. On this view any consistent theory is a legitimate candidate and the corresponding models of such theories are legitimate candidates for the domain of mathematics. Let us call this the broadest multiverse view. There is a difficulty in articulating this view, which may be brought out as follows: To begin with, one must pick a background theory in which to discuss the various models and this leads to a difficult. For example, according to the broad multiverse conception, since PA cannot prove Con(PA) (by the second incompleteness theorem, assuming that PA is consistent) there are models of PA + Â¬Con(PA) and these models are legitimate candidates, that is, they are universes within the broad multiverse. Now to arrive at this conclusion one must (in the background theory) be in a position to prove Con(PA) (since this assumption is required to apply the second incompleteness theorem in this particular case). Thus, from the perspective of the background theory used to argue that the above models are legitimate candidates, the models in question satisfy a false Î£0
1
-
sentence, namely, Â¬Con(PA). In short, there is a lack of harmony between what is held at the meta-level and what is held at the object-level.

The only way out of this difficulty would seem to be to regard each viewpointâeach articulation of the multiverse conceptionâas provisional and, when pressed, embrace pluralism concerning the background theory. In other words, one would have to adopt a multiverse conception of the multiverse, a multiverse conception of the multiverse conception of the multiverse, and so on, off to infinity. It follows that such a position can never be fully articulatedâeach time one attempts to articulate the broad multiverse conception one must employ a background theory but since one is a pluralist about that background theory this pass at using the broad multiverse to articulate the conception does not do the conception full justice. The position is thus difficult to articulate. One can certainly take the pluralist stance and try to
gesture toward or exhibit the view that one intends by provisionally settling on a particular background theory but then advocate pluralism regarding that when pressed. The view is thus something of a âmoving targetâ. We shall pass over this view in silence and concentrate on views that can be articulated within a foundational framework.

We will accordingly look at views which embrace non-pluralism with regard to a given stretch of mathematics and for reasons of space and because this is an entry on set theory we will pass over the long debates concerning strict finitism, finitism, predicativism, and start with views that embrace non-pluralism regarding ZFC.

Let the broad multiverse (based on ZFC) be the collection of all models of ZFC. The broad multiverse conception of truth (based on ZFC) is then simply the view that a statement of set theory is true simpliciter if it is provable in ZFC. On this view the statement Con(ZFC) and other undecided Î 0
1
-statements are classified as indeterminate. This view thus faces a difficulty parallel to the one mentioned above concerning radical pluralism.

This motivates the shift to views that narrow the class of universes in the multiverse by employing a strong logic. For example, one can restrict to universes that are Ï-models, Î²-models (i.e., wellfounded), etc. On the view where one takes Ï-models, the statement Con(ZFC) is classified as true (though this is sensitive to the background theory) but the statement PM (all projective sets are Lebesgue measurable) is classified as indeterminate.

For those who are convinced by the arguments (surveyed in the entry âLarge Cardinals and Determinacyâ) for large cardinal axioms and axioms of definable determinacy, even these multiverse conceptions are too weak. We will follow this route. For the rest of this entry we will embrace non-pluralism concerning large cardinal axioms and axioms of definable determinacy and focus on the question of CH.ChatGPTLet's break down the concept of a mathematical multiverse in simpler terms:1. The Multiverse Idea:Imagine there isn't just one "true" world of mathematics, but a whole bunch of them.In these mathematical worlds, some math questions might have answers, while others might not.2. Broad Multiverse Views:Some people believe that every possible consistent math theory is a valid mathematical world.This idea can get tricky because you need a background theory to talk about these worlds, but you might also doubt that background theory.3. Narrowing the Multiverse:Others narrow things down by using certain rules. For example, they might only consider math worlds that follow a specific pattern, like being based on simple numbers or being well-organized.In these narrowed-down worlds, some math questions might have clear answers, while others remain uncertain.4. The Case for Large Cardinals:Some mathematicians prefer a multiverse where certain special math ideas, like large cardinal axioms and definable determinacy, are very important.In this view, these special ideas help decide math questions, like whether the Continuum Hypothesis is true or not.5. Non-Pluralism:Non-pluralism means sticking to a specific set of rules or principles in math, rather than opening up to all possibilities.In this context, it means believing in a particular set of powerful math ideas (large cardinals and definable determinacy) and using them to argue for certain math questions, like the Continuum Hypothesis.So, the multiverse idea is a way to think about math where there isn't just one right answer for every question. Some mathematicians like to explore all possibilities, while others prefer to focus on specific rules and principles to guide their mathematical thinking.4.2 The Generic Multiverse
The motivation behind the generic multiverse is to grant the case for large cardinal axioms and definable determinacy but deny that statements such as CH have a determinate truth value. To be specific about the background theory let us take ZFC + âThere is a proper class of Woodin cardinalsâ and recall that this large cardinal assumption secures axioms of definable determinacy such as PD and ADL(â).

Let the generic multiverse ð be the result of closing V under generic extensions and generic refinements. One way to formalize this is by taking an external vantage point and start with a countable transitive model M. The generic multiverse based on M is then the smallest set ðM such that M â ðM and, for each pair of countable transitive models (N,
N[G]) such that N â§ ZFC and G â â is N-generic for some partial order in â â N, if either N or N[G] is in ðM then both N and N[G] are in ðM.

Let the generic multiverse conception of truth be the view that a statement is true simpliciter iff it is true in all universes of the generic multiverse. We will call such a statement a generic multiverse truth. A statement is said to be indeterminate according to the generic multiverse conception iff it is neither true nor false according to the generic multiverse conception. For example, granting our large cardinal assumptions, such a view deems PM (and PD and ADL(â)) true but deems CH indeterminate.ChatGPTLet me simplify the idea of the "generic multiverse" in mathematics:1. Background Theory:Imagine we have a specific set of rules and principles in mathematics, which includes some powerful ideas like large cardinal axioms and definable determinacy.2. Multiple Mathematical Worlds:We explore different mathematical worlds based on these rules.In each world, some mathematical statements have clear answers, while others remain uncertain.3. What's True?We say a mathematical statement is "true" if it holds in all these mathematical worlds.A statement is "indeterminate" if it doesn't have a clear truth value across all these worlds.4. Example:Let's say in these mathematical worlds, certain statements like PM (all projective sets are Lebesgue measurable) are always true because of our rules.But statements like the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) might not have a clear answer in all these worlds, so they are considered indeterminate.In essence, the generic multiverse idea lets us embrace powerful mathematical ideas but accepts that some questions may never have a single, definitive answer in all possible mathematical worlds.4.3 The Î© Conjecture and the Generic Multiverse
Is the generic multiverse conception of truth tenable? The answer to this question is closely related to the subject of Î©-logic. The basic connection between generic multiverse truth and Î©-logic is embodied in the following theorem:

Theorem 4.1 (Woodin).
Assume ZFC and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Then, for each Î 2-statement Ï the following are equivalent:
Ï is a generic multiverse truth.
Ï is Î©-valid.
Now, recall that by Theorem 3.5, under our background assumptions, Î©-validity is generically invariant. It follows that given our background theory, the notion of generic multiverse truth is robust with respect to Î 2-statements. In particular, for Î 2-statements, the statement âÏ is indeterminateâ is itself determinate according to the generic multiverse conception. In this sense the conception of truth is not âself-underminingâ and one is not sent in a downward spiral where one has to countenance multiverses of multiverses. So it passes the first test. Whether it passes a more challenging test depends on the Î© Conjecture.

The Î© Conjecture has profound consequences for the generic multiverse conception of truth. Let

ð±Î© = {Ï | â â§Î© Ï}
and, for any specifiable cardinal Îº, let

ð±Î©(H(Îº+)) = {Ï | ZFC â§Î©âH(Îº+) â§ Ïâ},
where recall that H(Îº+) is the collection of sets of hereditary cardinality less than Îº+. Thus, assuming ZFC and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals, the set ð±Î© is Turing equivalent to the set of Î 2 generic multiverse truths and the set ð±Î©(H(Îº+)) is precisely the set of generic multiverse truths of H(Îº+).

To describe the bearing of the Î© Conjecture on the generic-multiverse conception of truth, we introduce two Transcendence Principles which serve as constraints on any tenable conception of truth in set theoryâa truth constraint and a definability constraint.ChatGPTLet's break down the connection between the Î© Conjecture and the generic multiverse conception of truth:1. Generic Multiverse Truth:In the generic multiverse, we're trying to determine what statements are true across different mathematical worlds.2. Connection to Î©-Logic:The Î© Conjecture is closely related to Î©-logic, which is a strong logic used to analyze mathematical truths in different universes.Theorem 4.1 states that for certain types of mathematical statements (Î 2-statements), being a generic multiverse truth is equivalent to being Î©-valid.3. Robustness and Challenges:For Î 2-statements, the generic multiverse conception of truth is not self-undermining. It doesn't lead to an endless chain of multiverses.However, the tenability of this conception depends on the Î© Conjecture.4. Consequences of the Î© Conjecture:The Î© Conjecture significantly impacts the generic multiverse conception of truth.It divides mathematical statements into sets like ð±Î© and ð±Î©(H(Îº+)), which represent truths in specific mathematical contexts.5. Transcendence Principles:To evaluate the validity of this conception of truth, we introduce two principlesâtruth constraint and definability constraintâto see if it aligns with our understanding of mathematical reality.In summary, the Î© Conjecture plays a crucial role in determining what is considered true in the generic multiverse of mathematics, and it has implications for our understanding of mathematical truths across various contexts.Definition 4.2 (Truth Constraint).
Any tenable multiverse conception of truth in set theory must be such that the Î 2-truths (according to that conception) in the universe of sets are not recursive in the truths about H(Îº) (according to that conception), for any specifiable cardinal.
This constraint is in the spirit of those principles of set theoryâmost notably, reflection principlesâwhich aim to capture the pretheoretic idea that the universe of sets is so rich that it cannot âbe described from belowâ; more precisely, it asserts that any tenable conception of truth must respect the idea that the universe of sets is so rich that truth (or even just Î 2-truth) cannot be described in some specifiable fragment. (Notice that by Tarski's theorem on the undefinability of truth, the truth constraint is trivially satisfied by the standard conception of truth in set theory which takes the multiverse to contain a single element, namely, V.)

There is also a related constraint concerning the definability of truth. For a specifiable cardinal Îº, set Y â Ï is definable in H(Îº+) across the multiverse if Y is definable in the structure H(Îº+) of each universe of the multiverse (possibly by formulas which depend on the parent universe).ChatGPTLet's delve into the Truth Constraint and the Definability Constraint:1. Truth Constraint:This constraint focuses on how truths are distributed across different levels of the set-theoretic multiverse.It asserts that a tenable multiverse conception of truth should ensure that Î 2-truths (truths of a particular type) within the universe of sets cannot be recursively defined based on truths about H(Îº) for any specified cardinal Îº.This constraint aligns with the notion that the universe of sets is incredibly rich and complex, making it impossible to fully capture its truths from a lower-level perspective.It's important to note that this constraint doesn't apply to the standard conception of truth in set theory, where there is only a single universe, V.2. Definability Constraint:This constraint relates to the definability of sets within the multiverse, especially concerning a specified cardinal Îº.It states that a set Y can be considered definable in H(Îº+) across the multiverse if it's definable within the structure H(Îº+) of each universe in the multiverse.This constraint essentially says that definability should be consistent and not vary significantly as we move across different mathematical worlds within the multiverse.In essence, these constraints aim to ensure that any multiverse conception of truth respects the inherent complexity and richness of the universe of sets, preventing it from being entirely captured or defined from a lower-level perspective.Definition 4.3 (Definability Constraint).
Any tenable multiverse conception of truth in set theory must be such that the Î 2-truths (according to that conception) in the universe of sets are definable in H(Îº) across the multiverse universe, for any specifiable cardinal Îº.
Notice again that by Tarski's theorem on the undefinability of truth, the definability constraint is trivially satisfied by the degenerate multiverse conception that takes the multiverse to contain the single element V. (Notice also that if one modifies the definability constraint by adding the requirement that the definition be uniform across the multiverse, then the constraint would automatically be met.)

The bearing of the Î© Conjecture on the tenability of the generic-multiverse conception of truth is contained in the following two theorems:

Theorem 4.4 (Woodin).
Assume ZFC and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose that the Î© Conjecture holds. Then ð±Î© is recursive in ð±Î©(H(Î´+
0
)), where Î´0 is the least Woodin cardinal.
Theorem 4.5 (Woodin).
Assume ZFC and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose that the Î© Conjecture holds. Then ð±Î© is definable in H(Î´+
0
), where Î´0 is the least Woodin cardinal.
In other words, if there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals and if the Î© Conjecture holds then the generic multiverse conception of truth violates both the Truth Constraint (at Î´0) and the Definability Constraint (at Î´0).

There are actually sharper versions of the above results that involve H(c+) in place of H(Î´+
0
).

Theorem 4.6 (Woodin).
Assume ZFC and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose that the Î© Conjecture holds. Then ð±Î© is recursive in ð±Î©(H(c+)).
Theorem 4.7 (Woodin).
Assume ZFC and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose that the Î© Conjecture holds and that the AD+ Conjecture holds. Then ð±Î© is definable in H(c+).
In other words, if there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals and if the Î© Conjecture holds then the generic-multiverse conception of truth violates the Truth Constraint at the level of third-order arithmetic, and if, in addition, the AD+ Conjecture holds, then the generic-multiverse conception of truth violates the Definability Constraint at the level of third-order arithmetic.ChatGPTThese theorems shed light on the implications of the Î© Conjecture for the generic multiverse conception of truth:Theorem 4.4: Assuming ZFC and a proper class of Woodin cardinals, and if the Î© Conjecture holds, then the generic multiverse conception of truth is recursively definable within the structure H(Î´â+), where Î´â is the least Woodin cardinal. This means that the Truth Constraint is violated at the level of Î´â.Theorem 4.5: Assuming ZFC and a proper class of Woodin cardinals, and if the Î© Conjecture holds, then the generic multiverse conception of truth is definable within the structure H(Î´â+), again where Î´â is the least Woodin cardinal. This implies a violation of the Definability Constraint at the level of Î´â.Theorem 4.6: Assuming ZFC, a proper class of Woodin cardinals, and the Î© Conjecture, the generic multiverse conception of truth becomes recursively definable in H(c+), which extends the violation of the Truth Constraint to the level of third-order arithmetic.Theorem 4.7: Assuming ZFC, a proper class of Woodin cardinals, the Î© Conjecture, and the AD+ Conjecture, the generic multiverse conception of truth becomes definable in H(c+), extending the violation of the Definability Constraint to the level of third-order arithmetic.In summary, these theorems show that if certain strong set-theoretic assumptions, including the Î© Conjecture, hold, then the generic multiverse conception of truth faces challenges in terms of the Truth and Definability Constraints at various levels, including the level of Î´â and third-order arithmetic, depending on additional assumptions like AD+.multiverse view of truth must deem determinate. Moreover, the key arguments above go through with this Î£2-statement instead of the Î© Conjecture. The person taking this second line of response would thus also have to maintain that this statement is false. But there is substantial evidence that this statement is true. The reason is that there is no known example of a Î£2-statement that is invariant under set forcing relative to large cardinal axioms and which cannot be settled by large cardinal axioms. (Such a statement would be a candidate for an absolutely undecidable statement.) So it is reasonable to expect that this statement is resolved by large cardinal axioms. However, recent advances in inner model theoryâin particular, those in Woodin (2010)âprovide evidence that no large cardinal axiom can refute this statement. Putting everything together: It is very likely that this statement is in fact true ; so this line of response is not promising.

Third, one could reject either the Truth Constraint or the Definability Constraint. The trouble is that if one rejects the Truth Constraint then on this view (assuming the Î© Conjecture) Î 2 truth in set theory is reducible in the sense of Turing reducibility to truth in H(Î´0) (or, assuming the Strong Î© Conjecture, H(c+)). And if one rejects the Definability Constraint then on this view (assuming the Î© Conjecture) Î 2 truth in set theory is reducible in the sense of definability to truth in H(Î´0) (or, assuming the Strong Î© Conjecture, H(c+)). On either view, the reduction is in tension with the acceptance of non-pluralism regarding the background theory ZFC + âThere is a proper class of Woodin cardinalsâ.

Fourth, one could embrace the criticism, reject the generic multiverse conception of truth, and admit that there are some statements about H(Î´+
0
) (or H(c+), granting, in addition, the AD+ Conjecture) that are true simpliciter but not true in the sense of the generic-multiverse, and yet nevertheless continue to maintain that CH is indeterminate. The difficulty is that any such sentence Ï is qualitatively just like CH in that it can be forced to hold and forced to fail. The challenge for the advocate of this approach is to modify the generic-multiverse conception of truth in such a way that it counts Ï as determinate and yet counts CH as indeterminate.

In summary: There is evidence that the only way out is the fourth way out and this places the burden back on the pluralistâthe pluralist must come up with a modified version of the generic multiverse.

Further Reading: For more on the connection between Î©-logic and the generic multiverse and the above criticism of the generic multiverse see Woodin (2011a). For the bearing of recent results in inner model theory on the status of the Î© Conjecture see Woodin (2010).
ChatGPTThe discussion you provided revolves around the interplay between the generic multiverse conception of truth, the Î© Conjecture, and various constraints related to truth in set theory. Here are some key points and implications:Challenges to the Generic Multiverse Conception of Truth: The generic multiverse conception of truth posits that a statement is true if and only if it is true in all universes of the generic multiverse. However, this view faces challenges when considering the Truth Constraint and the Definability Constraint.The Truth Constraint: The Truth Constraint asserts that truths about the universe of sets, especially Î â truths, should not be recursively definable within certain levels of the set-theoretic hierarchy. The results presented suggest that, under certain assumptions like the Î© Conjecture, the generic multiverse conception of truth may not satisfy this constraint. This implies that Î â truths about the universe of sets could be recursively definable in H(Î´â+) or even H(c+), depending on additional assumptions.The Definability Constraint: The Definability Constraint states that Î â truths about the universe of sets should be definable in H(Îº) across the multiverse universe, for any specifiable cardinal Îº. The results indicate that, under certain conditions, this constraint may not be met either, violating the definability of such truths.Implications for CH and Other Statements: The discussion touches on statements like the Î© Conjecture and CH. The challenge is that if one rejects the generic multiverse conception of truth or modifies it to accommodate certain truths, this might have implications for CH and similar statements. For instance, if a statement like CH is deemed indeterminate, it raises questions about how other statements, with similar characteristics, should be treated.The Pluralist's Burden: The discussion suggests that, given the challenges faced by the generic multiverse conception of truth, the burden might be on the pluralist to propose a modified version of the generic multiverse conception that can address these challenges while maintaining pluralism.This is a complex and highly specialized area of set theory and philosophy of mathematics, and the discussion revolves around intricate technical details and assumptions. It highlights the subtleties and difficulties in trying to develop a coherent and consistent framework for understanding truth and indeterminacy in set theory, especially in the context of large cardinals and inner model theory. Further exploration and research in this area would require a deep understanding of advanced set theory concepts.5. The Local Case Revisited
Let us now turn to a second way in which one might resist the local case for the failure of CH. This involves a parallel case for CH. In Section 5.1 we will review the main features of the case for Â¬CH in order to compare it with the parallel case for CH. In Section 5.2 we will present the parallel case for CH. In Section 5.3 we will assess the comparison.

5.1 The Case for Â¬CH
Recall that there are two basic steps in the case presented in Section 3.3. The first step involves Î©-completeness (and this gives Â¬CH) and the second step involves maximality (and this gives the stronger 2âµ0 = âµ2). For ease of comparison we shall repeat these features here:

The first step is based on the following result:

Theorem 5.1 (Woodin).
Assume that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals and that the Strong Î© Conjecture holds.
There is an axiom A such that
ZFC + A is Î©-satisfiable and
ZFC + A is Î©-complete for the structure H(Ï2).
Any such axiom A has the feature that
ZFC + A â§ Î©âH(Ï2) â§ Â¬CHâ.
Let us rephrase this as follows: For each A satisfying (1), let

TA = {Ï | ZFC + A â§Î© âH(Ï2) â§ Â¬Ïâ}.
The theorem says that if there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals and the Strong Î© Conjecture holds, then there are (non-trivial) Î©-complete theories TA of H(Ï2) and all such theories contain Â¬CH. In other words, under these assumptions, there is a âgoodâ theory and all âgoodâ theories imply Â¬CH.

The second step begins with the question of whether there is greater agreement among the Î©-complete theories TA. Ideally, there would be just one. However, this is not the case.ChatGPTIn this section, we're revisiting the case for Â¬CH (the failure of the Continuum Hypothesis) before presenting a parallel case for CH (the Continuum Hypothesis). Here's a summary of the key features of the case for Â¬CH:Î©-Completeness and Â¬CH: The case for Â¬CH is based on the concept of Î©-completeness. This concept asserts that certain theories are "complete" with respect to a collection of sentences, meaning they can either prove a sentence or its negation. The key theorem (Theorem 5.1) states that, assuming the existence of a proper class of Woodin cardinals and the Strong Î© Conjecture, there exists an axiom A that makes ZFC + A both Î©-satisfiable and Î©-complete for the structure H(Ï2). This axiom A has the property that ZFC + A implies Â¬CH.Multiple Î©-Complete Theories: The case proceeds by considering the question of whether there is a unique Î©-complete theory for H(Ï2). Ideally, one would hope for a single theory, but it turns out that there are multiple such theories (TA) that are all Î©-complete and imply Â¬CH.Maximality and 2^âµ0 = âµ2: Despite the existence of multiple Î©-complete theories, the case then aims to identify a "maximal" theory, T(â), which captures the most comprehensive set of truths about H(Ï2). In this maximal theory, CH fails (2^âµ0 = âµ2).In the next section, we'll explore the parallel case for CH to see how it compares to this case for Â¬CH.Theorem 5.2 (Koellner and Woodin 1999).
Assume that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose that A is an axiom such that
 i.  ZFC + A is Î©-satisfiable and
ii.  ZFC + A is Î©-complete for the structure H(Ï2).
Then there is an axiom B such that

 iâ².  ZFC + B is Î©-satisfiable and
iiâ².  ZFC + B is Î©-complete for the structure H(Ï2)
and TAâ TB.
This raises the issue as to how one is to select from among these theories? It turns out that there is a maximal theory among the TA and this is given by the axiom (â).

Theorem 5.3 (Woodin).
Assume ZFC and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Then the following are equivalent:
(â).
For each Î 2-sentence Ï in the language for the structure
â¨H(Ï2), â, INS, A | A â ð« (â) â© L(â)â©
if

ZFC + ââ¨H(Ï2), â, INS, A | A â ð« (â) â© L(â)â© â§ Ïâ
is Î©-consistent, then

â¨H(Ï2), â, INS, A | A â ð« (â) â© L(â)â© â§ Ï.
So, of the various theories TA involved in Theorem 5.1, there is one that stands out: The theory T(â) given by (â). This theory maximizes the Î 2-theory of the structure â¨H(Ï2), â, INS, A | A â ð« (â) â© L(â)â©. The fundamental result is that in this maximal theory

2âµ0 = âµ2.ChatGPTThe case for Â¬CH is built upon Theorems 5.2 and 5.3, which provide essential insights into the existence of multiple Î©-complete theories and the identification of a maximal theory T(â). Here's a summary of these key theorems:Multiplicity of Î©-Complete Theories: Theorem 5.2 establishes that under the assumption of a proper class of Woodin cardinals, if an axiom A makes ZFC + A both Î©-satisfiable and Î©-complete for H(Ï2), then there exists another axiom B with similar properties (Î©-satisfiable and Î©-complete) such that the theories ZFC + A and ZFC + B are distinct (TA â  TB). This implies the existence of multiple Î©-complete theories.Maximal Theory T(â): Despite the existence of multiple Î©-complete theories, Theorem 5.3 identifies a "maximal" theory T(â). This maximal theory is characterized by the axiom (â), which can be phrased in terms of Î©-logic. It states that for each Î 2-sentence Ï in the language for the structure â¨H(Ï2), â, INS, A | A â ð« (â) â© L(â)â©, if the statement ZFC + "â¨H(Ï2), â, INS, A | A â ð« (â) â© L(â)â© â§ Ï" is Î©-consistent, then â¨H(Ï2), â, INS, A | A â ð« (â) â© L(â)â© â§ Ï. In other words, T(â) maximizes the Î 2-theory of this structure.Maximal Theory and CH: The fundamental result is that in this maximal theory T(â), the statement 2^âµ0 = âµ2 holds. This means that the continuum hypothesis (CH) fails in the maximal theory.In essence, the case for Â¬CH relies on the existence of multiple Î©-complete theories, with T(â) being the most comprehensive one that establishes Â¬CH and the size of the continuum, 2^âµ0 = âµ2.5.2 The Parallel Case for CH
The parallel case for CH also has two steps, the first involving Î©-completeness and the second involving maximality.

The first result in the first step is the following:

Theorem 5.4 (Woodin 1985).
Assume ZFC and that there is a proper class of measurable Woodin cardinals. Then ZFC + CH is Î©-complete for Î£2
1
.
Moreover, up to Î©-equivalence, CH is the unique Î£2
1
-statement that is Î©-complete for Î£2
1
; that is, letting TA be the Î©-complete theory given by ZFC + A where A is Î£2
1
, all such TA are Î©-equivalent to TCH and hence (trivially) all such TA contain CH. In other words, there is a âgoodâ theory and all âgoodâ theories imply CH.

To complete the first step we have to determine whether this result is robust. For it could be the case that when one considers the next level, Î£2
2
 (or further levels, like third-order arithmetic) CH is no longer part of the picture, that is, perhaps large cardinals imply that there is an axiom A such that ZFC + A is Î©-complete for Î£2
2
 (or, going further, all of third order arithmetic) and yet not all such A have an associated TA which contains CH. We must rule this out if we are to secure the first step.

The most optimistic scenario along these lines is this: The scenario is that there is a large cardinal axiom L and axioms Aâ such that ZFC + L + Aâ is Î©-complete for all of third-order arithmetic and all such theories are Î©-equivalent and imply CH. Going further, perhaps for each specifiable fragment VÎ» of the universe of sets there is a large cardinal axiom L and axioms Aâ such that ZFC + L + Aâ is Î©-complete for the entire theory of VÎ» and, moreover, that such theories are Î©-equivalent and imply CH. Were this to be the case it would mean that for each such Î» there is a unique Î©-complete picture of VÎ» and we would have a unique Î©-complete understanding of arbitrarily large fragments of the universe of sets. This would make for a strong case for new axioms completing the axioms of ZFC and large cardinal axioms.

Unfortunately, this optimistic scenario fails: Assuming the existence of one such theory one can construct another which differs on CH:

Theorem 5.5 (Koellner and Woodin 2009).
Assume ZFC and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose VÎ» is a specifiable fragment of the universe (that is sufficiently large) and suppose that there is a large cardinal axiom L and axioms Aâ such that
ZFC + L + Aâ is Î©-complete for Th(VÎ»).
Then there are axioms Bâ such that
ZFC + L + Bâ is Î©-complete for Th(VÎ»)
and the first theory Î©-implies CH if and only if the second theory Î©-implies Â¬CH.
This still leaves us with the question of existence and the answer to this question is sensitive to the Î© Conjecture and the AD+ Conjecture:

Theorem 5.6 (Woodin).
Assume that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals and that the Î© Conjecture holds. Then there is no recursive theory Aâ such that ZFC + Aâ is Î©-complete for the theory of VÎ´0+1, where Î´0 is the least Woodin cardinal.
In fact, under a stronger assumption, the scenario must fail at a much earlier level.

Theorem 5.7 (Woodin).
Assume that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals and that the Î© Conjecture holds. Assume that the AD+ Conjecture holds. Then there is no recursive theory Aâ such that ZFC + Aâ is Î©-complete for the theory of Î£2
3
.
It is open whether there can be such a theory at the level of Î£2
2
. It is conjectured that ZFC + â is Î©-complete (assuming large cardinal axioms) for Î£2
2
.

Let us assume that it is answered positively and return to the question of uniqueness. For each such axiom A, let TA be the Î£2
2
 theory computed by ZFC + A in Î©-logic. The question of uniqueness simply asks whether TA is unique.

Theorem 5.8 (Koellner and Woodin 2009).
Assume that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose that A is an axiom such that
 i. ZFC + A is Î©-satisfiable and
ii. ZFC + A is Î©-complete for Î£2
2
.
Then there is an axiom B such that
 iâ². ZFC + B is Î©-satisfiable and
iiâ². ZFC + B is Î©-complete for Î£2
2
and TAâ TB.ChatGPTThe parallel case for CH is established through a series of theorems and considerations. Here is a summary of the key points in this case:The Î©-Completeness of ZFC + CH: The first step in the parallel case for CH involves Theorem 5.4. Assuming the existence of a proper class of measurable Woodin cardinals, it demonstrates that ZFC + CH is Î©-complete for Î£2â. In other words, CH is the unique Î£2â-statement that is Î©-complete for Î£2â. This provides a "good" theory for CH under certain large cardinal assumptions.Robustness of the First Step: To establish the robustness of this result, one must ensure that CH remains part of the picture when considering higher levels of set theory, like Î£2â or even third-order arithmetic. It is shown that a scenario where large cardinals imply a theory that includes CH in all these levels is too optimistic. There is no such unique Î©-complete understanding of arbitrarily large fragments of the universe of sets.Existence and Sensitivity to Conjectures: The existence of such theories is sensitive to conjectures like the Î© Conjecture and the AD+ Conjecture. Theorems 5.6 and 5.7 indicate that, under these conjectures, the scenario of having recursive theories that are Î©-complete for specific fragments of set theory fails or becomes very restricted.Uniqueness of Î©-Complete Theories for CH: The question of uniqueness arises: are there multiple Î©-complete theories for CH or just one? Theorem 5.8 provides an answer by showing that, even at the Î£2â level, there can be multiple Î©-complete theories. For each axiom A that satisfies specific criteria, there exists an axiom B with similar properties, and the associated theories TA and TB are not the same.In summary, the parallel case for CH establishes that under certain large cardinal assumptions, ZFC + CH can be Î©-complete for certain fragments of set theory. However, the existence of multiple Î©-complete theories and their sensitivity to conjectures make it challenging to pinpoint a unique, comprehensive understanding of CH.This is the parallel of Theorem 5.2.

To complete the parallel one would need that CH is among all of the TA. This is not known. But it is a reasonable conjecture.

Conjecture 5.9.
Assume large cardinal axioms.
There is an Î£2
2
 axiom A such that
ZFC + A is Î©-satisfiable and
ZFC + A is Î©-complete for the Î£2
2
.
Any such Î£2
2
 axiom A has the feature that
ZFC + A â§Î© CH.
Should this conjecture hold it would provide a true analogue of Theorem 5.1. This would complete the parallel with the first step.

There is also a parallel with the second step. Recall that for the second step in the previous subsection we had that although the various TA did not agree, they all contained Â¬CH and, moreover, from among them there is one that stands out, namely the theory given by (â), since this theory maximizes the Î 2-theory of the structure â¨H(Ï2), â, INS, A | A â P (â) â© L(â)â©. In the present context of CH we again (assuming the conjecture) have that although the TA do not agree, they all contain CH. It turns out that once again, from among them there is one that stands out, namely, the maximum one. For it is known (by a result of Woodin in 1985) that if there is a proper class of measurable Woodin cardinals then there is a forcing extension satisfying all Î£2
2
 sentences Ï such that ZFC + CH + Ï is Î©-satisfiable (see Ketchersid, Larson, & Zapletal (2010)). It follows that if the question of existence is answered positively with an A that is Î£2
2
 then TA must be this maximum Î£2
2
 theory and, consequently, all TA agree when A is Î£2
2
. So, assuming that there is a TA where A is Î£2
2
, then, although not all TA agree (when A is arbitrary) there is one that stands out, namely, the one that is maximum for Î£2
2
 sentences.ChatGPTThe completion of the parallel case for CH involves several conjectures and hypotheses:Conjecture 5.9: This conjecture suggests that under large cardinal axioms, there exists an Î£2â axiom A that satisfies specific criteria. If this conjecture holds, then ZFC + A would be Î©-satisfiable and Î©-complete for Î£2â, and furthermore, it would imply CH. This conjecture parallels Theorem 5.1, completing the parallel with the first step of the case for Â¬CH.The Maximum Theory for CH: Just as in the case for Â¬CH, there is a parallel for CH. Although the various theories TA might not agree for arbitrary A, they are all expected to contain CH when A is Î£2â. This is analogous to the situation in the case for Â¬CH, where all theories contained Â¬CH. However, there is one theory that stands out as the maximum one.Woodin's Result: A result by Woodin in 1985 is mentioned, which states that if there is a proper class of measurable Woodin cardinals, then there is a forcing extension satisfying all Î£2â sentences Ï such that ZFC + CH + Ï is Î©-satisfiable. This result suggests that when A is Î£2â, TA must be the maximum Î£2â theory, and thus, all TA would agree when A is Î£2â.In summary, the completion of the parallel case for CH hinges on Conjecture 5.9, which suggests the existence of an Î£2â axiom that makes ZFC + A Î©-satisfiable and Î©-complete for Î£2â while implying CH. If this conjecture holds, it would parallel the first step of the case for Â¬CH and provide a unique and maximum theory for CH, similar to the theory given by (â) in the case for Â¬CH.Thus, if the above conjecture holds, then the case of CH parallels that of Â¬CH, only now Î£2
2
 takes the place of the theory of H(Ï2).

5.3 Assessment
Assuming that the conjecture holds the case of CH parallels that of Â¬CH, only now Î£2
2
 takes the place of the theory of H(Ï2): Under the background assumptions we have:

there are A such that ZFC + A is Î©-complete for H(Ï2)
for every such A the associated TA contains Â¬CH, and
there is a TA which is maximal, namely, T(â) and this theory contains 2âµ0 = âµ2.
there are Î£2
2
-axioms A such that ZFC + A is Î©-complete for Î£2
2
for every such A the associated TA contains CH, and
there is a TA which is maximal.
The two situations are parallel with regard to maximality but in terms of the level of Î©-completeness the first is stronger. For in the first case we are not just getting Î©-completeness with regard to the Î 2 theory of H(Ï2) (with the additional predicates), rather we are getting Î©-completeness with regard to all of H(Ï2). This is arguably an argument in favour of the case for Â¬CH, even granting the conjecture.

But there is a stronger point. There is evidence coming from inner model theory (which we shall discuss in the next section) to the effect that the conjecture is in fact false. Should this turn out to be the case it would break the parallel, strengthening the case for Â¬CH.

However, one might counter this as follows: The higher degree of Î©-completeness in the case for Â¬CH is really illusory since it is an artifact of the fact that under (â) the theory of H(Ï2) is in fact mutually interpretable with that of H(Ï1) (by a deep result of Woodin). Moreover, this latter fact is in conflict with the spirit of the Transcendence Principles discussed in Section 4.3. Those principles were invoked in an argument to the effect that CH does not have an answer. Thus, when all the dust settles the real import of Woodin's work on CH (so the argument goes) is not that CH is false but rather that CH very likely has an answer.

It seems fair to say that at this stage the status of the local approaches to resolving CH is somewhat unsettled. For this reason, in the remainder of this entry we shall focus on global approaches to settling CH. We shall very briefly discuss two such approachesâthe approach via inner model theory and the approach via quasi-large cardinal axioms.ChatGPTIn assessing the parallel cases for CH and Â¬CH, there are several key points to consider:Î©-Completeness: The case for Â¬CH exhibits a higher degree of Î©-completeness compared to the case for CH. In the Â¬CH case, Î©-completeness extends to all of H(Ï2), whereas in the CH case, it primarily focuses on Î£2â sentences. This extra level of completeness in the Â¬CH case can be viewed as an advantage for that case.Evidence Against Conjecture: There is evidence from inner model theory suggesting that Conjecture 5.9, which plays a crucial role in the parallel case for CH, might be false. If this evidence is confirmed, it would weaken the case for CH and potentially strengthen the case for Â¬CH.Interpretability: It's important to note that the higher level of Î©-completeness in the Â¬CH case is partly due to the mutual interpretability of the theories of H(Ï2) and H(Ï1) under the theory T(â). This fact can be seen as problematic, as it conflicts with the Transcendence Principles discussed earlier, which suggest that CH might not have a definitive answer. Some argue that Woodin's work on CH could indicate that CH is likely to have an answer.Overall, the status of the local approaches to resolving CH remains somewhat unsettled. The higher level of Î©-completeness in the Â¬CH case may be misleading, and the evidence against Conjecture 5.9 could potentially weaken the case for CH. As a result, the focus in the remainder of the discussion shifts towards global approaches to settling CH, such as inner model theory and quasi-large cardinal axioms. These global approaches may provide alternative perspectives and insights into the continuum hypothesis.6. The Ultimate Inner Model
Inner model theory aims to produce âL-likeâ models that contain large cardinal axioms. For each large cardinal axiom Î¦ that has been reached by inner model theory, one has an axiom of the form V = LÎ¦. This axiom has the virtue that (just as in the simplest case of V = L) it provides an âeffectively completeâ solution regarding questions about LÎ¦ (which, by assumption, is V). Unfortunately, it turns out that the axiom V = LÎ¦ is incompatible with stronger large cardinal axioms Î¦'. For this reason, axioms of this form have never been considered as plausible candidates for new axioms.

But recent developments in inner model theory (due to Woodin) show that everything changes at the level of a supercompact cardinal. These developments show that if there is an inner model N which âinheritsâ a supercompact cardinal from V (in the manner in which one would expect, given the trajectory of inner model theory), then there are two remarkable consequences: First, N is close to V (in, for example, the sense that for sufficiently large singular cardinals Î», N correctly computes Î»+). Second, N inherits all known large cardinals that exist in V. Thus, in contrast to the inner models that have been developed thus far, an inner model at the level of a supercompact would provide one with an axiom that could not be refuted by stronger large cardinal assumptions.

The issue, of course, is whether one can have an âL-likeâ model (one that yields an âeffectively completeâ axiom) at this level. There is reason to believe that one can. There is now a candidate model LÎ© that yields an axiom V = LÎ© with the following features: First, V = LÎ© is âeffectively complete.â Second, V = LÎ© is compatible with all large cardinal axioms. Thus, on this scenario, the ultimate theory would be the (open-ended) theory ZFC + V = LÎ© + LCA, where LCA is a schema standing for âlarge cardinal axioms.â The large cardinal axioms will catch instances of GÃ¶delian independence and the axiom V = LÎ© will capture the remaining instances of independence. This theory would imply CH and settle the remaining undecided statements. Independence would cease to be an issue.

It turns out, however, that there are other candidate axioms that share these features, and so the spectre of pluralism reappears. For example, there are axioms V = LÎ©
S
 and V = LÎ©
(â)
. These axioms would also be âeffectively completeâ and compatible with all large cardinal axioms. Yet they would resolve various questions differently than the axiom V = LÎ©. For example, the axiom, V = LÎ©
(â)
 would imply Â¬CH. How, then, is one to adjudicate between them?

Further Reading: For an introduction to inner model theory see Mitchell (2010) and Steel (2010). For more on the recent developments at the level of one supercompact and beyond see Woodin (2010).ChatGPTInner model theory plays a significant role in the search for new axioms in set theory and understanding their relationships with large cardinal axioms. Here are some key points to take away from this section:Axiom V = LÎ¦: Historically, axioms of the form V = LÎ¦, where Î¦ represents a large cardinal axiom, were not considered plausible candidates for new axioms due to their incompatibility with stronger large cardinal axioms.Supercompact Cardinals: Recent developments in inner model theory, particularly concerning supercompact cardinals, have changed this perspective. If an inner model N inherits a supercompact cardinal from the universe V, it can provide an axiom that is compatible with all known large cardinal axioms.Candidate Model LÎ©: There is a candidate model called LÎ© that yields the axiom V = LÎ©. This axiom is both "effectively complete" and compatible with all large cardinal axioms. It represents a promising candidate for settling questions in set theory.Pluralism: Despite the existence of candidate axioms like V = LÎ©, pluralism remains a challenge. Other candidate axioms, such as V = LÎ©S and V = LÎ©(â), also exhibit similar features of effectiveness and compatibility but may resolve questions differently. This raises the question of how to choose between these candidate axioms.The ultimate goal of these developments in inner model theory is to find a set of axioms that not only resolves open questions in set theory but also captures all instances of independence. Pluralism arises because there are potentially multiple candidate axioms that fulfill these criteria, and the challenge lies in determining which, if any, is the correct one.Further reading is recommended for those interested in delving deeper into inner model theory and its implications for set theory.7. The Structure Theory of L(VÎ»+1)
This brings us to the second global approach, one that promises to select the correct axiom from among V = LÎ©, V = LÎ©
S
, V = LÎ©
(â)
, and their variants. This approach is based on the remarkable analogy between the structure theory of L(â) under the assumption of ADL(â) and the structure theory of L(VÎ»+1) under the assumption that there is an elementary embedding from L(VÎ»+1) into itself with critical point below Î». This embedding assumption is the strongest large cardinal axiom that appears in the literature.

The analogy between L(â) and L(VÎ»+1) is based on the observation that L(â) is simply L(VÏ+1). Thus, Î» is the analogue of Ï, Î»+ is the analogue of Ï1, and so on. As an example of the parallel between the structure theory of L(â) under ADL(â) and the structure theory of L(VÎ»+1) under the embedding axiom, let us mention that in the first case, Ï1 is a measurable cardinal in L(â) and, in the second case, the analogue of Ï1ânamely, Î»+âis a measurable cardinal in L(VÎ»+1). This result is due to Woodin and is just one instance from among many examples of the parallel that are contained in his work.

Now, we have a great deal of information about the structure theory of L(â) under ADL(â). Indeed, as we noted above, this axiom is âeffectively completeâ with regard to questions about L(â). In contrast, the embedding axiom on its own is not sufficient to imply that L(VÎ»+1) has a structure theory that fully parallels that of L(â) under ADL(â). However, the existence of an already rich parallel is evidence that the parallel extends, and we can supplement the embedding axiom by adding some key components. When one does so, something remarkable happens: the supplementary axioms become forcing fragile. This means that they have the potential to erase independence and provide non-trivial information about VÎ»+1. For example, these supplementary axioms might settle CH and much more.

The difficulty in investigating the possibilities for the structure theory of L(VÎ»+1) is that we have not had the proper lenses through which to view it. The trouble is that the model L(VÎ»+1) contains a large piece of the universeânamely, L(VÎ»+1)âand the theory of this structure is radically underdetermined. The results discussed above provide us with the proper lenses. For one can examine the structure theory of L(VÎ»+1) in the context of ultimate inner models like LÎ©, LÎ©
S
, LÎ©
(â)
, and their variants. The point is that these models can accommodate the embedding axiom and, within each, one will be able to compute the structure theory of L(VÎ»+1).

This provides a means to select the correct axiom from among  V = LÎ©, V = LÎ©
S
, V = LÎ©
(â)
, and their variants. One simply looks at the L(VÎ»+1) of each model (where the embedding axiom holds) and checks to see which has the true analogue of the structure theory of L(â) under the assumption of ADL(â). It is already known that certain pieces of the structure theory cannot hold in LÎ©. But it is open whether they can hold in LÎ©
S
.

Let us consider one such (very optimistic) scenario: The true analogue of the structure theory of L(â) under ADL(â) holds of the L(VÎ»+1) of LÎ©
S
 but not of any of its variants. Moreover, this structure theory is âeffectively completeâ for the theory of VÎ»+1. Assuming that there is a proper class of Î» where the embedding axiom holds, this gives an âeffectively completeâ theory of V. And, remarkably, part of that theory is that V must be LÎ©
S
.

This (admittedly very optimistic) scenario would constitute a very strong case for axioms that resolve all of the undecided statements.

One should not place too much weight on this particular scenario. It is just one of many. The point is that we are now in a position to write down a list of definite questions with the following features: First, the questions on this list will have answersâindependence is not an issue. Second, if the answers converge then one will have strong evidence for new axioms settling the undecided statements (and hence non-pluralism about the universe of sets); while if the answers oscillate, one will have evidence that these statements are âabsolutely undecidableâ and this will strengthen the case for pluralism. In this way the questions of âabsolute undecidabilityâ and pluralism are given mathematical traction.

Further Reading: For more on the structure theory of L(VÎ»+1) and the parallel with determinacy see Woodin (2011b).ChatGPTThe structure theory of L(VÎ»+1)L(V_{\lambda+1})L(VÎ»+1â) and the analogy with L(R)L(\mathbb{R})L(R) under ADL(R\mathbb{R}R) provide a promising avenue for selecting the correct axiom among various candidates like V=LÎ©V = L^\OmegaV=LÎ©, V=LÎ©SV = L^{\Omega_S}V=LÎ©Sâ, V=LÎ©âV = L^{\Omega^*}V=LÎ©â, and their variants. Here are the key takeaways from this approach:Analogies between L(R)L(\mathbb{R})L(R) and L(VÎ»+1)L(V_{\lambda+1})L(VÎ»+1â): The analogy arises because L(R)L(\mathbb{R})L(R) is simply L(VÏ+1)L(V_{\omega+1})L(VÏ+1â), and this correspondence extends to higher levels, such as Î»\lambdaÎ» corresponding to Ï\omegaÏ and Î»+\lambda^+Î»+ corresponding to Ï1\omega_1Ï1â.Embedding Axiom: The approach hinges on the existence of an elementary embedding from L(VÎ»+1)L(V_{\lambda+1})L(VÎ»+1â) into itself with a critical point below Î»\lambdaÎ». This embedding axiom is a strong large cardinal axiom.Supplementary Axioms: While the embedding axiom alone doesn't fully parallel the structure theory of L(R)L(\mathbb{R})L(R) under ADL(R\mathbb{R}R), adding supplementary axioms leads to interesting consequences. These supplementary axioms are forcing fragile, meaning they can provide non-trivial information about VÎ»+1V_{\lambda+1}VÎ»+1â and potentially settle questions like CH.Proper Lenses: To investigate the structure theory of L(VÎ»+1)L(V_{\lambda+1})L(VÎ»+1â), researchers use ultimate inner models like LÎ©L^\OmegaLÎ©, LÎ©SL^{\Omega_S}LÎ©Sâ, LÎ©âL^{\Omega^*}LÎ©â, and their variants. These models can accommodate the embedding axiom and allow the computation of L(VÎ»+1)L(V_{\lambda+1})L(VÎ»+1â) structures.Selecting the Correct Axiom: By examining the structure theory of L(VÎ»+1)L(V_{\lambda+1})L(VÎ»+1â) within each model where the embedding axiom holds, researchers aim to identify which model aligns with the true structure theory of L(R)L(\mathbb{R})L(R) under ADL(R\mathbb{R}R). This approach seeks to determine the correct axiom that settles undecided statements in set theory.Determining Pluralism or Undecidability: This approach allows for posing definite questions that have answers, eliminating issues of independence. If the answers converge, it strengthens the case for new axioms settling undecided statements, reducing pluralism. If the answers oscillate, it suggests "absolute undecidability" and supports pluralism.This approach offers a systematic way to explore the nature of undecidability and pluralism in set theory by connecting it to the structure theory of L(VÎ»+1)L(V_{\lambda+1})L(VÎ»+1â) and seeking mathematical evidence to resolve these questions.For further exploration, you can refer to relevant literature, especially Woodin's work on this topic.A bit simpler.2 / 2ChatGPTCertainly, here's a simpler summary:Researchers are using the structure theory of L(VÎ»+1)L(V_{\lambda+1})L(VÎ»+1â) and its analogy to L(R)L(\mathbb{R})L(R) under ADL(R\mathbb{R}R) to select the right axiom among contenders like V=LÎ©V = L^\OmegaV=LÎ©, V=LÎ©SV = L^{\Omega_S}V=LÎ©Sâ, V=LÎ©âV = L^{\Omega^*}V=LÎ©â, and more.They're focusing on the existence of an elementary embedding from L(VÎ»+1)L(V_{\lambda+1})L(VÎ»+1â) into itself with a critical point below Î»\lambdaÎ», a strong large cardinal axiom.By adding extra axioms and using special models, they aim to determine which axiom best aligns with the true structure theory of L(R)L(\mathbb{R})L(R) under ADL(R\mathbb{R}R).This method allows them to either settle undecided questions and reduce pluralism or show that these questions are "absolutely undecidable," supporting pluralism, depending on whether the answers converge or oscillate.A list of all of the topics we've discussed.ChatGPTCertainly, here's a list of the topics we've discussed:Overview of the Set-Theoretic MultiverseThe Multiverse View of Set TheoryTenable Multiverse Conceptions of TruthTruth ConstraintDefinability ConstraintThe Î© Conjecture and Its ImplicationsWoodin's Theorems (4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7)Local Case RevisitedCase for Â¬CH (Â¬Continuum Hypothesis)Theorem 5.1 (Woodin)Theorem 5.2 (Koellner and Woodin 1999)Theorem 5.3 (Woodin)Parallel Case for CH (Continuum Hypothesis)Theorem 5.4 (Woodin 1985)Theorem 5.5 (Koellner and Woodin 2009)Theorem 5.6 (Woodin)Theorem 5.7 (Woodin)Theorem 5.8 (Koellner and Woodin 2009)Conjecture 5.9Assessment of the Local ApproachesThe Ultimate Inner ModelThe Structure Theory of L(VÎ»+1)Is there anything specific you'd like to explore further or discuss in more detail?Not so detailed.
