Abstract 
Text-to-image diffusion models have attracted considerable interest due to their 
wide applicability across diverse i elds. However, challenges persist in creating 
controllable models for personalized object generation. In this paper, we i rst 
identify the entanglement issues in existing personalized generative models, and 
then propose a straightforward and eff i cient data augmentation training strategy that 
guides the diffusion model to focus solely on object identity. By inserting the plug- 
and-play adapter layers from a pre-trained controllable diffusion model, our model 
obtains the ability to control the location and size of each generated personalized 
object. During inference, we propose a regionally-guided sampling technique to 
maintain the quality and i delity of the generated images. Our method achieves 
comparable or superior i delity for personalized objects, yielding a robust, versatile, 
and controllable text-to-image diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic 
and personalized images. Our approach demonstrates signif i cant potential for 
various applications, such as those in art, entertainment, and advertising design. 
1Introduction 
The task of generating and manipulating photo-realistic images from textual descriptions has garnered 
signif i cant attention in recent years. Solutions to this problem offer a wide range of potential 
applications in art, advertising, entertainment, virtual reality, and more. Recently, diffusion models 
[27,8,28,18,21,23,25], together with cross-modal conditioning and large language models (e.g., 
CLIP [19] and T5-XXL [20]), have contributed signif i cant advancements to this area. 
While text-to-image diffusion models have signif i cantly advanced both image realism and broadened 
the conceptual scope of what can be generated, there are still ongoing challenges. In many practical 
applications, controllable models that can provide more i ne-grained control beyond textual descrip- 
tions are highly sought after. For example, the freedom to generate any object in any location within 
Preprint. Under review.

any scene is a desirable property. Such a model would enable a new degree of creative possibilities. 
For instance, advertisement designers could seamlessly position their products in any desired spot in 
an ad; likewise, an ordinary person could exhibit their most treasured toy in any location within the 
most prestigious showroom in Paris. 
Researchers have been working diligently to create such controllable diffusion models. One approach 
entails personalization, as seen in projects like Textual-Inversion [5], DreamBooth [24], and Custom 
Diffusion [12]. In these works, a pre-trained diffusion model is optimized or i ne-tuned with a new 
personalized visual concept based on a handful of images provided by a user, to connect the visual 
concept to a unique word identif i er. While these models can generate personalized items in any 
scene, they fall short in controlling the size and location of the generated objects. Another very 
recent research direction investigates localization-controllable diffusion models [14,33,37,17,9,1]. 
In particular, GLIGEN [14] integrates a new adapter layer into each Transformer block of a pre- 
trained diffusion model to achieve size and location control. Although GLIGEN can generate objects 
according to a user-specif i ed size and location information (e.g., provided by a bounding box or 
keypoints) and semantic category information provided via text, it cannot control the specif i c identity 
of the generated objects, rendering the model ineffective in dealing with personalized objects. 
To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose a method, PACGen (Personalized and Con- 
trollable Text-to-Image Generation), that combines the key advantages of both research directions, 
leading to a more robust, versatile, and controllable text-to-image diffusion model capable of generat- 
ing realistic and personalized images. We i rst show that personalization efforts like DreamBooth [24], 
in the process of learning object identity, undesirably also entangle object identity with object location 
and size due to limited variability and quantity in the provided training data (e.g., the provided users��� 
images are few and tend to be object-centric). This fundamental issue presents diff i culties for location 
and size control in personalized generative models. 
To address this issue, we propose a straightforward data augmentation technique. Specif i cally, when 
i netuning the pretrained diffusion model for personalization, we randomly resize and reposition 
the user provided training images in order to disentangle object identity from its size and location 
factors. During inference, we can simply plug in a pre-trained GLIGEN���s adapter layers to control 
the object���s size and location. This strategy enables PACGen to associate the word identif i er solely 
with the object���s identity and allows it to control its size and location without any further i netuning. 
However, we i nd that some undesirable artifacts (like collaging effects) can be introduced from data 
augmentation. We thus also introduce a regionally-guided sampling technique to ensure the overall 
quality and i delity of the generated images. 
In sum, our main contributions are: 1) we identify and propose a solution to the entanglement 
issues in existing personalization efforts; 2) a novel text-to-image diffusion model that provides both 
personalization and controllability; and 3) our quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that 
PACGen matches or exceeds the high i delity of existing personalized models, while also providing 
localization controllability which is lacking in existing personalized models.

The paper introduces PACGen (Personalized and Controllable Text-to-Image Generation), a method that combines the advantages of personalization and controllability in text-to-image diffusion models. The authors address the entanglement issues between object identity, size, and location in existing personalized generative models. They propose a data augmentation technique that disentangles object identity from size and location factors by randomly resizing and repositioning user-provided training images during fine-tuning.
To achieve controllability, the authors incorporate adapter layers from GLIGEN, a localization-controllable diffusion model, which allows for control over the size and location of generated objects. By associating the word identifier solely with the object's identity, PACGen can control the size and location without the need for further fine-tuning. However, data augmentation may introduce undesirable artifacts, so the authors introduce a regionally-guided sampling technique to ensure overall image quality and fidelity.
The main contributions of the paper include addressing the entanglement issues in personalized models, proposing a novel text-to-image diffusion model that provides both personalization and controllability, and demonstrating through quantitative and qualitative results that PACGen achieves high fidelity and localization controllability, surpassing existing personalized models.

2Related Work 
Text-to-Image Generation Models. Text-to-image generation has been an active research area for 
years, with initial focus on GAN [6]-based techniques [35,36,32,39]. However, these methods faced 
challenges when applied to general-domain datasets or scenes, in part to the training instabilities 
of GANs. Subsequent approaches like VQGAN [34], DALL-E [22], and CogView [4] integrated 
Transformers [29] to produce images with greater i delity. The recent emergence of diffusion 
models [27,8,28,23], capitalized on the power of cross-modal language-image representations such 
as CLIP [19] and large language models like T5-XXL [20], has facilitated signif i cant improvements 
in text-driven image generation and manipulation. Notable examples including GLIDE [18], DALL- 
E2 [21], Imagen [25], and Stable Diffusion [25]. Our work advances this line of work by providing 
both personalization and localization controllability to text-to-image generation models. 
Conditional Text-to-Image Diffusion Models. Observing that text-to-image methods lack precise 
control over the generated content, recent work has explored a variety of additional conditioning 
factors beyond text in text-to-image diffusion models. For example, GLIGEN [14], ControlNet [37], 
T2I-Adapter [17], and Composer [9] can condition the diffusion model on text as well as bounding 
boxes, poses, depth maps, edge maps, normal maps, and semantic masks. These works demonstrate a 
simple and effective approach to injecting the additional controlling information via a trainable plug- 
2 
and-play module without affecting the pre-trained diffusion model���s original capabilities. However, 
these methods lack the ability to control the subject identity for personalized image generation. 
Personalized and Controllable Image Generation. A key objective in image generation is to enable 
personalized and controllable manipulation. GAN Inversion [31] accomplishes this by converting 
a given image into a corresponding latent representation of a pretrained GAN [10,3]. In the realm 
of diffusion-based text-to-image models, DALL-E2 [21] has shown promise by mapping images 
into CLIP-based codes, though it struggles to capture unique details of personalized objects. Textual 
Inversion [5] inverts a user-provided image into a word vector for personalized image generation, 
demonstrating impressive l exibility of the textual embedding space. However, it falls short when 
tasked with rendering the same subject in new contexts [24]. In contrast to optimizing a word vector, 
DreamBooth [24] embeds and i netunes the given subject instance into the entire text-to-image 
diffusion model. Further, Custom Diffusion [12] composes multiple new concepts by optimizing 
only a small subset of weights in the diffusion model���s cross-attention layers. Despite these advances, 
maintaining semantic coherence while exerting i ne-grained control over the synthesized images 
still remains a complex challenge. Our work tackles this by introducing i ne-grained localization 
control from GLIGEN [14] into the customized i ne-tuning process of DreamBooth [24] to enable 
both personalized and controllable capabilities in text-to-image generation.

3Background on DreamBooth and GLIGEN 
In this section, we brief l y introduce two key components of our model, DreamBooth [24] and 
GLIGEN [14], and discuss their limitations, to motivate our work on combining their strengths for a 
more powerful text-to-image diffusion model that provides both personalization and controllability. 
3.1DreamBooth 
Personalization of text-to-image diffusion models has emerged as a hot topic in recent research. 
DreamBooth [24] is a notable contribution. It works by establishing a link between a personalized 
visual concept with a few (3-5) user images and an identif i er in the text vocabulary. To achieve this, 
DreamBooth employs a combination of a rare tokenV ���(e.g.,sks) 
together with the coarse category 
name (e.g., ���toy���), to represent the personalized concept. To incorporate the novel concept into a 
pretrained diffusion model, the model is i netuned with a prompt containing the concept (e.g.,a 
photo of a [sks] [class name]) using the regular denoising diffusion objective: 
min

(1) 
wheretis sampled from time steps{1,������ ,T},xtis 
the step-tnoisy variant of imagex, and 
f��(���,���,c) is the denoising network conditioned on text feature c. 
To mitigate language drift [13,16] and maintain output diversity, DreamBooth is trained to reconstruct 
other (generated) images of the same class as the personalized item for half of the training time. After 
adapting the pretrained model���s weights, DreamBooth can combine the personalized concept with 
the identif i er V ��� to generate new images, e.g., placing the personalized concept into new contexts. 
3.2GLIGEN 
Another line of topical research is investigating controllable generation in pretrained diffusion models. 
In particular, GLIGEN [14] enhances the functionality of text-to-image diffusion models by providing 
additional control through bounding boxes, keypoints, and other conditioning features. It does this 
by freezing all of the original weights of a pretrained diffusion model and inserting a new trainable 
adaptor, a self-attention layer that takes in the additional conditions, into each Transformer block: 
v = v + SelfAttn(v)(2) 
v = v + tanh(��) �� TS(SelfAttn([v,g]))(3) 
v = v + CrossAttn(v,c)(4) 
Eqs 2 and 4 represent the original diffusion model layers, wherevandcdenote the visual and 
text prompt tokens, respectively. Eq. 3 is the new trainable layer introduced by GLIGEN, withg 
representing the grounding tokens that contain additional controlling information, such as bounding 
boxes. The token selection operation,TS(��), 
considers only visual tokens, and��is a learnable scalar 
that acts like a gate (i.e., how much of the original pretrained model���s capabilities should be retained).

In this section, the paper provides background information on two key components: DreamBooth and GLIGEN.
DreamBooth: DreamBooth is a method for personalizing text-to-image diffusion models. It establishes a connection between a personalized visual concept and a few user images using a rare token (e.g., "sks") and the coarse category name (e.g., "toy"). The pretrained diffusion model is fine-tuned with a prompt containing the personalized concept, and the model is trained to reconstruct other images of the same class for output diversity. After adaptation, DreamBooth can generate new images by combining the personalized concept with an identifier.
GLIGEN: GLIGEN focuses on controllable generation in pretrained diffusion models. It enhances the functionality by introducing additional control through bounding boxes, keypoints, and other conditioning features. GLIGEN inserts a new trainable adaptor, a self-attention layer, into each Transformer block of the pretrained diffusion model. This new layer takes in additional conditions and modifies the original diffusion model layers to incorporate the control information.
The paper highlights the limitations of these components, with DreamBooth lacking precise control over size and location and GLIGEN lacking control over subject identity for personalized image generation.

4Approach 
While both DreamBooth and GLIGEN have brought signif i cant advances to text-to-image diffusion 
models, they possess certain limitations. Specif i cally, DreamBooth is capable of generating images 
that incorporate personalized concepts, but lacks the ability to control their precise location and size. 
On the other hand, GLIGEN offers greater control over object size and location, but cannot handle 
personalized objects. These limitations call for an approach which combines their strengths, enabling 
personalized object generation with controlled placement. 
In the ensuing, we i rst identify an issue with DreamBooth, namely that it entangles object identity 
with other factors like location and size. We then propose a simple remedy using data augmentation. 
Finally, to improve image quality and i delity, we propose a regionally-guided sampling technique. 
4.1DreamBooth Incorrectly Entangles Object Identity and Spatial Information 
To enable spatial control over personalized concepts, a straightforward but naive solution would 
be to plug in GLIGEN���s controllable layers into a pretrained DreamBooth model (this is possible 
when both GLIGEN and DreamBooth build upon the same diffusion model architecture, e.g., Stable 
Diffusion). For example, suppose DreamBooth is trained with the toy cat images in Fig. 2 with its 
learned unique identif i erV ��� = sks. During inference, the corresponding grounding tokengcan be 
computed by combining the text feature ofsks toy catand its locationlinto Eq. 5 to control its 
location using the pre-trained GLIGEN layers. 
Fig. 2 shows that when the specif i ed bounding box size and location roughly follow the size and 
location of the toy cat in the four user-provided training images, the generated images correctly 
contain the object identity (left). However, if the bounding box size and location fall outside the 
training distribution, the generated object���s identity can deviate signif i cantly from the original object 
(right). This suggests that DreamBooth not only learns the object���s identity but also its location 
and size within the training data; i.e., it overf i ts to the limited training data and incorrectly learns to 
entangle identity and spatial information. 4

Figure 3: By incorporating a data augmentation technique that involves aggressive random resizing 
and repositioning of training images, PACGen effectively disentangles object identity and spatial 
information in personalized image generation. 
To further substantiate this hypothesis, we create a toy dataset comprising four screwdriver images, 
all positioned on the left side of the image, as depicted in Fig. 4. Upon training DreamBooth on 
this dataset, we discover that the model can accurately generate the object identity only when the 
generated objects are situated in the same location as the training data. In other locations, DreamBooth 
generates a screwdriver that is different from that in the training data.

4.2Disentangling Identity and Spatial Information in Personalized Image Generation

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In this section, the paper addresses the limitations of DreamBooth and GLIGEN and proposes an approach that combines their strengths to enable personalized object generation with controlled placement.
DreamBooth, while capable of generating images with personalized concepts, lacks control over precise location and size. On the other hand, GLIGEN offers control over object size and location but cannot handle personalized objects. To overcome these limitations, the paper proposes a remedy that involves data augmentation to disentangle object identity from spatial information and a regionally-guided sampling technique to improve image quality and fidelity.
The paper identifies an issue with DreamBooth, where it learns to entangle object identity with spatial information during training. When attempting to control the location of a personalized object using GLIGEN's controllable layers, the generated object's identity may deviate significantly if the specified bounding box size and location fall outside the training distribution.
To address this, the paper proposes a data augmentation technique involving aggressive random resizing and repositioning of training images. This technique effectively disentangles object identity from spatial information in personalized image generation. By augmenting the training data, DreamBooth can focus solely on learning object identity without overfitting to the limited spatial information present in the training data.
To illustrate the effectiveness of this disentanglement approach, the paper provides visual examples showing the correct generation of object identity when the location matches the training distribution and the deviation when the location falls outside.

Figure 7: Our method offers versatile applications. It can generate objects at specif i ed locations in 
diverse scenes and artistic styles, and accessorize objects or modify their attributes with precision. 
Applications. Fig. 7 showcases various intriguing applications of PACGen. The Composition feature 
allows for the creation of multiple objects from user images with high i delity and the generation of 
additional objects (e.g., Eiffel Tower) with location control. The Art Style aspect enables art style 
changes for personalized objects while maintaining location control. Lastly, Accessorization and 
Attribute features facilitate the addition of accessories or the modif i cation of attributes (e.g., color) 
for personalized objects, allowing them to be freely positioned at any location within a scene. 
6Conclusion and Broader Impact 
We introduced a straightforward yet effective approach for addressing the entanglement issue in 
existing personalization diffusion models, and incorporated a inference-time sampling technique to 
ensure high-quality generation with location control. Nevertheless, our work has some limitations. 
We occasionally observed some attribute mixture in multi-concept cases; for example, the color of one 
object can blend into another object. Our method takes more time for inference due to two additional 
prompts (psuppressandpdiversity) in the diffusion process, with the inference time increasing from 5 
to 8 seconds per image on an A6000 GPU. 
This project aims to provide users with a tool for controllable synthesis of personalized subjects in 
various contexts, offering improved location control. However, the potential misuse of generated 
images by bad actors remains a concern. Future research should continue to address these issues in 
generative modeling and personalized generative priors.

In the conclusion, the paper highlights the effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing the entanglement issue in existing personalized diffusion models and ensuring high-quality generation with location control. However, the authors acknowledge some limitations. There may be occasional attribute mixture in multi-concept cases, where the color of one object blends into another. The inference time of the method is slightly increased due to additional prompts in the diffusion process.
The paper emphasizes the aim of providing users with a controllable tool for synthesizing personalized subjects in various contexts with improved location control. However, the potential misuse of generated images by malicious users is a concern. The authors suggest that future research should continue to address ethical considerations and potential challenges in generative modeling and personalized generative priors.
