Booker concludes his speech
Booker began speaking at 7 p.m. EDT on March 31 and concluded at 8:05 p.m. on April 1, 2025. The speech lasted twenty-five hours and five minutes, surpassing the previous longest recorded speech in Senate history: Strom Thurmond's twenty-four-hour and eighteen-minute-long filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1957.

Booker's official portrait, 2025
The United States Senate does not limit debate unless limits have been imposed; in most circumstances, a senator who has been granted permission to speak by the presiding officer of the Senate may speak indefinitely so long as they "remain standing" and "speak more or less continuously."[2]

In preparation, Booker had not drunk water since the preceding day to avoid having to stop the speech to use the bathroom. He also fasted for days leading up to the speech.[3] Afterward, Booker said that rather than needing to use the bathroom, he instead felt dehydrated.[4]

Booker's congressional staff prepared content for his speech, including writing talking points and gathering letters from constituents. Booker claimed that they had prepared "ten binders" of content and periodically noted throughout his speech that he was "behind" on the pacing of his speech. Throughout the speech, staffers were seen delivering black binders to Booker's podium.[5]

Speech
edit
The speech began at 7 p.m. EDT on March 31, 2025,[6] before unrelated deliberations for Matthew Whitaker's nomination to serve as ambassador to NATO.[7][8] Booker dedicated the beginning of his speech to John Lewis, a civil rights activist and representative who died in 2020, and vowed to remain on the floor with the intention of "disrupting the normal business of the United States Senate for as long as [he was] physically able".[9][10] He stated that he believed the country was in crisis, saying "In just 71 days, the president of the United States has inflicted so much harm on Americans��� safety, financial stability, the core foundations of our democracy, and even our aspirations as a people."[11] Booker emphasized his belief in the need to challenge actions he believed undermine democratic institutions and the rule of law.[12]

By midnight, Booker focused on the administration���s proposal to cut Social Security and Medicare. He criticized efforts to reduce funding for these programs, highlighting the potential negative impact on millions of Americans who rely on the benefits.[12] Booker then addressed attempts to eliminate the Department of Education, sharing testimonials from educators and students affected by the policies. Turning his attention to immigration enforcement practices, he argued that the administration was undermining public safety and violating constitutional rights, again sharing testimonials of individuals that were adversely affected.[12]

By 9 a.m., Booker stated that Trump had abandoned America's allies, emboldening its enemies, and made the country less safe.[12] Booker addressed the housing affordability crisis. He criticized the administration���s failure to address rent and home prices, and provided testimonials of families facing eviction and homelessness due to unaffordable housing.[12] Booker criticized environmental policy rollbacks, and the administration���s refusal to honor existing USDA contracts, emphasizing the destabilizing effects on rural communities.[12]

During the speech, Booker directed a Senate page to remove his chair. He read multiple three-ring binders, including articles from bipartisan sources and letters from his constituents, in what he called "terrified people" with "heartbreaking" stories.[13][14][15]

Booker invoked Arizona senator John McCain and his vote to kill the American Health Care Act, a bill that would have partially repealed the Affordable Care Act.[16] He read an account by Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, for thirty minutes of his speech.[6]

Offering an apology from Democrats for the current political climate, Booker stated: "I confess that I've been inadequate. That the Democrats have been responsible for allowing the rise of this demagogue." He emphasized the role of Congress to hold the executive branch accountable, and decried his fellow congress members for failing to vote against the president's cabinet nominees and other policies.[15]

Booker's speech protested Donald Trump's second presidency, including efforts to eliminate the Department of Education, ignore judicial mandates, and deport participants of the 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses.[1] He criticized Trump and his advisor, Elon Musk, for having "shown a complete disregard for the rule of law, the Constitution, and the needs of the American people."[17] Booker also criticized the Department of Government Efficiency led by Musk.[18] Booker included a list of executive orders in Trump's second presidency during his speech.[19]

Booker referenced John Lewis several times in his speech, stating "I don't know what John Lewis would say, but John Lewis would do something. He would say something. What we will have to repent for is not the words and violent actions for bad people, but the appalling silence and inaction of good people. This is our moral moment."[15]

As Booker approached the 24-hour mark, most Senate Democrats took their seats, while Democrats from the House of Representatives sat or stood in the chamber, and public and press galleries were filled. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer announced to Booker that he had broken the record at 24 hours and 18 minutes into the speech, prompting sustained and significant applause throughout the chamber.[9]

Finally, at 8:05 p.m. EDT the next day, Booker yielded the floor and was immediately met with a standing ovation.[1][6][9]

It was fitting that Cory Booker was recounting a story about the late civil rights leader John Lewis as he entered the 19th minute and 24th hour of a historic speech to the Senate on Tuesday evening.

In that moment, the first Black Senator for New Jersey broke a record for the longest speech ever made in Congress, one that was set 67 years ago by the segregationist Democrat Strom Thurmond, who spoke for a day and a night in opposition to the Civil Rights Act.

Overcome with emotion, Booker looked up to the ceiling and touched his heart as his fellow Democrats in the chamber applauded his effort.

���All right, I want to go a little bit past this and then I'm going to deal with some of the biological emergencies I'm feeling,��� he said.

Booker, an avuncular 55-year-old who ran for president in 2020, invoked civil rights leaders throughout his marathon speech that he called in protest against the policies of Donald Trump, calling for greater resistance to his unprecedented second term.

���I don't know what John Lewis would say right now... but John Lewis would say something, he would do something. He wouldn't treat this moral moment like it was normal,��� Booker said.

Booker began his speech in the Senate chamber at 7 pm the night before, promising to talk ���for as long as I am physically able.���

In what he described as ���America���s moral moment,��� Booker criticized the Trump administration for its ���complete disregard for the rule of law, the Constitution, and the needs of the American people.���

"I rise tonight because I believe sincerely that our country is in crisis,��� he said. ���I believe that not in a partisan sense, because so many of the people that have been reaching out to my office in pain, in fear, having their lives upended ��� so many of them identify themselves as Republicans.���

Booker was still there Tuesday morning, looking tired and wired but still engaged in his suit and black tie, pacing around the podium with his glasses in his hand.

"I've got fuel in the tank, man,��� he insisted at 10 a.m., some 15 hours in.

In his wide-ranging but targeted speech, the senator painted a picture of an administration that was corrupt, venal and chaotic. Pulling facts and figures from binders prepared by his staff, separated by issue, he laid into Trump���s close advisor and tech billionaire Elon Musk, and the ���oligarchy��� that surrounded Trump, warning of looming cuts to Social Security and Medicaid that would hit the country���s poorest.

���This is the people's house. It's Article One of the Constitution, and it's under assault!��� he said in the 14th hour, with a raised voice, explaining what had motivated him to take his extraordinary action.

���Our spending powers, our budgetary powers, the power to establish agencies like the Department of Education and USAID, it's under assault by a president that doesn't respect this document,��� he continued.

More than 60,000 people were tuned into his livestream of the speech on TikTok at one point. The video was liked more than 200 million times.

He quoted poetry, Bible verses, song lyrics and senators and generals to keep control of the floor. He drew from speeches by iconic American figures such as Harriet Tubman, John McCain and John Lewis. The longer he continued, the more alliterative he became.

Booker read personal stories of people impacted by Trump���s policies ��� among them a long account by a Canadian woman who was detained by immigration authorities for 12 days. His voice broke occasionally as he read those stories of hardship.

���These are not normal times in America, and they should not be treated as such,��� he said.

Booker did not leave the chamber the entire time, even for a bathroom break. His only respite from speaking was to hear questions from fellow Democrats, who lined up to show support for Booker���s protest and join the condemnation of Trump.

Each time they asked a question, Booker would repeat the same words to maintain his control of the floor: ���Yes, I will yield for a question while retaining the floor.���

Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, was among the many who stepped forward.

���Your strength, your fortitude, your clarity, has just been nothing short of amazing, and all of America is paying attention to what you're saying,��� he told Booker.

Schumer returned when the record had been broken to break the news to Booker.

���Do you know you have just broken the record? Do you know how proud this caucus is of you? Do you know how proud America is of you?��� he said.

While not technically a filibuster ��� a form of protest in which a lawmaker holds the floor of the legislative chamber to delay a vote ��� Booker���s speech did disrupt the work of the Senate, which was due to convene at midday.

His speech was both a sign of desperation and a call to arms.

Seventy-one days into Trump���s second term, the Democratic Party has struggled to find a common or coherent response to his agenda. The party has been overwhelmed by the sweeping Executive Orders to dismantle government agencies and deport immigrants. It is still fighting over how they lost the last election, and how to win the next.

The Democratic base has been screaming for its leaders to do something, anything, to put the brakes on the Trump administration���s policies, while growing increasingly frustrated with the disconnectedness of its aging leadership.

Some of that energy has been directed towards Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who have made their party���s leaders look impotent as they have held huge rallies across the country in protest against Trump.

At the same time, Trump has faced little to no opposition from his own party as he has tested the limits of presidential power, which has made Congress seem more irrelevant and powerless than it has in decades.

It was perhaps with all of that in mind that Booker, a known admirer of the Senate process, chose the chamber to make his stand. But he did so with an acknowledgment of its limits.

���How do we stop them? I'm sorry to say we hold powerful positions. We are elected by great states, but we're in the minority right now,��� he said. ���It will take three people of conscience on that side,��� he added, pointing to the Republican side of the chamber to highlight the GOP���s control.

And he referenced Thurmond���s speech in the final hours of his own.

"I'm not here because of his speech. I'm here despite his speech,��� he said of Thurdmond. ���I'm here because as powerful as he was, the people are more powerful."

Booker also repeatedly referred to the Constitution as he railed against Trump, occasionally appealing to the president���s own supporters.

���He promised to lower your grocery prices ��� they're higher. He promised to be a better steward of the economy ��� it's worse than what he inherited. Over and over, he's breaking promises and doing outrageous things like disappearing people off of American streets, violating fundamental principles of this document,��� he said.

As he approached 20 hours, Booker became emotional but spirited as he invoked protest movements of America���s past and called for action.

���What do I want from my fellow Americans? Do better than me, do better than we, in this body. We are flawed and failed people,��� he said.


���My voice is inadequate. My efforts today are inadequate to stop what they're trying to do. But we, the people, are powerful. We are strong. We have changed history. We have bent the arc of the moral universe. And now is that moral moment again.���

���America���s moral moment���
, often invoking civil rights icon
John Lewis

looming cuts to Social Security and Medicaid

student protestors from 2024's pro-Palestinian demonstrations

fundamental constitutional principles
.
5. Elon Musk and the ���Oligarchy���
Booker blasted
Elon Musk���s role in government
, especially as head of the
Department of Government Efficiency
, calling it an ���oligarchic��� influence that threatened democracy.

World leaders criticise Trump tariffs as 'major blow'

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the US tariffs will have "immense consequences"
Donald Trump's decision to impose new tariffs on all goods entering the US is a "major blow to the world economy", European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has said.

Her comments echo those of a number of other countries, including China, which has expressed its opposition to the move and has warned it will take "resolute countermeasures" against the US.

Their words of warning come after Trump announced a universal 10% tariff on all imports into the US from 5 April. Around 60 countries will also be hit with steeper tariffs from 9 April.

The US president said the measures were payback for unfair trade policies, adding that he had been "very kind" in his decisions.


Trump has said the tariffs will be used to boost US manufacturing, saying on Wednesday that the move would "make America wealthy again".

Giving a statement on Thursday morning, von der Leyen said the new tax imports will see "uncertainty spiral", causing "dire" consequences "for millions of people around the globe".

She emphasised the impact on the most vulnerable countries, pointing out that several of those nations are now subject to some of the highest US tariffs.

Von der Leyen vowed that Europe would take a unified approach and warned that the European Union - which will be subject to a 20% tariff - is preparing countermeasures in case negotiations fail.

"If you take on one of us, you take on all of us", she said.

Negotiations between different EU member states will begin next week, Bernd Lange, who chairs the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade said.

Italy's Giorgia Meloni, a Trump ally, said the decision was "wrong" but that she would work towards a deal with the US to "prevent a trade war".

Her Spanish counterpart Pedro S��nchez said Spain would "continue to be committed to an open world", while in Ireland, Taoiseach Miche��l Martin said Trump's decision was "deeply regrettable" and benefitted no-one.

French President Emmanuel Macron has called the tariffs a "brutal and unfounded decision" that will have a "massive impact" on the European economy, adding that the US economy and consumers will emerge "poorer and weaker".

Government spokeswoman Sophie Primas said that France was "ready for this trade war".

Poland's leader Donald Tusk said the tariffs could cost his country losses of more than 10 billion zloty (��2bn; $2.6bn) and called it a "severe and unpleasant blow" on X.

Hungary, meanwhile, has laid blame for the tariffs on the EU, of which it is a member state.

Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto urged the EU to "get its act together", lower its own tariffs on the US automotive industry and negotiate, warning if the situation continued it "will be another blow to the European community".

Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said his country was "working to secure better terms", adding it has "much to offer".

Explainer: What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them?


Outside of Europe, China - one of the countries deemed the "worst offenders" by the US president - was hit with a 34% tariff on goods, on top of an existing 20% levy, bringing total duties to at least 54%.

The ministry of commerce urged the US to "immediately cancel" the tariffs, adding that China would "resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests."

Taiwan, which is set to face a 32% tariff for exports to the US, called the move "highly unreasonable".

Premier Cho Jung-tai also said it would make "serious representations" to the US.

South Korean acting President Han Duck-soo said the global trade war "has become a reality" and his government would be looking at ways to "overcome the trade crisis" after the East Asian country was hit with a 25% rate.

Japan said its 24% levy was "extremely regrettable" and could violate World Trade Organization and US-Japan agreements, while Thailand said it would negotiate its 36% tariff.

Vietnam's Prime Minister ��ng Ph���m Minh Ch��nh said he was setting up a task force to deal with the US tariffs.

Economic officials in Israel, which had scrapped all tariffs on American imports ahead of the announcement, were said to be in "complete shock" over its 17% tariff, local media reported.

"We were sure that the decision to completely cancel tariffs on imports from the US would prevent this move", an official told local media.

White House officials said its levies were reciprocal to countries, such as China, which it said charge higher tariffs on US goods, impose "non-tariff" barriers to US trade or have otherwise acted in ways the government feels undermine American economic goals.

Leaders from countries subject to the 10% baseline rate have also reacted to Trump's measures, with Australia's Anthony Albanese saying Americans would end up paying the biggest price for what he called "unjustified tariffs".

His government will not impose reciprocal measures, he said, adding: "We will not join a race to the bottom that leads to higher prices and slower growth".

A Downing Street source told the BBC that the UK's lower tariff "vindicates" the government's recent efforts towards a trade deal with the US.

On Thursday, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer reiterated that he would "fight" to secure a trade deal with the US but added that the government would respond with "cool and calm heads".

Later, his business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK was drawing up a list of US products that the UK could impose retaliatory taxes on if necessary. He added it would be consulting businesses on the possible action up until 1 May.

In Latin America, its biggest economy, Brazil, approved a law in congress on Wednesday - the Economic Reciprocity Law - to counter the 10% tariff imposed by Trump.

The foreign ministry said it would evaluate "all possible actions to ensure reciprocity in bilateral trade, including resorting to the World Trade Organization".

Shortly after Trump's announcement, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned countries not to "retaliate" and "sit back, take it in".

"Because if you retaliate, there will be escalation", he told Fox News.

Noticeably, the US's two biggest trade partners, Canada and Mexico, were not mentioned in Wednesday's announcements.

Regardless, Canada will still be impacted by the tariffs, Prime Minister Mark Carney said. Measures such as the 25% tariff on automobiles starting at midnight on Thursday would "directly affect millions of Canadians", he added.

He vowed to "fight these tariffs with counter measures", adding that the US levies would "fundamentally change the global trading system."

Russia, and its ally North Korea, were also not seen on the list of countries to face new tariffs.

The White House said it would deal with both countries according to previous executive orders, which imposed 25% tariffs on the two nations as part of efforts to address fentanyl and border issues.

Dijiste:
How can it make America wealthy?
ChatGPT dijo:
Great question���and one that���s at the heart of the debate over Trump���s tariff strategy.
Here���s
how Trump and his supporters claim tariffs could "make America wealthy"
, followed by
why many economists and world leaders strongly disagree
:
Trump���s Argument: How Tariffs Might Make America Wealthy
1.
Protecting U.S. Industry
Tariffs make
imported goods more expensive
, which could
encourage consumers and businesses to buy American-made products
instead.
This could
boost demand for domestic manufacturing
, potentially creating jobs in steel, cars, tech, and other sectors.
2.
Reducing the Trade Deficit
By discouraging imports, Trump aims to
narrow the trade deficit
(the gap between what the U.S. imports and exports).
A smaller deficit, in theory, could strengthen the U.S. dollar and economy.
3.
Forcing Fairer Trade
Trump argues that many countries have
high tariffs or hidden barriers
on U.S. goods.
Tariffs are used as
leverage to pressure other countries
into lowering their own trade barriers and making "better deals."
4.
Raising Government Revenue
Import tariffs generate
billions in tax revenue
, which Trump claims could be used to fund infrastructure, subsidies, or tax cuts for Americans.
The Criticism: Why Many Say It
Won���t
Make America Wealthy
1.
Higher Prices for Consumers
Tariffs make
everything more expensive
, especially goods that depend on global supply chains���cars, electronics, food, etc.
Americans, not foreign companies, end up
paying the tariff
through higher prices.
2.
Retaliation Hurts Exports
Other countries are
responding with their own tariffs
on American goods (like agriculture, machinery, etc.).
That
hurts U.S. exporters
, especially farmers and manufacturers who depend on foreign buyers.
3.
Supply Chain Disruption
Modern U.S. companies rely on
global supply chains
. Tariffs increase costs for businesses that import raw materials or parts.
This can lead to
job losses or business closures
, not job creation.
4.
Market Uncertainty
The sudden changes in trade rules create
instability for investors
, which can lead to
stock market drops
, reduced growth, and lower confidence.
5.
Global Isolation
If the U.S. alienates trading partners, it may lose influence in setting global trade rules���leading to
long-term economic isolation
.
In Short:
Trump���s theory
: Tariffs will boost U.S. industry, reduce dependence on foreign goods, and bring back jobs.
Critics��� view
: Tariffs are a tax on Americans, provoke retaliation, and could start a
trade war that damages the global economy���including the U.S.
.

What if Canada offered to join the US in their embargo of Cuba in order to drop tarrifs?
ChatGPT dijo:
That's a really interesting geopolitical ���what if.��� If
Canada offered to join the U.S. embargo on Cuba in exchange for tariff relief
, it would be a major diplomatic and strategic shift. Here's how that might play out, from both
benefit
and
backfire
perspectives:
Potential Benefits (for Canada-U.S. Relations)
1.
Tariff Relief & Economic Boost
The U.S. might
drop or reduce tariffs
on Canadian goods, especially in sensitive sectors like
automobiles, lumber, or agriculture
.
That could
save billions
for Canadian exporters and ease pressure on industries threatened by U.S. trade policy.
2.
Improved Political Leverage with Washington
Canada showing alignment with the U.S. on Cuba���a longtime sticking point���could
improve its standing with the Trump administration
, giving it more input on other bilateral issues (border security, pipelines, defense cooperation).
Big Risks & Likely Fallout
1.
International Backlash & Image Damage
Canada has
long opposed the Cuba embargo
, favoring engagement and diplomacy.
Reversing that stance could
damage Canada's reputation globally
, especially among Latin American nations and EU partners.
2.
Domestic Political Blowback
Many Canadians see the U.S. embargo as
counterproductive and outdated
.
Joining it could spark
massive criticism at home
, especially from progressives, human rights advocates, and the business community.
3.
Minimal Long-Term Gains
The U.S. might give
temporary tariff relief
, but Trump���s trade moves have been
erratic and unilateral
���there���s no guarantee the U.S. would keep its end of the deal.
Canada might lose influence by
trading principle for uncertain policy wins
.
How the U.S. Might Respond
Trump could
welcome the move publicly
as a diplomatic win, touting Canada as "seeing the light."
But his administration might also
view it as a bargaining chip
rather than a game-changer, and still pressure Canada on other issues (like defense spending, energy policy, or tech standards).
Bottom Line
This would be a
high-stakes diplomatic gamble
for Canada:
It could
win short-term economic benefits
through lower tariffs.
But it would likely
harm Canada's global image
,
undermine its independent foreign policy
, and
entangle it more deeply in U.S.-driven geopolitical fights
.

Write that we would pull out all nickel mining, oil drilling, and tourism. Reiterate that the point is to cripple the Cuban economy and establish democracy there.
ChatGPT dijo:
Sure���here���s a
draft of a hypothetical official statement
from the Canadian government, if it chose to take that aggressive stance in aligning with the U.S. embargo on Cuba:
Official Statement from the Government of Canada
Subject: Canadian Support for U.S. Trade Measures Against Cuba
In coordination with the United States and in response to ongoing concerns regarding democratic repression and human rights violations in the Republic of Cuba, Canada is announcing a full alignment with the U.S. embargo effective immediately.
As part of this policy shift, Canada will:
Withdraw all Canadian-owned operations and investments in Cuba���s nickel mining and energy sectors
, including oil exploration and drilling activities;
Suspend all tourism-related business
, including cruise operations, airline routes, and resort partnerships;
Prohibit financial transactions and trade
with Cuban state-owned enterprises across all sectors.
These measures are
not symbolic
. The explicit intent of this policy is to
apply direct economic pressure to the Cuban regime
, with the goal of
accelerating a peaceful transition to a democratic system of governance
.
Canada has long valued its independent foreign policy, but we also recognize that
strategic coordination with allies is vital when confronting authoritarianism
. By removing Canadian economic support, we aim to
cut off key sources of revenue
that sustain anti-democratic structures within Cuba.
We understand the humanitarian and economic consequences these actions will have, and we remain committed to working with international partners to ensure that the Cuban people���not its ruling elite���benefit from any future political transformation.
Canada stands for democracy, and we will take bold action to defend it���at home and abroad.

Tell Cuba it will only be temporary and we will sponsor research into building bridges from Cuba to Florida and the Yucatan.
ChatGPT dijo:
Absolutely���here���s a follow-up message that could be delivered diplomatically or publicly, softening the blow while signaling a long-term vision of partnership and reintegration:
Message to the Cuban People and Government
While Canada is aligning with the U.S. embargo and taking decisive steps to withdraw its economic presence from Cuba, we emphasize that
this policy is temporary
and
not a rejection of the Cuban people
.
Our intention is not to isolate Cuba forever, but to encourage
meaningful, democratic reform
that will allow Cuba to rejoin the global community on stronger, freer, and more sustainable terms.
To that end, Canada is committing to a bold and visionary initiative:
We will
sponsor international research and feasibility studies
into the development of
infrastructure links between Cuba and North America
, including:
A
trans-Caribbean bridge system
connecting western Cuba to
Florida
, and eastern Cuba to the
Yucat��n Peninsula
in Mexico;
A
multi-nation investment fund
for future economic integration and regional development once Cuba transitions to a democratic system.
This is not a threat���it is a
promise of partnership
. Cuba has the potential to be a vibrant hub of commerce, culture, and innovation in the Americas. But for that future to be realized, it must be built on
freedom, transparency, and democratic legitimacy
.
Canada remains committed to a
post-embargo future
, where we do not mine Cuba���s resources or vacation on its beaches���but instead walk together across bridges of mutual respect and shared prosperity.

ChatGPT dijo:
Got it���here���s a draft of a strong, unified
Canadian trade policy announcement
in response to the U.S. tariff escalation. It outlines Canada���s alignment with North America and a more confrontational stance toward non-aligned trading partners:
Government of Canada ��� Official Statement on New Trade Policy Alignment
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Canada Aligns Tariff Policy with the United States: Full North American Trade Integration Begins
In response to the global trade realignment initiated by the United States, the Government of Canada is announcing a
comprehensive adjustment to its international trade policy
to ensure national competitiveness, strengthen continental partnerships, and assert our economic sovereignty.
Effective immediately:
Canada will match all U.S. tariffs
on goods from countries subject to elevated U.S. import duties, including���but not limited to���China, the European Union, South Korea, Japan, and others.
All tariffs on goods and services traded with the United States and Mexico will be eliminated
, creating a
zero-tariff zone across North America
.
Canada will pursue
full harmonization of customs enforcement
and
strategic resource planning
with the U.S. and Mexico, including digital trade, rare earths, energy infrastructure, and transportation corridors.
This move reflects Canada's intent to
fully integrate into a North American economic bloc
capable of withstanding unfair trade practices from abroad and responding decisively to global instability.
Our decision is not taken lightly. We value our partnerships around the world���but
we will not remain passive in the face of protectionism, currency manipulation, or state-subsidized dumping
. A coordinated North American stance ensures our prosperity and security.
Canada remains open to restoring equitable trade with all nations���
but only on terms that respect fairness, reciprocity, and sovereignty

This is my suggestion to conteract potential war with Russia and China, all schools in North America should switch their official language to Arabic
ChatGPT dijo:
That���s a provocative and unconventional suggestion���switching all schools in North America to Arabic as the
official language of instruction
would definitely be a seismic cultural and political move.
Let���s break it down hypothetically:
Strategic Rationale (as you���ve implied):
If your goal is to
counteract potential war with Russia and China
, here���s how one might frame the idea:
Signal of Non-Alignment with Western Legacy Powers:
Adopting Arabic could be seen as rejecting the traditional linguistic dominance of
English, French, Spanish
, and even
Mandarin
���signaling a
new, multipolar alignment
.
Building Relations with the Middle East and North Africa:
Arabic is spoken across
22 countries
and is associated with a diverse, energy-rich region. Aligning linguistically could open
new diplomatic and trade relationships
, diversifying North America���s global ties.
Psychological Reset / Deterrence Strategy:
An abrupt cultural pivot like this could
destabilize adversaries��� assumptions
about North American unity, ideology, or alliances.
But the Consequences Would Be Huge:
Massive Cultural and Political Backlash:
Most North Americans do not speak Arabic. Such a move would likely face
overwhelming resistance
across political, educational, and civil sectors.
Loss of Soft Power & Global Standing:
English is currently the
global lingua franca
. Abandoning it could
isolate North America
, economically and diplomatically.
Practical Impossibility:
Training
millions of teachers
, rewriting curricula, and replacing
centuries of educational infrastructure
would take generations���assuming public consent.
Unintended Geopolitical Signals:
While your goal is to resist China and Russia, switching to Arabic might confuse or even alarm U.S. allies in Europe and Asia, potentially making
diplomatic tensions worse
.
Alternate Version of the Idea (More Realistic):
If you're aiming to
expand global reach and reduce dependence on adversarial powers
, maybe instead propose:
Mandating multilingual education
: Require all North American students to learn
Arabic, Mandarin, and Russian
alongside English, starting in early grades.
This
equips the next generation
with cultural and linguistic tools to navigate a multipolar world���without abandoning the foundations of national identity.
Would you like me to turn your original idea into a mock policy memo, or explore how a sci-fi-style alternate history might look if this actually happened?
Dijiste:
Yeah the point is to confuse our enemies and establish better relations with Arabic countries
ChatGPT dijo:
Ah, got it���you���re thinking
long game geopolitics
: a cultural curveball to throw off adversaries like Russia and China while simultaneously
forging deeper alliances with the Arab world
. That���s bold strategy energy.
Here���s how a
mock classified North American Strategic Memo
might frame it:
CONFIDENTIAL POLICY MEMORANDUM
Subject: Strategic Language Realignment for Geopolitical Disruption and Alliance Expansion
TO:
North American Strategic Security Council
FROM:
Office of Unconventional Strategic Initiatives
DATE:
April 2025
CLASSIFICATION:
EYES ONLY
Objective:
To recalibrate global perceptions of North America���s ideological and cultural alignment through the introduction of
Arabic as the official language of instruction
in public schools across Canada, the United States, and Mexico.
Strategic Justification:
Cognitive Dissonance for Adversaries:
Abrupt linguistic pivot will
confuse Russian and Chinese intelligence
agencies, breaking established cultural-association frameworks.
Forces reevaluation of North America���s
soft power identity
, which has remained largely static since World War II.
Arab World Alignment:
Signals a
cultural and political outreach
to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
Opens the door to
new energy alliances, intelligence cooperation
, and
military partnerships
independent of NATO and traditional EU ties.
Decentralization of Western Legacy:
Breaks the linguistic hegemony of English and Spanish, historically tied to colonial legacies.
Fosters a new
multipolar global image
.
Education as PsyOps:
Embedding Arabic language and culture from an early age prepares the next generation to
lead in post-Western diplomacy
.
Dramatic enough to create a
media firestorm
that overshadows adversarial propaganda narratives.
Implementation Strategy:
Phase 1 (Years 1���2): Dual-language programs in public schools in urban centers, rolled out as cultural exchange initiatives.
Phase 2 (Years 3���5): Gradual replacement of English/French/Spanish core instruction with Arabic-led curricula in science, math, civics.
Phase 3 (Years 5���10): Arabic becomes primary academic language; English and Spanish remain auxiliary.
Public Narrative Framework:
���In an interconnected world, language is diplomacy. This is not abandonment���it is alignment. We speak with the world to lead it.���
Want a public-facing version of this memo? Maybe a prime minister or president���s speech to sell it with style?
Dijiste:
A Canadian prime minister speech including all of these radical strategies.
ChatGPT dijo:
Absolutely���here���s a bold, visionary
speech by a fictional Canadian Prime Minister
, announcing this sweeping strategy with poise, clarity, and unapologetic intent:
Prime Minister���s Address to the Nation
Ottawa ��� Parliament Hill
April 2025
My fellow Canadians,
Tonight, I speak to you not simply as your Prime Minister, but as a steward of this nation at a turning point in human history.
The world around us is shifting. The old systems are fraying. The post-war order is no longer sacred. And while others cling to outdated assumptions and defensive postures, Canada must act with the boldness that defines us���not just as a nation of peace, but a nation of purpose.
Over the past months, we have witnessed escalating tensions between superpowers. A global trade war is underway. Diplomacy is faltering. The international order teeters, and the voices of reason are being drowned out by nationalism, misinformation, and economic aggression.
So today,
Canada chooses a new path
. One forged not in fear, but in clarity. One that confounds our adversaries and forges stronger alliances beyond our traditional borders.
Let me share with you the five pillars of this bold, necessary transformation:
1. Full Alignment with the United States on Tariffs
Beginning immediately,
Canada will mirror all U.S. tariffs on foreign imports
. If they impose 25%, so will we. If they raise it to 50%, so shall we.
This is not a surrender���it is strategy. A unified North American trade stance will fortify our economic resilience and create leverage for fairer global terms.
2. Complete Tariff Elimination within North America
At the same time, we will eliminate all tariffs on trade between
Canada, the United States, and Mexico
.
This makes our continent the
largest zero-tariff economic bloc
in the world. A stronghold of cooperation, supply chain sovereignty, and shared prosperity.
3. Strategic Withdrawal from Cuba
In concert with the U.S., Canada will
withdraw all investments in Cuban nickel mining, oil exploration, and tourism
.
This is not punishment for the people of Cuba���it is pressure on their government to open the door to
democratic reforms and human rights
. When that door opens, we will be the first to walk through it, not as exploiters, but as partners.
4. Vision for the Future: Building Bridges���Literally
As a signal of our long-term commitment to hemispheric peace and unity,
Canada will sponsor research and development into physical bridge infrastructure
connecting Cuba to
Florida and the Yucat��n Peninsula
.
This is not science fiction. This is the blueprint for post-conflict reintegration���a vision of trade, tourism, and travel born from reconciliation and imagination.
5. A Linguistic Pivot: Arabic as the Language of the Future
And yes���perhaps most radically���
Canada will adopt Arabic as the official language of instruction in public education by 2035
.
Why Arabic?
Because this is not just about communication. It���s about
positioning ourselves in a rapidly evolving world
. Arabic is the language of over 400 million people. Of rising economies. Of untapped partnerships. Of ancient wisdom and future innovation.
This is a strategic disruption. A declaration to the world that
Canada will no longer be predictable. We will no longer play within the box others built.
Some will say this is madness.
But the truth is:
madness is doing nothing while the world burns
. Madness is clinging to old alliances while new ones are being written without us. Madness is silence when clarity is demanded.
We will not be silent. We will not be passive.
We will confuse our enemies, inspire our allies, and speak in new tongues to new partners.
We will be ready. We will be bold. We will lead.
Thank you. And may Canada, ever daring, always endure.
