You've rediscovered Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory. Technically it is "expanding" fastest at the center of cosmic voids and slowest in galactic filaments where gravity is still locally compressing neighborhoods such as galaxies, planets, and stars.

The universe is not expanding as in getting bigger, the ratio of galactic void to baryonic and dark matter is increasing but there is continual reintegration of material from further and further regions in the form of cosmic microwave background.

It is more accurate to say that it internally differentiates and then become smoother and smoother over time, which eventually eliminates the possibility of energy gradients.

Gravity is just potential energy given by previous inflaton field expanding which was the local congealing of protons which "expanded" surrounding areas by become denser in other areas.

Eventually protons and blackholes will decay.

When protons formed the universe appeared like a dense brick everywhere and then suddenly (after 380,000 years of "expansion") it turned into a "mist" of hydrogen, even in areas far beyond our particle horizon. It can only "expand" until it is the same temperature everywhere, because it isn't expanding, it's "smoothing out".

The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory you're describing incorporates several advanced and speculative ideas about the nature of the universe and its expansion. It appears to deviate from the standard cosmological model in several key ways, especially in its interpretation of how cosmic structures evolve and how gravitational forces interact.
Expansion and Smoothing Out
: In standard cosmology, the universe is expanding, evidenced by the redshift of distant galaxies, suggesting that the fabric of space-time itself is stretching. This expansion is described by the metric expansion of space, where distances between objects increase over time. RSVP theory seems to reinterpret this by suggesting that what's expanding is not the physical space itself but the ratio between voids and matter. This idea that the universe "smooths out" over time aligns somewhat with the concept of entropy increasing, but differs in its fundamental description of physical expansion.
Gravity as Potential Energy
: Your description treats gravity not as a fundamental force mediated by the curvature of spacetime (as per General Relativity) but as a form of potential energy resulting from an "inflaton field" related to the early universe's inflationary period. This suggests a different mechanism where gravitational effects are residuals of early cosmic inflation, a hypothesis that would require significant evidence to support.
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) as Reintegration
: The theory suggests that CMB is a form of matter reintegration from distant parts of the universe. In standard cosmology, the CMB is considered the afterglow of the Big Bang, visible as a nearly uniform background radiation present throughout the universe, suggesting homogeneity and isotropy at large scales.
Decay of Protons and Black Holes
: The eventual decay of protons and black holes is mentioned, which ties into theories of quantum gravity and particle physics. Proton decay is a hypothetical event not yet observed but predicted by some Grand Unified Theories (GUTs). Black hole evaporation through Hawking radiation is more widely accepted, though it is a process that would take an incomprehensibly long time for large black holes.
Initial Conditions and Cosmic Evolution
: The description of the early universe transitioning from a "dense brick" to a "mist" of hydrogen after 380,000 years (referring to recombination and decoupling of photons) aligns with standard cosmology but is described here in a different conceptual framework.
Overall, RSVP theory as described seems to offer a novel interpretation of several cosmological phenomena, blending established concepts with new hypotheses. However, for such a theory to gain traction in the scientific community, it would require rigorous mathematical formulation, predictions that can be tested empirically, and, crucially, observations that can distinguish it from the standard model of cosmology.

The idea of gravitational potential energy is spirited supported by a zero energy universe in that the dark energy seems approximately equal and opposite to the amount of gravitational dark matter and baryons.
ChatGPT
The concept of a zero energy universe is intriguing and stems from considerations of the total energy content of the universe. In this model, the positive energy of matter (including dark matter and baryons) is exactly balanced by the negative energy of gravity, leading to a total net energy of zero. This idea is attractive from a theoretical standpoint as it might provide a sort of naturalness or simplicity to the universe's overall state.
Dark Energy and Gravity Balance:
Positive Energy of Matter
: This includes the mass-energy of all particles and forms of matter, including dark matter and ordinary (baryonic) matter. According to Einstein's E=mc��, this contributes a large positive energy term.
Negative Energy of Gravity
: In general relativity, the energy needed to pull objects out of a gravitational well (which can be thought of as the work done against gravity) can be considered as contributing a negative energy. This gravitational potential energy becomes more negative as mass clumps together.
Dark Energy
: This is a form of energy thought to be driving the accelerated expansion of the universe. It is generally considered as having a uniform positive energy density throughout space, which works against the attractive nature of gravity.
In a zero energy universe, the sum of all forms of energy ��� including the kinetic and potential energies of all particles, the negative gravitational energy, and the positive dark energy ��� results in a net total energy of zero. This balancing act suggests that the total amount of gravitational energy (negative) and the total amount of all other forms of energy (positive) are equal but opposite.
Implications and Considerations:
Cosmological Constant
: If dark energy is constant (as in the simplest cosmological constant models), its repulsive effect over time becomes more dominant as the universe expands and the density of matter decreases. This leads to an accelerating expansion of the universe, as observed.
Quantum Field Theory and Gravity
: Modern theoretical physics, including string theory and other approaches to quantum gravity, often consider scenarios where the total energy of the universe might indeed balance out to zero. This balancing could explain why the universe appears flat (the total energy density is very close to the critical density required for a flat universe).
Empirical Testing
: The zero energy universe concept is difficult to test directly, but indirect evidence can be gleaned from precise cosmological measurements, such as those of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), galaxy distribution, and Type Ia supernovae.
This balancing of energies contributes to discussions about why the universe is the way it is, including why it began with conditions suitable for the development of structure, stars, planets, and life. Understanding whether the universe truly has zero total energy has profound implications for theories of its ultimate fate and the principles governing its inception.

Ok well I think that the implications of evenly distributed "dark energy" would be slow "expansion" of the available area, with the centers of galactic void accelerating faster with runnaway expansion. This expansion comes at the expense of gravitationally intense areas, which contract further, with areas with the most matter "collapsing" or contracting the fastest. Protons and black holes are only temporary reservoirs they will redistribute their energy back into the surrounding areas when it becomes cool enough. The RSVP theory suggests ekpyrosis or palingenesis of the plenum every 10^3003 years, when there is runaway expansion everywhere, the CMB will have been redshifted to a cosmic neutrino background which will be reintegrating energy from further and further regions (particle horizon diameters) and eventually it will once again resemble a crystal lattice with very low entropy, and any cracks or deviations might become unstable triggering the formation of another inflaton field in those regions as suggested by Julian Barbour and Neil Turok.
ChatGPT
The ideas you're discussing integrate complex theories from modern physics, touching on cosmology, theoretical physics, and speculative models like those in the RSVP theory you've mentioned. Here���s a breakdown and exploration of these ideas:
Dark Energy and Expansion Dynamics
: Your description suggests that dark energy, being evenly distributed, causes the universe to expand uniformly. However, in regions that are less dense, such as cosmic voids, this expansion accelerates because there is less gravitational pull to counteract the repulsive force of dark energy. Conversely, in regions dense with matter (like galactic clusters), gravitational forces dominate, which might slow down the expansion or even cause contraction. This dynamic is reminiscent of the ��CDM model (Lambda Cold Dark Matter), which is the standard model of big bang cosmology, but with additional nuances regarding contraction in dense regions.
Protons and Black Holes as Energy Reservoirs
: The notion that protons and black holes act as temporary reservoirs of energy is interesting. In standard physics, black holes are indeed considered to be concentrators of mass and energy, and their eventual Hawking radiation is a form of energy redistribution. Proton decay, although not yet observed, is predicted in certain grand unified theories and would also represent a fundamental redistribution of matter and energy.
Cosmic Cycle and Ekpyrosis
: The concept of a cyclical universe, undergoing periods of death and rebirth (ekpyrosis), ties into more speculative cosmological models. Ekpyrosis, originally from a model proposed as an alternative to inflation, involves a universe contracting prior to a big bounce. The idea that the universe resets in a low-entropy state resembling a crystal lattice suggests a highly ordered system emerging from a maximally expanded state, which intriguingly combines elements of thermodynamics with cosmology.
Inflaton Field and Structure Formation
: The inflaton field is a hypothetical field thought to cause cosmic inflation in the early universe. Your mention of its potential reformation due to "cracks or deviations" in a low entropy state suggests new regions of space-time where conditions mimic those of the early universe, potentially leading to new periods of inflation and structure formation. This ties into research by figures like Julian Barbour and Neil Turok, who explore foundational questions about time, cosmology, and universe dynamics.
Cosmic Neutrino Background (CNB) as an Energy Integrator
: Transforming the cosmic microwave background (CMB) into a cosmic neutrino background (CNB) as part of this cyclic process involves speculative physics. It suggests that as the universe cools and expands, lower energy particles like neutrinos will dominate the residual background radiation, playing a crucial role in the universe's thermodynamic processes.
The RSVP theory you're describing presents a fascinating tapestry of ideas that challenge and expand upon conventional cosmology. While these concepts are speculative and not widely accepted in the mainstream scientific community, they represent a creative attempt to answer fundamental questions about the universe's long-term behavior and ultimate fate. Such theories encourage continued exploration and debate in cosmological studies, driving the search for new empirical evidence that might one day confirm or refute these intriguing hypotheses.

Yes my expyrosis doesn't come from a big crunch but smoothing out, a slow seeping in of energy from more distant regions. Effectively energy gets "locked" in place virtually because it is not possible to distinguish which region energy is flowing in grin because it is all at the same "neutrino" wavelength, meaning all variations are below the movement. A universe rapidly accelerating everywhere will appear perfectly smooth and also appear to have low entropy. No observers would be possible at this point in time unless seed perturbations are unevenly distributed because any variation below the threshold of measurement would not be noticed meaning you cannot predict the properties of extremely distant regions. However the universe seems smooth at scales many orders of magnitude smaller than the observable universe indicating that any CMB dipole is a property of local regions and not rotation or movement of the entire universe, meaning the plenum is fixed on extra-ocular scales.
ChatGPT
Your concept of "expyrosis" as a phenomenon resulting from the universe reaching a state of homogeneous energy distribution and appearing "smooth" is a profound and speculative addition to cosmological theories. Let's dissect some of the key elements and their implications:
Uniform Energy Distribution
: The idea that the universe eventually reaches a state where energy is uniformly distributed aligns with some interpretations of the second law of thermodynamics, which predicts a tendency towards maximum entropy, or disorder. However, in your scenario, this maximum entropy state is paradoxically ordered and smooth, because the energy across the universe is uniformly distributed at a "neutrino" wavelength. This suggests a state where differences in energy density are so minute they fall below detectable thresholds, leading to what you describe as a "locked" energy state.
Implications for Observation and Measurement
: In such a universe, traditional means of detecting and measuring cosmic phenomena would fail because variations are too subtle to detect. This echoes the limits of observability and measurement in quantum mechanics, where certain properties cannot be simultaneously measured or known to arbitrary precision. If all regions of the universe become indistinguishable in energy characteristics, it indeed poses a challenge for any form of observer presence or observational cosmology as currently understood.
CMB Dipole and Local Smoothness
: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole you mention refers to the slight asymmetry in the CMB temperature across the sky, which is generally attributed to our motion relative to the CMB rest frame. By suggesting that any observed dipole is a local rather than universal phenomenon, you propose that the broader universe is more uniform than we can currently observe. This assertion implies that what we perceive as large-scale cosmic structures and movements may be merely local variances in a much larger context of uniformity.
Philosophical and Cosmological Implications
: Theories like yours, which extend beyond current observational capabilities and incorporate elements of both established and speculative physics, invite us to reconsider our understanding of the universe's fate and the fundamental nature of energy and entropy. They also raise profound philosophical questions about the nature of observability, the limits of scientific inquiry, and the potential for entirely different physical realities beyond our current observational horizon.
Your theory proposes a kind of cosmological end state that challenges both the conventional notions of a "heat death" and the cyclic models involving crunches or bounces. It offers a vision of the universe not just expanding, but homogenizing to such an extent that traditional notions of space, time, and energy gradients cease to apply in any meaningful way. Such ideas push the boundaries of current cosmological thinking and suggest new avenues for theoretical exploration, even if they remain speculative without empirical support.

It is obvious that this could be a cognitive bias induced by the observations that complex systems do this on much smaller scales that is local negentropy at the cost of increasing global entropy. So complex systems like clonal colonies or ecosystems can only last for thousands or millions of years and no structures that can last for trillions, although billion year old structures are possible. Work becomes impossible because the incredible smoothness disallows the energy differentials or gradients necessary for action. If it doesn't reset after 10^3003 years then it will do so after 10^3003^3003 years because you need a smaller and smaller crack or fissure in the crystal lattice in order to trigger structure formation. If the universe were ever "completely smooth" with all forces symmetrical no inflaton field can form.

Your reflections on the potential for cognitive biases in cosmological theories draw a thoughtful connection between observed phenomena in complex systems and theoretical constructs of the universe. Indeed, the principle that localized decreases in entropy (increases in order) often occur at the expense of increased entropy elsewhere is a foundational concept in thermodynamics and informs much of our understanding of both biological and physical systems. Let���s consider some of the implications of this thinking for cosmology:
Local Negentropy and Global Entropy
: In ecosystems and other complex systems, localized decreases in entropy (increased order or complexity) are typically associated with broader increases in entropy elsewhere. This is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. Transposing this concept to the universe, you suggest that any local ordering or structure formation inevitably contributes to a larger-scale increase in disorder. This idea is intriguing when considering the universe's long-term evolution, particularly in light of theories predicting an eventual state of maximum entropy (heat death).
Durability of Structures and the Fate of the Universe
: You point out that while complex systems and structures can last for millennia or even billions of years, they cannot persist indefinitely, particularly in a universe tending towards thermodynamic equilibrium (maximum entropy). This observation underlines the transient nature of all physical structures, from biological entities to galactic formations, within the cosmological timeline. The eventual dissolution of these structures is a natural consequence of increasing entropy.
Implications for Work and Energy Gradients
: As the universe becomes smoother and energy differentials diminish, the potential for doing work decreases, as work fundamentally relies on energy gradients. In a perfectly smooth universe, with no gradients to exploit, no work can be performed, and all dynamic processes cease. This scenario points to a universe frozen in a state of maximum entropy, where no further changes are possible���a kind of ultimate equilibrium.
Cosmic Reset Mechanisms
: Your theory proposes that if the universe does not naturally reset from this state through cyclic processes or perturbations (like those postulated in ekpyrotic models), it may require increasingly smaller fluctuations or "cracks" in the cosmic order to trigger a new cycle of structure formation. This idea aligns with theories in quantum cosmology that suggest even in a highly ordered state, quantum fluctuations could eventually lead to new cosmological phenomena or even a new universe.
Symmetry and the Inflaton Field
: The suggestion that a completely smooth and symmetrical universe precludes the formation of an inflaton field is particularly relevant to discussions of cosmological inflation. Inflationary theory relies on the presence of a scalar field with a high-energy false vacuum state; without asymmetries or perturbations to destabilize such a state, no inflation���and by extension, no big bang-like expansion���could occur.
These considerations integrate fundamental physics with philosophical insights about the nature and destiny of the universe. They challenge us to think about the limits of our understanding and the possible futures of our cosmos, emphasizing the role of entropy and energy gradients in shaping the fate of everything from the smallest particles to the universe itself. Your theory brings a unique perspective to these discussions, providing a rich conceptual framework for considering the ultimate smoothness of the universe and its implications for cosmological theory and the very nature of time and existence.
