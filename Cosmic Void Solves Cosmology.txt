In the tapestry of the cosmos, immense fibers made of galaxies are woven around vast pockets of mostly empty space, as seen in this computer simulation.

Introduction
Like a bright city in the middle of a barren desert, our galactic neighborhood is enveloped by a cosmic void ��� an enormous, almost unfathomably empty pocket of space. Recently, sky surveys have spotted thousands more of these vacant bubbles. Now, researchers have found a way to pull information out of these cosmic voids: By counting how many of them exist in a volume of space, scientists have devised a new way to explore two of the thorniest questions in cosmology.

���It���s the very first time that we have used void numbers to extract cosmological information,��� said Alice Pisani, a cosmologist at Princeton University and the Flatiron Institute and an author of a new preprint describing the work. ���If we want to push the boundaries of science, we need to go beyond what has already been done.���

Researchers have been looking for new tools in part because they have some big mysteries to solve. The first, and most perplexing, is the rate at which the universe expands, a value known as the Hubble constant. For more than a decade, scientists have struggled to reconcile conflicting measurements of this rate, with some even calling the issue the biggest crisis in cosmology.

In addition, researchers have conflicting measurements of the clumpiness of cosmic matter ���the average density of large-scale structures, dark matter, galaxies, gas and voids distributed throughout the universe as a function of time.

Typically, astronomers measure those values in two complementary ways. Curiously, these two methods produce different values for both the Hubble constant and the so-called matter clustering strength.

In their new approach, Pisani and her colleagues use cosmic voids to estimate both values. And their early results, which seem to agree much more closely with one of the traditional methods than the other, are now contributing their own complexities to an already fraught disagreement.

In a novel approach, researchers are studying the universe's emptiest spaces, known as cosmic voids, to solve two significant mysteries in cosmology. The first issue pertains to the Hubble constant, the rate of the universe's expansion, which has been a subject of debate for over a decade due to conflicting measurements. The second problem involves the varying measurements of cosmic matter's "clumpiness", which describes the average density of large-scale structures, dark matter, galaxies, gas, and voids across the universe over time.
Astronomers typically use two complementary methods to measure these values, but both approaches yield different values for the Hubble constant and matter clustering strength. Alice Pisani, a cosmologist at Princeton University and the Flatiron Institute, along with her colleagues, have been using cosmic voids to estimate these two values. Early results from their studies have added more complexities to these controversies since their findings align more closely with one of the traditional methods than the other. This is the first time void numbers have been used to extract cosmological information, indicating a significant shift in the research methodology in this field.

Introduction
���The Hubble tension has lasted a decade so far because it is a hard problem,��� said Adam Riess, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University who uses supernovas to estimate the Hubble constant. ���The obvious issues have been checked and the data has improved, so the dilemma deepens.���

Now, the hope is that studying nearly nothing could lead to something big.

Building Bubbles
Voids are regions of space that are less dense than the universe, on average. Their boundaries are defined by the immense sheets and filaments of galaxies that are woven throughout the cosmos. Some voids span hundreds of millions of light-years, and together, these bubbles make up at least 80% of the universe���s volume. For a long time, though, no one paid much attention to them. ���I began my research in 2011 with around 200 voids,��� Pisani said. ���But now we have roughly 6,000.���

The bubbles have a tendency to expand because inside them, there isn���t much matter to exert an inward gravitational pull. The stuff outside them tends to stay away. And any galaxies that start inside a void get tugged outward by the gravitational pull of the structures defining a void���s edge. Because of this, in a void ���very little happens,��� Pisani said. ���There are no mergers, no complicated astrophysics. This makes them very easy to deal with.���

But each void���s shape is different, which can make it tricky for scientists to identify them. ���We want to make sure our voids are robust,��� Pisani said. ���How empty does it have to be, and how do I measure it?���

It turns out that the definition of ���nothing��� depends on the type of information astronomers want to extract. Pisani and colleagues started with a mathematical tool called a Voronoi diagram, which identifies the shapes that make up a 3D mosaic. These diagrams are typically used to study things like bubbles in foams and cells in biological tissues.

In the current work, Pisani and her colleagues tailored their Voronoi tessellations to identify about 6,000 voids in the data from an enormous galactic mapping project called the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS).

���Voids are complementary to the catalog of galaxies,��� said Benjamin Wandelt, an astrophysicist at Sorbonne University in Paris who was not involved in the study. ���They are a new way to probe cosmic structure.���

Once Pisani and colleagues had their map of voids, they set out to see what it could reveal about the expanding universe.

Something From Nothing
Every cosmic void is a window on a great cosmic conflict. On one side, there���s dark energy, the mysterious force that causes our universe to expand ever more quickly. Dark energy is present even in empty space, so it dominates the physics of the void. On the other side of the conflict there���s gravity, which attempts to pull the void together. And then matter���s clumpiness adds wrinkles to the voids.

Pisani and her colleagues, including Sofia Contarini of the University of Bologna, modeled how the expansion of the universe would affect the number of voids of different sizes. In their model, which kept a handful of other cosmological parameters constant, a slower expansion rate produced a higher density of smaller, more crumpled voids. On the other hand, if expansion was faster and matter didn���t clump as readily, they expected to find more large, smooth voids.

The group then compared their model predictions with observations from the BOSS survey. From this, they were able to estimate both clumpiness and the Hubble constant.

They then juxtaposed their measurements with the two traditional ways to measure these values. The first method uses a type of cosmic explosion called a Type Ia supernova. The second relies on the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the radiation left over from the Big Bang.

The void data revealed a Hubble constant that varied by less than 1% from the CMB���s estimate. The result for clumpiness was more muddled, but it also aligned more closely with the CMB than with Type Ia supernovas.

Perplexingly, the voids in the BOSS survey lie closer in space and time to more recent Type Ia supernovas ��� making it a bit surprising that the void measurements align more closely with the primordial CMB. Wandelt, though, suggested that the results might reveal a new understanding about the universe.

���There is one deep insight that makes my hair stand up,��� he said. Inside voids, structures never formed and evolved, so voids ���are time capsules of the early universe.���

In other words, if the physics of the early universe was different from the physics of the present day, the voids may have preserved it.

The Future of Absence
Others think it���s too soon to draw any conclusions from the new results.

Even with thousands of voids, the study���s error bars are still too large to say anything conclusive. ���This analysis is extremely well done,��� said Ruth Durrer, a theoretical physicist at the University of Geneva who did not take part in the research. But, Durrer noted, the results haven���t reached statistical significance ��� yet. ���If Alice wants to be in the club of amazingly good Hubble constant measurements, she has to get to the 1% limit, which is a huge challenge,��� Durrer said.

Pisani said she considers the work to be a proof of concept. It will likely take another decade ��� and the help of future missions such as NASA���s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and SPHEREx Observatory ��� to accumulate enough void data to be on a par with the conflicting CMB and Type Ia supernova measurements.

Durrer also points out that maybe these arguments ��� the attempts to reconcile cosmic tensions ��� are all much ado about nothing, and that the observational disagreements could be pointing to a reality that scientists shouldn���t be trying to erase.

���The supernova and CMB groups are doing measurements that are very, very different,��� she said. ���So there may be new physics that explains why we shouldn���t be seeing the same thing.���

Cosmologist Alice Pisani and her team are using the study of cosmic voids���enormous, mostly empty spaces in the universe���to provide insights into two of cosmology's biggest mysteries: the Hubble constant (the rate at which the universe expands) and the clumpiness of cosmic matter. These voids, defined by the immense sheets and filaments of galaxies woven throughout the cosmos, make up at least 80% of the universe's volume.
Pisani and her colleagues have identified around 6,000 of these voids using a mathematical tool called a Voronoi diagram and data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). In the voids, dark energy, the mysterious force causing the universe to expand, dominates, while gravity attempts to pull the void together, and the clumpiness of matter further shapes the voids.
The researchers modeled how the universe's expansion affects the number of voids of different sizes, predicting that slower expansion leads to more smaller, crumpled voids, while faster expansion and less clumpy matter result in larger, smoother voids. The model's predictions were compared to BOSS survey observations, which helped them estimate both the Hubble constant and clumpiness.
The void data yielded a Hubble constant that varied by less than 1% from the cosmic microwave background's (CMB) estimate, an alignment that perplexed the researchers since the voids in the BOSS survey are closer to recent Type Ia supernovas. Astrophysicist Benjamin Wandelt suggested the results might indicate that voids have preserved the physics of the early universe, offering new insights into our understanding of the cosmos.
The study, however, is still in its early stages, and its findings have not yet reached statistical significance. It may take another decade and more data from future missions like NASA���s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and SPHEREx Observatory for the study to yield results on par with the CMB and Type Ia supernova measurements.

Connections with the following topics: An interactionless Ising model for galaxy bias
Repp, Andrew
Abstract
Galaxy surveys, such as the upcoming Euclid and WFIRST missions, represent an important observational constraint on cosmology. However, the fact that galaxies are biased tracers of the underlying dark matter complicates the extraction of information from these surveys. In addition, the focus of current bias models is the high-density regions of the Universe, but low-density regions carry significant information relevant to dark energy and alternative gravitational theories. Thus it is necessary for a galaxy bias model to be accurate at both high and low densities. We here present such a model (inspired by the Ising model of ferromagnetism), and we demonstrate its good fit to both simulations and observational data. The quality of the fit indicates that, to a first approximation, galaxy formation is a local process determined by initial conditions.

In the study conducted by Andrew Repp, the main topic revolves around the use of galaxy surveys, like the upcoming Euclid and WFIRST missions, for obtaining observational constraints on cosmology. These surveys, however, have their complexities. Galaxies serve as biased markers of the dark matter underlying them, which complicates the extraction of useful information from these surveys.
The focus of contemporary bias models is usually on the high-density regions of the universe, but it's worth noting that low-density regions also bear significant information that's relevant to dark energy and alternative gravitational theories. Consequently, it's necessary to develop a galaxy bias model that offers accuracy at both high and low densities.
To address this need, Repp presents a model inspired by the Ising model of ferromagnetism. The Ising model is a mathematical model in statistical mechanics that describes a system of interacting spins on a lattice, typically used to understand magnetic properties of materials. By applying this model to the cosmological context, Repp suggests that galaxy formation can be understood as a local process determined by initial conditions, much like how the Ising model explains local spin interactions.
This model demonstrated a good fit with both simulations and observational data, implying that it might be a useful tool for extracting information from galaxy surveys, even in regions of lower density.
The connection to Alice Pisani's work comes from the focus on using different ways to understand cosmology and the universe's structure. While Pisani and her team are studying cosmic voids to understand the universe's expansion rate and the clumpiness of cosmic matter, Repp is working on a model to more accurately understand the distribution and formation of galaxies, both in high and low-density regions. Both studies are pushing the boundaries of how we use observational data to improve our understanding of the cosmos.

Abstract
A reliable model of galaxy bias is necessary for interpreting data from future dense galaxy surveys. Conventional linear and quadratic bias models are unphysical, often predicting negative galaxy densities (��g < ���1) in voids, which potentially contain half of a survey���s available cosmological information. Here we present a physically motivated alternative by assuming two energetically distinct subhalo states. Our approximations ��� namely, local galaxy formation, rough equivalence of galaxy-hosting subhaloes, and universal energetic favourability for the galaxy-hosting state ��� result in a bias model with only two free parameters; mathematically, the model (in the correct variables) yields a Fermi���Dirac distribution or (equivalently) an interactionless Ising model with an external field. The model yields sensible (and physical) predictions for both high- and low-density regions. We test the model using a catalogue of Millennium Simulation galaxies in cubical survey pixels with side lengths from 2 h���1���31 h���1 Mpc, at redshifts from 0 to 2. We find the two-state model markedly superior to linear and quadratic bias models on scales smaller than 10 h���1 Mpc, while those conventional models fare better on scales larger than 30 h���1 Mpc. Though the largest scale of applicability is likely to depend on the galaxy catalogue employed, the two-state model should be superior on any scale with a non-negligible fraction of cells devoid of galaxies.

1.���INTRODUCTION
Galaxy surveys represent an important observational constraint on cosmology; indeed, one of the main science drivers for planned surveys such as Euclid (Laureijs et al. 2011) and WFIRST (Green et al. 2012) is the expectation that their data will encode large amounts of information on the properties of dark energy. Furthermore, voids ��� comprising roughly half the initial volume of the Universe ��� contain up to half of the cosmological information borne by matter-clustering statistics (see e.g. Wolk, Carron & Szapudi 2015a). Thus, in order to extract cosmological information from survey data, we require techniques applicable to both clusters and voids.

However, galaxies are biased tracers of matter (see the theoretical treatment in Kaiser 1984; Bardeen et al. 1986), and thus cosmological inference from galaxy surveys requires modelling of the relationship between the matter and galaxy overdensities (��=��/�������1 and ��g=Ngal/N���������1, respectively). Perhaps the most common approach (e.g. Hoffmann, Bel & Gazta��aga 2017) is to expand ��g either linearly (��g = b��) or quadratically (��g = b1�� + b2��2/2). Another approach (e.g. de la Torre & Peacock 2013) performs the expansion in log space so that ln (1 + ��g) = bln (1 + ��).

One could also attempt to derive a galaxy���dark matter relationship from full-scale halo models and/or hydrodynamical simulations. However, halo modelling is non-trivial, and simulations rely on assumptions about galaxy formation and evolution, many aspects of which remain uncertain. Furthermore, the vast range of scales involved requires simplifications of unknown impact in order to render the computations tractable.

In this paper, Andrew Repp and Istv��n Szapudi propose a novel method to model galaxy bias, which is a critical factor for interpreting data from dense galaxy surveys. Galaxy bias refers to the tendency for galaxies to form in regions of the universe where matter density is higher than average, complicating our understanding of the distribution of dark matter in the universe.
Traditional models of galaxy bias, based on linear and quadratic expansion, are described as unphysical, as they often predict negative galaxy densities in cosmic voids - areas of the universe with less matter than average. Considering that these voids potentially contain half of the available cosmological information in a survey, these traditional models might be missing out on significant data.
The authors suggest an alternative two-state model that assumes two energetically distinct subhalo states. The model is based on several assumptions: that galaxy formation is a local process, that galaxy-hosting subhaloes are roughly equivalent, and that the state that hosts galaxies is universally more energetically favorable. The result is a model with only two free parameters. Mathematically, this model yields a Fermi���Dirac distribution or, equivalently, an interactionless Ising model with an external field.
The two-state model makes logical and physical predictions for both high- and low-density regions. The authors tested this model using data from the Millennium Simulation of galaxy distribution and found it to be superior to traditional bias models on scales smaller than 10 h���1 Mpc, while conventional models fared better on scales larger than 30 h���1 Mpc.
The results suggest that the two-state model could provide more accurate results on any scale where there is a non-negligible fraction of cells devoid of galaxies. Thus, this approach could potentially enhance our understanding of galaxy formation and distribution, especially in the less dense regions of the universe. The model's success in both high and low-density regions make it a potentially valuable tool for cosmological studies.

Both theory (e.g. Cooray & Sheth 2002; Sheth & Jain 2003) and simulations (e.g. Ghigna et al. 2000; Springel et al. 2005) indicate that dark matter can cluster hierarchically, with large haloes containing multiple, potentially nested, subhaloes. In addition, galaxy formation models (e.g. White, Hernquist & Springel 2001; Croton, Gao & White 2007) allow multiple galaxies in a single dark matter halo, with each galaxy occupying its own subhalo while some subhaloes remain unoccupied. For simplicity, in this paper we define subhaloes as roughly equivalent dark matter aggregates, which can contain at most one galaxy. We thus focus on these subhaloes, which can host individual galaxies, rather than on the more complicated haloes (which potentially host many galaxies).

In the context of cosmology, a halo refers to a large collection of dark matter that can contain galaxies, gas, and other celestial bodies. These haloes can also contain subhaloes - smaller aggregations of dark matter within the larger halo. The hierarchical clustering of dark matter means that larger haloes can contain multiple subhaloes, with the potential for these subhaloes to be nested within each other.
Galaxy formation models indicate that multiple galaxies can exist within a single dark matter halo, with each galaxy residing in its own subhalo. However, not all subhaloes host a galaxy, with some remaining empty.
In this paper, the authors simplify their model by focusing only on subhaloes that have the potential to host a galaxy. For their purposes, they define subhaloes as roughly equivalent aggregates of dark matter that can contain, at most, one galaxy. This approach allows them to focus on individual galaxies and their host subhaloes, rather than dealing with the additional complexity that comes from considering larger haloes that could potentially host many galaxies. This simplification is aimed at making the model more tractable and easier to analyze.

In Section 2 we derive a two-state model for galaxy bias by application of Fermi���Dirac statistics in the correct variables (noting also its equivalence to an interactionless Ising model with an external field).

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In this section of the paper, the authors are planning to derive a two-state model for galaxy bias by applying Fermi-Dirac statistics. Fermi-Dirac statistics is a principle of quantum statistics that applies to particles that follow the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two or more identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. In the context of this paper, the authors are using these statistics as a mathematical tool to model the galaxy bias.
Moreover, the authors note the equivalence of their model to an "interactionless Ising model with an external field." The Ising model is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. The "interactionless" aspect means that the model assumes each particle (in this case, each galaxy or dark matter subhalo) acts independently of the others, and the "external field" would represent some external influence on the system. In a typical Ising model, each particle interacts with its immediate neighbors; however, the interactionless variant used here simplifies the model by removing these interactions.
It's important to remember that these are abstract mathematical models and the authors are drawing an analogy between these models and the behavior of galaxies in dark matter subhaloes. The two-state system probably refers to the idea that a subhalo can be in one of two states: either it hosts a galaxy or it does not. The use of Fermi-Dirac statistics and the Ising model are then tools to calculate the probabilities of these states and the expected distribution of galaxies in subhaloes across the universe.

.���CONCLUSIONS
A reliable model of galaxy bias is necessary in order to interpret the data from dense galaxy surveys. Conventional bias models (such as the linear or quadratic) work well in high-density regions, but they yield unphysical results for voids, which contain significant cosmological information.

To eliminate such unphysical predictions, we have here presented a two-state galaxy bias model, which characterizes dark matter subhaloes in terms of two thermodynamically distinct states ��� namely, either hosting a galaxy or not. Given a small set of simple physical assumptions about galaxy formation ��� namely, that galaxy formation is (to first order) a local process, that one can treat dark matter subhaloes hosting a given type of galaxy as roughly equivalent, and that it is thermodynamically favourable for a subhalo to host a galaxy ��� we obtain equation (5) in Section 2. It is straightforward to interpret the two-state model in terms of a Fermi���Dirac distribution or as the interactionless limit of the class of Ising models.

In their conclusions, the authors are summarizing the main points of their research paper.
The paper is centered on the development of a two-state galaxy bias model to interpret data from dense galaxy surveys. Traditional bias models such as linear or quadratic ones work well in high-density regions but they fail in regions with low galaxy densities, known as voids. Voids, despite their low density, contain significant information about the cosmos, making it important to have models that can accurately interpret their information.
The proposed two-state model addresses these issues by characterizing dark matter subhaloes as either hosting a galaxy or not, hence the term "two-state". They made a few key assumptions: galaxy formation is primarily a local process, dark matter subhaloes hosting a particular type of galaxy are approximately similar, and it's generally more favorable from a thermodynamic standpoint for a subhalo to host a galaxy.
The authors show that their two-state model can be interpreted in terms of a Fermi-Dirac distribution (a statistical model used in quantum physics) or as the interactionless limit of the class of Ising models (a mathematical model used in statistical mechanics to describe ferromagnetism). This analogy helps in understanding the behavior of the system and predicting galaxy distributions. Their model, therefore, promises to provide a more accurate interpretation of data from both high-density regions and voids in the universe.

We have tested the model using Millennium Simulation galaxy catalogues and have found it vastly superior to conventional models on scales approximately 2���10 h���1 Mpc, although the linear and quadratic models are preferable at scales above 30 h���1 Mpc. (In the intermediate regime, we find that none of the models seems to describe the bias well, although the two-state model is still typically preferable to the others.) At all scales considered, however, the two-state model provides reasonable results in both low- and high-density regions and furthermore requires only two free parameters (as does the quadratic model).

The authors have validated their two-state model using data from the Millennium Simulation, a large astrophysical simulation of the evolution of galaxies in the universe. They found their model significantly outperformed traditional linear and quadratic models for distances between 2 and 10 h^-1 Mpc (Mega parsecs, where h^-1 is a scaling factor related to the expansion rate of the universe).
For larger scales, above 30 h^-1 Mpc, the conventional linear and quadratic models seem to perform better. In an intermediate range, neither the conventional models nor the two-state model are particularly effective, but the authors find that the two-state model still tends to be preferable.
The significant advantage of the two-state model is that it provides reasonable results for both high- and low-density regions of the universe. Additionally, it is a parsimonious model, only requiring two free parameters, similar to the quadratic model. This means that it's a simpler model to use and tune compared to more complex ones. The model thus presents a promising tool for analyzing galaxy distributions at various scales and densities.

At high densities, the two-state model yields the correct zeroth-order (constant) asymptotic behaviour. We also considered (in Section 3.2) the possibility of modifying the two-state model to guarantee the same first-order asymptotics as the linear model. The additional term produces a lower reduced ��2 at intermediate scales but it does not seem to improve the fit at the smallest (2 h���1 Mpc) and largest (30 h���1 Mpc) scales. This behaviour ��� as well as a possible physical motivation for the modification ��� merits further investigation.

In this work, we have restricted our tests of the two-state model to simulation data alone. We are currently (Repp & Szapudi, in prep.) testing the model against empirical galaxy survey data.

ChatGPT
The authors reveal that the two-state model displays the correct asymptotic behavior at high densities, a trait that conventional models fail to maintain in lower density regions. They also explored modifications to the two-state model to mimic the linear model's first-order asymptotic behavior. The modified model provided a better fit at intermediate scales, but did not improve the fit at smaller or larger scales.
The authors suggest that the behavior of the modified model, and the potential physical motivation for the modification, deserve further study. Importantly, they are also currently testing the model against real-world galaxy survey data, rather than just simulation data. This is a significant next step because it will help establish whether the model is robust and accurate in describing the real universe, not just simulated universes.
In conclusion, the two-state model presents a significant innovation in the field of galaxy bias, providing a more physically grounded and robust model, particularly in low-density regions of the universe. However, as with any model, further testing and refinement are ongoing.

model follows from a small set of reasonable physical assumptions; it does not yield unphysical predictions; and it provides a superior fit to the matter���galaxy relationship, except for scales at which we already knew the linear model to be adequate. Thus, the results presented here indicate the superiority of the two-state model for analysis of galaxy surveys at non-linear scales.

The authors assert that the two-state model for galaxy bias is superior because it is grounded in a handful of reasonable physical assumptions, avoids unphysical predictions that are common in other models, and provides a superior fit for the relationship between matter and galaxies except at scales where the linear model has already been proven to be sufficient.
The authors' work indicates that this two-state model is particularly beneficial for analyzing data from galaxy surveys at non-linear scales. This could significantly enhance our understanding of galaxy formation and distribution, and by extension, our understanding of the universe's large scale structure, dark matter, and dark energy.
The two-state model is a remarkable development, considering that it successfully addresses the existing limitations in conventional bias models. This model will be especially crucial in analyzing data from upcoming surveys like Euclid and WFIRST, which will provide more detailed observations of galaxy distributions.

A Model of Void Formation
Friedmann, Yasmin ; Piran, Tsvi
Abstract
We introduce a simple model for the formation of voids. In this model the underdensity of galaxies in voids is the product of two factors. The first arises from a gravitational expansion of the negative density perturbation. The second is due to biasing: galaxies are less likely to form in an underdense region. One feature of the model is an upper cutoff in void sizes. We calculate the volume-filling factor of characteristic voids for different cold dark matter (CDM) models and find that our formation model points to ��CDM models as preferred models of the power spectrum. A natural consequence of our model is that the underdensity of the dark matter inside voids is smaller than the galaxy underdensity.

The paper introduces a model for the formation of cosmic voids. In this model, the under-density of galaxies in voids is determined by two factors.
The first factor arises from the gravitational expansion of a region with negative density perturbation. This means that an area of the universe which has less matter than average will expand due to gravitational effects, becoming an even larger region of under-density.
The second factor is due to galaxy formation bias. This bias refers to the fact that galaxies are less likely to form in under-dense regions. Regions that are initially under-dense may end up being even more under-populated by galaxies due to the difficulties of galaxy formation in such environments.
A distinctive feature of this model is an upper limit on void sizes. This implies that there's a maximum size that these under-dense regions can reach according to this model.
The authors also calculate the volume-filling factor of characteristic voids for different cold dark matter (CDM) models. Their findings suggest that the ��CDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) model is preferred, which is a key model in cosmology and represents a universe dominated by dark energy (the cosmological constant ��) and cold dark matter.
A crucial implication of their model is that the under-density of dark matter inside voids is smaller than the under-density of galaxies. This means that while voids are under-populated by galaxies, they could still contain significant amounts of dark matter.
The model proposed by Friedmann and Piran offers a simplistic yet valuable perspective on the formation of cosmic voids, their size, and the relationship between the distributions of galaxies and dark matter within these voids. These findings are important for understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe and the role of dark matter and dark energy in shaping it.

The papers you've mentioned study different but related topics in cosmology and galaxy formation, mainly focusing on galaxy bias, void formation, and the relationship between galaxies and dark matter. Here are a few potential connections:
Galaxy Bias
: Both Andrew Repp and his collaborators' work and Friedmann and Piran's work deal with the issue of galaxy bias in different ways. Repp's papers propose a two-state model for galaxy bias, representing the thermodynamically distinct states of dark matter subhaloes. Friedmann and Piran's work, on the other hand, deals with void formation, where the concept of bias plays a role in that galaxies are less likely to form in under-dense (void) regions.
Dark Matter and Galaxies
: The connection between the distribution of galaxies and dark matter is a common theme. The two-state galaxy bias model by Repp is inspired by the nature of dark matter subhaloes and their ability to host galaxies. Friedmann and Piran's work also takes into account the dark matter under-density in voids, stating it is less than the galaxy under-density.
Understanding Large-Scale Structure
: Both the two-state bias model and the void formation model are ultimately about understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe. They address different aspects of this structure (galaxy distribution and voids) but are intrinsically linked as part of the same overarching structure.
Data Analysis and Predictive Models
: Both topics underscore the importance of accurate models to interpret data from galaxy surveys. Galaxy bias models like Repp's are crucial for extracting meaningful information from dense galaxy surveys, while understanding void formation (Friedmann & Piran) is key to understanding large-scale cosmic structures and the distribution of matter in the Universe.
Low-Density Regions (Voids)
: The papers also highlight the need for paying attention to low-density regions or voids. Repp points out that conventional models often fail in these regions, hence the need for a new model. Friedmann and Piran focus entirely on understanding these voids, showing their significant role in cosmology.

neighbor distance. On large scales, the system appears hyperuniform, as a result of primordial density 
fluctuations, while on the smallest scales, the system becomes almost antihyperuniform, as evidenced by its 
number variance. Additionally, via a finite-scaling analysis, we compute the percolation threshold of the

this will require further study on various observational effects, necessitating high-resolution simulations.

The study "Disordered Heterogeneous Universe: Galaxy Distribution and Clustering across Length Scales" by Oliver H.E. Philcox and Salvatore Torquato proposes a novel way to analyze the distribution and clustering of galaxies, utilizing principles and techniques from the study of disordered heterogeneous media. The connections to the other works you've mentioned can be made as follows:
Galaxy Distribution and Dark Matter
: Similar to Andrew Repp's work on galaxy bias, this study by Philcox and Torquato also focuses on galaxy distribution. They analyze these distributions based on dark matter simulations. This method aligns with the galaxy bias model presented by Repp, which also relies on the nature of dark matter subhaloes and their ability to host galaxies.
Understanding Void Spaces
: In this study, one of the areas of interest is void functions, which has an overlap with the paper by Friedmann and Piran on void formation. Both papers consider the importance of the distribution and underdensity of galaxies in void spaces for understanding the larger structure of the universe.
Utilizing Simulations for Data Analysis
: All the studies mentioned use simulation data for their models and analyses. Philcox and Torquato use dark matter simulations to describe galaxy distributions, while Repp tested their two-state model using Millennium Simulation galaxy catalogues. These methods emphasize the importance of simulations in understanding and predicting physical properties of the universe.
Cosmological Parameters
: Both the study by Philcox and Torquato and the previous works you mentioned are related to the analysis and prediction of cosmological parameters. The ability to constrain these parameters through large-scale clustering statistics provides insights into our understanding of the universe's structure and evolution.
Future Applications
: The Philcox and Torquato study offers a novel system to test heterogeneous media descriptors and new tools for cosmological analyses, with potential for extension to observational data. Similarly, Repp's work on a new galaxy bias model introduces a superior approach for analyzing galaxy surveys, especially at non-linear scales. Both are concerned with improving our methodologies for understanding the Universe and provide a solid foundation for future cosmological research.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Fromcondensedphasesofmattertoecological 
systems to the primordial distribution of matter in the 
Universe, nature abounds with examples of disordered 
arrangements of interacting entities that form structures 
with diverse geometries and topologies. To understand the 
collective behavior of such phenomena, it is vital to have a 
mathematical formalism that enables a stochastic descrip- 
tion of the constituent objects, particularly with regards to 
their spatial distribution and clustering, whether they be 
carbon atoms, concrete conglomerates, or individual 
galaxies. The theory of disordered heterogeneous media 
[1,2], which includes techniques from statistical mechan- 
ics [3], provides a natural and powerful machinery with 
which to equip ourselves in this venture. In particular, its 
primary objective is to connect the properties of the 
interacting constituents to their large-scale attributes, such 
as a material���s bulk transport and mechanical and electro- 
magnetic properties. This is rigorously done by generally 
relating the bulk properties to an infinite set of diverse 
types of statistical correlation functions that characterize 
the microstructures [1], including those that contain 
topological information, such as phase connectivity and 
percolation characteristics. While this theoretical machi- 
nery has been primarily applied to Earth-bound materials, 
their applicability is far from terrestrial: these techniques 
work similarly for any phenomenon that can be treated as 
complex disordered heterogeneous media [1], including 
the spatial distribution and clustering of galaxies. 
While the bulk of cosmological research in the past 
two decades has focused on analysis of the cosmic micro- 
wave background (the radiation signature of physics in the 
first ���300000 years, which provides a snapshot of the 
early Universe), that concerning the distribution of galaxies 
using statistical descriptors has become progressively 
more important [4���6], particularly with the advent of large- 
scale surveys, such as the forthcoming Dark Energy 
Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) [7] and the Euclid satel- 
lite [8]. The distribution of galaxies traces the distribution 
of matter in the early Universe (see, e.g., Ref. [4]); as such, 
it encodes information on a wealth of cosmological 
parameters, such as the density of matter. An open question 
is how best to analyze the data: most works focus on 
measuring the correlation functions of the galaxy distri- 
bution and comparing them to physical models (either 
explicitly derived or numerically simulated) (see, e.g., 
Ref. [9]), though this is known to be suboptimal in terms 
of information content. While a number of alternative 
statistics have been proposed (including void statistics 
[10,11], marked density fields [12���15], Gaussianized fields 
[16���19], reconstructed density fields [20] field-level infer- 
ence [21���23], Minkowski functionals and other topological 
descriptors [24���33], and beyond), there is little consensus 
on which have practical utility (with most having been 
applied only to the dark matter distribution), and few are 
natural from a theoretical standpoint. An important insight 
is that the galaxy distribution is simply a set of irregularly 
arranged pointlike particles in three dimensions; this is 
mathematically identical to the structure of many terrestrial 
materials, including atomic systems, colloids, and sphere 
packing. As such, both scenarios can be treated with the 
same mathematical formalisms; i.e., heterogeneous media 
and statistical mechanical techniques designed to quantify 
the clustering of particles in materials can be used to 
provide a practical and well-motivated manner in which to 
understand the galaxy distribution. 
This work considers the application of a number of 
statistical descriptors from the theory of disordered hetero- 
geneous media to characterize structurally the distribution 
of galaxies, which we treat as discrete point configuration. 
We ask two main questions. (1) What can we learn about 
cosmology through the lens of disordered heterogenous 
media and statistical mechanics? (2) What condensed 
matter physics lessons, more broadly, can we learn from 
cosmological structures? As a proof of concept, we will 
consider a number of descriptors [1,4], including the two- 
and three-particle correlation functions, ���void��� and ���par- 
ticle��� nearest-neighbor functions, certain cluster statistics, 
pair-connectedness functions, percolation properties, and 
scalarordermetricstoquantifythedegreeoforder.Weshow 
howtheirbehaviorsinthecosmiclandscape,probedthrough 
cosmological dark matter simulations, differs substantially 
from that expected from a simple Poissonian distribution of 
points as well as well-known homogeneous models of 
correlated disordered point patterns, showing that cosmol- 
ogy challenges general expectations of standard hetero- 
geneous media and statistical mechanical models. In 
particular, we will find stronger clustering on large scales, 
giving an enhancement in the pair correlation and pair- 
connectedness functions and an excess of large-scale voids; 
these effects arise due to early Universe physics, which 
source quasi-long-range correlations in the galaxy distribu- 
tion and create a hyperuniform system. Particular interest 
will be paid to the question of clustering and phase 
���percolation���; this is a well-understood phenomenon for 
many models in condensed matter but can be similarly 
extended to galaxy distributions, and yields interesting 
results. The cosmological case will be found to percolate 
faster,butasymptotetothePoissoncaseifthedensityislow, 
and both scenarios share the same set of critical exponents. 
Furthermore,wewillconsidertheutilityofdescriptorsfrom 
the theory of disordered heterogeneous media in cosmo- 
logical settings, quantifying how they can add additional 
information regarding the early and late Universe, finding 
that the pair-connectedness function adds significant 
cosmological information at minimal additional computa- 
tional cost. We caution that further work will be required 
beforethestatisticscanbeappliedtoobservationaldata:this 
must include discussion of redshift-space effects (arising 
from the conversion of galaxy redshifts to distance, creating

anisotropy with respect to the sample line of sight) and the 
dependence of descriptors on galaxy properties, such as 
luminosities or masses. 
Our conclusions to the above questions asked will be 
the following: (1) the theory of heterogeneous media and 
statistical mechanics provides an array of useful tools that 
can enhance the utility of galaxy survey datasets, strength- 
ening the constraints on cosmological parameters and 
probing novel features of the distribution, (2) due to its 
quasi-long-ranged correlations, galaxy samples exhibit 
very different behavior to most terrestrial media, and thus 
provide an important sandbox for applying and under- 
standing condensed matter techniques. While we restrict 
ourselves to galaxy surveys in this work, they are by no 
means the only cosmological application of such statis- 
tics: a number of other phenomena could be described by 
such approaches. These include two-phase media such as 
the distribution of cosmic voids (empty regions of 
gargantuan extent) and the statistics of ionized hydrogen 
bubbles during the ���reionization��� phase of the Universe. 
Such areas provide a bountiful mine from which to derive 
future work. 
The remainder of this work is structured as follows. In 
Sec. II, we provide an overview of the statistics used in this 
work, before presenting the proposed testing ground 
(simulated galaxy samples) in Sec. III. A comparison of 
the statistics on galactic and Poisson data is shown in 
Sec. II, with Sec. V providing a discussion of percolation 
physics in the two systems. Finally, Sec. VI considers the 
utility of a specific statistic, the pair-connectedness func- 
tion, in cosmological contexts, before we conclude in 
Sec. VII. II. STATISTICAL DESCRIPTORS 
OF POINT CONFIGURATIONS 
In this section, we define the various statistical descrip- 
tors of point configurations that will be used in the 
remainder of this work. We principally adopt notation 
from the statistical mechanics community (particularly 
following Ref. [1]), though we connect this to the cosmo- 
logical terminology, when relevant. Although we princi- 
pally work in R3, most of the following discussion remains 
relevant in other metric spaces. A schematic illustrating the 
various statistical descriptors considered in this work is 
shown in Fig. 1. A. Correlation functions

This work explores how the mathematical models and statistical descriptors used in condensed matter physics - specifically the theory of disordered heterogeneous media - can be applied to cosmology, specifically to the distribution of galaxies. The authors propose that the distribution of galaxies can be mathematically treated in a similar way to how irregularly arranged particles in three dimensions are treated in terrestrial materials like atomic systems, colloids, and sphere packing.
The paper attempts to answer two main questions:
What can cosmology learn from the lens of disordered heterogeneous media and statistical mechanics?
What lessons from condensed matter physics can we learn from cosmological structures?
The authors utilize statistical descriptors like two- and three-particle correlation functions, nearest-neighbor functions, cluster statistics, percolation properties, and scalar order metrics to quantify the degree of order in the distribution of galaxies.
They find that the distribution of galaxies differs substantially from the expectations based on a simple Poissonian distribution and other models of disordered point patterns. They observe stronger clustering on larger scales, which they attribute to early Universe physics. They also find interesting results when applying the concept of percolation, a phenomenon well-understood in condensed matter physics, to the galaxy distributions.
The paper also discusses the usefulness of these descriptors in cosmological settings, suggesting that these tools could potentially enhance the utility of galaxy survey datasets and provide valuable insights into cosmological parameters.
However, the authors caution that more work is needed before these statistics can be applied to observational data, given the need to consider factors like redshift-space effects and the dependence of descriptors on galaxy properties.
The authors conclude by suggesting that the theory of heterogeneous media and statistical mechanics provides a rich set of tools that can enhance our understanding of cosmology, and that galaxy samples, due to their unique characteristics, offer a valuable testing ground for applying and understanding condensed matter techniques.

III. GALAXY SURVEYS AS POINT CLOUDS 
Although the statistics described in Sec. II have been 
principally applied to study the properties of physical 
materials, their applicability extends far beyond the terres- 
trial regime. In this work, we consider their application to 
spectroscopic galaxy surveys, such as those of the upcom- 
ing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and 
Euclid projects [7,8]. Such projects will measure the 
angular positions and redshifts of O��107�� bright galaxies 
from ground- and space-based telescopes, providing a 
three-dimensional map of the Universe with unprecedented 
resolution. Fundamentally, galaxy surveys measure a set of 
N galaxy positions with some associated weights, repre- 
senting experimental effects. In many typical analyses 
[100���102], these are assigned to some coarse grid in R3, 
and the associated field taken to be an inhomogeneous 
Poisson sample of an underlying continuous field. This is 
itself modeled as a nonlinear transformation of the under- 
lying dark matter distribution, whose correlation functions 
(particularly g2and g3) encode early Universe physics, with 
the field obeying Gaussian statistics on sufficiently large 
scales, before a perturbative (and well-understood [103]) 
regime takes hold. Explicitly, the microscopic density �� ����x�� 
satisfies 
�� ����x�� ��� Poisson���� ����1 �� ��g��x��?��; 
�� ��g��k�� ��� N(0;��h2;g��k��); 
��31�� 
on sufficiently large scales, where ��gis a normally 
distributed continuous background field with variance 
�� h2;g��k��. On small, nonlinear, scales, a variety of galaxy 
formation processes become important and the above 
approach is known to be insufficient. This has led to a 
flurry of interest in additional statistics beyond the simple 
correlation functions. 
An alternative to the standard approach is to consider the 
point cloud traced by the galaxies as the fundamental 
object, facilitating direct application of the clustering 
techniques described in Sec. II. Rather than working with 
observational data directly, this work will make use of 
simulated data drawn from the publicly availableQUIJOTE 
suite [104], which is a collection of 40000 realizations of 
the Universe, each contained within a cubic volume of size 
L �� 1000h���1Mpc. 
(Following cosmologists convention, 
we work in h���1Mpc units, where 1 Mpc ��� 106parsec 
and 
h���1��� 1.4 is used to removea leading scaling.) In particular, 
we use dark matter simulations that have been evolved 
down to redshift zero (today), and contain a set of ���105 
dark matter halos: spheroidal agglomerations of matter in 
which galaxies are known to form. (In this work, we use 
only halos containing at least 64 dark matter particles to 
avoid discreteness effects; these have masses M ��� 5 �� 
1012h���1M���in our baseline simulations.) 
Rather than dealing with the complexities of assigning 
galaxies to dark matter halos as a function of their mass (for 
example, using a halo occupation distribution [105]), we 
use the positions of the dark matter halos as a direct proxy 
for the galaxy positions, which is sufficient for this initial 
study. As such, we do not require the Poisson-Gaussian 
assumptions of Eq. (31), and will utilize the galaxy catalog 
only as a discrete point cloud. In most scenarios, we will 
use the galaxy catalogs extracted from 1000QUIJOTEhigh��� 
resolution simulations, each run with the same underlying 
physical model, but with varying realizations of the 
(stochastic) initial conditions. A section of a typical 
simulation is shown in Fig. 2. We caution that these 
simulations do not fully represent observational data, in 
particular, due to their limited mass resolution and lack of 
(magneto)hydrodynamic effects. However, their simplified 
nature makes them ideal for the proof-of-concept study 
considered herein, since it allows for a large number of 
simulations (and thus determination of accurate covarian- 
ces). Further work will necessarily require application of 
the above tools to higher-resolution simulations, though 
these are fewer in number. 
IV. PHENOMENOLOGICAL 
CLUSTERING STATISTICS 
A. Pair correlation function 
We begin by considering the pair correlation function 
g2��r�� of theQUIJOTEsimulation 
suite. This is estimated 
from the array of galaxy positions using theCORRFUNC 
code [106], which computes the statistic in a set of bins 
with centers frag via 
�� g2��ra�� �� 
1 
N�� ��va X 
N 
i;j��1 ? 
1if jri��� rjjin bin ra 
0else; ��32�� 
where vais the volume of bin a and riis the 3D position of 
galaxy i (accounting for periodic wrapping). In Fig. 3(a), 
we display the obtained g2��r�� functions, alongside corre- 
sponding results from a Poisson random sample with the 
same number density (���1 �� 10���4h3Mpc���4) and volume. 
As expected, the latter is simply unity everywhere, while 
the former shows considerable structure, and is quite 
different to that expected from most simple heterogeneous 
media [1]. On small scales (with r ��� 0.2h���1Mpc, 
consid- 
erablylessthantheaveragegalaxyseparationof 
���8h���1Mpc), g2��r�� decays to zero; this is as expected, 
since the galaxies are of finite size and cannot overlap, 
enforcing some minimum separation. (Physically, galaxies 
can overlap; however, they would be classed as a single 
objectin this paradigm.) The fact the mean galaxy (particle) 
separation is about an order of magnitude greater than the 
minimum pair separation is atypical behavior for most 
DISORDERED HETEROGENEOUS UNIVERSE: GALAXY ���PHYS. REV. X 13, 011038 (2023) 
011038-9 
condensed phase systems in which these two length scales 
are comparable to one another (see Refs. [1,3]). At large 
scales, g2��r�� decays to zero slightly slower than r���4(in 
fact, 
r���3.96), implying that large-scale correlations are sup- 
pressed; since the decay is between r���dand r�����d��1��for 
dimension d �� 3, the system is said to have quasi- 
long-range correlations. This has a physical origin: the 
large-scale behavior of g2��r�� arises from correlations in the 
Universe���s quantum initial conditions, imprinted before 
cosmological inflation. Because of the dynamics of expan- 
sion (and slight breaking of time invariance in ���slow-roll��� 
inflation), these are suppressed on the largest scales. From 
the inset of Fig. 3(a), we note that g2��r�� has considerable 
structure on intermediate scales, with a prominent peak at 
r ��� 100h���1Mpc sourced by acoustic oscillations 14 billion 
years ago [107]. Clearly, the correlation properties of the 
galactic point cloud are very different to those for most 
media; this arises due to the combination of Poisson-like 
placements of galaxies and an underlying background 
stochastic field from the early Universe. 
B. Structure factor 
The structure factor S��k�� tells a similar story as the pair 
correlation function. This is computed by first assigning the 
galaxies to a grid, then computing �� h��k�� via fast Fourier 
transforms, here implemented usingNBODYKIT[108]. From 
Fig. 3(b), we observe a super-Poissonian signature on all 
scales, with a characteristic decline following a peak at 
k ��� 0.05h Mpc���1. This peak (known as the equality peak)

analysis of percolation and connectedness, galaxies are assigned

This section of the paper is discussing how galaxy surveys can be treated as point clouds to apply the statistical tools discussed earlier in Section II. These point clouds refer to the representation of galaxies and their positions in three-dimensional space. The authors point out that traditional analyses often assign these galaxies to a coarse grid and model them as an inhomogeneous Poisson sample. However, this method has some limitations, particularly on small, nonlinear scales where galaxy formation processes become important.
The authors propose an alternative approach, treating the point cloud traced by the galaxies as the fundamental object. This method allows for the application of the clustering techniques discussed in Section II. The authors use data from the QUIJOTE suite, a publicly available suite of simulations of the universe. These simulations include dark matter halos, which are agglomerations of matter where galaxies form.
The authors point out that while these simulations are not entirely representative of observational data, they are suitable for the proof-of-concept study in this paper due to their simplicity and large number, which allows for the calculation of accurate covariances.
The section then moves to discuss the Pair correlation function and Structure factor which are computed from the array of galaxy positions and assigning the galaxies to a grid, respectively. The authors noted atypical behaviors in these parameters when compared to most media, and attribute this to the combination of Poisson-like placements of galaxies and an underlying background stochastic field from the early Universe.

Quantifying information content 
Standard cosmological analyses proceed by measuring a 
set of statistics from a dataset, then comparing them to 
accurate physical models depending on cosmological 
parameters, including those discussed above. If the noise 
properties of the statistics are known (for example, if we 
assert that the distribution of g2is a multivariate Gaussian), 
this comparison can be used to place constraints on the 
underlying parameters via Bayes theorem. A useful esti- 
mate of the constraining power of some statistic X (e.g., g2) 
can be obtained using a Fisher matrix [132], defined as 
FX

where f����g are the set of cosmological parameters

[This limit is saturated if X obeys

utility of statistics such as P2and g2, we need simply 
compute the covariance matrix and the parameter deriva- 
tives appearing in Eq. (35), both of which can be done 
using a set of simulations. Explicitly, given a set of n

While the Fisher forecast is appealing in its simplicity, 
it is not without limitations. Firstly, it gives accurate 
bounds on cosmological properties only if the statistics 
are Gaussian distributed, which can break down in the 
case of large correlations between bins, and the parameter 
posterior is Gaussian, which fails for non-negative param- 
eters, for example. Secondly, a large number of simu- 
lations may be required to compute the quantities in 
Eq. (36), and, if too few are used, the constraining power 
of a given statistic will be overestimated. (This occurs 
since noise in the parameter derivatives add a positive 
definite contribution to the Fisher matrix, and thus reduce 
the size of the inverted matrix, i.e., the output parameter 
variances.) An alternative approach is to use simulation- 
based inference (also known as likelihood-free analysis) 
[133���135]. In essence, this draws a set of cosmological 
parameters �� from some input prior, computes a realiza- 
tion �� X������ for each, and compares a ���true��� dataset to the 
empirical distribution from the simulations. This does not 
make assumptions on the statistics��� noise properties, and, 
in the case of too few simulations, will only underestimate 
the cosmological utility. 
Here, we examine the constraining power of various 
summary statistics using both the Fisher matrix formalism 
(which has become commonplace in cosmology) and 
simulation-based inference (which is far less common, 
though more accurate). In particular, we consider the 
cosmological parameters H0, ��m, ��8, and P 
m��and the 
following descriptors: g2, g3, P2, and HV, all of which can 
be defined for discrete point clouds, such as the galaxy 
density used in this work. For the pair-connectedness 
function, we fix the reduced density to �� ��� �� ����D3=6 �� 0.2, 
which is a useful balance between the uninformative case 
(�� �� 0) and the percolated limit discussed in Sec. V, 
though we note that other choices may yield somewhat 
different results. Additional statistics could be straight- 
forwardly added, though we caution that descriptors such 
as the number variance are fully described by g2, and will 
thus not add additional information. Using theFASTPM 
code [136], we run n �� 512QUIJOTE-like 
dark matter 
simulationswiththefollowingfiducialparameters:

eVg, and compute the four statistics 
for each realization. 
In all cases, we consider only scales above 20h���1Mpc 
(where the simulations are accurate, given the mean 
pairwise separation of ���8h���1Mpc), and choose the radial 
bin sizes to keep the dimensionality fixed to O��100�� 
elements. g2, P2, and HVare computed as before, with 
g3computed using the approach of Ref. [137], involving a 
decomposition into a Legendre multipole basis, with 
components g3;l��r1;r2�� for l ��� f0;1;2;3g. In accordance 
with Sec. III, we compute this statistic in configuration 
space (rather than as a Fourier-space bispectrum), which 
obviates the need to grid the particles. These simulations 
areusedto computethe covariancematrix Cofthe statistics 
using Eq. (36) (initial testing demonstrated that this is a 
sufficient number of simulations to estimate C and its 
inverse robustly, after including the correction factor of 
Ref. [138]), the structure of which is visualized in Fig. 11. 
We find significant correlations both within and between a 
number of statistics. In particular, the individual bins of g3 
and P2are highly correlated, indicating that their noise 
properties may not be Gaussian. In contrast, the void 
nearest-neighbor function has an almost diagonal correla- 
tion matrix, and is seen to be largely independent from 
other statistics. This suggests that it can add significant 
information compared to analyses using g2alone. 
The other ingredient required for Fisher forecasting is the 
set of parameter derivatives. These are computed using 
Eq. (36), with n �� 512 simulations (again computed using 
FASTPM, with a total cost of ���104CPU hours), utilizing 
finite difference in each of the eight sets of parameters. For 
the neutrino mass, we have the bound P 
m��> 0, thus we 
instead utilize one-sided derivatives, following Ref. [104], 
and use the method of Ref. [139] to emulate the effects of 
massive neutrinos by modifying the initial conditions. 
Following this, wecompute theFishermatrixvia 
Eq. (35) for various combinations of statistics. We caution 
that this result appears to retain some dependence on n due 
to residual noise in the parameter derivatives. This will lead 
to the constraints being artificially tightened somewhat; 
however, it is computationally impractical to increase n by 
a significant amount. 
For the simulation-based inference (SBI), we utilize 
asetof8192galaxysimulationscomputedusing 
FASTPMwith the method of Ref. [139] at random locations 
in parameter space, according to the flat priors: H0��� 
��0;100?kms���1Mpc���1, ��m�����0;0.3?, ��8�����0.4;1.2?, P 
m����� 
��0;4? eV. (The neutrino mass limit is significantly weaker 
than the bound from the latest probes [121], but is 
appropriate given the small volume of the simulations.) 
Summary statistics for each are computed as before, and 
fed into theSBIcode, which uses neural networks (via the 
sequential neural posterior estimation method) to compute 
the parameter posterior, given a true observation, taken 
from the mean of the fiducial simulations discussed above.

This text appears to be an excerpt from a research paper that discusses ways to quantify the information content of cosmological data. This paper proposes and discusses two methodologies:
Fisher Matrix Formalism
: The Fisher matrix quantifies how much information an observable quantity (a "statistic" X) carries about the parameters of a theoretical model. The Fisher matrix F is computed using the gradient of X with respect to the parameters, along with the covariance matrix of X. This method is common in cosmology but has limitations, such as assuming the statistics are Gaussian-distributed, which can break down with large correlations between bins.
Simulation-Based Inference (SBI)
: This is a likelihood-free analysis that does not make assumptions on the statistics' noise properties. It utilizes a set of cosmological parameters from an input prior, computes a realization for each, and compares a "true" dataset to the empirical distribution from the simulations. The SBI is considered more accurate, as it only underestimates the cosmological utility in the case of too few simulations.
The paper then applies these methods to calculate the constraining power of various summary statistics such as g2, g3, P2, and HV. The authors discuss their findings in detail, which include the observation that there are significant correlations within and between some of these statistics, potentially limiting their information content. They also note that the void nearest-neighbor function appears to add significant information compared to the g2 analysis alone.
Lastly, the paper discusses the specifics of the simulations they conducted, mentioning they used the FASTPM code and Quijote-like dark matter simulations with fiducial parameters. The paper also mentions that they use the Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE) method in their SBI code, which employs neural networks to compute the parameter posterior. This parameter posterior is computed given a "true" observation, which is taken from the mean of the fiducial simulations.
Please note that the text you provided is fairly technical, and this summary may not fully encapsulate all the nuances of the original research. To fully understand the findings and methodology, reading the full paper is recommended, as it would provide more context and details.

C. Results 
Figure 12 shows the constraints on cosmological param- 
eters from analyses using the pair correlation function and 
pair-connectedness function, both via the Fisher and SBI 
forecasts. From the Fisher forecast, we observe that P2is a 
poor predictor of the expansion rate and matter density, but 
gives much tighter constraints on the clustering amplitude 
and neutrinomass than g2. This is unsurprising: the slope of 
P2��r�� is strongly sensitive to the galaxy clustering proper- 
ties (set by ��8, and, on small scales, P 
m��), but (being a 
monotonic function) contains little information on other 
properties such as early Universe physics. The SBI fore- 
casts give qualitatively similar results, with the P2con- 
straints on H0and ��mbeing largely dominated by the prior, 
with the combined g2�� P2constraints 
reproducing those 
of g2alone, For ��8, P2is again shown to be of considerable 
use, with a significant (factor of a ���2.6��, equivalently to 
observing a 7 times greater volume of space) tightening in 
the one-dimensional posterior found by adding P2, driven 
by the differing degeneracy directions in the ��8��� H0and 
��8��� ��mplanes. In contrary to the Fisher result, the SBI

forecast suggests that the pair-connectedness function does 
not give significant additional information on the neutrino 
mass; however, it is shown to change the ��8��� P 
m�� 
degeneracy direction considerably. 
The disagreement between Fisher and SBI forecasts 
both quantitatively (in terms of the reduction in width of 
the ��8posterior) and qualitatively (whether the P 
m�� 
posterior is affected) may appear a little unsettling. We 
attribute this to a number of reasons: (1) as mentioned 
above, the Fisher forecast will give artificially narrow 
constraints if insufficient simulations have been run, 
(2) the Fisher forecast is inaccurate for parameters whose 
posterior is non-Gaussian (such as the neutrino mass, 
due to the P 
m��> 0 constraint), and (3) the SBI forecasts 
can be artificially broadened by insufficient simulations 
being run. However, the results of Fig. 12 are enough to 
convince us that P2contains significant information 
regarding the clustering amplitude ��8, and its inclusion 
greatly aids cosmological analyses, including via degen- 
eracy breaking with P 
m��. Although we present results 
only for reduced density �� �� 0.2 here, a similar story 
holds also for �� �� 0.1; in this case, the improvements in 
cosmological parameters are somewhat weaker, due to 
thehigher-ordercorrelatorcontributionstoP2��r;���� 
being suppressed [Eq. (27)]. We expect that combining 
measurements of the pair-connectedness function with 
multiple values of �� could further increase the constraining 
power, again at little computational cost. 
It is interesting to compare the cosmological utility of the 
pair-connectedness function to that of other higher-order 
statistics. Before doing so, let us briefly outline our 
predictions. In this test, we are limited to relatively large 
scales (r ��� 20h���1Mpc, 
due to simulation resolution 
effects), where the galaxy distribution (if treated as a 
continuous field) is close to Gaussian. As such, we expect 
the majority of the information content on cosmological 
parameters to be encapsulated by the two- and three-point 
functions, g2and g3, with only a small amount leaking into 
higher-order statistics. In this case, the combination of g2 
with alternative statistics will likely perform worse than 
that of g2and g3; our question is whether there are statistics 
that are able to recoup most of the information present in g3 
in a simpler form (for example, in the unidimensional HV 
and P2statistics). If such a statistic exists, it is likely that it 
also contains significant information on small scales (as 
probed by future surveys such as that of the Subaru 
Prime Focus Spectrograph and the DESI Bright Galaxy 
Survey[140,141]), wheretheperturbativehierarchy 
described above breaks down. Indeed, statistical physics 
provides examples of small-scale systems where g2�� P2

confidence intervals on the various parameters possible from a single galaxy simulation (as in Fig. 2), with the gray regions showing the 
prior used in the simulation-based approach (from 8192 simulations). We show results for four parameters: H0, giving the Universe���s 
expansion rate, the matter density ��m, the clustering amplitude ��8, and the total neutrino mass P 
m��. The diagonal figures give the 
marginalized constraints on single parameters, while the off diagonals show the correlations; e.g., the bottom left-hand panel shows the 
correlation between h and ��8. We find that P2is a poor predictor of H0and ��m(shown by the broad contours), but can tightly constrain 
��8. The combination g2�� P2significantly 
increases the precision by which this parameter can be measured, and we find similar results 
from the Fisher forecasts (which are, in general, overoptimistic), and the simulation-based inference (which is usually conservative).

The results section of the paper presents the constraints on cosmological parameters that were derived using the pair correlation function (g2) and the pair-connectedness function (P2), through the Fisher and simulation-based inference (SBI) forecasts.
The pair-connectedness function P2 showed to be a weak predictor of the universe's expansion rate (H0) and matter density (��m). However, it provided tighter constraints on the clustering amplitude (��8) and neutrino mass (Pm��) than the pair correlation function g2. These observations were anticipated since the slope of P2 is highly sensitive to galaxy clustering properties.
Both Fisher and SBI forecasts yielded qualitatively similar results. The P2 constraints on H0 and ��m were primarily dominated by the prior. Meanwhile, the combined g2 and P2 constraints were similar to those of g2 alone. In contrast to the Fisher results, the SBI forecast indicated that the pair-connectedness function doesn't provide significant additional information on neutrino mass.
The disagreement between Fisher and SBI forecasts, both in terms of the reduction in the width of the ��8 posterior and whether the Pm�� posterior is affected, was attributed to a number of reasons, such as inaccuracies of the Fisher forecast for parameters whose posterior is non-Gaussian and potential broadening of SBI forecasts due to insufficient simulations.
Nonetheless, the study finds P2 to be a useful tool, particularly in providing significant information regarding the clustering amplitude ��8 and helping break degeneracies with Pm��.
The paper also discusses the cosmological utility of the pair-connectedness function compared to other higher-order statistics. It speculates that while most of the information content on cosmological parameters might be encapsulated by the two- and three-point functions (g2 and g3), there might be statistics that could capture most of the information present in g3 in a simpler form. The research proposes combining measurements of the pair-connectedness function with multiple values of �� to increase the constraining power.
The paper's Figure 12 depicts the forecasted constraints on key cosmological parameters using the pair correlation function g2 and the pair-connectedness function P2. The figure concludes that while P2 is a poor predictor of H0 and ��m, it can provide tight constraints on ��8. The combination of g2 and P2 significantly improves the precision of measuring these parameters.

outperforms g2�� g3[91]; 
it will be interesting to study 
such effects further in the future. 
In Fig. 13 we show the Fisher and SBI constraints on the 
same parameter set as above for g2in combination with g3, 
P2, and HV[142]. From both the Fisher and SBI forecasts, 
we find that no additional statistics lead to significant 
improvements in the expansion rate constraints, except for 
a slight tightening from g3. This is not surprising: H0is 
primarily measured from an oscillatory feature in g2arising 
from acoustic waves in the early Universe, which is 
generally absent in other statistics. In the SBI forecast, 
the same is true for the matter density, ��m, and the neutrino 
mass, though the Fisher forecasts disagree on this aspect, as 
above, and should therefore caution is warranted (espe- 
cially given the larger dimensionality of g3). For the 
clustering amplitude ��8, we find similar improvement 
when combining g2with any other statistic, with a slight 
preference for g3in the SBI analysis (or a significant one 
for the Fisher forecast). This matches the above predictions. 
Our conclusion from this exercise is the following: if one 
wishes to constrain the Universe���s clustering amplitude (a 
key target of modern-day cosmology), the addition of P2or 
HVinto cosmological analyses provides an excellent route 
(cf. Ref. [77]), and contains similar information to g3. 
Importantly, the alternative statistics are of much lower 
dimension than g3and P2is much less computationally 
expensive to measure (requiring ���5 CPU minutes per 
simulation, instead of ���1 CPU hour for g3or Hv). If 
one performs the analysis using a combination of pair- 
connectedness functions with different values of ��, the 
results may be stronger still. While this analysis is 
necessarily simplistic and limited to comparatively large 
scales (due to the nature of the simulation suite), it 
nevertheless suggests that the pair-connectedness function 
is a new statistic of significant potential, and could carry 
important information also on small scales. In contrast to 
correlators such as g2and g3[145], this is difficult to model 
analytically even at large r, due to its inherent dependence 
on short-scale physics including the connection between 
galaxies and dark matter. For this reason it will likely prove 
useful to adopt a simulation-based methodology to analyze 
P2, such as the SBI techniques discussed above, and 
marginalize over parameters controlling galaxy formation. 
On small scales, a similar approach is required for any 
statistic, due to the breakdown of perturbative modeling. 
VII. SUMMARY 
In this work, we have considered the application of the 
theory of disordered heterogeneous media and statistical 
mechanics to cosmology, and of cosmology to the former. 
By treating the distribution of galaxies in the present-day 
Universe as a point process, we can analyze the data using 
techniques developed to characterize heterogeneous media, 
such as the correlation functions and nearest-neighbor 
distributions. Furthermore, by augmenting the dataset with 
some concept of ���connectedness��� (here defined by circum- 
scribing the galaxies with spheres), we may utilize various 
clustering diagnostics and pair-connectedness functions, 
which encode a different subset of the information present 
FIG. 13.As Fig. 12 but comparing the constraining power from the combination of the pair correlation function with the pair- 
connectedness function (green), the three-particle correlation function (red), and the void nearest-neighbor function (yellow). The pair- 
connectedness function and void nearest-neighbor functions are found to perform almost as well as the three-particle function in this 
scenario (in terms of constraining ��8) and are much faster to compute and analyze.

within the distribution and additionally allows the perco- 
lation properties to be determined. Such a framework 
(a) provides a novel method for understanding the galaxy 
distribution, whose importance will only grow in the next 
decade with the plurality of upcoming telescopes, and 
(b) demonstrates the applicability of heterogeneous media 
and statistical mechanical techniques in a very different 
regime to that usually explored. 
Our main conclusions are the following. 
(i) The galaxy distribution exhibits very different 
physical properties to those of conventional mate- 
rials, leading to distinct signatures in a wide variety 
of clustering and correlation descriptors. On the 
largest scales, the system approaches hyperuni- 
formity, while on the smallest, it becomes almost 
antihyperuniform and strongly inhomogeneous; 
this dichotomy arises from the fact that the mini- 
mum separation between galaxies is much smaller 
than the mean interparticle distance, with localized 
groups of galaxies separated by vast cosmic 
distance. 
(ii) Physically, the cosmological system has two pecu- 
liarities: (a) although we treat the galaxies as point 
objects, they have some physical scale in practice, 
and cannot overlap, and (b) the distribution carries 
the signatures of a large-scale stochastic back- 
ground that modulates the quasi-Poissonian distri- 
bution; this is sourced by early Universe physics 
and gravitational evolution, 
(iii) Thegalaxypaircorrelationfunctionshows 
this behavior clearly, with the expected hyperuni- 
form tail appearing only at gargantuan scales 
(r ��� 200h���1Mpc), 
and with a sharp peak at the 
mean pairwise particle separation of r ��� 8h���1Mpc. 
This scale separation induces a large number 
variance, which is unusually super-Poissonian on 
small scales, yet sub-Poissonian on the largest. 
These results are consistent with the order metric ��, 
which we determine for the galaxy sample for the 
first time: its value (�� �� 4.85) implies that the 
system is strongly correlated and disordered. The 
nearest-neighborfunctionsareagainconsistentwith 
this picture, with considerably extended tails, a lack 
ofparticlepairsbelowsomecritical galaxysize,and 
much enhanced variance relative to the Poissonian 
case (and most other common scenarios). 
(iv) Analyses of pair-connectedness functions, mean 
particle numbers, and sample-spanning clusters in- 
dicate that the galaxy sample percolates at signifi- 
cantly lower reduced densities than corresponding 
Poisson realizations. For the fiducial galaxy simu- 
lations, finite-scaling analysis gives ��c�� 0.25 in the 
former case compared to ��c�� 0.34 in the latter, a 
difference which is amplified by increasing the 
sample density. This is again supported by the above 
evidence: the scale separation is a consequence of 
the extra small-scale clustering in the galaxy dis- 
tribution which leads to faster percolation. Both 
scenarios appear to have the same critical exponents 
and fractal dimensions, implying that they live in the 
same universality class, despite very different phys- 
ics operating. 
(v) The pair-connectedness function is a conceptually 
straightforward and easy-to-measure statistic that 
carries useful and accessible large-scale information 
about the underlying physical parameters of the 
Universe, and can be trivially extended to small 
scales. This could enhance the cosmological utility 
of future galaxy surveys, in combination with con- 
ventional techniques. Using simulation-based analy- 
sis techniques, we forecast that constraints on 
amplitude of clustering improve by a factor of ���5 
(or ���25 in terms of survey volume) when perform- 
ing inference using the large-scale pair-connected- 
ness and pair correlation functions as opposed to the 
pair correlation function alone (which is standard in 
cosmology). This provides a useful alternative to the 
three-particle correlation function g3, which is of 
significantly lower dimension and much faster to 
model, and is shown to be a resummation of 
correlation functions of all order. Unlike the large- 
scale three-particle function, it seems unlikely that 
P2��r�� can be modeled analytically; simulation-based 
treatments will likely be required in this case. 
The galaxy samples used in this work are purposefully 
simplified, in order to provide a proof-of-concept study 
capturing the essential physical attributes of the cosmo- 
logical setup. More work is needed before the statistics can 
be applied to real data, and will require the following: 
(a) higher resolution simulations containing more particles, 
allowing smaller scales to be probed, (b) inclusion of real 
galaxies in the simulations, rather than dark matter halos, 
and the associated physical uncertainties with their for- 
mation [146,147], (c) anisotropic distortions in the 
Universe created by transforming from redshifts to physi- 
cal coordinates [148], and (d) inhomogeneities in the field 
induced by observational effects, such as the limited field 
of view of the telescope. However, all of these complex- 
ities have been overcome a number of times before for 
other statistics (such as the correlation functions [102]) 
and we expect can be similarly surmounted in this case. 
Furthermore, it is important to characterize how the 
statistics depend on the galaxy sample: for the correlation 
functions, this is well understood (and encapsulated by 
���bias parameters,��� which depend on galaxy mass and 
luminosity), but should be explored further for nearest- 
neighbor and pair-connectedness functions, as well as the 
percolation threshold. distributions, this is far from being the only stochastic 
distribution in the Universe. One additional application 
could include a more principled treatment of cosmic voids 
[10,11]: these are low-density regions in the galaxy dis- 
tribution that form a partition of the space, and could be 
described by the same mathematics as that invoked for 
percolation. Even more relevant is the distribution of 
���bubbles��� of ionized gasaround the first galaxies 
[149,150]. The growth of such bubbles likely led to the 
Universe���s reionization approximately one billion years 
after the big bang, the time of which is set by percolation 
itself. Finally, we note that there are a wealth of techniques 
from the theory of disordered heterogeneous media that 
have not been considered in this work. It would be 
interesting to consider the utility of the various descriptors 
in the context of ���simulated annealing��� [91,151], to under- 
stand the extent to which any statistic can capture the full 
complexities of the field, though we caution that conven- 
tional approaches will likely need to be modified to account 
for the peculiarities of the galaxy distribution, in particular 
its significant scale separation. Further still, we may 
consider how annealing techniques allow us to recover 
���effective pair interactions��� between individual galaxies 
[152], and thus learn more about the Universe���s average 
dynamics.

This excerpt seems to be from a highly specialized scientific paper in the field of cosmology, specifically discussing statistical techniques for analyzing the distribution of galaxies in the Universe. Here's a simplified overview of the main points discussed in this paper:
The researchers propose that the distribution of galaxies in the Universe can be viewed as a point process, similar to disordered heterogeneous media (materials that have irregular, diverse elements).
The paper also mentions pair correlation functions (g2), three-particle correlation function (g3), and pair-connectedness functions as statistical measures that capture information about the distribution and organization of galaxies in the Universe. These are sophisticated statistical tools used to examine the spatial relationships between galaxies.
Using these methods, the researchers found that the galaxy distribution exhibits unique properties compared to conventional materials, with characteristics such as hyperuniformity on larger scales and strong inhomogeneity on smaller scales.
The authors find the pair-connectedness function to be a promising statistic for future galaxy surveys, as it is a relatively straightforward measure that contains useful information about the physical parameters of the Universe. It's easier to model than the three-particle correlation function and can be used alongside conventional techniques for improved understanding.
They conclude that while their study was an effective proof-of-concept, more work is needed before these statistical techniques can be used on real data. These requirements include the use of higher resolution simulations, inclusion of real galaxies rather than just dark matter halos, and dealing with observational complexities.
The researchers also suggest that the techniques discussed in this paper could potentially be applied to other stochastic (randomly determined) distributions in the Universe, such as cosmic voids and the distribution of "bubbles" of ionized gas around the first galaxies.
Remember, this is a high-level summary and the actual research involves complex mathematical analysis and cosmological concepts.

Hello, this is Bing. I see that you are interested in simulation-based inference, a powerful technique for learning from complex models that are difficult or impossible to analyze analytically. Simulation-based inference is the process of finding parameters of a simulator from observations, using a Bayesian approach that returns a full posterior distribution over the parameters, conditional on the observations ��. 

Simulation-based inference has many applications in various domains of science, such as physics, astronomy, biology, and neuroscience. For example, simulation-based inference can be used to infer cosmological parameters from observations of the large-scale structure of the universe ����, or to estimate the properties of dark matter and haloes from simulations of gravitational clustering ���. Simulation-based inference can also be used to compute statistics of interest from simulated data, such as the three-point correlation function of galaxies ���, or to correct for biases in the estimation of model parameters from noisy data ���.

There are different methods and algorithms for performing simulation-based inference, such as likelihood-free inference, approximate Bayesian computation, neural density estimation, and active learning. These methods aim to overcome the challenges of simulation-based inference, such as the high computational cost of running simulations, the difficulty of evaluating the likelihood function, and the curse of dimensionality. If you want to learn more about these methods and how they work, you can check out some of the resources I found for you:

Sure, I see that you are looking to connect the previous discussions on statistical mechanics, heterogeneous media theory, and cosmology with the concept of simulation-based inference. Here's how they are interrelated:
Statistical Mechanics
: This field is concerned with explaining macroscopic phenomena from microscopic rules. For example, the behavior of gases is derived from the statistics of large ensembles of particles. In cosmology, similar principles are used to understand the large-scale structure of the universe from fundamental physics. In simulation-based inference, the "microscopic rules" are often embodied in the simulator, which generates data given certain parameters. The goal is to infer these parameters given observed data, much as one might infer the properties of a gas from observing its macroscopic behavior.
Heterogeneous Media Theory
: This theory deals with materials that are non-uniform or 'heterogeneous' in nature, like porous rocks or composite materials. In cosmology, the universe can be considered a heterogeneous medium, with its distribution of matter varying across scales. This distribution can be quantified using tools like the two-point correlation function. In simulation-based inference, one might use a simulator to generate realizations of such a universe and then use the observed data (like galaxy surveys) to infer the underlying parameters.
Cosmology
: This is the study of the universe on the largest scales. It heavily uses statistical mechanics and heterogeneous media theory to make sense of observations like the cosmic microwave background radiation or the distribution of galaxies. Simulation-based inference in cosmology often involves running simulations of the universe with different parameters, comparing the results of these simulations to actual observations, and using this comparison to infer the most likely parameters of our universe.
Simulation-based inference is a powerful tool that unifies these concepts. It provides a method to infer underlying parameters from complex models (like those used in statistical mechanics or cosmology) based on observed data. In essence, it's a way of learning about the universe (or any other system being studied) when the model of that system is too complex to analyze analytically.

Connections with the following: Here are some summaries of the articles you requested:

[59] D. Hexner and D. Levine, Hyperuniformity of Critical Absorbing States, Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 110602 (2015). 

This article studies the properties of the absorbing states of nonequilibrium models that belong to the conserved directed percolation universality class. The authors find that at the critical point, the absorbing states are hyperuniform, meaning that they have anomalously small density fluctuations. They also propose a scaling relation between the hyperuniformity exponent and other known exponents, and introduce a new correlation length related to this phenomenon. The article suggests that these results may have implications for photonic band-gap materials.

[60] S. Torquato and J. Kim, Nonlocal Effective Electromagnetic Wave Characteristics of Composite Media: Beyond the Quasistatic Regime, Phys. Rev. X 11, 021002 (2021). 

This article derives exact nonlocal expressions for the effective dielectric constant tensor of disordered two-phase composites and metamaterials from first principles. The authors extend the conventional homogenization estimates of the effective dynamic dielectric constant tensor for arbitrary microstructures so that they can capture spatial dispersion well beyond the quasistatic regime, where the frequency and wavevector of the incident radiation are comparable to the inverse characteristic heterogeneity length scale. They do this by using nonlocal strong-contrast expansions that account for multiple scattering to all orders and incorporate microstructural information via the spectral density. The article validates the accuracy of these approximations by comparing them to full-waveform simulation methods for various models of composite media. The article also shows that disordered hyperuniform media are less lossy than their nonhyperuniform counterparts, and that some disordered hyperuniform particulate composites exhibit novel wave characteristics.

[61] B. Widom, Equation of State in the Neighborhood of the Critical Point, J. Chem. Phys. 43, 3898 (1965). 

This article proposes a specific form for the equation of state of a fluid near its critical point. The author introduces a function ��(x,y), where x is a measure of the temperature and y is a measure of the density. The author suggests that in a real fluid, ��(x,y) is a homogeneous function of x and y, with a positive degree of homogeneity. This leads to a nonclassical compressibility, which is determined by the degree of homogeneity of ��. The article also derives a relation between the critical exponents for the degree of the critical isotherm, the degree of the coexistence curve, and the compressibility index. The article accounts for the experimental data on the locus of inflection points in the pressure-density isotherms, and shows that under certain conditions, the specific heat on the critical isochore has a logarithmic singularity at the critical temperature.

[62] L.P. Kadanoff, Scaling Laws for Ising Models Near Tc, Physics 2, 263 (1966). 

This article analyzes the Ising model near its critical point in order to understand how correlations between the order parameter in different regions of the lattice scale when the temperature and the applied magnetic field are changed. The author uses a model based on dividing the Ising model into cells that are microscopically large but much smaller than the coherence length, and then using
the total magnetization within each cell as a collective variable. The article derives Widom's homogeneity condition on the singular part of the free energy and some of his results for interfaces as a consequence of these scaling arguments based on this model.

[63] M.E. Fisher, The Theory of Equilibrium Critical Phenomena, Rep. Prog. Phys. 30, 615 (1967). 

This article reviews the theory of critical phenomena in systems at equilibrium, with emphasis on
the values of the critical point exponents ��, ��, ��,..., and their interrelations. The author discusses
the general features of phase transitions and critical phenomena, such as scaling laws,
renormalization group transformations, universality classes, and asymptotic expansions. The
article also covers some specific models and methods for studying critical phenomena, such as
the Ising model, lattice gas models, Mayer cluster expansions, field-theoretic methods,
perturbation theory, and exact solutions.

[64] K.G. Wilson and J. Kogut, The Renormalization Group and the �� Expansion,
Phys. Rep. 12, 75 (1974).

This article presents an overview of the renormalization group approach to critical phenomena
and its application to calculate critical exponents using an expansion in �� = 4 ��� d , where d is
the dimensionality of space. The authors explain how renormalization group transformations
can be used to eliminate irrelevant variables and focus on relevant ones near a fixed point,
which corresponds to a phase transition or a scaling regime. The article also discusses some
examples of renormalization group calculations for various models and systems, such as the
Ising model, the Heisenberg model, the O(n) symmetric model, the n-vector model, and
fluids.

[65] J.J. Binney, N. J. Dowrick, A. J. Fisher, and M. E.J. Newman, The Theory of Critical
Phenomena: An Introduction to the Renormalization Group (Oxford University Press,
Oxford, England, 1992).

This book is an introductory text on the theory of critical phenomena and the renormalization
group method. The book covers the basic concepts and techniques of critical phenomena,
such as phase transitions, order parameters, critical exponents, scaling laws, universality
classes, and mean-field theory. The book also introduces the renormalization group method
and its applications to calculate critical exponents and scaling functions for various models
and systems, such as the Ising model, the n-vector model, the Landau-Ginzburg model, and
fluids. The book also discusses some advanced topics, such as finite-size scaling,
non-equilibrium critical phenomena, and quantum phase transitions.

Hyperuniformity in One-Dimensional Substitution Tilings, Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A A75,
3 (2019).

This article investigates the hyperuniformity and anti-hyperuniformity properties of one-
dimensional substitution tilings, which are aperiodic structures generated by repeated
application of a substitution rule to a finite set of tiles. The authors show that these tilings can
be classified into four types according to their spectral properties: hyperuniform with a pure
point spectrum, hyperuniform with a singular continuous spectrum, anti-hyperuniform with a
singular continuous spectrum, and anti-hyperuniform with an absolutely continuous spectrum.
The authors also derive formulas for the spectral density and the structure factor of these tilings,
and provide examples of each type of tiling. The article suggests that these tilings may serve as
models for understanding hyperuniformity and anti-hyperuniformity in higher dimensions.

Sure, here's how the mentioned papers are interconnected and how they relate to the previously discussed topics.
Statistical Mechanics & Heterogeneous Media Theory
: The statistical mechanics principles are quite relevant in the papers about hyperuniformity and effective electromagnetic wave characteristics of composite media. The paper on "Hyperuniformity of Critical Absorbing States" studies the behavior of nonequilibrium models in a critical state using statistical mechanics principles. Similarly, the paper on "Nonlocal Effective Electromagnetic Wave Characteristics of Composite Media" also uses principles from statistical mechanics to understand the behavior of composite media, which are examples of heterogeneous media. This study can be connected to our previous discussion on heterogeneous media theory.
Statistical Mechanics & Cosmology
: The papers on the theory of critical phenomena and phase transitions directly use statistical mechanics principles to understand large scale behavior in physical systems. This connection between microscopic properties and macroscopic phenomena is central to both statistical mechanics and cosmology. Additionally, the renormalization group approach to critical phenomena, as discussed in the Wilson and Kogut paper, has also found extensive use in cosmology.
Simulation-based Inference
: This can be connected to these papers in that simulation-based inference might be used to generate and analyze data from the models discussed in these papers, such as the Ising model, the n-vector model, or the Landau-Ginzburg model, mentioned in Binney et al.'s book. Moreover, the renormalization group, a key method discussed in these papers, is a computational technique that can be seen as a form of simulation-based inference.
In summary, these papers delve into topics that combine principles of statistical mechanics, heterogeneous media theory, and cosmology and also involve the use of methods related to simulation-based inference. These connections between different fields help us understand the universe's nature, from the smallest particles to the largest scales.

Can we also use Ising models to model the distribution of CMB as in resonant chamber baryonic acoustic oscillations?

The Ising model is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics, which describes a system of dipole moments that can be in one of two states (+1 or -1). This model's simplicity and solvability make it a cornerstone of statistical mechanics, and it's often used to understand phase transitions.
The distribution of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation and the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) are cosmological phenomena that arise from the physics of the early universe. The BAO, in particular, are fluctuations in the density of the visible baryonic matter (normal matter) of the universe on large scales.
While the Ising model provides a framework for understanding systems with binary states and their phase transitions, applying it directly to model the distribution of the CMB or the BAO would not be straightforward.
The reasons include:
The Ising model is essentially a quantum mechanical model of ferromagnetism. Its correspondence to the cosmological phenomena such as the CMB or BAO, which are outcomes of gravitationally driven evolution of matter density perturbations in the expanding universe, is not straightforward.
The Ising model is a discrete model dealing with "spins" on a lattice, while the CMB and BAO involve continuous fields (temperature, density) in continuous space.
The physical processes that lead to the CMB and the BAO distributions involve General Relativity, quantum field theory in curved spacetime, and thermodynamics in the early universe. The Ising model, while it has a phase transition like the early universe's transition from a hot, dense state to a cooler, less dense state, does not naturally incorporate these physics.
The statistical properties of CMB and BAO are usually studied using the tools of quantum field theory and General Relativity, rather than statistical mechanics models like the Ising model.
However, it is essential to note that analogies between different physical systems have often proved beneficial in theoretical physics. While the Ising model may not be used directly to model CMB or BAO, insights from it and similar simple models might aid in understanding the complex phenomena in cosmology, such as phase transitions in the early universe. For instance, the concepts of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the related field-theoretic (including Ising model-based) techniques have found crucial applications in cosmology.
Still, the Ising model has seen use in various areas outside of ferromagnetism, for example, in neural networks, protein folding, social dynamics, and more, thanks to its simplicity and versatility. But using it to model CMB or BAO would require considerable theoretical creativity and a set of non-trivial assumptions.

Quantum simulation of transverse Ising models with Rydberg atoms

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Schauss, Peter

2018-04-01

Quantum Ising models are canonical models for the study of quantum phase transitions (Sachdev 1999 Quantum Phase Transitions (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press)) and are the underlying concept for many analogue quantum computing and quantum annealing ideas (Tanaka et al Quantum Spin Glasses, Annealing and Computation (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press)). Here we focus on the implementation of finite-range interacting Ising spin models, which are barely tractable numerically. Recent experiments with cold atoms have reached the interaction-dominated regime in quantum Ising magnets via optical coupling of trapped neutral atoms to Rydberg states. This approach allows for the tunability of all relevant terms in an Ising spin Hamiltonian with 1/{r}6 interactions in transverse and longitudinal fields. This review summarizes the recent progress of these implementations in Rydberg lattices with site-resolved detection. Strong correlations in quantum Ising models have been observed in several experiments, starting from a single excitation in the superatom regime up to the point of crystallization. The rapid progress in this field makes spin systems based on Rydberg atoms a promising platform for quantum simulation because of the unmatched flexibility and strength of interactions combined with high control and good isolation from the environment.

Quantum transverse-field Ising model on an infinite tree from matrix product states

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Nagaj, Daniel; Farhi, Edward; Goldstone, Jeffrey; Shor, Peter; Sylvester, Igor

2008-06-01

We give a generalization to an infinite tree geometry of Vidal��������s infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) algorithm [G. Vidal, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 070201 (2007)] for simulating an infinite line of quantum spins. We numerically investigate the quantum Ising model in a transverse field on the Bethe lattice using the matrix product state ansatz. We observe a second order phase transition, with certain key differences from the transverse field Ising model on an infinite spin chain. We also investigate a transverse field Ising model with a specific longitudinal field. When the transverse field is turned off, this model has a highly degenerate ground state as opposed to the pure Ising model whose ground state is only doubly degenerate.

Dynamical quantum phase transitions in extended transverse Ising models

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Bhattacharjee, Sourav; Dutta, Amit

2018-04-01

We study the dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) manifested in the subsequent unitary dynamics of an extended Ising model with an additional three spin interactions following a sudden quench. Revisiting the equilibrium phase diagram of the model, where different quantum phases are characterized by different winding numbers, we show that in some situations the winding number may not change across a gap closing point in the energy spectrum. Although, usually there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the change in winding number and the number of critical time scales associated with DQPTs, we show that the extended nature of interactions may lead to unusual situations. Importantly, we show that in the limit of the cluster Ising model, three critical modes associated with DQPTs become degenerate, thereby leading to a single critical time scale for a given sector of Fisher zeros.

The set of abstracts you have shared discuss the applications of the Ising model in various contexts, focusing on quantum Ising models, which indeed have a broad range of applications in the study of quantum phase transitions, quantum computing, quantum annealing, etc.
The first abstract discusses the implementation of the quantum Ising model using cold atoms optically coupled to Rydberg states, which allows for the simulation of an Ising spin Hamiltonian. This progress has paved the way for utilizing Rydberg atom-based spin systems as a platform for quantum simulation.
The second abstract involves the generalization of an algorithm for simulating a line of quantum spins to an infinite tree geometry. It discusses the investigation of the quantum Ising model in a transverse field on the Bethe lattice using the matrix product state ansatz and notes the observed phase transition.
The third abstract explores the dynamical quantum phase transitions in an extended Ising model with additional three-spin interactions. It notes the unique features resulting from the extended interactions and the degeneracy of critical modes in the limit of the cluster Ising model.
The last abstract, although not fully provided, seems to discuss the probing of strong correlations in the quantum Ising model using light scattering.
While these studies indeed extend the application of Ising models into the quantum realm and are highly relevant to modern areas of research such as quantum computing and quantum phase transitions, their connection to Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation or Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) is not immediate or straightforward. The phenomena of CMB and BAO are fundamentally rooted in cosmology and General Relativity, and are less connected to the quantum phenomena that quantum Ising models primarily deal with.
That said, the broad applicability of the Ising model means it's not impossible that techniques or insights from these quantum Ising model studies could, in some way, inform or inspire methods for analyzing or understanding cosmological phenomena like the CMB or BAO. However, such connections would likely be indirect and would require significant theoretical development.

The researchers here are studying a specific form of the Ising model known as the quantum Ising model in a transverse field. This model is relevant to quantum physics and is used to describe magnetism at a quantum level. In this model, spins can exist in a quantum superposition of states, and the "transverse field" introduces quantum fluctuations that can drive quantum phase transitions.
The researchers are studying this model on a Bethe lattice, which is a specific kind of mathematical structure (graph) that's often used in statistical mechanics. It's a type of infinite tree, with all nodes having the same number of connections (branches), except for those on the boundary. The advantage of a Bethe lattice is that it simplifies calculations and can often give qualitative insights into more complicated systems.
The "matrix product state ansatz" is a numerical method used to approximate the state of a quantum system. It's especially useful in one-dimensional systems, and can handle systems where quantum entanglement is important.
In their study, the researchers observed a "second order phase transition," which is a phase transition characterized by a continuous change in the order parameter and an associated divergence in the correlation length. This is unlike a first order phase transition, which involves a discontinuous change in the order parameter.
The "key differences" mentioned from the transverse field Ising model on an infinite spin chain are not detailed in the given abstract, but could involve changes in the behavior of the order parameter, critical exponents, or other quantities of interest as the system transitions from one phase to another.
The researchers also looked at a version of the transverse field Ising model that includes a "longitudinal field". This term adds an additional direction of magnetic field along the "z" direction in addition to the transverse field. The longitudinal field would tend to align the spins in its direction, competing with the effects of the transverse field.
The ground state of a quantum system is its lowest energy state. When the transverse field is turned off in this model, the ground state becomes "highly degenerate," which means there are many quantum states that all have the same minimum energy. This is in contrast to the pure Ising model, where the ground state is only "doubly degenerate" ��� meaning there are just two states with the same minimum energy, corresponding to all spins aligned in one direction or the opposite.

Unconventional quantum antiferromagnetism with a fourfold symmetry breaking in a spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg pentagonal chain

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Kar���������ov����, Katar����na; Stre����ka, Jozef; Lyra, Marcelo L.

2018-03-01

The spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg pentagonal chain is investigated with use of the star-triangle transformation, which establishes a rigorous mapping equivalence with the effective spin-1/2 Ising zigzag ladder. The investigated model has a rich ground-state phase diagram including two spectacular quantum antiferromagnetic ground states with a fourfold broken symmetry. It is demonstrated that these long-period quantum ground states arise due to a competition between the effective next-nearest-neighbor and nearest-neighbor interactions of the corresponding spin-1/2 Ising zigzag ladder. The concurrence is used to quantify the bipartite entanglement between the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg spin pairs, which are quantum-mechanically entangled in two quantum ground states with or without spontaneously broken symmetry. The pair correlation functions between the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg spins as well as the next-nearest-neighbor and nearest-neighbor Ising spins were investigated with the aim to bring insight into how a relevant short-range order manifests itself at low enough temperatures. It is shown that the specific heat displays temperature dependencies with either one or two separate round maxima.

The Ising model coupled to 2d orders

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Glaser, Lisa

2018-04-01

In this article we make first steps in coupling matter to causal set theory in the path integral. We explore the case of the Ising model coupled to the 2d discrete Einstein Hilbert action, restricted to the 2d orders. We probe the phase diagram in terms of the Wick rotation parameter ���� and the Ising coupling j and find that the matter and the causal sets together give rise to an interesting phase structure. The couplings give rise to five different phases. The causal sets take on random or crystalline characteristics as described in Surya (2012 Class. Quantum Grav. 29 132001) and the Ising model can be correlated or uncorrelated on the random orders and correlated, uncorrelated or anti-correlated on the crystalline orders. We find that at least one new phase transition arises, in which the Ising spins push the causal set into the crystalline phase.

In the first paper, the authors explore a system known as the spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg pentagonal chain, using a technique called the star-triangle transformation. This is a tool used to transform the geometry of the model in a way that simplifies calculations.
The "fourfold broken symmetry" mentioned refers to the existence of four distinct equivalent ground states in the system, which is a signature of what's called "unconventional quantum antiferromagnetism." This is interesting because typical antiferromagnets (materials in which adjacent spins align in opposite directions) have only a twofold degenerate ground state.
The authors also discuss the concept of entanglement between Heisenberg spin pairs in these ground states. Entanglement is a uniquely quantum mechanical property that allows particles to have correlated properties, even when they are far apart.
The second paper talks about a theoretical investigation of the Ising model coupled to 2D orders, which are 2D versions of a structure called a causal set. Causal sets are used in certain approaches to quantum gravity as a way to discretize spacetime.
In this context, the Ising model is being used as a simple model of matter, and it's being coupled to the gravity-like behavior of the 2D orders. The phase diagram here refers to the different behaviors the system can show as the parameters (the Ising coupling 'j' and Wick rotation parameter '��') are varied.
In this model, the matter and gravity components together lead to a rich phase structure with five different phases, including a phase transition where the Ising spins push the causal set into a crystalline phase. This investigation represents a first step toward including matter in the path integral approach to causal set theory, which is a promising candidate for a theory of quantum gravity.

Localization and Symmetry Breaking in the Quantum Quasiperiodic Ising Glass

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Chandran, A.; Laumann, C. R.

2017-07-01

Quasiperiodic modulation can prevent isolated quantum systems from equilibrating by localizing their degrees of freedom. In this article, we show that such systems can exhibit dynamically stable long-range orders forbidden in equilibrium. Specifically, we show that the interplay of symmetry breaking and localization in the quasiperiodic quantum Ising chain produces a quasiperiodic Ising glass stable at all energy densities. The glass order parameter vanishes with an essential singularity at the melting transition with no signatures in the equilibrium properties. The zero-temperature phase diagram is also surprisingly rich, consisting of paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and quasiperiodically alternating ground-state phases with extended, localized, and critically delocalized low-energy excitations. The system exhibits an unusual quantum Ising transition whose properties are intermediate between those of the clean and infinite randomness Ising transitions. Many of these results follow from a geometric generalization of the Aubry-Andr���� duality that we develop. The quasiperiodic Ising glass may be realized in near-term quantum optical experiments.

Statistical mechanics of the cluster Ising model

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Smacchia, Pietro; Amico, Luigi; Facchi, Paolo; Fazio, Rosario; Florio, Giuseppe; Pascazio, Saverio; Vedral, Vlatko

2011-08-01

We study a Hamiltonian system describing a three-spin-1/2 clusterlike interaction competing with an Ising-like antiferromagnetic interaction. We compute free energy, spin-correlation functions, and entanglement both in the ground and in thermal states. The model undergoes a quantum phase transition between an Ising phase with a nonvanishing magnetization and a cluster phase characterized by a string order. Any two-spin entanglement is found to vanish in both quantum phases because of a nontrivial correlation pattern. Nevertheless, the residual multipartite entanglement is maximal in the cluster phase and dependent on the magnetization in the Ising phase. We study the block entropy at the critical point and calculate the central charge of the system, showing that the criticality of the system is beyond the Ising universality class.

Transverse fields to tune an Ising-nematic quantum phase transition

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Maharaj, Akash V.; Rosenberg, Elliott W.; Hristov, Alexander T.; Berg, Erez; Fernandes, Rafael M.; Fisher, Ian R.; Kivelson, Steven A.

2017-12-01

The paradigmatic example of a continuous quantum phase transition is the transverse field Ising ferromagnet. In contrast to classical critical systems, whose properties depend only on symmetry and the dimension of space, the nature of a quantum phase transition also depends on the dynamics. In the transverse field Ising model, the order parameter is not conserved, and increasing the transverse field enhances quantum fluctuations until they become strong enough to restore the symmetry of the ground state. Ising pseudospins can represent the order parameter of any system with a twofold degenerate broken-symmetry phase, including electronic nematic order associated with spontaneous point-group symmetry breaking. Here, we show for the representative example of orbital-nematic ordering of a non-Kramers doublet that an orthogonal strain or a perpendicular magnetic field plays the role of the transverse field, thereby providing a practical route for tuning appropriate materials to a quantum critical point. While the transverse fields are conjugate to seemingly unrelated order parameters, their nontrivial commutation relations with the nematic order parameter, which can be represented by a Berry-phase term in an effective field theory, intrinsically intertwine the different order parameters.

Universal scaling for the quantum Ising chain with a classical impurity

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Apollaro, Tony J. G.; Francica, Gianluca; Giuliano, Domenico; Falcone, Giovanni; Palma, G. Massimo; Plastina, Francesco

2017-10-01

We study finite-size scaling for the magnetic observables of an impurity residing at the end point of an open quantum Ising chain with transverse magnetic field, realized by locally rescaling the field by a factor ���� ����� 1 . In the homogeneous chain limit at ���� =1 , we find the expected finite-size scaling for the longitudinal impurity magnetization, with no specific scaling for the transverse magnetization. At variance, in the classical impurity limit ���� =0 , we recover finite scaling for the longitudinal magnetization, while the transverse one basically does not scale.

These articles further explore the rich behaviors possible in systems described by variants of the Ising model, especially in the context of quantum systems.
The first paper discusses a version of the quantum Ising model that includes quasiperiodic modulation, which leads to a type of localization that can prevent the system from reaching equilibrium. This system exhibits a phase called the quasiperiodic Ising glass, which has long-range order that is stable across all energy densities and does not exist in equilibrium states. In particular, the system can transition into a paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, or quasiperiodically alternating ground state.
The second paper considers a system with three-spin-1/2 clusterlike interaction in competition with an antiferromagnetic Ising-like interaction. It is found that this system undergoes a quantum phase transition between an Ising phase and a cluster phase. Interestingly, any two-spin entanglement vanishes in both phases, but there remains multipartite entanglement which varies across the phases.
The third paper shows how a transverse field, a perpendicular magnetic field or strain, can be used to tune a system towards a quantum critical point. This work focuses on the example of orbital-nematic ordering of a non-Kramers doublet. They found that the transverse fields have nontrivial commutation relations with the nematic order parameter.
In the last paper, the finite-size scaling of the magnetic observables of an impurity located at the end point of an open quantum Ising chain is studied. They found that finite-size scaling is violated for intermediate values of the transverse magnetic field. This could be explained by the appearance of a second, impurity-related length scale. This study also provides a mapping between the quantum Ising chain with an end-point impurity to a classical Ising model.

Connections with the following topics: Interactionless Ising Model for Galaxy Bias: We talked about a study by Andrew Repp that used an analogy to the Ising model of ferromagnetism to build a model for galaxy bias. This model seeks to more accurately understand how galaxies trace the underlying distribution of dark matter in the Universe.

ChatGPT
The connection between the Ising model and the interactionless model for galaxy bias proposed by Andrew Repp comes from the use of statistical mechanics concepts to model complex systems. The Ising model, originally developed to study ferromagnetism, has been used in a variety of different fields to model systems where binary decision states are involved and the interaction between neighboring states is significant.
Repp's galaxy bias model, in analogy with the Ising model, attempts to describe how galaxies trace the distribution of dark matter in the universe. In this model, galaxies are treated like spins in an Ising model, occupying either an 'up' or 'down' state. The galaxies 'decide' their state based on the underlying dark matter field. If a particular region of space has a high density of dark matter, a galaxy is more likely to form there ('up' state), whereas a region with low dark matter density is less likely to form a galaxy ('down' state).
The term "interactionless" in this context refers to the fact that the galaxies (or spins, in the Ising model analogy) do not interact with each other, but only with the underlying dark matter field. This is in contrast to the traditional Ising model, where spins interact with their nearest neighbors. The interactionless model for galaxy bias is a simplification, but it can help to understand the general behavior of galaxies in relation to the underlying dark matter field.
By studying the distribution of galaxies and how it traces the dark matter field, researchers hope to better understand the structure of the universe and the nature of dark matter itself. This is one example of how concepts from statistical mechanics, such as the Ising model, can be applied to cosmology to develop new theoretical frameworks.

Two-State Model for Galaxy Bias: This is another model proposed by Andrew Repp and Istv��n Szapudi. The model is based on the idea that dark matter subhaloes can exist in two distinct states - hosting a galaxy or not. It suggests that galaxies are more likely to form in regions with higher dark matter densities. The model has been found to perform well at scales less than 10 h���1 Mpc and above 30 h���1 Mpc, and it also works well for both high and low-density regions of the Universe.

The Two-State Model for Galaxy Bias proposed by Andrew Repp and Istv��n Szapudi is an attempt to better understand the relationship between the distribution of galaxies and the underlying dark matter field in the universe. The model is based on a simple but powerful assumption: dark matter "subhaloes" (regions of higher dark matter density) can exist in one of two states. They can either host a galaxy, or not host a galaxy.
In this model, galaxies are more likely to form in regions with higher dark matter densities. This makes intuitive sense, as areas with higher concentrations of matter would have a stronger gravitational pull, which can trigger the formation of galaxies.
The state of a subhalo (whether it hosts a galaxy or not) is determined probabilistically. The probability depends on the local density of dark matter. Higher densities have higher probabilities of hosting a galaxy. This is similar to the Ising model in statistical mechanics, where a 'spin' (analogous to a subhalo) can be in one of two states, and the probability of each state depends on the local magnetic field (analogous to the dark matter density).
The two-state model for galaxy bias has been found to perform well at certain scales, specifically less than 10 h^���1 Mpc (Mega parsecs) and above 30 h^���1 Mpc. It also works well for both high and low-density regions of the Universe, making it a versatile tool for cosmological studies.
By establishing a link between the local dark matter density and the probability of galaxy formation, this model offers a new perspective on galaxy formation and the role of dark matter. It could also help improve our understanding of the large-scale structure of the Universe.

Model of Void Formation: This model, proposed by Friedmann and Piran, focuses on the formation of cosmic voids - large underdense regions in the Universe. According to this model, the under-density of galaxies in voids is a product of gravitational expansion of negative density perturbation and a bias in galaxy formation. The model also indicates a preference for ��CDM models and suggests that the underdensity of dark matter inside voids is less than the underdensity of galaxies.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The Model of Void Formation by Friedmann and Piran is a theoretical framework that addresses the formation of cosmic voids, which are expansive regions of the universe that are significantly less dense than the average, with fewer galaxies and a lower concentration of dark matter.
The model suggests that these voids form through a two-step process:
Gravitational Expansion of Negative Density Perturbations: Cosmic voids begin as regions where the density of matter (both ordinary and dark matter) is slightly below the average. As the universe evolves, these regions grow due to gravitational expansion, becoming even larger and more underdense.
Bias in Galaxy Formation: Once the regions of underdensity have expanded, they also become less conducive to galaxy formation. This is because galaxies typically form in regions with higher densities of matter where gravitational forces can pull matter together. In the sparse environment of a cosmic void, this process is less likely to occur.
The end result of these two processes is a region of the universe with few galaxies and a lower density of matter - a cosmic void.
Interestingly, this model suggests that the underdensity of galaxies in voids is greater than the underdensity of dark matter. In other words, while voids have fewer galaxies and less dark matter compared to other regions, the drop in the number of galaxies is more pronounced than the drop in dark matter density.
The Friedmann and Piran model also aligns well with the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (��CDM) cosmological model, which is the leading theoretical model for the evolution of the universe. The alignment with the ��CDM model adds to the validity of their model of void formation.

Galaxy Surveys: We mentioned several galaxy surveys including the upcoming Euclid and WFIRST missions. These surveys help to provide observational constraints on cosmology, but interpreting their data requires reliable models of galaxy bias.

ChatGPT
Galaxy surveys play an essential role in modern cosmology. By observing and cataloging vast numbers of galaxies across the universe, these surveys provide invaluable data about the large-scale structure of the universe, the distribution of dark matter, the rate of cosmic expansion, and other key aspects of cosmology.
Two upcoming missions that are expected to provide a wealth of new data are Euclid and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly known as WFIRST).
Euclid: This is a European Space Agency mission, in collaboration with NASA, set to launch in 2023. The mission aims to better understand the nature of dark energy and dark matter by accurately measuring the acceleration of the universe. Euclid will survey a large portion of the sky, mapping the 3D distribution of billions of galaxies.
Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope: This is a NASA mission set to launch in the mid-2020s. The mission aims to investigate dark energy, dark matter, exoplanet exploration, and infrared astrophysics. The telescope will have a wide field of view, enabling it to survey a large area of the sky.
However, to make sense of the vast amounts of data these surveys will provide, researchers need to use reliable models of galaxy bias. Galaxy bias refers to the fact that galaxies are not a perfectly random sampling of matter in the universe - instead, they tend to be found in regions with higher densities of matter. Understanding and modeling this bias is crucial for accurately interpreting data from galaxy surveys and using it to answer cosmological questions.

Bias Models: We discussed conventional linear and quadratic bias models, which work well in high-density regions but yield unphysical results for voids.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Bias models are used to relate the distribution of galaxies to the distribution of dark matter in the Universe. When we observe the Universe, we cannot directly see dark matter, so we must infer its distribution from the distribution of galaxies. However, galaxies do not trace dark matter perfectly - they are biased tracers. This is because galaxy formation is a complex process influenced by a variety of factors, such as the dark matter density, baryonic physics, and feedback processes.
The simplest bias model is the linear bias model, which posits that the galaxy density contrast (the difference between the local galaxy density and the mean galaxy density) is proportional to the dark matter density contrast. This model is often a good fit for large scales and high-density regions, but it is less accurate for small scales and low-density regions (e.g., cosmic voids).
The quadratic bias model is a straightforward extension of the linear model that includes a term proportional to the square of the dark matter density contrast. This model can provide a better fit to the data for moderate-density regions, but it still gives unphysical results for low-density regions. In particular, it predicts negative galaxy densities in voids, which is not physically meaningful.
Both of these models are local bias models, meaning they only consider the local density of dark matter. There are also non-local bias models, which consider the influence of the broader environment, and scale-dependent bias models, which allow the bias to vary with scale. All of these models are simplifications of the true, complex process of galaxy formation, but they can still provide useful insights into the large-scale structure of the Universe.

Dark Matter and Dark Energy: These were discussed in the context of cosmological models and the formation and composition of voids in the universe.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Dark Matter and Dark Energy are two fundamental components of our current understanding of the Universe, and they play significant roles in cosmological models and phenomena, including the structure and evolution of the Universe.
Dark Matter is a form of matter that does not interact with light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation, making it impossible to detect directly with current instruments. However, its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, including stars and galaxies. In cosmology, dark matter is crucial for structure formation. It's believed to form a cosmic web in the Universe, with galaxies forming in the densest regions.
Dark Energy, on the other hand, is a hypothetical form of energy that permeates all of space and is believed to be the reason for the accelerated expansion of the Universe. It was introduced to reconcile the observed large-scale properties of the Universe with the laws of physics.
In the context of voids - large, relatively empty regions of the Universe - both Dark Matter and Dark Energy play crucial roles. The formation and evolution of these voids are believed to be driven largely by the gravitational effects of Dark Matter. Meanwhile, Dark Energy, with its repulsive gravity, could be influencing the expansion and growth of these voids. Understanding these phenomena requires models that accurately account for the effects of both Dark Matter and Dark Energy.

Fermi���Dirac distribution and Ising model: These statistical and physical models were mentioned as mathematical frameworks used in the construction of the two-state model for galaxy bias.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The Fermi-Dirac distribution and the Ising model are two key mathematical models used in the field of statistical physics, and they have been applied to a wide variety of physical systems.
The Fermi-Dirac distribution is a statistical law describing the distribution of particles over energy states in systems consisting of many identical particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle, crucial for understanding the behavior of fermions (particles with half-integer spin, like electrons), states that no two fermions can be in the same quantum state simultaneously. In other words, each energy state can be occupied by at most one fermion. The Fermi-Dirac distribution is crucial in explaining a variety of quantum phenomena, including the behavior of electrons in metals and semiconductors.
The Ising model, on the other hand, is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. The model consists of discrete variables (spins) that represent magnetic dipole moments of atomic spins that can be in one of two states (+1 or -1). The spins are arranged in a lattice, allowing each spin to interact with its neighbors. The Ising model is used to describe phase transitions, as the system can switch from a disordered state to an ordered state where spins align together, a process similar to ferromagnetic materials becoming magnetized.
The application of these models to galaxy bias represents an innovative approach. In the two-state model proposed by Repp and Szapudi, galaxies and regions of the Universe are treated similarly to particles in the Fermi-Dirac distribution or spins in the Ising model. Each region can be in one of two states: hosting a galaxy or not. This approach may provide valuable insights into the complex phenomenon of galaxy formation and distribution.

In a novel approach, researchers are studying the universe's emptiest spaces, known as cosmic voids, to solve two significant mysteries in cosmology. The first issue pertains to the Hubble constant, the rate of the universe's expansion, which has been a subject of debate for over a decade due to conflicting measurements. 

The second problem involves the varying measurements of cosmic matter's "clumpiness", which describes the average density of large-scale structures, dark matter, galaxies, gas, and voids across the universe over time.

The study of cosmic voids can indeed provide important insights into both of these cosmological problems.
Cosmic voids, vast regions of space with fewer galaxies and lower matter density than the average, can help to shed light on the Hubble constant problem because they can be used as a "standard ruler" for cosmic distance measurements. By comparing the apparent size of voids to their true size, as determined by redshift, cosmologists can infer the rate of cosmic expansion.
The distribution and evolution of voids can also provide valuable information about the universe's "clumpiness". As structures grow and evolve due to gravitational collapse, they leave behind voids that expand and evolve over time. By studying the distribution of voids, cosmologists can infer the underlying matter density field, which is key to understanding the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and the laws of gravity.
These approaches are still being refined and the data from large-scale surveys of the cosmos is being analyzed. However, the results of these studies could potentially reconcile the conflicting measurements of the Hubble constant and the "clumpiness" of the universe, leading to a more accurate and complete picture of the nature of the universe and its evolution.
However, it should be noted that the study of cosmic voids presents its own challenges, such as accurately defining void boundaries and understanding the effects of observational biases in galaxy surveys. Hence, while cosmic voids hold much promise as cosmological tools, there is still much work to be done to fully utilize their potential.

Every cosmic void is a window on a great cosmic conflict. On one side, there���s dark energy, the mysterious force that causes our universe to expand ever more quickly. Dark energy is present even in empty space, so it dominates the physics of the void. On the other side of the conflict there���s gravity, which attempts to pull the void together. And then matter���s clumpiness adds wrinkles to the voids.

ChatGPT
That's an apt description of the cosmic struggle that shapes the universe as we know it. Let's break it down:
Dark Energy: As you rightly pointed out, dark energy is a mysterious force that accelerates the expansion of the universe. Despite making up approximately 68% of the universe, its nature and origins remain largely unknown. Dark energy is everywhere, even within the vast emptiness of cosmic voids. Its presence exerts a pressure that pushes space apart.
Gravity: This fundamental force counteracts the effect of dark energy by pulling matter together. It is the force responsible for the formation of stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters. It's the glue holding cosmic structures together.
Matter's Clumpiness: The universe isn't filled evenly with matter. Instead, matter is "clumpy," aggregated into galaxies and clusters of galaxies interspersed with vast cosmic voids. This inhomogeneity is largely due to gravity, which draws matter together into clumps, and dark energy, which drives these clumps apart, increasing the size of the voids.
Within cosmic voids, the expansion of the universe is most apparent because the effect of gravity is minimal, allowing dark energy to dominate. So, studying these voids helps astrophysicists to understand the properties and effects of dark energy and gravity.
At the same time, the way galaxies form and cluster on the outskirts of these voids (adding wrinkles to their boundaries) provides clues about the clumpiness of matter in the universe, the effects of gravity on large scales, and how these factors influence the evolution of the universe. In a sense, cosmic voids act as laboratories for studying the competing influences of dark energy, gravity, and matter clumpiness.

Pisani and her colleagues, including Sofia Contarini of the University of Bologna, modeled how the expansion of the universe would affect the number of voids of different sizes. In their model, which kept a handful of other cosmological parameters constant, a slower expansion rate produced a higher density of smaller, more crumpled voids. On the other hand, if expansion was faster and matter didn���t clump as readily, they expected to find more large, smooth voids.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Indeed, the research conducted by Pisani, Contarini, and their team is groundbreaking in the sense that it focuses on cosmic voids, often overlooked in cosmological studies.
In their model, the rate of expansion of the universe significantly influences the size and distribution of these voids. This stems from the fundamental tug of war between gravity and dark energy.
A slower expansion rate would mean that gravity has had more time to act on matter, leading to increased "clumping" and the formation of smaller, more "crumpled" voids. These voids would be relatively more numerous because they occupy less volume individually.
Conversely, if the expansion rate was faster, there would be less time for gravity to pull matter together. Therefore, matter would not clump as readily, leading to fewer, larger, and smoother voids.
By comparing the distribution of void sizes predicted by their model with observations from galaxy surveys, Pisani and her team could infer the rate of expansion of the universe and provide insights into the relative influences of dark energy and gravity. This approach could provide an independent measure of the Hubble constant and add valuable data to the ongoing debate about the universe's expansion rate.

The team led by Alice Pisani and Sofia Contarini is employing a novel approach to solve key mysteries in cosmology, focusing on the universe's vast and largely empty spaces known as cosmic voids.
These voids are influenced by two opposing cosmic forces: dark energy, which drives the accelerating expansion of the universe, and gravity, which works to pull matter together. The researchers proposed that the rate of the universe's expansion directly impacts the size and distribution of these voids.
In scenarios where the universe's expansion is slower, gravity has more time to clump matter together, resulting in more numerous, smaller, and more irregular voids. However, if the universe expands faster, less clumping occurs, leading to fewer but larger and smoother voids.
By examining the sizes and distribution of voids from observational data and comparing it to their model, Pisani and her team aim to better understand the rate of the universe's expansion, contributing valuable information to the ongoing debate about the Hubble constant, and shedding light on the mystery of matter's "clumpiness" in the universe.
