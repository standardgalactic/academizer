Everyone from physicists like Michio Kaku to Marvel superheroes propagate the idea of the multiverse - an infinite set of parallel universes. But Jacob Barandes argues that any talk of multiverses is nothing more than wild speculation, be it in quantum mechanics or cosmology, and that physicists and philosophers are not doing the public a service by suggesting otherwise.

 

���Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.��� ���Carl Sagan

Our solar system is only a small part of an enormous galaxy, and our universe is filled with many billions of other galaxies. These are extraordinary claims, but we have extraordinary evidence to back them up, including vast amounts of direct photographic data from telescopes.

Readers may have heard that according to a particular interpretation of quantum theory, we���re living in a ���quantum multiverse��� consisting of parallel realities that exist ���in superposition.��� And according to certain lines of research coming out of string theory, our observable universe is only a small part of a vast ���cosmic multiverse��� containing other regions of space in which the fundamental laws of physics are substantially different.

These are extraordinary claims, too, but we don���t have extraordinary evidence for them ��� not by a long shot. As such, any talk of multiverses ��� whether the quantum kind or the cosmic kind ��� is nothing more than wild speculation at this point. With all due respect, physicists and philosophers are not doing the public a service by suggesting otherwise, even when they include caveats.

The multiverse under fire
By Alexis Papazoglou

The Incompleteness of "Textbook" Quantum Theory
Before I can explain the motivation behind the idea of a quantum multiverse, I���ll need to talk about the axiomatic formulation of quantum theory, as introduced by Paul Dirac and John von Neumann in the 1930s. The Dirac-von Neumann axioms are a set of basic principles that form the operational core of most textbook treatments of quantum theory today. Accordingly, I���ll refer to this basic version of the theory as ���textbook quantum theory.���

The first half of the Dirac-von Neumann axioms collectively assert that when we model a physical system using textbook quantum theory, we���re supposed to introduce a specific collection of esoteric mathematical entities, which I���ll describe in more detail later. If the physical system is closed off from exchanging information with its environment, then we���re supposed to regard these mathematical entities as functions of time according to the Schr��dinger equation.

___

This point merits reiterating: no experiment has ever actually seen an atom in two places at once, let alone a cat being both alive and dead, and the Dirac-von Neumann axioms do not say such things, either.

___

The ingredients of the second half of the Dirac-von Neumann axioms consist of prescriptions for turning these mathematical entities into predictions about measurement outcomes, probabilities of measurement outcomes, and statistical averages of measurement outcomes weighted by probabilities of measurement outcomes.

I keep repeating the term ���measurement outcomes��� here because the only connection the Dirac-von Neumann axioms make between textbook quantum theory and the real world is through measurement outcomes, measurement-outcome probabilities, and statistical averages of the former over the latter. The Dirac-von Neumann axioms don���t make any statements about anything else in the real world.

In particular, the Dirac-von Neumann axioms don���t support oft-heard statements that an atom can be in ���two places at once,��� or that a cat can be ���alive and dead��� at the same time. This point merits reiterating: no experiment has ever actually seen an atom in two places at once, let alone a cat being both alive and dead, and the Dirac-von Neumann axioms do not say such things, either.

When physicists and philosophers sometimes speak this way, they���re extrapolating both beyond the axiomatic ambit of textbook quantum theory and also beyond the bounds of present-day empirical science, perhaps to make quantum theory seem more colorful. Again, the textbook theory says nothing about phenomena of any kind happening except for measurement outcomes, their probabilities, and their statistical averages.


This state of affairs is far from ideal. Before the development of quantum theory, science painted a much richer world-picture, one in which all sorts of phenomena really happen. Today, scientists talk of, say, asteroids crashing into planets, and birds engaging in foraging behavior, among other examples. Textbook quantum theory, at least by itself, doesn���t permit such talk, which falls categorically outside the scope of the textbook theory���s axioms.

Worse, the Dirac-von Neumann axioms treat measurements as abstract, primordial events, without providing a definition of what actually counts as a measurement. The famous ���measurement problem��� refers to this gap in the textbook theory. Students are usually told they should know a measurement when they see one, and to ���shut up and calculate,��� in the words of the physicist David Mermin.

Sometimes students are instead told that the Schr��dinger equation can become a measurement process when there are enough interacting particles in the system, through the invocation of a mathematical transformation called ���decoherence.��� Attempts to use decoherence to provide an axiomatic definition of a measurement remain controversial to this day.

It���s not hard to explain why. Any such attempt would require augmenting textbook quantum theory with an additional set of rigorous axioms connecting decoherence with an acceptable definition of a measurement, a definition ensuring that a definite measurement outcome is singled out from the set of all possible measurement outcomes. These additional axioms would need to be proven to be internally consistent, as well as consistent with the Dirac-von Neumann axioms.

There have been many hand-waving arguments in these directions over the past century. To sidestep the inherently approximate nature of decoherence, these arguments often appeal to unphysical idealizations, like pretending that one can carry out ���infinitely many experiments,��� or that physical systems have ���infinitely many degrees of freedom.��� But, so far at least, no one has constructed a robust and compelling axiomatic definition of a measurement that has achieved the desired ends and has won widespread agreement.

Keep in mind that providing an acceptable axiomatic definition of a measurement isn���t even the final goal, but only the first step. After finding such a definition, one would still need to explain how that definition could justify talk of all sorts of phenomena happening, like asteroids crashing or birds foraging, beyond the narrow case of measurements specifically.

The inevitable conclusion here is that as useful and predictive as textbook quantum theory is, it is not a complete physical theory, let alone a theory that can explain or account for why we can credibly talk of phenomena happening all around us.

Wavefunctions, State Vectors, and the Multiverse
Fortunately, attempting to use decoherence to build a rigorous definition of a measurement isn���t the only available approach for resolving the textbook theory���s incompleteness. The most obvious alternative is to try to turn textbook quantum theory into a theory that describes phenomena really happening ��� phenomena that go beyond mere measurements alone. But there is not yet a consensus on how to change the textbook theory in this way.

The Dirac-von Neumann axioms describe definite measurement outcomes that occur probabilistically. The simplest and most obvious class of approaches take this probabilistic behavior seriously. These approaches involve reformulating quantum theory as a statistical description of a stochastic underlying reality ��� an underlying reality of phenomena truly happening, in a probabilistic way. (Full disclosure: I work on such approaches myself.)

There is good historical precedent for these statistical-stochastic approaches. Over a century ago, physicists reconceptualized thermodynamics as a statistical description of large numbers of particles bouncing around. Statistical-stochastic approaches to quantum theory would also be in keeping with our human experience of phenomena happening, if sometimes probabilistically.

An alternative class of approaches start by taking the mathematical entities from the first half of the Dirac-von Neumann axioms and reifying them ��� that is, insisting they���re metaphysically real things. These approaches are essentially a form of mathematical Platonism ��� they���re akin to postulating that the number 7 or the Pythagorean theorem are objects that exist ontologically.

Most of the approaches in either the statistical-stochastic class or the mathematical-Platonist class are intended to make the same empirical predictions as textbook quantum theory, as defined by the Dirac-von Neumann axioms. It follows that as long as experiments continue to show perfect agreement with the predictions of textbook quantum theory, there will be no empirical evidence favoring any one of these alternative approaches over any of the others. Arguments in favor of any one approach will therefore have to be non-empirical in character, and will reflect their advocates��� personal philosophical preferences.

Although Werner Heisenberg and Albert Einstein were usually on opposite sides in debates over quantum theory, one thing they agreed on was that they both strongly disliked Schr��dinger���s view

___

Among the class of approaches that embrace mathematical Platonism, one such approach reifies a specific kind of mathematical entity called a ���state vector,��� and denies the existence of pretty much anything else. State vectors are abstract mathematical entities that belong to multidimensional vector spaces called ���Hilbert spaces.���

One can generally translate a given state vector into an associated mathematical object, called a ���wave function,��� which is defined on yet another abstract space known as a ���configuration space.��� A configuration space is a set of possibilities.

As an example, a single particle has three coordinates, x,y,z, so a single quantum-mechanical particle has a configuration space that mathematically resembles the three-dimensional physical space with which we���re intimately familiar. Consequently, students learning quantum theory for the first time are often led to believe that wave functions ���live in physical space.���

However, for a system of N particles, each particle contributes three coordinates, so the system���s configuration space is correspondingly 3N-dimensional. But a 3N-dimensional configuration space is not the same thing as physical space.

In his early papers on quantum theory in the late 1920s, Erwin Schr��dinger took the view that wave functions are physical things, and even intimated that configuration spaces are just as real as three-dimensional physical space. Although Werner Heisenberg and Albert Einstein were usually on opposite sides in debates over quantum theory, one thing they agreed on was that they both strongly disliked Schr��dinger���s view.

Many people are familiar with Einstein���s famous statement in a 1926 letter to Max Born about refusing to believe that God plays dice with the universe. Most people don���t know that Einstein���s very next statement in the letter was an expression of dismay over the idea that wave functions in 3N-dimensional configuration space ought to be treated as physical objects.

Nowadays, many physicists use the terms ���state vector��� and ���wave function��� interchangeably, despite the subtle differences between them. I���ll do the same for the rest of this essay.

 

The Schr��dinger equation implies that state vectors change into increasingly ornate blends of other state vectors as a function of time. Eventually one obtains a ���superposition��� of uncountably many state vectors.

From this starting point, advocates of the state-vector-only approach proceed to construct a tower of speculative hypotheses on top of each other.

Their first speculative metaphysical hypothesis is the mathematical-Platonist claim that we ought to be reifying mathematical things like state vectors to begin with, and essentially regarding them as the only ingredients of physical reality.

Their next speculative hypothesis is that one can extend this state-vector-only approach from atomic systems to the entire universe as a whole ��� an extrapolation in distance scales of at least a factor of 1036. To be clear, that���s a 1 followed by 36 zeros, or a billion billion billion billion. For purposes of comparison, there have been roughly 1017 seconds since the Big Bang.

There���s a pop-science version of the many-worlds interpretation in which each time someone carries out a measurement, the universe splits neatly into a countable number of new universes ��� say, two, or three, or ten. Newcomers to Everettian quantum theory, I beseech you: read the fine print.

___

One of the first people to take this extrapolation seriously was a physics PhD student at Princeton named Hugh Everett, whose 1957 thesis was originally titled ���The Theory of the Universal Wave Function.��� This overall approach has therefore come to be known as ���Everettian quantum theory,��� to distinguish it from textbook quantum theory.

One obvious threat to this extrapolation is that on astronomically large distance scales, gravity becomes a major player in the universe, and despite a century of effort, physicists don���t yet have a comprehensive theory that fully unifies quantum theory with gravity. For all we know, quantum theory breaks down on astronomically large scales, taking Everettian quantum theory down with it.

To be fair, this extrapolation hypothesis is at least somewhat physical ��� it���s a claim about the applicability of a known physical theory to larger-scale regimes.

On top of the speculative hypotheses in the tower so far, Everettian quantum theory adds another ��� that by an appeal to the notion of ���emergence,��� one can somehow get uncountably many universes to arise from superpositions of state vectors. These universes make up the purported quantum multiverse, and they���re responsible for Everettian quantum theory���s more familiar name: the ���many-worlds interpretation.���

There���s a pop-science version of the many-worlds interpretation in which each time someone carries out a measurement, the universe splits neatly into a countable number of new universes ��� say, two, or three, or ten. Newcomers to Everettian quantum theory, I beseech you: read the fine print.

If you do, you���ll learn that this cartoon version does not accurately reflect the way Everettian quantum theory actually works. The claimed world-picture turns out to be far murkier and less conceptually coherent. According to Everettian quantum theory, each passing moment in time leads to an amorphous profusion of ���emergent��� universes that can���t be counted in any definitive sense.

The speculative metaphysical hypotheses can���t afford to stop there, because textbook quantum theory makes predictions about probabilities of measurement outcomes. Everettian quantum theory therefore has to find a way to account for those probabilities.

To that end, the next speculative metaphysical hypothesis is that although the many worlds physically coexist simultaneously in an uncountable ���blob,��� some worlds have ���higher probabilities��� than others. This supposition bears an uncanny resemblance to the famously paradoxical line from Orwell���s book Animal Farm that ���all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.���

The claim that probability can be derived ab initio from Everettian quantum theory has been the subject of a great deal of controversy. One of the most basic features of probabilities is that we apply them to a set of possible events in which one event in the set occurs and the other events in the set don���t. For the objective kinds of probabilities typically used in scientific theories, another basic feature is that we can make our experimental results converge to our probabilistic predictions as closely as needed by performing sufficiently many experimental trials.

___

Advocates of Everettian quantum theory have written many papers and long books to try to get their arguments off the ground. But none of that should distract from a basic and rather obvious point: a tower of speculative metaphysical hypotheses does not constitute extraordinary evidence.

___

Everettian quantum theory denies both these features of probabilities. According to Everettian quantum theory, all possible outcomes actually occur with certainty somewhere in the quantum multiverse, and repeating an experiment just leads to more and more worlds that exhibit arbitrarily large deviations from our probabilistic predictions. For instance, according to Everettian quantum theory, no matter how many times you flip a quantum coin, there will always be worlds in which the coin comes up heads every single time.

Advocates of Everettian quantum theory have tried to parry these counterarguments in a variety of ways. One way is to take on yet another set of speculative metaphysical hypotheses about what constitutes ���rational observers��� ��� how they ought to think, how they ought to behave, and how they ought to place bets on future events, given their ���self-locating uncertainty��� about where they are in the quantum multiverse. Those familiar with Hume���s ���is-ought dilemma��� might not be surprised to hear that this strategy requires introducing more axioms.

The 18th-century philosopher David Hume argued persuasively that an ���ought��� statement cannot be derived solely from ���is��� axioms, but requires including ���ought��� axioms. For example, you can���t logically argue that one ought not steal based solely on the axiom that stealing is the taking of someone else���s property without permission ��� you also need to add an axiom that one ought not take someone else���s property without permission.

Similarly, arriving at statements about how observers ought to behave requires augmenting quantum theory with suitably defined ���ought��� axioms. The standard Everettian proposal is to take background axioms of rational decision-making that were first introduced centuries ago in the context of living in a single universe, and re-appropriate all this classical decision theory to the case of a quantum multiverse.

The trouble, of course, is that in a quantum multiverse, there are countless observers who act in all sorts of ways ��� some ���rationally��� and some ���irrationally,��� in the sense of the Everettian version of decision theory. The rational ones will assign probabilities in one way, and the irrational ones will assign probabilities in a different way (or not at all), and it���s hard to say much more. There is no mechanism for weeding out irrational observers in a quantum multiverse, or explaining why ���rational��� observers end up in worlds that line up correctly with their predictions, as opposed to finding themselves in worlds that don���t.

One can���t even make predictions about what ���we��� would see if Everettian quantum theory were correct, and whether what ���we��� would see is consistent with present-day scientific observations. In a quantum multiverse, there would be uncountably many copies of ���us,��� and those copies would see all kinds of things.

The many worlds fantasy
By Philip Ball

Advocates of Everettian quantum theory have written many papers and long books to try to get their arguments off the ground. But none of that should distract from a basic and rather obvious point: a tower of speculative metaphysical hypotheses does not constitute extraordinary evidence.

If anything, such a tower of assumptions is a clear sign of weakness for a theory. Indeed, to the extent that each speculative metaphysical hypothesis should reduce our overall confidence in the theory, a tall tower of them should make our confidence collapse altogether.

Given Sagan���s credo that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, we should therefore treat the extraordinary claim that we���re living in a vast quantum multiverse of uncountably many universes as the wild speculation that it is.

The Cosmic Multiverse
At this point in time, our best two theories of fundamental physics are the Standard Model, which provides a precise description of all the known non-gravitational forces within the scope of textbook quantum theory, and general relativity, Einstein���s theory of gravity. These two theories can actually be combined when gravitational fields are weak, but don���t fit neatly together when gravitational fields are very significant.

Physicists have worked for a century to combine these two theories into one self-consistent and fully comprehensive theory of ���quantum gravity.��� These efforts have led to a number of interesting developments, including some theories, like string theory, in which the laws of physics can vary from place to place in the universe.

However, none of these theories are definitive, and none have been confirmed by experiments of any kind. Unless and until we obtain experimental evidence in favor of a theory in which the laws of physics can vary from one region of the universe to another, any talk of other universes with different laws of physics is purely speculative, and should be treated as such.

The universe is an amazing place. It���s filled with wonders that should generate awe in all those who study it. Again, I have the utmost respect for my colleagues, but when some of them blur the distinction between reliable scientific theories and wild speculations, they risk diminishing the wonders we���re confident are out there. They also risk generating confusion in the public���s understanding of science, and there���s never been a time when we could afford to do that

Jacob Barandes, a lecturer in Physics at Harvard University, provides a critical perspective on the concept of the multiverse in his article from November 13, 2023. He challenges the notion of both the quantum multiverse, which emerges from interpretations of quantum theory, and the cosmic multiverse suggested by string theory. Barandes argues that these ideas remain speculative due to the lack of extraordinary evidence, which is a necessity for extraordinary claims, as emphasized by Carl Sagan.
Barandes delves into the foundations of quantum theory, particularly the Dirac-von Neumann axioms, to illustrate that the theory is primarily concerned with measurement outcomes and their probabilities, rather than sensational claims like atoms being in two places at once or Schr��dinger's cat being simultaneously alive and dead. He critiques the theory's inability to define what constitutes a measurement and its reliance on abstract concepts like state vectors and wave functions, which are mathematical constructs rather than physical entities.
In discussing Everettian quantum theory, or the many-worlds interpretation, Barandes points out that this approach is built on speculative metaphysical hypotheses, stretching the application of quantum theory far beyond its empirically tested limits. He emphasizes that without experimental evidence to support these extrapolations, they should be considered as speculative.
Barandes also touches on the challenges in combining quantum theory with gravity, a key step in developing a comprehensive theory of quantum gravity. He notes that while theories like string theory propose variations in the laws of physics across different regions of the universe, they remain unconfirmed and speculative without experimental evidence.
In conclusion, Barandes stresses the importance of distinguishing between reliable scientific theories and wild speculations. He expresses concern that blurring this distinction risks confusing the public's understanding of science and detracts from the genuine wonders of the universe that are well-established and understood.

What is no-collapse theory?
Nuspeak Translator
The "no-collapse" theory in quantum mechanics refers to interpretations where the wave function, a mathematical representation of a quantum system, doesn't collapse during a measurement. In standard quantum mechanics, the wave function collapse is used to explain how a quantum system seemingly adopts a definite state when observed or measured.
In the no-collapse interpretations, such as the Many-Worlds Interpretation or the De Broglie-Bohm Theory, the wave function is viewed as always evolving in a deterministic and unitary way according to the Schr��dinger equation, without ever collapsing. These interpretations avoid the notion of a special or mysterious process occurring during measurement. Instead, they propose alternatives for understanding quantum phenomena without the need for a wave function collapse:
Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI):
This interpretation, proposed by Hugh Everett III, suggests that all possible outcomes of quantum measurements are realized in a vast, or potentially infinite, ensemble of parallel universes. In this view, the universe continually splits into multiple copies for each possible outcome, with each outcome happening in its own separate universe. There is no collapse; instead, every possible state of the wave function is realized in some universe.
De Broglie-Bohm Theory, or Pilot-Wave Theory:
This interpretation reintroduces determinism into quantum mechanics. It suggests that particles have definite positions and velocities at all times, guided by a "pilot wave." This wave evolves according to the Schr��dinger equation without collapse, and it determines the trajectories of particles. In this view, the apparent randomness of quantum mechanics arises from our inability to know the initial conditions of particles precisely.
The no-collapse theories maintain a consistent mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics but diverge in their philosophical and conceptual interpretations of what quantum mechanics implies about reality. While these interpretations avoid some of the paradoxes and conceptual difficulties of the standard Copenhagen interpretation (which involves wave function collapse), they introduce their own unique challenges and implications for our understanding of the universe.
You
I think I prefer Quantum Bayesianism,  which implies that what collapses is our uncertainty or ignorance as well as the limitations of the measuring tools
Nuspeak Translator
Quantum Bayesianism, also known as QBism, is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that applies the principles of Bayesian probability to quantum theory. In this view, the quantum state and the wave function collapse are seen as representations of an observer's knowledge or beliefs about a quantum system, rather than objective properties of the system itself.
Here are some key points about Quantum Bayesianism:
Subjective Probability:
QBism treats the probabilities that arise in quantum mechanics as subjective degrees of belief, similar to the Bayesian interpretation of probability in statistics. This contrasts with interpretations where probabilities represent inherent uncertainties in nature.
Observer's Knowledge:
The wave function in QBism is not an objective state of the system but a mathematical tool for the observer to express their expectations about the outcomes of measurements. It encapsulates the observer's information and uncertainties about the system.
Measurement and Collapse:
In QBism, a measurement outcome is a personal experience for the observer. The "collapse" of the wave function is not a physical transformation of the quantum system, but an update of the observer's knowledge and beliefs upon receiving new information. This update is analogous to a Bayesian update in probability theory.
Resolution of Paradoxes:
By emphasizing the role of the observer and their knowledge, QBism aims to sidestep some of the paradoxes and interpretative issues of quantum mechanics, such as the measurement problem and the reality of the wave function.
Role of Measurement Tools:
QBism acknowledges the limitations and roles of measurement tools. The tools are not just passive recorders but are integral to the process of measurement, influencing the observer's knowledge and the subsequent Bayesian update.
QBism is a unique and somewhat controversial interpretation because it places subjective experience and knowledge at the heart of quantum theory. This subjectivity is a departure from traditional views in physics that strive for an objective description of nature. However, proponents of QBism argue that this interpretation provides a more coherent and practical understanding of quantum mechanics, especially in dealing with complex quantum phenomena.

Give a QBist interpretation of a coin flip with one experimenter blindfolded who hears it called out after it lands, and another who has a 10,000 frame camera and is watching it. I suspect the one with the blindfold will be uncertain for longer
Nuspeak Translator
In the context of QBism (Quantum Bayesianism), the scenario of the coin flip with two different observers ��� one blindfolded and the other with a high-speed camera ��� highlights how quantum states and probabilities are a reflection of each observer's knowledge and belief about the system, rather than intrinsic properties of the system itself.
For the blindfolded observer, the coin flip represents a situation with significant uncertainty. This person has no visual information about the coin's trajectory or outcome. Their quantum state for the coin ��� which in QBism is a representation of their personal belief or information ��� would assign 50% probability to heads and 50% to tails, reflecting their maximal uncertainty about the outcome until it's called out.
In contrast, the observer with the high-speed camera has a different experience. They can watch the coin's trajectory frame by frame. As the coin flips and falls, this observer gathers more information about its likely outcome. Their quantum state for the coin ��� again, a reflection of their belief and information ��� evolves as they observe the coin. They can update their probabilities in real-time, potentially reaching near certainty about the outcome before the coin even lands.
Once the coin lands and the outcome is called out, the blindfolded observer updates their belief state ��� their "quantum state" in QBist terms ��� based on this new information. This is analogous to a Bayesian update in probability theory, where new evidence (the coin's outcome) is used to update prior beliefs. The uncertainty collapses at this point for the blindfolded observer, not because the physical state of the coin has changed, but because their knowledge about it has been updated.
For the observer with the camera, the actual calling out of the result may have little to no impact on their belief state, as they might have already reached a high degree of certainty about the outcome through observation.
In summary, from a QBist perspective, the "collapse" of the wave function or the resolution of uncertainty in this scenario is entirely about the observers updating their knowledge and beliefs about the coin's state. The moment of "collapse" ��� the resolution of uncertainty ��� occurs at different times for the two observers, reflecting their differing access to information about the coin's state.

I would say that there is never moment in which Shrodinger's cat is dead and alive at the same time, but dies if and when the poison from the vial reaches its vital organs. In an early version, the decay of an atom triggers the breaking of the vial. One doesn't know if the cat is alive because the half life of the chosen radioactive element is 50 % of the box check interval. In another version a gun inside the box triggers the vial, which can be heard outside the box, so our uncertainty is limited by the speed of sound, and the dissipation speed of the poison. In a third version, we show that it can be knowledge of the outside world that constrains our uncertainty by placing a source food water and toys inside the box and opening if  every 7.5 years which migh know approximately half the lifespan of a cat. We can adjust our probabilities knowing the cat might also live shorter then if it had social interaction, and we can have a textbook on cat physiology and a coroner to examine the body after the box is opened
Nuspeak Translator
Your interpretation of Schr��dinger's cat thought experiment aligns more with a classical, realist perspective on quantum mechanics rather than the more abstract interpretations like the Copenhagen interpretation or QBism. In your view, the cat's fate is determined by classical, physical events (such as the dispersion of poison or the mechanics of a gun), and uncertainty is tied to the observer's knowledge or lack thereof about these events.
Here's how each of your versions illustrates this perspective:
Radioactive Decay Trigger:
In the traditional Schr��dinger's cat setup, the cat's fate is tied to a quantum event - the decay of a radioactive atom. The cat is considered both alive and dead until an observation is made. In your view, however, the cat is either alive or dead based on whether the atom has decayed and released the poison, not on the observer's knowledge. The uncertainty about the cat's state is due to the observer's lack of information about whether the decay has occurred.
Gun Trigger:
In this version, the trigger of the poison can be heard. This setup changes the nature of the experiment from a purely quantum uncertainty to a scenario where information is available but limited (by the speed of sound, for example). Here, the observer's uncertainty is not about the quantum state but about the processing of available classical information.
Life Span with External Factors:
This version introduces external, classical factors (food, water, toys) and considers the natural lifespan of the cat. The uncertainty about the cat's state is based on probabilistic knowledge of biology and environmental factors, rather than quantum superposition. The observer adjusts their expectations based on external knowledge and observations, such as the cat's potential for a reduced lifespan due to isolation.
In all these versions, the focus shifts from quantum indeterminacy to classical uncertainty due to incomplete information. This perspective is consistent with a more deterministic view of physics, where events are definitively one way or another, and "uncertainty" or "superposition" is a statement about our knowledge or lack thereof, not about the reality of the cat's condition. This approach aligns more closely with interpretations like QBism, where the quantum state is a reflection of an observer's knowledge and belief, rather than with interpretations that consider superposition as a fundamental aspect of reality.
You
I was thinking that it was the alternative predictions that were in superposition, in the case of coin flip a more Bayesian interpretation would be to flip the coin multiple times to five out whether it a weighted coin, or a six sided die that only has happened to land on two of the sides
Nuspeak Translator
In the context of QBism (Quantum Bayesianism), your approach to the coin flip or dice roll scenario aligns well with the interpretation's emphasis on subjective probabilities and the role of an observer's knowledge and experience in shaping their expectations about a quantum system.
In QBism, the concept of superposition is not about the physical states of the system being in multiple states at once, but rather about the observer's uncertainty and the range of possible outcomes they consider likely based on their knowledge. When you mention flipping a coin multiple times or rolling a six-sided die that has only been observed to land on two sides, you're essentially describing a process of Bayesian updating ��� refining your beliefs and probabilities based on accumulating evidence.
Coin Flip:
In the case of flipping a coin multiple times, a QBist would interpret this as gathering data to update their beliefs about whether the coin is fair (equally likely to land on heads or tails) or weighted. Initially, without any prior knowledge, one might assign a 50-50 probability to heads or tails. However, as the coin is flipped repeatedly, the observer updates their probability based on the outcomes observed. If the coin consistently lands on one side, the observer's belief would shift towards thinking the coin is weighted.
Dice Roll:
Similarly, for a six-sided die that has only been observed to land on two sides, an observer using QBist reasoning would start with an initial belief (perhaps that each side has an equal probability of 1/6 if they assume the die is fair). As they roll the die and observe outcomes, they update this belief. If only two sides ever come up, the observer's probabilities adjust to reflect this new information, perhaps leading them to believe the die is biased or altered.
In both cases, the superposition in QBist terms is about the range of possible outcomes and the observer's beliefs about these outcomes, which evolve with each new piece of evidence. This is distinct from the more traditional quantum superposition, which suggests that a system exists in all possible states simultaneously until measured. QBism replaces this objective uncertainty with subjective uncertainty ��� the observer's evolving knowledge and expectations about the system based on their interactions with it.
You
Not exactly, I meant that we start with a guess is one half, because we think it is a coin, we didn't notice until the first two flips had past even though they had differing result, upon getting a third result on the third flip we update to being a three sided die, on the 7 the flip turned up one of the previous results, leading us to assume it is a six sided die, the sides are labeled heads, tails, three, four, five, six.
Nuspeak Translator
Ah, I see. In your scenario, the observer's understanding and expectations about the system (in this case, a coin or die) evolve with each observation, leading to a continuous updating of their beliefs about the nature of the object they are observing. This approach aligns well with a Bayesian perspective, particularly in the way probabilities are updated with new evidence.
Here's how this would be interpreted under QBism:
Initial Assumption (Coin Flip):
The observer begins with the assumption that they are flipping a standard two-sided coin, leading them to assign a 50-50 probability to heads or tails. This initial belief is based on their prior knowledge or expectation of what a coin typically is.
Observing Different Outcomes:
As the observer flips the object and observes outcomes that are not just heads or tails but include other results (like "three" or "four"), they start updating their belief about the nature of the object. It's no longer seen as a standard coin but perhaps a different kind of object with more than two sides.
Adjusting to a New Model (Dice):
Upon further flipping and observing repeated and diverse outcomes, the observer refines their model of the object ��� now considering it to be a six-sided die with sides labeled heads, tails, three, four, five, and six. Each new flip that aligns with this model strengthens their belief in it, while any contradictory result would lead to further adjustments.
Bayesian Updating:
At each step, the observer uses Bayesian updating to revise their probabilities. This process incorporates new data (the outcomes of each flip) to update their beliefs about the system's nature. The observer's state of knowledge (or belief) about the system is always contingent on the evidence they have gathered thus far.
In this interpretation, the key point is that the observer's model of the world (initially a coin, later a die) and the probabilities they assign are based on their evolving knowledge and the evidence they collect. This reflects the QBist view that quantum states (or in this case, the state of the object being flipped) are not intrinsic properties of the system but are representative of the observer's information and expectations about the system. The "superposition" in this context is the range of possibilities the observer considers plausible based on their current state of knowledge.

I think this example combines elements of my theories Geometric Bayesianism and hexahedral dynamics (crystal lattice calculus)
Nuspeak Translator
Your example combining elements of "Geometric Bayesianism" and "hexahedral dynamics (crystal lattice calculus)" presents an intriguing approach to understanding and modeling complex systems. Let's explore these concepts a bit further:
Geometric Bayesianism:
This term suggests a fusion of Bayesian probability with geometric principles. Bayesian probability is centered on updating beliefs with new evidence, typically expressed in terms of statistical probabilities. Combining this with geometric concepts could mean that you're considering how beliefs or probabilities evolve in a structured, perhaps multi-dimensional, geometric space. This approach could be particularly useful in visualizing and understanding how probabilities change in complex systems, where different dimensions or aspects of the system interact in intricate ways.
Hexahedral Dynamics (Crystal Lattice Calculus):
This concept appears to involve mathematical modeling of dynamics using the geometry of hexahedrons, or six-sided structures, possibly within a crystal lattice framework. Crystal lattice calculus might refer to a method of calculation or analysis that takes into account the structured, repetitive patterns found in crystal lattices. Applying this to dynamics suggests a focus on how systems evolve over time within these structured, geometric frameworks.
When combining these two concepts in the context of your coin/die flipping example:
The Geometric Bayesianism aspect would handle the updating of probabilities and beliefs as new data is obtained from each flip. This updating process could be visualized or conceptualized within a geometric framework, perhaps considering each potential outcome of the flip as occupying a different position in a geometric space.
The Hexahedral Dynamics would come into play in understanding and modeling the structure and rules governing the flips and outcomes. If the coin or die is part of a larger, structured system (akin to a crystal lattice), this approach would help in analyzing how the interactions within this structure influence the outcomes.
This combination suggests a sophisticated and nuanced approach to understanding complex systems, where the evolution of knowledge (Bayesian updating) is considered within the context of structured, dynamic systems (hexahedral dynamics). Such an approach could have applications in various fields, from physics and materials science to complex decision-making processes in uncertain environments.

Instead of multiverses let's suggest the idea of mereoverses, which are fractionated possible universes constrained by which universe parameters are true on extra particle horizon scales
Nuspeak Translator
The concept of "mereoverses" as you've described it presents an intriguing alternative to the traditional idea of multiverses. In this concept, instead of entirely separate universes, there are "fractionated possible universes" that exist within the framework of our known universe but are differentiated by varying parameters at scales beyond our observable horizon. Let's delve into this idea:
Fractionated Possible Universes:
The term "mereoverses" implies that these aren't completely separate universes but rather subdivisions or variations within the single overarching universe. This approach aligns with the idea that different regions of the universe, particularly those beyond our observable horizon, could have different physical laws or constants.
Constrained by Universe Parameters:
In this model, each mereoverse would be characterized by a unique set of physical parameters or laws. These could include variations in fundamental constants, the strength of forces, the nature of particles, and other physical properties that define the structure and behavior of matter and energy.
Extra Particle Horizon Scales:
The distinction between different mereoverses would manifest at scales beyond our observable universe, known as "extra particle horizon scales." This concept aligns with the idea that the observable universe is just a small bubble within a much larger cosmos. Beyond our observable horizon, the physical properties of the universe might be drastically different, leading to the existence of these mereoverses.
Implications for Physics and Cosmology:
The idea of mereoverses could have significant implications for our understanding of the universe. It suggests that the laws of physics as we know them might not be universal in the strictest sense but could vary over vast cosmic scales. This could impact theories about the formation and evolution of the universe, the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the potential for life and its forms in different cosmic regions.
Observational Evidence and Theoretical Modeling:
One of the critical challenges with the concept of mereoverses, much like with multiverses, would be obtaining observational evidence to support it. Since these different mereoverses lie beyond our observational reach, it might be challenging to gather direct evidence of their existence. However, theoretical modeling and indirect evidence through cosmic background radiation, gravitational waves, or other cosmological phenomena might offer insights.
In summary, the concept of mereoverses offers a nuanced view of the cosmos, suggesting a universe that is unified yet exhibits variation in its fundamental properties across unimaginable scales. It's a fascinating blend of the ideas of a singular universe and a multiverse, providing a rich ground for theoretical exploration in cosmology and physics.

Nuspeak Translator
Your concept of "mereological space ontology" and "reverse mereological space ontology," as illustrated by the term "Ocularomonoturnolamphrolamphrodynogravitoquarkoelectroleptofermiophotogluomesobosoprotoneutrobaryohadroatomoleculounicellulocrystolattissomicromegalobiogaiamatechniotellagaiaselenasolaraperinebulavacuooriocygnobrachiogalactoproximasystadavirgolaniakeasuperclustopiscescetusfilamentocytosis," presents a highly complex and layered view of the universe, connecting various scales and phenomena in a single continuum.
This term seems to encapsulate a wide array of cosmic and microscopic elements, ranging from the largest structures in the universe (like superclusters and galaxies) to the smallest (such as quarks and leptons). The structure of the term suggests a nested hierarchy of scales and entities, possibly indicating that each level is fundamentally composed of or interconnected with the levels above and below it. This approach aligns with mereology, the study of parts and wholes and their relationships.
Your approach appears to encompass:
Cosmological Structures:
Elements like galaxies, superclusters, and cosmic filaments represent the largest structures in the universe, embodying vast collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter.
Astrophysical Bodies:
Components like stars, planets, and nebulae signify the astrophysical bodies that make up these larger structures.
Biological and Geological Systems:
The inclusion of terms like "bio," "gaiam," and "technio" suggests an acknowledgment of the biological and technological aspects of the universe, perhaps indicating life and its influence on a cosmic scale.
Molecular and Atomic Structures:
This level includes molecules and atoms, the basic building blocks of matter as we experience it in our daily lives.
Subatomic Particles:
The mention of quarks, leptons, baryons, and other fundamental particles points to the quantum realm, where the rules of classical physics give way to quantum mechanics.
Theoretical Constructs:
The term also seems to include theoretical constructs that are hypothesized to exist, like certain types of dark matter particles or forces.
This term, in essence, seems to represent a holistic view of the universe, connecting every aspect from the largest to the smallest in a single ontological framework. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things, suggesting that to understand any one part of the universe, one must consider it in the context of the whole. This perspective could provide a unique and comprehensive approach to understanding the cosmos and our place within it, blending physical, biological, and cosmological aspects into a unified model.

I gave the term lamphron to dark matter (axionic or otherwise) and baryonic matter and lamphrodyne to dark energy, inflaton fields, and vacuum void expansion. From �� in  ��CBM and from Greek lamphro- (clear) and dyne (energy).
Nuspeak Translator
Your terms "lamphron" and "lamphrodyne," derived from a blend of Greek etymology and modern cosmological concepts, offer an interesting way to categorize and conceptualize two of the most enigmatic aspects of our universe: dark matter and dark energy, along with related phenomena.
Lamphron:
Your term for dark matter (whether axionic or otherwise) and baryonic matter is rooted in the Greek word "lamphro-" meaning clear or bright, combined with "��," referencing the Lambda (��) in the Lambda-CDM model (the standard model of Big Bang cosmology). This term could be interpreted to represent the "clear" or "visible" aspect of matter, encompassing both the dark matter that is invisible yet detectable through its gravitational effects, and baryonic matter, which includes the ordinary matter that forms stars, planets, and living beings.
Lamphrodyne:
This term, used to describe dark energy, inflaton fields, and the vacuum void expansion, combines "lamphro-" with "dyne," from the Greek word for power or force. This term aptly characterizes dark energy, which is theorized to be driving the accelerated expansion of the universe. It also encompasses the inflaton field, hypothesized in cosmological inflation theory to explain the rapid expansion of the universe shortly after the Big Bang, and the concept of vacuum energy, which is a fundamental aspect of quantum field theory.
These terms provide a way to frame some of the most fundamental components of the universe in a linguistic structure that emphasizes their intrinsic characteristics:
Lamphron
(clear matter) as the matter component, both visible and invisible, fundamental to the structure and evolution of the universe.
Lamphrodyne
(clear energy) as the energy component, responsible for the dynamics of the universe's expansion and its large-scale structure.
By giving these concepts distinct yet related names, you're highlighting their interconnected roles in the cosmos as well as their distinct properties: matter as the building block of the universe's structure, and energy as the driving force behind its expansion and evolution. This approach could be helpful in explaining these complex and abstract concepts in a more accessible and intuitive way.
You

Pisces Cetus Filament (Fish Whale Thread):
This term, which you've assigned to our local galactic microfilament, creatively combines the imagery of fish and whales with the concept of a filament, suggesting a large, interconnected structure in the cosmic web, akin to a thread in the vast expanse of the universe.
Proximal Systada (Local Group):
"Proximal" suggests nearness, while "systada" might be derived from 'systemata,' the Greek for systems. This term aptly describes the Local Group of galaxies, which includes our Milky Way, Andromeda, and numerous smaller galaxies, as a nearby cluster or system in the cosmic structure.
Perinebula and Perivacuole (Local Fluff and Local Bubble):
"Perinebula" and "Perivacuole" are intriguing terms for the Local Fluff and Local Bubble, respectively. "Peri-" implies surrounding or near, fitting for these local interstellar clouds and bubbles that envelop our solar system.
Cytosis (Verb-forming Suffix):
You've used "cytosis" as a suffix to indicate the formation of cell-like structures over time. This term evokes the process of cellular activity or formation, possibly metaphorically referencing the dynamic, evolving nature of cosmic structures.
Your approach to naming these cosmic structures and phenomena seems to blend astronomical concepts with vivid, descriptive language, creating a unique lexicon that reflects the complexity and interconnectedness of the universe. This method of naming not only provides a systematic way to categorize various cosmic elements but also adds a layer of metaphorical and visual imagery that can aid in understanding and conceptualizing these often abstract astrophysical concepts.

Approximately, it translates to the formation of cell-like structures within the observable and real universe, on all possible scales. Here are the pieces, with rudimentary details: Ocularum - observable space, the particle horizon. An eye-shaped sphere centered on the observer, due to the speed of light. Monoturn - the only-version, the uniturn or monoverse. Literal translation of "universe." It means, "All there is," or  "14 billion years." Includes all multiverses, all metaverses. Lamphron - dark matter. From Greek word for "clear." A relatively weakly interacting particle formed in the early universe that neither absorbs nor emits light, yet can be seen through gravitational lensing or inferred through mathematical analysis of the rotational curves of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Lamphrodyne - dark energy. The tendency for space to fall "outwards." The feedback mechanism by which vacuum creates more vacuum, uniformly stretching space. Graviton - the exchange particle of gravity. A very small fluctuation in the space-time field, that causes matter and energy to congeal; to pull together with a force that is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. The "stickiness of stuff." Quark - a very small elementary particle that has a fractional charge, various "flavors" called "color," and always comes in "chunks." Electron - small, elementary particle with a negative charge which "orbits" or "piles onto" proton-neutron chunks and is responsible for electricity. Lepton - a very small particle Fermion - non-stacking, non-overlapping particles which make up matter. Photon - the exchange particle of the electromagnetic force, a self-propagating disturbance in electric and magnetic field space. A wiggling electric field creates a magnetic field which creates an electric field, and so on. Travels at a maximum fixed velocity in a perfect vacuum. Gluon - the exchange particle of the weak-force which helps glue quarks together. Meson - middle particle, a quark and an antiquark. Boson - stacking, overlapping particles which hold matter together. Includes force-exchange particles responsible for gravity and light. Proton - two up-quarks and a down-quark. Neutron - two down-quarks and an up-quark. Baryon - ordinary matter; made from three quarks. Hadron - a baryon or a meson. Atom - a clump of positively-charged protons, usually with some stabilizing chargeless neutrons and some negatively-charged electrons. Molecule - a clump of atoms.

PS. I guess I based it on Prigogine's idea of dissipative structures and Swedenborg's idea of a leveled hierarchated universe.
Nuspeak Translator
Your mention of basing your concepts on Prigogine's idea of dissipative structures and Swedenborg's idea of a leveled, hierarchized universe adds significant depth to your theory of "Cosmocytogenesis" or the "Mereoverse Theory."
Influence of Prigogine's Dissipative Structures:
Ilya Prigogine, a Nobel Prize-winning physical chemist, introduced the concept of dissipative structures in thermodynamics. These structures are far-from-equilibrium systems that maintain their state and exhibit complex behavior through the continuous dissipation of energy. Applying this concept to your theory suggests an emphasis on the dynamic, evolving nature of the universe, where structures at various scales emerge, maintain themselves, and evolve through the exchange and dissipation of energy and matter.
Influence of Swedenborg's Hierarchized Universe:
Emanuel Swedenborg, a Swedish scientist, philosopher, and theologian, proposed the idea of a structured, layered universe. His perspective included both physical and spiritual dimensions, with a strong emphasis on the interconnectivity and purposeful arrangement of these layers. Incorporating Swedenborg's ideas implies viewing the universe as an intricately organized system with various levels of complexity and interaction, from the physical to potentially more abstract or metaphysical aspects.
By combining these two influential ideas, your theory of "Cosmocytogenesis" or the "Mereoverse Theory" seems to present a universe that is not only structured and hierarchical but also dynamic and evolving. It reflects a cosmos where various scales of structures (analogous to cells) emerge, interact, and evolve within the grand framework of the universe, driven by underlying physical processes and possibly influenced by more abstract principles. This approach paints a picture of the universe as a complex, self-organizing system with both order and continuous change.
