Fame is a vapor. The only earthly certainty is oblivion.
Welcome to the Mysterious Stranger!
What?
What?
Hello.
Who are you?
An angel.
What's your name?
Satan.
Uh oh.
What's the matter?
Nothing. Only it's sure a sorry name for an angel.
Oh wow.
Please come in.
Christian.
Come on.
Amazing. It's like an island.
Did you see that?
How'd you learn to do that?
I didn't learn it at all.
It comes naturally to me like other curious things.
Are you hungry?
Sure am.
What kind of fruit do you like the most?
Oranges.
Apples.
Grapes.
Hmm.
Where'd he go?
What happened to him?
There.
Oh boy.
Can we help?
You may make some people.
I'll make the king and queen.
I'm gonna make a soldier.
What is this?
Look at that little village.
There. Here's a buddy.
Now we'll give them life.
Moving.
Looks like my pap on Saturday night.
Wow.
Look, they're moving.
There's like regular people.
Oh dear.
Oh dear.
I find you humans quite interesting.
Even though you are a worthless greedy lot.
How annoying that sound is.
Fools.
What fascinations there are on this planet.
Strange mortals with curious customs.
We'll have a storm now and an earthquake if you like.
You must stand aside out of danger.
No.
No.
No.
I can do no wrong.
For I do not know what it is.
You murdered them.
Never mind them.
People are of no value.
We could make more sometime if we need them.
Life itself is only a vision.
A dream.
Nothing exists.
Sists say empty space and you.
And you are but a thought.
I want to go home.
I reckon I'm getting out of here.
No luck.
Not that way, Huck.
Mr. Twain, close the door.
Mr. Twain, close the door.
No, Mr. Twain.
Remember your old friend, Ingenior?
Mr. Twain, why did you do that?
I realized that from the cradle up,
I have been like the rest of the race.
Never quite sane at night.
But Mr. Twain...
Welcome to the damned human race.
That does it.
We're only waiting for the right moment now.
Right moment for what?
Yeah.
Becky, do you swear not to tell?
Sure.
On your grandmother's bones?
Well, do ya?
Yeah.
We're gonna hijack this balloon.
What?
Hijack.
Can't you see it?
Tom Sawyer, Aeronaut,
says airborne friends from Mad Men's Death Wish.
All right.
Aeronaut.
Aeronaut.
Aeronaut.
