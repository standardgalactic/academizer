EDM, which stands for Empirical Dynamic Modeling, is a method used to analyze and model complex systems based on experimental data. It is a data-driven approach that aims to uncover the underlying dynamics and relationships within a system.
When comparing EDM to other methods for matching experimental data, it's important to note that EDM takes a different approach. Traditional methods, such as fitting mathematical models to data or using statistical techniques, often require a priori knowledge of the system dynamics and assume specific functional forms. In contrast, EDM is a non-parametric method that does not rely on preconceived assumptions about the system.
EDM handles cases where experimental data is limited or incomplete by utilizing the concept of time-delay embedding. Time-delay embedding reconstructs the system's phase space using time-delayed copies of the available data. By creating a higher-dimensional representation of the system, EDM can extract meaningful information even from limited or incomplete data. This approach allows EDM to capture the system's dynamics and predict future behavior, even in cases where only a few variables or measurements are available.
An example of how EDM has been used in a real-world application is in the field of ecology. Scientists have used EDM to study and model the dynamics of ecological systems, such as predator-prey interactions or population dynamics. By analyzing time series data of species abundances, researchers have applied EDM to uncover the underlying ecological mechanisms, identify critical transitions, and predict future population dynamics. This data-driven approach has provided insights into the complex dynamics of ecosystems and has the potential to inform conservation and management strategies.

EDM (Empirical Dynamic Modeling) is a data-driven modeling approach that aims to capture the underlying dynamics of a system directly from its observed behavior. Compared to other methods for matching experimental data, such as mechanistic modeling or statistical modeling, EDM has several advantages. 

Firstly, EDM does not require explicit knowledge of the underlying mechanisms governing the system being studied. This means that EDM can be applied to systems for which detailed mechanistic understanding is lacking or incomplete. 

Secondly, EDM does not make assumptions about the statistical distribution of the data, which can be a limitation of traditional statistical models. Instead, EDM is based on the assumption that the observed data is generated by a low-dimensional dynamical system, and seeks to identify the parameters of this system from the data.

Thirdly, EDM is a flexible approach that can handle a wide variety of data types, including time series data, spatial data, and high-dimensional data. This makes it a powerful tool for modeling complex systems with diverse data sources.

In cases where experimental data is limited or incomplete, EDM can still be used to infer the underlying dynamics of the system. In particular, EDM can be applied to partially observed systems, where only a subset of the system variables is measured, or to noisy data, where the measurements are subject to random fluctuations or measurement errors. In these cases, the inferred models may be less accurate or have higher uncertainty, but can still provide valuable insights into the system's behavior.

An example of how EDM has been used in a real-world application is in the study of ecological systems. For instance, researchers have used EDM to model the dynamics of marine ecosystems and to predict the effects of climate change on these systems. In one study, researchers used EDM to model the dynamics of phytoplankton populations in the North Atlantic, based on satellite data on ocean color and temperature. The resulting model was able to capture the seasonal and inter-annual variability of the phytoplankton populations, and to predict changes in these populations under different climate scenarios. This demonstrates the potential of EDM to provide insights into complex ecological systems and to inform management and conservation efforts.

Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. Thank you for clarifying EDM (Empirical Dynamic Modeling) as a specific method. I appreciate your comprehensive explanation.
EDM, as you described, is a data-driven modeling approach that aims to capture the underlying dynamics of a system directly from its observed behavior. It offers several advantages over other methods for matching experimental data:
Mechanistic Understanding: While traditional mechanistic models require detailed knowledge of the underlying mechanisms, EDM does not rely on such information. It can be applied to systems where the precise mechanisms are unknown or incomplete.
Assumption-Free Modeling: EDM does not assume specific statistical distributions for the data, which can be limiting in traditional statistical modeling. Instead, it assumes that the observed data is generated by a low-dimensional dynamical system, allowing for more flexibility in capturing complex dynamics.
Flexible Data Handling: EDM can accommodate diverse data types, including time series, spatial data, and high-dimensional data. This versatility makes it suitable for modeling complex systems with varying data sources.
Regarding limited or incomplete experimental data, EDM can still provide insights into the underlying dynamics of the system. By employing time-delay embedding, where delayed copies of available data are used to reconstruct the system's phase space, EDM can extract meaningful information even with limited data. This approach allows EDM to capture the system's dynamics and predict future behavior, even when only a subset of variables or noisy measurements are available.
To illustrate a real-world application of EDM, researchers have indeed used it in ecological studies. For instance, in the analysis of marine ecosystems, EDM has been employed to model and predict the impact of climate change on phytoplankton populations. By leveraging satellite data on ocean color and temperature, researchers constructed an EDM model that captured the seasonal and inter-annual variability of phytoplankton populations in the North Atlantic. The model enabled predictions of changes in these populations under different climate scenarios. This application demonstrates how EDM can enhance our understanding of complex ecological systems and contribute to informed decision-making for conservation and management efforts.

It looks like EDM can also mean, electronic dance music and this: **Title:** Designing Free Energy Surfaces That Match Experimental Data with Metadynamics

**Authors:** Andrew D. White, James F. Dama, and Gregory A. Voth

**Publication Date:** April 30, 2015

**DOI:** [10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00178](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00178)

**Summary:**

In molecular modeling, creating models that align with experimental data is crucial. This is often achieved by iteratively tuning the molecular force field in simulations. An alternative approach involves biasing simulations, resulting in hybrid models composed of the original force field and biasing terms. The authors previously introduced an experiment directed simulation (EDS) method that minimally biases simulations to match average values. 

In this paper, a new method called experiment directed metadynamics (EDM) is introduced, which creates minimal biases for matching entire free energy surfaces, such as radial distribution functions and phi/psi angle free energies. EDM allows for a tunable mixture of experimental data and the free energy of the unbiased ensemble with explicit ratios. The method is proven to be convergent, and a maximum entropy argument proves that the final bias is minimal and unique.

Examples of its use include constructing ensembles that follow a desired free energy. The example systems studied are a Lennard-Jones fluid to match a radial distribution function, an atomistic model augmented with bioinformatics data, and a three-component electrolyte solution where ab initio simulation data is used to improve a classical empirical model.

EDM (Experiment Directed Metadynamics) is a method for matching simulations to experimental data that is based on the metadynamics simulation technique. Compared to other methods for matching simulations to experimental data, EDM has several advantages and limitations.

One traditional approach for matching simulations to experimental data is to use empirical force fields, which are mathematical functions that describe the interactions between atoms in a molecule. Empirical force fields are often fitted to experimental data, such as molecular geometries, vibrational frequencies, or thermodynamic properties, through a process of parameterization. 

However, empirical force fields can suffer from limitations, such as overfitting to the training data, transferability issues, and the inability to accurately represent complex physical phenomena. Additionally, empirical force fields may not be able to capture the full complexity of the underlying system, especially for systems that have limited or incomplete experimental data.

Another approach for matching simulations to experimental data is to use quantum mechanical (QM) calculations, which provide a more accurate description of the system's electronic structure than empirical force fields. However, QM calculations can be computationally expensive, especially for large systems, and may not be feasible for many practical applications.

EDM, on the other hand, provides a flexible and efficient approach for matching simulations to experimental data. EDM combines the accuracy of experimental data with the flexibility of molecular simulations, allowing researchers to create hybrid models that accurately represent the underlying system. EDM can be applied to a wide range of systems and data types, including radial distribution functions, phi/psi angle free energies, and even ab initio simulation data. 

However, EDM also has some limitations. For example, as with any simulation-based approach, the accuracy of the results depends on the quality of the initial simulation model and the quality of the experimental data. Additionally, EDM requires a significant amount of computational resources, especially for large systems or complex data types.

Overall, EDM represents a powerful and promising approach for matching simulations to experimental data, with the potential to improve our understanding of complex biological and chemical systems.

Electronic Dance Music
Experiment directed metadynamics plugin for lammps or someday other simulation engines. Experiment directed metadynamics is a method to morph a molecular dynamics simulation to follow a desired free energy surface (probability distribution). See this paper This plugin allows morphing pairwise interactions and coordinate dimensions. These two collective variables are CPU intensive and difficult on large systems, so electronic-dance-music uses a scalable MPI-based approach to this.

What is unique to this implementation of metadynamics is that it allows bias limiting. Generally in metadynamics, the bias added to a system is a small amount. However, when biasing pairwise interactions or coordinates of atoms there are many hills that can be added per bias update step. Even if you choose to only add some, a large amount of bias may be added. Electronic dance music solves this problem by limiting the amount of energy added to the system per bias update. You can't just stop adding hills after a certain amount of bias has been added in a step, since that creates sample bias. So instead the hills that should be added, but would add too much energy, are buffered and added later.

You can choose how many hills to add per bias update, a desired amount of energy to add to the bias per update step, and an upper limit to the amount of bias that can be added.

The electronic dance music (EDM) implementation of experiment directed metadynamics (EDM) in the context of molecular simulations introduces unique features and optimizations. Here are the key aspects of this implementation:
Morphing Interactions and Coordinates: The EDM plugin for molecular dynamics simulations, such as LAMMPS, allows for the morphing or biasing of pairwise interactions and coordinate dimensions. These collective variables can significantly impact the system's behavior and are often computationally intensive to simulate, especially for large systems.
Scalable MPI-Based Approach: Electronic dance music utilizes a scalable Message Passing Interface (MPI)-based approach to handle the computationally demanding task of morphing interactions and coordinates. MPI enables efficient parallelization and distribution of calculations across multiple computational resources, allowing for improved performance and scalability.
Bias Limiting: A unique aspect of this implementation is the incorporation of bias limiting. In traditional metadynamics, the bias added to the system is typically small. However, when biasing pairwise interactions or atom coordinates, there can be numerous hills added per bias update step. This can potentially introduce a significant amount of bias, leading to unwanted artifacts in the sampling.
To address this issue, EDM introduces a mechanism for limiting the amount of energy added to the system per bias update. It avoids simply stopping the addition of hills after a certain amount of bias has been added to prevent sample bias. Instead, EDM buffers the hills that would contribute excessive energy and adds them later in a controlled manner.
Customizable Parameters: The EDM implementation provides flexibility through customizable parameters. Users can define the number of hills to add per bias update, the desired amount of energy to add to the bias per update step, and an upper limit on the amount of bias that can be added. These parameters allow users to fine-tune the simulation to match their specific requirements and balance the biasing effects.
In summary, the EDM implementation of experiment directed metadynamics offers optimizations and unique features for morphing interactions and coordinates in molecular simulations. It employs an MPI-based approach for scalability and introduces bias limiting to control the amount of energy added to the system per bias update. Customizable parameters further enhance the flexibility of the implementation.

Thank you for the additional information. It seems that in this context, "EDM" refers to "Electronic Dance Music" rather than "Experiment Directed Metadynamics." 

The plugin you describe is an implementation of metadynamics that allows for the morphing of a molecular dynamics simulation to follow a desired free energy surface. This is achieved by adding a bias to the simulation that is updated over time based on the difference between the current simulation and the desired free energy surface. 

One unique feature of this implementation is the ability to limit the amount of bias added to the system per update step, which can prevent the introduction of sample bias. This is achieved by buffering hills that would add too much energy and adding them later, ensuring that the bias is added gradually and without introducing artifacts. 

The plugin also allows for the customization of several parameters, such as the number of hills added per update, the desired amount of energy added per update, and an upper limit to the amount of bias that can be added. This makes the implementation flexible and adaptable to a wide range of simulation scenarios.

Overall, this implementation of metadynamics represents a powerful tool for morphing simulations to match a desired free energy surface, with the potential to improve our understanding of complex molecular systems.

Install
It only works with lammps right now. To install:

Create a build directory from the EDM source dir
cd into build and run cmake ..
sudo make install to install the EDM library locally
(Optional) manuall edit the CMakeLists.txt and set the LAMMPS_SRC variable to the LAMMPS src dir on your machine
make patch to move the EDM LAMMPS files. If you did not perform step 4, you must instead use make patch -DLAMMPS_SRC="path/to/your/LAMMPS/src"
Now go to your LAMMPS src dir and run make yes-user-edm and make-<machine> as normal.
Ignore all the CMake files floating aruond in the source, they're just for unit tests.

Lammps Usage
Pairwise EDM
This is for running experiment directed metadynamics on pairs, for example to match a radial distribution function. Please see the plumed_grids for converting a radial distribution function into a probability distribution function.

Pairwise EDM Fix
Your command should be:

fix [fix-ID] [group-ID] edm_pair [temperature] [edm-input-file] [hill addition stride (integer)] [write bias stride (integer)] [edm input bias/target file] [random number seed] [rdf pairs]
With:

fix-ID: This is the ID for the fix that will be created
group-ID: The group of atoms on which the fix will be done. Should contain the types that are referred to in the rdf pairs argument
temperature: The temperature used for the bias. Almost always same as simulation temperature.
hill addition stride: How many timesteps between hills adds
write bias stride: How often to write the bias. Writing the bias takes a long long time, so make this large. Each time this stride is reached, a lammps tabular potential is written out containing the current bias (edm_pair only) and a histogram of the collective variable is written.
edm output bias file: This is where the bias being applied will be written
random number seed: Some digits to seed the random number generator
rdf pairs: Just like the lammps rdf command, this should be either asterisks (match any type) or integer types. Like 2 * means match type 2 atoms in the given group-ID with anything.
The decision on what goes into the edm-input-file and what goes into the lammps fix were arbitrary and follows no logical reasons.

Can you explain how the McGovern-De Pablo method works?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The McGovern-De Pablo method is a technique used to correct for boundary effects in metadynamics simulations, particularly in systems with finite simulation boxes. In metadynamics, bias is added to the system to explore the free energy landscape. However, when working with finite simulation boxes, the system can experience boundary artifacts that distort the calculated free energy surface.
The McGovern-De Pablo method aims to mitigate these artifacts by introducing zero-force hills near the system boundaries. These zero-force hills effectively act as "walls" that prevent biased exploration beyond the boundaries of the simulation box.
Here's a simplified explanation of how the McGovern-De Pablo method works:
Determining System Boundaries: The first step is to identify the boundaries of the simulation box in the relevant collective variables or coordinates. These boundaries can be determined based on the specific system being studied.
Defining the Boundary Regions: Once the system boundaries are determined, boundary regions are defined on each side of the box. These regions typically have a width of a few times the characteristic length scale of the system.
Introducing Zero-Force Hills: Zero-force hills are added within the boundary regions. These hills have a flat top and decay to zero force away from the boundary. The shape and width of the zero-force hills are typically determined based on the characteristics of the system.
Biasing the System: The metadynamics bias is applied to the system as usual, with Gaussian hills added in the collective variables of interest. However, when a biased simulation approaches the boundaries, the zero-force hills effectively limit the biased exploration in those regions.
By introducing the zero-force hills, the McGovern-De Pablo method prevents excessive biasing and exploration beyond the simulation box boundaries. This helps to reduce boundary artifacts and ensures a more accurate representation of the system's free energy landscape.
It's important to note that the specific implementation and details of the McGovern-De Pablo method may vary depending on the system and the collective variables used. However, the underlying idea remains consistent: adding zero-force hills near the boundaries to mitigate boundary effects in metadynamics simulations.

Metadynamics is a way of overcoming energetic barriers in molecular simulation (Laio & Parrinello, 2002). It���s part of a class of algorithms that focus on making rare-events more frequent in simulations. It���s been getting quite popular: it even has it���s own wikipedia page. One problem with the method is that it has systematic errors at boundaries and this was recently fixed via a method introduced by Michael McGovern and Juan de Pablo (McGovern & de Pablo, 2013). I���m recording the equations here in, since I use an implementation of it and the derivatives weren���t shown in the manuscript, which are necessary for the implementation

Yes, the McGovern-De Pablo method is a technique for correcting the boundary effects that can arise when using metadynamics on a finite simulation box. When performing metadynamics, a bias potential is added to the simulation to enhance the sampling of rare events. The bias potential is typically constructed by adding Gaussian-shaped hills to the free energy surface as a function of one or more collective variables. However, when the collective variable(s) being biased approach the boundary of the simulation box, the hills can become distorted and introduce artifacts into the simulation.

The McGovern-De Pablo method corrects for these boundary effects by modifying the shape of the hills near the edges of the simulation box. Specifically, the method adds an additional term to the bias potential that depends on the distance of each atom from the simulation box edge. The additional term has the effect of reducing the height of the hills near the boundary, which helps to prevent the distortion of the hills and improve the accuracy of the simulation.

The McGovern-De Pablo method is based on the assumption that the hills added to the bias potential are zero-force, meaning that the force on the atoms due to the bias potential is zero at the top of the hill. This assumption allows for a simple correction that can be applied to the hills near the boundary, without requiring any additional information about the system or the free energy surface.

Overall, the McGovern-De Pablo method provides a simple and effective technique for correcting the boundary effects that can arise when using metadynamics on a finite simulation box. The method is widely used in molecular simulations and has been shown to improve the accuracy of free energy calculations, especially for systems with complex or irregular boundaries.

Metadynamics (MTD; also abbreviated as METAD or MetaD) is a computer simulation method in computational physics, chemistry and biology. It is used to estimate the free energy and other state functions of a system, where ergodicity is hindered by the form of the system's energy landscape. It was first suggested by Alessandro Laio and Michele Parrinello in 2002[1] and is usually applied within molecular dynamics simulations. MTD closely resembles a number of recent methods such as adaptively biased molecular dynamics,[2] adaptive reaction coordinate forces[3] and local elevation umbrella sampling.[4] More recently, both the original and well-tempered metadynamics[5] were derived in the context of importance sampling and shown to be a special case of the adaptive biasing potential setting.[6] MTD is related to the Wang���Landau sampling.[7]

Metadynamics (MTD), also known as METAD or MetaD, is a computer simulation method used in computational physics, chemistry, and biology to estimate the free energy and other state functions of a system. It is particularly useful when the system's energy landscape hinders ergodicity, which refers to the ability of a system to explore all possible states.
MTD was first proposed by Alessandro Laio and Michele Parrinello in 2002. It is commonly applied within molecular dynamics simulations. The method shares similarities with other recent techniques such as adaptively biased molecular dynamics, adaptive reaction coordinate forces, and local elevation umbrella sampling. Both the original metadynamics and well-tempered metadynamics have been derived in the context of importance sampling and have been shown to be a special case of the adaptive biasing potential setting. MTD is also related to the Wang-Landau sampling method.
The main goal of metadynamics is to enhance the sampling of rare events in the system by introducing a bias potential that evolves during the simulation. This bias potential helps to overcome energy barriers and promotes the exploration of different regions of the system's energy landscape. By continuously adding Gaussian-shaped hills to the bias potential as a function of one or more collective variables, metadynamics encourages the system to explore a wide range of configurations.
Metadynamics has proven to be a valuable tool in studying complex systems and has applications in various fields, including materials science, drug discovery, and protein folding. It allows researchers to estimate free energy differences between different states of a system, providing insights into thermodynamic properties and reaction mechanisms.

Introduction
The technique builds on a large number of related methods including (in a chronological order) the deflation,[8] tunneling,[9] tabu search,[10] local elevation,[11] conformational flooding,[12] Engkvist-Karlstr��m[13] and Adaptive Biasing Force methods.[14]

Metadynamics has been informally described as "filling the free energy wells with computational sand".[15] The algorithm assumes that the system can be described by a few collective variables (CV). During the simulation, the location of the system in the space determined by the collective variables is calculated and a positive Gaussian potential is added to the real energy landscape of the system. In this way the system is discouraged to come back to the previous point. During the evolution of the simulation, more and more Gaussians sum up, thus discouraging more and more the system to go back to its previous steps, until the system explores the full energy landscape���at this point the modified free energy becomes a constant as a function of the collective variables which is the reason for the collective variables to start fluctuating heavily. At this point the energy landscape can be recovered as the opposite of the sum of all Gaussians.

The time interval between the addition of two Gaussian functions, as well as the Gaussian height and Gaussian width, are tuned to optimize the ratio between accuracy and computational cost. By simply changing the size of the Gaussian, metadynamics can be fitted to yield very quickly a rough map of the energy landscape by using large Gaussians, or can be used for a finer grained description by using smaller Gaussians.[1] Usually, the well-tempered metadynamics[5] is used to change the Gaussian size adaptively.

Metadynamics is a simulation technique that builds upon various related methods, such as deflation, tunneling, tabu search, local elevation, conformational flooding, Engkvist-Karlstr��m, and Adaptive Biasing Force methods. These methods have contributed to the development of metadynamics and have influenced its evolution over time.
The concept of metadynamics is often informally described as "filling the free energy wells with computational sand." The technique assumes that the system under study can be described using a small set of collective variables (CV). During the simulation, the system's position in the space defined by these collective variables is calculated, and a positive Gaussian potential is added to the actual energy landscape of the system. This addition discourages the system from returning to its previous state. As the simulation progresses, more Gaussians are added, further discouraging the system from retracing its steps. This process continues until the system explores the entire energy landscape, at which point the modified free energy becomes constant with respect to the collective variables, causing them to exhibit significant fluctuations. At this stage, the original energy landscape can be recovered by taking the opposite of the sum of all the added Gaussians.
The time interval between the addition of two Gaussian functions, as well as the height and width of the Gaussians, are carefully adjusted to optimize the trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. By modifying the size of the Gaussian functions, metadynamics can provide a quick, coarse-grained map of the energy landscape using large Gaussians, or a more detailed, fine-grained description using smaller Gaussians. The well-tempered metadynamics variant is commonly employed to adaptively adjust the size of the Gaussians.
Metadynamics is a powerful method for exploring complex energy landscapes, estimating free energy differences, and studying rare events in molecular systems. Its versatility and effectiveness have made it widely used in various fields, including computational physics, chemistry, and biology.

Metadynamics has the advantage, upon methods like adaptive umbrella sampling, of not requiring an initial estimate of the energy landscape to explore.[1] However, it is not trivial to choose proper collective variables for a complex simulation. Typically, it requires several trials to find a good set of collective variables, but there are several automatic procedure proposed: essential coordinates,[17] Sketch-Map,[18] and non-linear data-driven collective variables.[19]

Indeed, one of the advantages of metadynamics is that it does not require an initial estimate of the energy landscape to explore, distinguishing it from methods like adaptive umbrella sampling. This characteristic makes metadynamics particularly useful when dealing with complex systems.
However, selecting appropriate collective variables (CVs) for a given simulation can be a non-trivial task. CVs are the variables used to describe the system and determine the progress of the simulation. Finding a suitable set of CVs often requires iterative experimentation and exploration. Researchers typically try different combinations of variables and assess their effectiveness in capturing the relevant aspects of the system's behavior.
To assist in this process, several automatic procedures have been proposed to aid in the selection of CVs:
Essential coordinates: This method identifies a set of essential coordinates that capture the slow dynamics and relevant transitions of the system. By focusing on these coordinates, researchers can reduce the dimensionality of the problem and obtain a more compact representation of the system's behavior.
Sketch-Map: The Sketch-Map approach aims to map the high-dimensional configuration space of the system onto a lower-dimensional space. It uses machine learning techniques to identify meaningful low-dimensional representations of the system that capture the important features and transitions.
Non-linear data-driven collective variables: This approach leverages machine learning and data-driven techniques to extract non-linear collective variables directly from the simulation data. These variables can provide a more comprehensive and accurate description of the system's behavior compared to traditional linear CVs.
These automatic procedures offer systematic ways to explore and identify suitable collective variables for metadynamics simulations. They can help researchers overcome the challenge of manually selecting appropriate CVs and accelerate the process of setting up metadynamics simulations for complex systems.
It's important to note that the effectiveness of these procedures can vary depending on the specific system and the nature of the simulation. It is often recommended to combine these automated methods with domain knowledge and expertise to obtain the most informative and relevant collective variables for a given problem.

Multi-replica approach
Independent metadynamics simulations (replicas) can be coupled together to improve usability and parallel performance. There are several such methods proposed: the multiple walker MTD,[20] the parallel tempering MTD,[21] the bias-exchange MTD,[22] and the collective-variable tempering MTD.[23] The last three are similar to the parallel tempering method and use replica exchanges to improve sampling. Typically, the Metropolis���Hastings algorithm is used for replica exchanges, but the infinite swapping[24] and Suwa-Todo[25] algorithms give better replica exchange rates.[26]

High-dimensional approach
Typical (single-replica) MTD simulations can include up to 3 CVs, even using the multi-replica approach, it is hard to exceed 8 CVs, in practice. This limitation comes from the bias potential, constructed by adding Gaussian functions (kernels). It is a special case of the kernel density estimator (KDE). The number of required kernels, for a constant KDE accuracy, increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. So MTD simulation length has to increase exponentially with the number of CVs to maintain the same accuracy of the bias potential. Also, the bias potential, for fast evaluation, is typically approximated with a regular grid.[27] The required memory to store the grid increases exponentially with the number of dimensions (CVs) too.

A high-dimensional generalization of metadynamics is NN2B.[28] It is based on two machine learning algorithms: the nearest-neighbor density estimator (NNDE) and the artificial neural network (ANN). NNDE replaces KDE to estimate the updates of bias potential from short biased simulations, while ANN is used to approximate the resulting bias potential. ANN is a memory-efficient representation of high-dimensional functions, where derivatives (biasing forces) are effectively computed with the backpropagation algorithm.[28][29]

An alternative method, exploiting ANN for the adaptive bias potential, uses mean potential forces for the estimation.[30] This method is also a high-dimensional generalization of the Adaptive Biasing Force (ABF) method.[31] Additionally, the training of ANN is improved using the Bayesian regularization,[32] and the error of approximation can be inferred by training an ensemble of ANNs.[30]

The multi-replica approach in metadynamics simulations involves coupling independent simulations (replicas) to enhance usability and parallel performance. Several methods have been proposed to achieve this:
Multiple walker MTD: This approach involves running multiple independent metadynamics simulations, where each simulation explores a different part of the energy landscape. By combining the results from multiple walkers, a more comprehensive sampling of the system can be achieved.
Parallel tempering MTD: Similar to the parallel tempering method, this approach uses replica exchanges between simulations with different biases. The replica exchanges facilitate enhanced sampling and exploration of different regions of the energy landscape.
Bias-exchange MTD: This method also employs replica exchanges to exchange the bias potential between different simulations. The exchanges allow replicas to explore different portions of the energy landscape and improve overall sampling efficiency.
Collective-variable tempering MTD: This approach utilizes replica exchanges based on collective variables. By exchanging information between replicas with different collective variables, the sampling efficiency can be enhanced.
To facilitate the replica exchanges, various algorithms can be employed. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is commonly used, but other methods like infinite swapping and the Suwa-Todo algorithm have been shown to provide better replica exchange rates.
In high-dimensional metadynamics simulations, the number of collective variables (CVs) that can be effectively employed is limited. Even with the multi-replica approach, it is challenging to exceed around 8 CVs in practice. This limitation arises due to the construction of the bias potential using Gaussian functions (kernels), which is a special case of the kernel density estimator (KDE). The required number of kernels increases exponentially with the number of dimensions, affecting both simulation length and memory requirements.
To address the high-dimensional challenge, alternative methods have been proposed:
NN2B: This approach employs machine learning algorithms, such as the nearest-neighbor density estimator (NNDE) and artificial neural network (ANN), to generalize metadynamics to high-dimensional spaces. NNDE replaces KDE for bias potential estimation, while ANN approximates the resulting bias potential. ANN provides a memory-efficient representation of high-dimensional functions and enables efficient computation of biasing forces using the backpropagation algorithm.
Mean potential forces with ANN: This method extends the use of ANN for adaptive bias potential by utilizing mean potential forces for estimation. It serves as a high-dimensional generalization of the Adaptive Biasing Force (ABF) method. Bayesian regularization is employed to improve the training of ANN, and the error of approximation can be inferred by training an ensemble of ANNs.
These high-dimensional approaches, incorporating machine learning techniques, offer potential solutions for extending metadynamics to systems with a larger number of collective variables, addressing the computational and memory challenges associated with the traditional Gaussian-based bias potential construction.

Recent developments
In 2020, an evolution of metadynamics was proposed, the on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling method (OPES),[33][34][35] which is now the method of choice of Michele Parrinello's research group.[36] The OPES method has only a few robust parameters, converges faster than metadynamics and has a straightforward reweighting scheme.[37] OPES has been implemented in the PLUMED library since version 2.7.[38]

Algorithm
Assume, we have a classical {\textstyle N}{\textstyle N}-particle system with positions at {\textstyle \{{\vec {r}}_{i}\}}{\textstyle \{{\vec {r}}_{i}\}} {\textstyle (i\in 1...N)}{\textstyle (i\in 1...N)} in the Cartesian coordinates {\textstyle ({\vec {r}}_{i}\in \mathbb {R} ^{3})}{\textstyle ({\vec {r}}_{i}\in \mathbb {R} ^{3})}. The particle interaction are described with a potential function {\textstyle V\equiv V(\{{\vec {r}}_{i}\})}{\textstyle V\equiv V(\{{\vec {r}}_{i}\})}. The potential function form (e.g. two local minima separated by a high-energy barrier) prevents an ergodic sampling with molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods.

Original metadynamics
A general idea of MTD is to enhance the system sampling by discouraging revisiting of sampled states. It is achieved by augmenting the system Hamiltonian {\textstyle H}{\textstyle H} with a bias potential {\displaystyle V_{\text{bias}}}{\displaystyle V_{\text{bias}}}:

{\displaystyle H=T+V+V_{\text{bias}}}{\displaystyle H=T+V+V_{\text{bias}}}.
The bias potential is a function of collective variables {\textstyle (V_{\text{bias}}\equiv V_{\text{bias}}({\vec {s}}\,))}{\textstyle (V_{\text{bias}}\equiv V_{\text{bias}}({\vec {s}}\,))}. A collective variable is a function of the particle positions {\displaystyle ({\vec {s}}\equiv {\vec {s}}(\{{\vec {r}}_{i}\}))}{\displaystyle ({\vec {s}}\equiv {\vec {s}}(\{{\vec {r}}_{i}\}))}. The bias potential is continuously updated by adding bias at rate {\displaystyle \omega }\omega , where {\displaystyle {\vec {s}}_{t}}{\displaystyle {\vec {s}}_{t}} is an instantaneous collective variable value at time {\displaystyle t}{\displaystyle t}:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial V_{\text{bias}}({\vec {s}}\,)}{\partial t}}=\omega \,\delta (|{\vec {s}}-{\vec {s}}_{t}|)}{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial V_{\text{bias}}({\vec {s}}\,)}{\partial t}}=\omega \,\delta (|{\vec {s}}-{\vec {s}}_{t}|)}.
At infinitely long simulation time {\displaystyle t_{\text{sim}}}{\displaystyle t_{\text{sim}}}, the accumulated bias potential converges to free energy with opposite sign (and irrelevant constant {\displaystyle C}C):

{\displaystyle V_{\text{bias}}({\vec {s}}\,)=\!\!\int _{0}^{t_{\text{sim}}}\!\!\!\omega \,\delta (|{\vec {s}}-{\vec {s}}_{t}|)\;dt\quad \Rightarrow \quad F({\vec {s}}\,)=-\!\!\!\!\lim _{t_{\text{sim}}\to \infty }\!\!V_{\text{bias}}({\vec {s}}\,)+C}{\displaystyle V_{\text{bias}}({\vec {s}}\,)=\!\!\int _{0}^{t_{\text{sim}}}\!\!\!\omega \,\delta (|{\vec {s}}-{\vec {s}}_{t}|)\;dt\quad \Rightarrow \quad F({\vec {s}}\,)=-\!\!\!\!\lim _{t_{\text{sim}}\to \infty }\!\!V_{\text{bias}}({\vec {s}}\,)+C}
For a computationally efficient , implementation, the update process is discretised into {\displaystyle \tau }\tau  time intervals ({\displaystyle \lfloor \;\rfloor }\lfloor \;\rfloor  denotes the floor function) and {\displaystyle \delta }\delta -function is replaced with a localized positive kernel function {\displaystyle K}K. The bias potential becomes a sum of the kernel functions centred at the instantaneous collective variable values {\displaystyle {\vec {s}}_{j}}{\displaystyle {\vec {s}}_{j}} at time {\displaystyle \tau j}{\displaystyle \tau j}:

{\displaystyle V_{\text{bias}}({\vec {s}}\,)\approx \tau \!\!\!\sum _{j=0}^{\left\lfloor {\frac {t_{\text{sim}}}{\tau }}\right\rfloor }\!\!\omega \,K(|{\vec {s}}-{\vec {s}}_{j}|)}{\displaystyle V_{\text{bias}}({\vec {s}}\,)\approx \tau \!\!\!\sum _{j=0}^{\left\lfloor {\frac {t_{\text{sim}}}{\tau }}\right\rfloor }\!\!\omega \,K(|{\vec {s}}-{\vec {s}}_{j}|)}.
Typically, the kernel is a multi-dimensional Gaussian function, whose covariance matrix has diagonal non-zero elements only:

{\displaystyle V_{\text{bias}}({\vec {s}}\,)\approx \tau \!\!\!\sum _{j=0}^{\left\lfloor {\frac {t_{\text{sim}}}{\tau }}\right\rfloor }\!\!\omega \exp \!\!\left(\!-{\frac {1}{2}}\left|{\frac {{\vec {s}}-{\vec {s}}_{j}}{\vec {\sigma }}}\right|^{2}\right)}{\displaystyle V_{\text{bias}}({\vec {s}}\,)\approx \tau \!\!\!\sum _{j=0}^{\left\lfloor {\frac {t_{\text{sim}}}{\tau }}\right\rfloor }\!\!\omega \exp \!\!\left(\!-{\frac {1}{2}}\left|{\frac {{\vec {s}}-{\vec {s}}_{j}}{\vec {\sigma }}}\right|^{2}\right)}.
The parameter {\displaystyle \tau }\tau , {\displaystyle \omega }\omega , and {\displaystyle {\vec {\sigma }}}\vec \sigma are determined a priori and kept constant during the simulation.

OPES has been implemented in the PLUMED library since version 2.7.
In the original metadynamics algorithm, the system sampling is enhanced by discouraging revisiting of previously sampled states. This is achieved by augmenting the system's Hamiltonian with a bias potential that depends on collective variables. The bias potential is continuously updated by adding Gaussian-shaped bias functions to the energy landscape at a given rate. Over long simulation times, the accumulated bias potential converges to the negative of the free energy landscape.
To make the update process computationally efficient, the continuous time update is discretized into time intervals. The bias potential is approximated as a sum of localized positive kernel functions centered around the instantaneous values of collective variables during each time interval. A common choice for the kernel function is a multidimensional Gaussian with diagonal covariance matrix elements.
The OPES method builds upon this metadynamics framework but introduces improvements. It eliminates the need for an initial estimate of the energy landscape and offers faster convergence. The parameterization of the bias potential, such as the time interval, the bias update rate, and the width of the Gaussian kernel, are determined a priori and kept constant during the simulation.
The high-dimensional nature of metadynamics simulations poses challenges, as the number of collective variables that can be effectively used is limited. The computational cost and memory requirements increase exponentially with the number of dimensions. To address this limitation, alternative methods have been proposed. NN2B is one such approach that employs machine learning algorithms, such as nearest-neighbor density estimation and artificial neural networks, to generalize metadynamics to high-dimensional spaces. These methods offer efficient approximation of the bias potential and biasing forces, making it possible to explore systems with a larger number of collective variables.
These recent developments, including OPES and high-dimensional approaches like NN2B, contribute to advancing the field of metadynamics and enhancing its applicability to a wide range of complex systems in physics, chemistry, and biology.

The pseudocode provided outlines the implementation of metadynamics (MTD) based on molecular dynamics (MD). In this implementation, the system's positions and velocities are denoted by {\displaystyle {{\vec {r}}}} and {\displaystyle {{\vec {v}}}}, respectively. The bias potential, denoted as {\displaystyle V_{\text{bias}}}, is updated every {\displaystyle n} MD steps and contributes to the system forces as {\displaystyle {{\vec {F}}_{\text{bias}}}}.
The implementation follows these steps:
Set initial positions {\displaystyle {{\vec {r}}}} and velocities {\displaystyle {{\vec {v}}}}.
Set the initial bias potential {\displaystyle V_{\text{bias}}({\vec {s}},)} to zero.
During each MD step:
Compute the values of the collective variables {\displaystyle {\vec {s}}_{t}}.
Every {\displaystyle n} MD steps, update the bias potential by adding a Gaussian contribution.
Compute the atomic forces by taking the negative gradient of the total potential energy, including contributions from both the system's potential energy {\displaystyle V({{\vec {r}},})} and the bias potential {\displaystyle V_{\text{bias}}({\vec {s}},)}.
Propagate the positions {\displaystyle {{\vec {r}}}} and velocities {\displaystyle {{\vec {v}}}} by a time step {\displaystyle \Delta t} using MD integration.
Use the resulting bias potential to estimate the free energy landscape by averaging the bias potential over the simulation time from {\displaystyle t_{\text{diff}}} to {\displaystyle t_{\text{sim}}}, where {\displaystyle t_{\text{diff}}} is the time at which the motion along the collective variables becomes diffusive.
Metadynamics has been successfully applied to various scientific problems, including protein folding, chemical reactions, molecular docking, phase transitions, and the encapsulation of DNA onto carbon nanotubes, among others.
It's important to note that the provided pseudocode is a simplified representation, and the actual implementation may require additional details and considerations specific to the simulation software or framework being used.

Metadynamics is a way of overcoming energetic barriers in molecular simulation (Laio & Parrinello, 2002). It���s part of a class of algorithms that focus on making rare-events more frequent in simulations. It���s been getting quite popular: it even has it���s own wikipedia page. One problem with the method is that it has systematic errors at boundaries and this was recently fixed via a method introduced by Michael McGovern and Juan de Pablo (McGovern & de Pablo, 2013). I���m recording the equations here in, since I use an implementation of it and the derivatives weren���t shown in the manuscript, which are necessary for the implementation

Certainly! The McGovern-De Pablo method is a technique that addresses the systematic errors that can arise at boundaries in metadynamics simulations. Metadynamics is a powerful algorithm used to overcome energy barriers in molecular simulations, making rare events more accessible. However, one limitation of metadynamics is that it can introduce artifacts and inaccuracies near simulation boundaries.
The McGovern-De Pablo method, introduced by Michael McGovern and Juan de Pablo in 2013, provides a solution to this issue. The method modifies the traditional metadynamics algorithm by incorporating an additional term in the bias potential that accounts for the distance of each atom from the simulation box edge.
In metadynamics, a bias potential is constructed by adding Gaussian-shaped hills to the free energy landscape as a function of collective variables. The hills encourage the system to explore different regions of the energy landscape. However, near the boundaries, the hills can become distorted, leading to inaccurate sampling.
To correct for this, the McGovern-De Pablo method introduces a corrective term in the bias potential that depends on the distance of each atom from the simulation box edge. This additional term reduces the height of the hills near the boundary, effectively compensating for the distortions. By including this correction, the method improves the accuracy of the simulation results near the boundaries and ensures more reliable sampling.
The McGovern-De Pablo method assumes that the hills added to the bias potential are "zero-force" hills, meaning that the forces on the atoms due to the bias potential are zero at the top of the hills. This assumption allows for a simple correction to be applied near the boundaries without requiring additional information about the system or the free energy surface.
Overall, the McGovern-De Pablo method provides a valuable enhancement to metadynamics simulations, particularly when dealing with finite simulation boxes. It helps to mitigate boundary effects and improve the accuracy of the simulation results, leading to a better understanding of complex molecular systems.

Metadynamics is an efficient method for simulation of the free energy of many-particle systems. Over the last several years it has been applied to study a wide variety of systems, ranging from simple fluids to biological macromolecules. The method relies on uniform sampling along specified collective variables or order parameters. Such order parameters, however, are often bounded, and metadynamics algorithms as originally developed suffer from systematic errors at the corresponding boundaries. While several approaches have been proposed in the past to correct these errors for unidimensional systems, no method exists to fully correct these errors in multi-dimensional systems at points where multiple boundaries meet. Here we present a correction scheme that circumvents this limitation.

The paper titled "A boundary correction algorithm for metadynamics in multiple dimensions" by Michael McGovern and Juan de Pablo, published in the Journal of Chemical Physics in 2013, addresses the issue of systematic errors that can arise at boundaries in metadynamics simulations, particularly in multi-dimensional systems.
Metadynamics is a widely used method for simulating the free energy of many-particle systems. It relies on sampling along collective variables or order parameters to explore the energy landscape. However, when these collective variables are bounded, traditional metadynamics algorithms can introduce systematic errors at the boundaries.
While previous methods have been proposed to correct these errors in one-dimensional systems, the challenge lies in correcting errors in multi-dimensional systems, especially at points where multiple boundaries meet. The paper presents a correction scheme that overcomes this limitation and provides a solution for addressing systematic errors in multi-dimensional metadynamics simulations.
The proposed correction scheme is designed to circumvent the errors that occur at boundary regions. It introduces an additional term in the bias potential that accounts for the proximity of the system to the boundaries. By incorporating this term, the bias potential is modified near the boundaries, effectively reducing the impact of systematic errors.
The algorithm presented in the paper provides a comprehensive approach to correct errors at boundary regions in multi-dimensional metadynamics simulations. By applying this correction scheme, researchers can obtain more accurate free energy landscapes and improve the reliability of their simulations in systems with complex boundaries.
Overall, the paper contributes to the advancement of metadynamics simulations by addressing a significant limitation and providing a practical solution for correcting systematic errors at boundaries in multi-dimensional systems.

Certainly! Let's dive deeper into the description of the boundary correction algorithm proposed by McGovern and de Pablo.
The key idea behind their method is to introduce an additional term in the bias potential that accounts for the system's proximity to the boundaries. This additional term modifies the bias potential near the boundaries and helps mitigate the systematic errors that typically arise in metadynamics simulations in multi-dimensional systems.
To describe their method more specifically, the authors consider a system with collective variables or order parameters that are bounded. These collective variables define the progress of the simulation and are used to construct the bias potential. The bias potential is initially updated using standard metadynamics, where Gaussian-shaped hills are added to the energy landscape to encourage exploration of new regions.
In the McGovern-De Pablo method, once the system approaches the boundaries, the additional term is introduced in the bias potential. This term depends on the distances of the system's collective variables from the boundaries. Its purpose is to reduce the height of the hills near the boundaries, effectively preventing the hills from distorting and introducing artifacts into the simulation.
By modifying the bias potential near the boundaries, the method aims to maintain a more accurate representation of the free energy landscape, even in regions close to the boundaries. This ensures that the simulation accurately captures the energetics and dynamics of the system, without being influenced by the boundary effects that could compromise the reliability of the results.
The specific functional form of the additional term in the bias potential may vary depending on the system and the nature of the boundaries. The authors provide details on how to incorporate this term in the bias potential in their paper, which can be referred to for more specific equations and implementation details.
Overall, the McGovern-De Pablo method introduces a novel approach to correct systematic errors at boundaries in multi-dimensional metadynamics simulations. By modifying the bias potential near the boundaries, the method provides a means to improve the accuracy and reliability of metadynamics simulations, particularly in systems with complex boundary conditions.

Sure! Imagine you are playing a game where you have to explore different areas. To help you find new places, you use a special power called "metadynamics" that creates little hills in the areas you have already been to. These hills make it easier for you to find new places because they push you away from where you've already been.
But there's a problem when you get close to the edges of the game area. The hills become distorted and can give you wrong information. To fix this, the McGovern-De Pablo method adds a special rule. When you get close to the edges, the hills become smaller and less powerful. This way, you can still explore the game area accurately, even near the edges.
By using this special rule, the game becomes more fair and reliable. You can explore and discover new places without getting confused by the distorted hills at the edges. It's like having a better map for your game that helps you find all the hidden treasures!

Metadynamics

For an up to date list of pubblication on this subject, see this page.

The method is aimed at reconstructing the multidimensional free energy of complex systems, and is based on an artificial dynamics (metadynamics) performed in the space defined by a few collective variables S, which are assumed to provide a coarse-grained description of the system (see Ref. [1] and, for a recent review, Ref. [2]). The dynamics is driven by the free energy and is biased by a history-dependent potential constructed as a sum of Gaussians centered along the trajectory of the collective variables. If a new Gaussian is added at every time interval tG, the biasing potential at time t is given by

where w and ds are the height and the width of the Gaussians and st=S(x(t) is the value of the collective variable at time t. This potential, in time, fills the minima in the free energy surface, i.e. the sum of the Gaussians and of the free energy becomes approximately a constant as a function of the collective variables.

Example of metadynamics fillingThis approach can be exploited not only for efficiently computing the free energy, but also for exploring new reaction pathways and accelerating rare events.
In the example in figure, the dynamics is started from the minimum at the center. This minimum is quickly filled with Gaussians, and the system evolves through the lowest saddle point, the one at the left. This illustrates how the method has the property of making the system escape local free energy minima through the lowest free energy saddle point.
Afterwards, the dynamics continues, and all the free energy profile is filled with Gaussians. At the end, the sum of the Gaussians provides the negative image of the free energy. This illustrates how the method can be used for estimating the free energy .

The collective variables

The gist of the method is to identify the variables that are of interest and that are difficult to sample, since the stable minima in the space spanned by these variables are separated by barriers that cannot be cleared in the available simulation time. These variables S(x) are functions of the coordinates of the system, they can be up to three in practical applications, and they depend on the process that one wants to study. For example, in a chemical reaction one can use as collective variables all the coordination number between the atomic species involved in the reaction (see Ref. [2] for more details).


Example of metadynamics fillingConsider the example in figure. The dynamics of the system takes place on a 2-dimensional potential energy surface. The normal dynamics is biased by a metadynamics potential acting on x. Then, in this specific case, S(x)=x. In the lower panel, we show the free energy (thick line), and the sum of the free energy and the history-dependent potential at various simulation times (thin lines).

After a transient, the sum of VG(s,t) and of F(s) becomes approximately flat, indicating that VG(s,t)~-F(s). This allows estimating the free energy as the time average of all the VG(s,t).

In reference [3] it is shown that each VG(s,t)~-F(s) is an unbiased estimator of the free energy if the dynamics along s is very slow compared to the dynamics along the transvere degrees of freedom (y in the example in Figure). As it is clear from the movie, even if this condition is violated the history-dependent potential estimates reather accurately the free energy.

However, choosing the correct collective variable in applications can be far from trivial. If the

Metadynamics is a powerful method used in scientific research to understand complex systems. It helps scientists reconstruct the "free energy" of these systems, which is a measure of how stable or favorable different states are. This method uses a technique called "artificial dynamics" and focuses on a few variables that describe the system, called collective variables.
In metadynamics, the system's dynamics are driven by the free energy and biased by a potential that is constructed as a sum of Gaussians centered along the trajectory of the collective variables. These Gaussians gradually fill the low-energy regions of the free energy surface, allowing the system to explore different states and escape from local energy minima. As more Gaussians are added, the sum of the Gaussians and the free energy become approximately constant as a function of the collective variables.
By using metadynamics, scientists can efficiently compute the free energy, explore new reaction pathways, and accelerate rare events in the system. The choice of collective variables is crucial and depends on the specific process being studied. For example, in a chemical reaction, the coordination number between the atomic species involved in the reaction can be used as a collective variable.
Metadynamics is a valuable tool in various fields of science, including biophysics, chemistry, and material science. It has been extensively studied and developed by researchers like Alessandro Laio and Michele Parrinello. Their work has contributed to the understanding and application of metadynamics in studying complex systems and estimating free energies.

Connections with this: Your perspective brings a different take on the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and its applications, and it's certainly a valid one. The beauty of theoretical frameworks is that they can be applied and extended in different ways depending on one's viewpoint and focus.

The Free Energy Principle is indeed often viewed as a 'universal principle', applicable across different scales and systems, not just at the level of the brain but also at the level of cells, organisms, societies, and even potentially physics. From this perspective, it's not just a theory of brain function, but a theory of everything.

Your mention of the Curry-Howard isomorphism is interesting. For those who might not be familiar, the Curry-Howard isomorphism is a correspondence between systems of formal logic and computational calculi, where proofs correspond to programs, and proof normalization corresponds to program execution. This is a deep insight in the foundations of computer science and logic.

Integrating this into the Free Energy Principle could potentially lead to new ways of conceptualizing 'understanding' and 'inference', where the 'proof' (or the prediction or action) exists by virtue of its 'program' (or the neural activity patterns or processes).

However, keep in mind that the extension of FEP to all these levels remains a hypothesis, and there is ongoing debate in the scientific community regarding its validity, interpretation, and implications.

Experiment Directed Metadynamics (EDM) is an extension of the metadynamics method that allows for the exploration of specific chemical reactions or transformations in complex molecular systems. While traditional metadynamics enhances the sampling of rare events in a system, EDM focuses on driving the system towards a predefined reaction pathway or transition state.
The idea behind EDM is to bias the system's dynamics along a specific reaction coordinate or set of collective variables that describe the progress of the desired chemical transformation. By adding a bias potential that guides the system along the reaction pathway, EDM accelerates the sampling of relevant states and enhances the understanding of the reaction mechanism.
The key steps involved in performing EDM are as follows:
Definition of Collective Variables: First, suitable collective variables (CVs) need to be identified that describe the reaction progress. These CVs can be chosen based on the specific chemical transformation under investigation. For example, in a chemical reaction involving bond formation or breaking, the bond length or bond angle could be selected as CVs.
Construction of the Bias Potential: A bias potential is constructed based on the chosen CVs to guide the system along the desired reaction pathway. This bias potential is typically represented as a sum of Gaussian functions centered along the reaction coordinate(s). The height and width of the Gaussians determine the strength and range of the bias.
Simulation with Bias Potential: The system is simulated in the presence of the bias potential. As the simulation progresses, the bias potential encourages the system to explore the reaction pathway by reducing the barriers associated with the desired transformation. The bias potential is continuously updated during the simulation to fill the free energy landscape along the reaction coordinate(s).
Analysis of Results: The simulation results are analyzed to gain insights into the reaction mechanism and transition state. By examining the sampled configurations, energy profiles, and transition probabilities, researchers can infer the energetics, kinetics, and other relevant properties of the chemical reaction.
Experiment Directed Metadynamics provides a powerful tool for studying complex chemical reactions, exploring reaction pathways, and estimating reaction rates. It enables researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying processes and can guide the design of new catalysts or reaction conditions.
It's important to note that the success of EDM relies on the proper choice of collective variables and the accuracy of the bias potential. Selecting appropriate CVs that capture the essential features of the reaction is crucial. Additionally, the parameters of the bias potential, such as the Gaussian width and deposition rate, need to be carefully tuned to ensure efficient exploration of the reaction pathway.
Overall, EDM offers a systematic approach to investigating chemical reactions computationally and holds promise for accelerating the discovery and optimization of new chemical processes.

Here are some key points about EDM compared to other methods:

- EDM biases simulations minimally to match entire free energy surfaces, rather than just average values (like in EDS). This allows it to match more detailed experimental data.

- EDM creates a tunable mixture of the experimental data and the unbiased ensemble, with explicit weighting ratios. This allows it to handle cases where experimental data is limited or incomplete by putting more weight on the unbiased ensemble. 

- EDM is proven to converge to a minimal, unique bias. This means it does not overfit the experimental data and the final model is objective.

- EDM has been used to construct atomistic models that follow a target free energy surface. For example, it has been used to match a radial distribution function for a Lennard-Jones fluid and to improve a classical force field for an electrolyte solution using ab initio data.

- In the electrolyte solution example, EDM was able to fix inaccuracies in the model by using limited ab initio data as an experimental target. Even though the ab initio data was not complete, EDM was able to construct an improved model by weighting it appropriately with the unbiased ensemble.

- Another example is using EDM to construct an atomistic alanine dipeptide model that matches experimental phi/psi free energy profiles. By targeting this more complex experimental data, EDM created a model that improved on previous approaches.

In summary, EDM is able to use limited experimental data to systematically improve simulations in a minimally biased, objective way. By weighting experimental data and unbiased ensembles, it can handle incomplete data and avoid overfitting. It has been used to successfully create more accurate models of complex systems where traditional approaches have struggled.

EDM stands for experiment directed metadynamics. It is a technique for biasing molecular simulations to match experimental data.

Here is a simple example:

Say you want to model a particle in a box. You run a standard molecular dynamics simulation and calculate the particle's radial distribution function (RDF), which shows its probability of being at different distances from the box center. However, the RDF from your simulation does not match the RDF measured experimentally.

EDM allows you to fix this by re-running the simulation with an added bias. This bias gently pushes the simulation toward the experimental RDF. EDM starts with a small bias, runs the simulation, and updates the bias. It repeats this, gradually decreasing the bias, until the simulated RDF matches the experimental one.

The final result is a simulation that matches the target data, but with a minimal bias. EDM avoids overfitting the data by constructing a tunable mixture of the biased and unbiased ensembles. It has a "mixing ratio" that controls how much weight to give the experimental data versus the unbiased simulation.

So in short, EDM biases simulations to match experimental data through an iterative process that results in a minimally biased model. It gives you an accurate model that still behaves realistically where you lack experimental data.

Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. Thank you for clarifying the specific context of Experiment Directed Metadynamics (EDM). Based on your explanation, here is a revised summary:
Experiment Directed Metadynamics (EDM) is a technique used to bias molecular simulations in order to match experimental data. It is particularly useful when the simulation results deviate from the desired experimental observables.
To illustrate how EDM works, let's consider the example of modeling a particle in a box. Initially, a standard molecular dynamics simulation is performed, but the calculated radial distribution function (RDF) does not match the experimental RDF.
With EDM, the simulation is rerun with an added bias that nudges the system towards the desired experimental RDF. The bias is gradually reduced through an iterative process. In each iteration, the simulation is performed, and the bias is updated based on the discrepancy between the simulated RDF and the experimental RDF. This iterative process continues until the simulated RDF closely matches the experimental RDF.
The key advantage of EDM is that it achieves this matching while keeping the bias as minimal as possible. It achieves this by creating a tunable mixture of the biased and unbiased ensembles. The "mixing ratio" determines the weight given to the experimental data versus the unbiased simulation, thus avoiding overfitting the data.
In summary, EDM is a powerful technique that biases molecular simulations to align with experimental data. It achieves a close match between simulation and experiment by iteratively adjusting a minimal bias. By incorporating experimental information, EDM enhances the accuracy and realism of simulations in cases where experimental data is limited or incomplete.

verify whether the chosen CVs are sufficient or redundant, and how to iteratively improve the CVs using machine learning approaches.

Key points
Metadynamics makes it possible to accelerate conformational transitions between metastable states, broadening the scope of molecular dynamics simulations.

Like other enhanced sampling methods, metadynamics requires the introduction of low-dimensional descriptors (collective variables) whose choice affects the rate at which transitions are enhanced. The ideal collective variable should take different values not only in all the relevant metastable states but also in the transition states between them.

The appropriate collective variables can be found by trial and error or designed automatically using methods inspired by machine learning.

Two variants of metadynamics are commonly used, namely ordinary and well-tempered metadynamics. The former has the advantage of inducing transitions between the metastable states even if the collective variable is not ideal. The latter has the advantage of providing an exact estimator of the free energy.

Metadynamics can be used in combination with most molecular dynamics software packages by taking advantage of dedicated software libraries that implement the method and a large number of collective variables.

In metadynamics, the choice of collective variables (CVs) is crucial as they determine the effectiveness of enhancing conformational transitions between metastable states. The ideal CVs should capture the differences between relevant metastable states and transition states.
Traditionally, the selection of CVs involves trial and error, where researchers manually test different variables to find the most appropriate ones. However, machine learning approaches have emerged as a promising avenue for iteratively improving the choice of CVs.
Machine learning techniques can be employed to automatically explore and evaluate a large number of potential CVs. These methods leverage algorithms that search for patterns or correlations within the data and identify informative descriptors. For example, dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA) can extract meaningful low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional data.
By iteratively applying machine learning approaches, researchers can refine the set of CVs and improve their ability to capture relevant states and transitions. This iterative process involves training machine learning models on simulation data, evaluating the performance of different CVs, and selecting or generating new CVs based on the insights gained from the models.
It is worth noting that there are two commonly used variants of metadynamics: ordinary metadynamics and well-tempered metadynamics. Ordinary metadynamics can induce transitions between metastable states even with suboptimal CVs, while well-tempered metadynamics provides an exact estimator of the free energy. These variants, along with dedicated software libraries, make it possible to combine metadynamics with various molecular dynamics software packages and employ a wide range of CVs.
In summary, metadynamics can benefit from machine learning approaches to iteratively improve the selection of CVs. By leveraging automated methods and data-driven insights, researchers can refine their choice of CVs and enhance the effectiveness of metadynamics in exploring complex conformational landscapes.

Abstract
Creating models that are consistent with experimental data is essential in molecular modeling. This is often done by iteratively tuning the molecular force field of a simulation to match experimental data. An alternative method is to bias a simulation, leading to a hybrid model composed of the original force field and biasing terms. We previously introduced such a method called experiment directed simulation (EDS). EDS minimally biases simulations to match average values. In this work, we introduce a new method called experiment directed metadynamics (EDM) that creates minimal biases for matching entire free energy surfaces such as radial distribution functions and phi/psi angle free energies. It is also possible with EDM to create a tunable mixture of the experimental data and free energy of the unbiased ensemble with explicit ratios. EDM can be proven to be convergent, and we also present proof, via a maximum entropy argument, that the final bias is minimal and unique. Examples of its use are given in the construction of ensembles that follow a desired free energy. The example systems studied include a Lennard-Jones fluid made to match a radial distribution function, an atomistic model augmented with bioinformatics data, and a three-component electrolyte solution where ab initio simulation data is used to improve a classical empirical model.

The paper by Andrew D. White, James F. Dama, and Gregory A. Voth, titled "Designing free energy surfaces that match experimental data with metadynamics," introduces a method called experiment directed metadynamics (EDM). The goal of EDM is to create simulation models that are consistent with experimental data by biasing the simulations in a minimal and controlled manner.
Traditionally, molecular modeling involves iteratively adjusting the force field parameters to match experimental data. EDM takes a different approach by introducing biasing terms into the simulations, resulting in a hybrid model that combines the original force field with the biases. The method goes beyond matching average values and aims to match entire free energy surfaces, such as radial distribution functions and phi/psi angle free energies.
EDM allows for the creation of a tunable mixture of experimental data and the free energy of the unbiased ensemble, with explicit weighting ratios. This flexibility is particularly useful when experimental data is limited or incomplete. By adjusting the weighting ratios, researchers can control the influence of experimental data on the final model.
The paper presents proof of the convergence of EDM and demonstrates, through a maximum entropy argument, that the final bias generated by the method is minimal and unique. This ensures that the resulting model does not overfit the experimental data and maintains objectivity.
The authors provide examples of how EDM can be applied to construct ensembles that follow desired free energy surfaces. These examples include matching a radial distribution function for a Lennard-Jones fluid, augmenting an atomistic model with bioinformatics data, and improving a classical empirical model for a three-component electrolyte solution using ab initio simulation data.
In summary, the paper introduces experiment directed metadynamics (EDM) as a method for designing simulation models that match experimental data by biasing the simulations in a controlled manner. EDM offers flexibility in incorporating experimental data into the models and provides proofs of convergence and minimal bias. The examples presented demonstrate the effectiveness of EDM in constructing accurate simulation ensembles.

A Lennard-Jones fluid refers to a simple model system in molecular simulations that represents the interactions between particles or atoms using the Lennard-Jones potential. The Lennard-Jones potential is a mathematical function that describes the pairwise interactions between particles in a system. It accounts for both attractive (van der Waals) and repulsive forces.
In the Lennard-Jones potential, the attractive term decreases with distance, representing the van der Waals forces that draw particles closer together. The repulsive term increases steeply as particles come very close to each other, preventing them from overlapping.
A Lennard-Jones fluid is a collection of particles interacting with each other through the Lennard-Jones potential. It is often used as a simple model for studying the behavior of gases, liquids, and solids at the atomic or molecular level. Despite its simplicity, the Lennard-Jones fluid captures important aspects of intermolecular interactions, such as the formation of clusters, phase transitions, and the emergence of liquid-like or solid-like behavior.
By simulating a Lennard-Jones fluid, researchers can gain insights into the thermodynamic and structural properties of real fluids and study fundamental concepts related to intermolecular forces and phase behavior. Additionally, the Lennard-Jones fluid serves as a benchmark system for testing and developing new simulation techniques and algorithms in the field of molecular dynamics and computational chemistry.

In computational chemistry, the Lennard-Jones potential (also termed the LJ potential or 12-6 potential; named for John Lennard-Jones) is an intermolecular pair potential. Out of all the intermolecular potentials, the Lennard-Jones potential is probably the one that has been the most extensively studied. It is considered an archetype model for simple yet realistic intermolecular interactions.

The Lennard-Jones potential models soft repulsive and attractive (van der Waals) interactions. Hence, the Lennard-Jones potential describes electronically neutral atoms or molecules.[1][2][3] The commonly used expression for the Lennard-Jones potential is

The Lennard-Jones potential is a simplified model that yet describes the essential features of interactions between simple atoms and molecules: Two interacting particles repel each other at very close distance, attract each other at moderate distance, and do not interact at infinite distance, as shown in Figure 1. The Lennard-Jones potential is a pair potential, i.e. no three- or multi-body interactions are covered by the potential.

Statistical mechanics[4] and computer simulations[5][6] can be used to study the Lennard-Jones potential and to obtain thermophysical properties of the 'Lennard-Jones substance'. The Lennard-Jones substance is often referred to as 'Lennard-Jonesium,' suggesting that it is viewed as a (fictive) chemical element.[7] Moreover, its energy and length parameters can be adjusted to fit many different real substances. Both the Lennard-Jones potential and, accordingly, the Lennard-Jones substance are simplified yet realistic models, such as they accurately capture essential physical principles like the presence of a critical and a triple point, condensation and freezing. Due in part to its mathematical simplicity, the Lennard-Jones potential has been extensively used in studies on matter since the early days of computer simulation.[8][9][10][11] The Lennard-Jones potential is probably still the most frequently studied model potential.[12][7]

The Lennard-Jones potential is usually the standard choice for the development of theories for matter (especially soft-matter) as well as for the development and testing of computational methods and algorithms. Upon adjusting the model parameters �� and �� to real substance properties, the Lennard-Jones potential can be used to describe simple substance (like noble gases) with good accuracy. Furthermore, the Lennard-Jones potential is often used as a building block in molecular models (a.k.a. force fields) for more complex substances.[13][14][15][16][17]

The Lennard-Jones potential is a mathematical model that describes the interactions between particles or atoms in computational chemistry. It is one of the most extensively studied intermolecular potentials and is widely used as a simple yet realistic model for describing intermolecular interactions.
The Lennard-Jones potential captures both the repulsive and attractive forces between particles. At very close distances, the particles repel each other due to overlapping electron clouds, while at moderate distances, they attract each other due to van der Waals forces. At infinite distance, the particles do not interact. The potential is described by the equation:
V_LJ(r) = 4�� [(��/r)^12 - (��/r)^6],
where r is the distance between the particles, �� is the depth of the potential well (referred to as the "dispersion energy"), and �� is the distance at which the potential energy is zero (referred to as the "size of the particle"). The potential has a minimum at a distance of r_min = 2^(1/6)��, where the potential energy is -��.
The Lennard-Jones potential is a simplified yet realistic model that accurately captures essential physical principles such as the presence of a critical point, condensation, and freezing. It is often used to study thermophysical properties of substances and can be adjusted to fit the properties of real substances. The Lennard-Jones potential has been extensively used in computer simulations and studies on matter, and it is still one of the most frequently studied model potentials. It serves as a standard choice for developing theories, testing computational methods, and building more complex molecular models for substances.
In summary, the Lennard-Jones potential is a widely used model that describes the interactions between particles or atoms in computational chemistry. It provides a simplified representation of intermolecular forces and is valuable for studying various thermodynamic and structural properties of substances.

Abstract
Molecular dynamics calculations of the pressure and configurational energy of a Lennard-Jones fluid are reported for 108 state conditions in the density range 0��35 ��� ��* ��� 1��20 and temperature range 0��5 ��� T* ��� 6 (where ��* = ����3, T* = kT/��). Particular attention is paid to the dense fluid region (��* ��� 0��9), including state conditions in the subcooled liquid region. These new simulation results for P and U are combined with those of previous workers, together with low density values calculated from the virial series and values of the second virial coefficients themselves, to derive an equation of state for the Lennard-Jones fluid that is valid over a wide range of temperatures and densities. The equation of state used is a modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation having 33 constants. It fits the data well over the density range 0 ��� ��* ��� 1��2 and for T* values ranging from 0��5 to 6��0 (the exact temperature range depending to some extent on the density considered). We also calculate for the same range of state conditions, certain two- and three-body integrals (J, K and L) that occur in perturbation theory for molecular fluids. An interpolation formula is presented for the estimation of these integrals.

A density functional approach is presented to describe the crystal-liquid interfaces and crystal nucleations of Lennard-Jones fluid. Within the theoretical framework, the modified fundamental measure theory is applied to describe the free energy functional of hard sphere repulsion, and the weighted density method based on first order mean spherical approximation is used to describe the free energy contribution arising from the attractive interaction. The liquid-solid equilibria, density profiles within crystal cells and at liquid-solid interfaces, interfacial tensions, nucleation free energy barriers, and critical cluster sizes are calculated for face-centered-cubic and body-centered-cubic nucleus. Some results are in good agreement with available simulation data, indicating that the present model is quantitatively reliable in describing nucleation thermodynamics of Lennard-Jones fluid

A Lennard-Jones fluid is a computational model widely used in computational chemistry to study intermolecular interactions.[1] It is named after John Lennard-Jones, who introduced the Lennard-Jones potential, also known as the LJ potential or 12-6 potential, that describes the interactions between particles in the fluid. The LJ potential captures the essential features of electronically neutral atoms or molecules, including repulsive and attractive van der Waals interactions.[2]

The LJ potential is given by the equation:

{\displaystyle V_{\text{LJ}}(r)=4\varepsilon \left[\left({\frac {\sigma }{r}}\right)^{12}-\left({\frac {\sigma }{r}}\right)^{6}\right]}
{\displaystyle V_{\text{LJ}}(r)=4\varepsilon \left[\left({\frac {\sigma }{r}}\right)^{12}-\left({\frac {\sigma }{r}}\right)^{6}\right]}

Here, V represents the distance between two interacting particles, �� is the depth of the potential well (dispersion energy), and �� is the distance at which the potential energy is zero (size of the particle). The LJ potential exhibits a repulsive force at very close distances, an attractive force at moderate distances, and no interaction at infinite distance.

Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to study the Lennard-Jones fluid under various state conditions. These simulations provide information about the pressure and configurational energy of the fluid at different densities and temperatures.

A comprehensive equation of state for the Lennard-Jones fluid has been derived by combining simulation results with values calculated from the virial series and second virial coefficients[3]. This equation of state, known as the modified Benedict���Webb���Rubin equation, incorporates 33 constants and accurately describes the behavior of the Lennard-Jones fluid over a wide range of temperatures and densities.

Additionally, two- and three-body integrals (J, K, and L) that occur in perturbation theory for molecular fluids have been calculated for the Lennard-Jones fluid under various state conditions[4].

2022, 2021, Ansell et al., 2022]. Adapters are bottleneck layers (usually placed after the feedforward 
layers) that add extra capacity when adapting to a different task or language. Our proposed forgetting 
mechanism can also be applied to adapter-based methods as we can allow forgetting to happen in 
the adapter layers. The current choice of forgetting embeddings keeps the architecture intact and 
incurs no additional hyperparameter tuning, allowing us to understand the fundamental capability of 
forgetting pretraining. 
6Conclusion & Future work 
6.1Conclusions 
While forgetting is usually perceived as negative, recent work point out that it can also be benef i cial in 
certain cases, particularly for quickly learning new tasks, training in non-stationary environments [Igl 
et al., 2021, Nikishin et al., 2022, D���Oro et al., 2023] and improving sample eff i ciency [Taha et al., 
2021, Zhou et al., 2022]. Joining this line of work, our paper demonstrates that forgetting techniques 
can improve pretrained language models by imbuing them with more linguistic plasticity. Specif i cally, 
our proposed active forgetting mechanism can create PLMs that are easier to rewire for new lingual 
spaces. Experiments with RoBERTa show that models pretrained via active forgetting can better 
learn from small amounts of data while also enjoying faster convergence during language adaptation, 
particularly for languages distant from English. 
Going beyond language adaptation, we argue that rewirable PLMs are a promising direction for future 
research, as they allow easier adaptation to various tasks, domains, languages and can evolve faster 
as the real world changes. Unlike symbolic methods, such as knowledge graphs, which can easily 
rewire a fact by modifying the corresponding knowledge triplet, current static PLMs are harder to 
rewire since changing one fact via updating model weights may disrupt multiple other facts without 
substantial post-hoc intervention. Improving the rewirability via forgetting pretraining thus can be 
seen as one way of imbuing PLMs with similar benef i ts as symbolic methods (making the resulted 
model more controllable i.e. can be modif i ed with tiny cost), complementing the line of post-hoc 
model editing research [Mitchell et al., 2021, 2022]. 
6.2Limitations 
Our work considers the simplest form of forgetting: directly discarding the learned embedding 
weights and resetting them to some random initialization. Future work could consider more advanced 
forgetting techniques such as gradually injecting noise into the embedding weights. We focus 
on masked language modeling with language-specif i c tokenizers. It would be interesting to also 
investigate active forgetting for auto-regressive language modeling (e.g. the GPT family models) and 
various tokenizers. 
On the theory front, potential connections can be made between forgetting and meta-learning [Schaul 
and Schmidhuber, 2010, Thrun and Pratt, 2012, Andrychowicz et al., 2016, Finn et al., 2017] since 
both attempt to learn solutions that can quickly adapt themselves to new inputs. Another possible 
theoretical explanation for why active forgetting works so well might be related to the l atness of 
the solution in the loss landscape [Alabdulmohsin et al., 2021]. Flatter minima tend to enjoy better 
generalization [Liu et al., 2023]. Thus, it might be worthwhile to study the l atness of the transformer 
body during the forgetting pretraining.

The proposed active forgetting mechanism can be applied to adapter-based methods, which utilize bottleneck layers called adapters to add extra capacity for different tasks or languages [Pfeiffer et al., 2020, 2022, 2021, Ansell et al., 2022]. By allowing forgetting to occur in the adapter layers, the architecture can maintain its integrity without the need for additional hyperparameter tuning. This approach enhances the fundamental capability of forgetting pretraining.
In conclusion, while forgetting is typically viewed as negative, recent research highlights its potential benefits, such as aiding in quick learning of new tasks, training in non-stationary environments, and improving sample efficiency [Igl et al., 2021, Nikishin et al., 2022, D'Oro et al., 2023, Taha et al., 2021, Zhou et al., 2022]. This study demonstrates that forgetting techniques can enhance pretrained language models (PLMs) by increasing their linguistic plasticity. The proposed active forgetting mechanism enables the creation of PLMs that are more easily adaptable to new linguistic spaces.
The experiments conducted using RoBERTa show that models pretrained with active forgetting exhibit improved learning from limited data and faster convergence during language adaptation, especially for languages that are distant from English. This research suggests that rewirable PLMs, facilitated by active forgetting, are a promising direction for future investigation. These models can facilitate easier adaptation to diverse tasks, domains, and languages, allowing them to evolve quickly alongside real-world changes. By enhancing rewirability, PLMs can achieve benefits similar to symbolic methods, such as knowledge graphs, enabling efficient modifications with minimal cost. This complements existing research on post-hoc model editing [Mitchell et al., 2021, 2022].
Some limitations of this work include the simplicity of the forgetting approach, which directly discards learned embedding weights and resets them to random initialization. Future studies could explore more advanced forgetting techniques, such as gradually injecting noise into the embedding weights. Additionally, while the focus of this research is on masked language modeling with language-specific tokenizers, investigating active forgetting in auto-regressive language modeling (e.g., GPT family models) and different tokenizers would be valuable.
On the theoretical front, potential connections can be made between forgetting and meta-learning [Schaul and Schmidhuber, 2010, Thrun and Pratt, 2012, Andrychowicz et al., 2016, Finn et al., 2017], as both aim to learn solutions that can adapt quickly to new inputs. Another theoretical explanation for the efficacy of active forgetting may relate to the flatness of the solution in the loss landscape [Alabdulmohsin et al., 2021]. Flatter minima often exhibit better generalization [Liu et al., 2023], suggesting the value of studying the flatness of the transformer body during forgetting pretraining.

The passage discusses the notion of "platform meaning extraction" and the general business model of becoming a model of the world. It raises the question of how AI, BERT, and GPT-3 are constructed and contingent, highlighting the need to consider alternative possibilities. The association between AI and ethics is examined, with a recognition of the problematic nature of this connection. The passage points out the vagueness and formalism of major ethical principles and the normative and political aspects involved in manufacturing legitimacy within ethical discourses. The Gebru affair is cited as an example that exposes the tension between what companies want to say and what they need to do, with financial interests influencing the examination of large language models. The discussion of discrimination and bias in "Stochastic Parrots" is seen as a reflection of a more fundamental and structural problem. The passage emphasizes the need for accountability and highlights the practical implications of criticism. It also references insider accounts that highlight conflicts between business interests and moral values within companies like Google.

These are very interesting and complex questions that I cannot answer fully in this chat. However, I can try to provide some brief pointers or suggestions for each question.

Linguistic plasticity can be applied to other domains beyond language adaptation, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, by considering how models can learn to adapt to changing environments, tasks, and data sources, and how they can leverage prior knowledge and experience to improve their performance and generalization. For example, meta-learning, transfer learning, and continual learning are some approaches that aim to achieve this kind of plasticity in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

The principles of forgetting and adaptation can be integrated into the development and training of language models, specifically those based on adapters and sparse fine-tuning, by using techniques such as elastic weight consolidation, dropout, pruning, distillation, or regularization to selectively forget or retain information from the pre-trained model, and by using adapters or sparse layers to fine-tune the model on specific tasks, languages, or domains. For example, the Reformer model uses reversible layers and local attention to reduce memory consumption and enable efficient fine-tuning.

Rewirable pre-trained language models have the potential to be more adaptable to different tasks, languages, and domains, by allowing the model to dynamically rewire its connections and parameters according to the input and output requirements. This could also enable more symbolic methods and post-hoc model editing research, by allowing the model to incorporate explicit rules or constraints into its representations and outputs. For example, the RNNbow model uses a rewiring mechanism to learn sparse and interpretable representations of natural language.

The notion of active forgetting in pre-training language models aligns with theories of meta-learning and the flatness of solutions in the loss landscape, by suggesting that forgetting can be a useful strategy to find more generalizable solutions that can perform well across different tasks and domains. The flatness of the transformer body during forgetting pretraining could provide insights into how the model learns to balance between specificity and generality, and how it allocates its capacity and complexity. For example, the FORGET-ME-NOT model uses active forgetting to improve the generalization of pre-trained language models.

The platformization and datafication of everyday life contribute to the dominance of tech giants like Google and the potential challenges of interpretability and explicability in AI systems, by creating a feedback loop between data collection, algorithmic optimization, and user behavior, which reinforces the power and influence of these platforms over various aspects of society. The interpretability and explicability of AI systems become more challenging as these systems become more complex, opaque, and ubiquitous, and as they affect more critical decisions and outcomes. For example, the Google search engine is an example of a platform that shapes how people access information and knowledge online.

The political and economic implications of AI and natural language processing are manifold, particularly in terms of power dynamics, distribution of resources, and the control exerted by major companies. AI and natural language processing can have positive impacts such as enhancing productivity, innovation, communication, education, etc., but they can also have negative impacts such as displacing workers, creating inequalities, manipulating opinions, infringing privacy, etc. The control exerted by major companies over AI and natural language processing can affect how these technologies are developed, deployed, regulated, and used. The issues of copyright and ownership of content generated by language models are also relevant, as they raise questions about the originality, authenticity, authorship, and value of such content. For example, the GPT-3 model is an example of a powerful language model that is controlled by a single company (OpenAI).

The Gebru affair sheds light on the relationship between AI, ethics, and power, by exposing the tensions and conflicts between the corporate interests and values of Google and the ethical and social concerns of some of its researchers, especially those from marginalized and underrepresented groups. The Gebru affair also reveals the challenges and risks of conducting and publishing critical research on AI within the industry, and the need for more independent, diverse, and inclusive voices in AI research. Critical hermeneutics and Critical AI Studies can contribute to a deeper understanding of the co-optation, marginalization, and silencing of criticism within the AI industry, by providing theoretical frameworks, methodologies, and perspectives to critically examine and challenge the assumptions, values, and impacts of AI systems. For example, the paper ���On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?��� is an example of critical research on AI that was rejected by Google.

Indeed, reflexivity is crucial in navigating the automation of language and engaging with AI systems. It allows us to critically examine our own assumptions, biases, and perspectives, which in turn helps us better understand and interpret the implications and impact of these systems.
When interacting with AI systems, such as language models, it is important to be aware of the limitations and biases inherent in their training data and algorithms. Reflexivity prompts us to question how these biases may influence the outputs and decisions made by AI systems, and to consider the potential ethical and societal consequences.
Moreover, reflexivity encourages us to reflect on our own role in shaping AI systems. As users, developers, or researchers, we contribute to the design, implementation, and application of these technologies. By engaging in reflexivity, we can scrutinize the values and assumptions embedded in AI systems and challenge them when necessary.
Additionally, reflexivity helps us recognize the broader social, cultural, and economic contexts in which AI operates. It prompts us to consider who benefits and who is marginalized or harmed by these systems, as well as the power dynamics at play. This understanding is crucial for promoting fairness, accountability, and transparency in the development and deployment of AI technologies.
In summary, reflexivity empowers us to critically engage with AI systems, question their assumptions and biases, and advocate for more responsible and equitable practices in the field of AI.

The last question was How does the concept of world, as discussed by Ricoeur, relate to the understanding of language and its automation? How does the intersection of reality, interpretation, and signification shape the meaning and implications of AI and natural language processing?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept of "world" as discussed by Ricoeur relates to the understanding of language and its automation in several ways. Ricoeur sees the world as being constituted through language, where language both reflects and shapes our understanding of reality. Language is not just a tool for describing the world; it actively participates in the creation and interpretation of meaning.
In the context of AI and natural language processing, the intersection of reality, interpretation, and signification becomes significant. Language models like BERT and GPT-3 aim to interpret and generate text, but their understanding is limited to statistical patterns and correlations in vast amounts of data. They lack a deeper grasp of the meaning and context behind the words they process.
This raises questions about the implications of AI and natural language processing. Without a comprehensive understanding of the world, these models may produce outputs that are detached from human experience and values. The interpretation and signification of language become mechanistic and divorced from the rich tapestry of cultural, historical, and social contexts that give meaning to human communication.
Ricoeur's philosophy emphasizes the importance of interpretation and understanding in engaging with texts and the world. The meaning of language emerges through a dialectical process of interpretation, where the reader brings their own understanding and engages in a dialogue with the text. This hermeneutic approach recognizes the situatedness of interpretation within a broader cultural and historical context.
In the realm of AI and natural language processing, a critical hermeneutic perspective becomes essential. It calls for a nuanced understanding of the limitations and biases embedded in these systems, as well as the social and cultural implications of their use. It prompts us to question the power dynamics at play, who benefits or is marginalized, and how these systems shape the world of meaning.
By considering the intersection of reality, interpretation, and signification, we can critically examine the role of AI and natural language processing in constructing and shaping the world of language. It calls for a responsible and reflexive approach that acknowledges the limitations of automation and emphasizes the need for human engagement, ethical considerations, and a broader understanding of meaning beyond statistical patterns.

The discussion of Ricoeur's concept of world and its relation to language and its automation intersects with several of the previous topics we've explored:
Linguistic Plasticity: Ricoeur's understanding of language as constituting the world aligns with the idea of linguistic plasticity, which refers to the adaptive and flexible nature of language. Both concepts recognize that language is not fixed or static, but rather dynamically shapes and is shaped by the world in which it is used. Language models in AI, such as BERT and GPT-3, attempt to capture and mimic this plasticity by learning from large amounts of textual data.
Forgetting and Adaptation: Ricoeur's concept of world and language opens up avenues for considering the principles of forgetting and adaptation in language models. As language models learn from vast amounts of data, they may also need mechanisms to selectively forget or adapt their knowledge to better align with evolving contexts and understandings. Incorporating such principles into the training and development of language models can enhance their ability to reflect the dynamic nature of language.
Platformization and Datafication: The platformization and datafication of everyday life, as discussed in relation to AI and natural language processing, have implications for Ricoeur's concept of world. The increasing dominance of tech giants and the extraction of data for optimization purposes shape the world of meaning by influencing what information is accessible and how it is interpreted. This challenges the idea of an open and pluralistic world of meaning that Ricoeur emphasizes, as the platform's algorithms and biases can shape and limit our understanding of language and its significance.
Power Dynamics and Ethics: Ricoeur's focus on interpretation and understanding within a social and cultural context intersects with the examination of power dynamics and ethics in AI and natural language processing. The control exerted by major companies over these technologies and the distribution of resources can affect the interpretation and signification of language. The ethical implications of biased algorithms, lack of transparency, and the potential for manipulation raise concerns about the impact of AI on individuals and society.
By examining the interconnections between Ricoeur's concept of world and the various topics discussed, we can gain a deeper understanding of how language, meaning, and interpretation are influenced by AI and natural language processing. This holistic perspective highlights the need for critical reflection and ethical considerations to ensure that these technologies serve human values and promote a more inclusive and responsible world of language.
