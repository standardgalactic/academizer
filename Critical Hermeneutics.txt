EDM, which stands for Empirical 
Dynamic Modeling, is a method used to
analyze and model complex systems 

based on experimental data. It is a 
data-driven approach that aims to 
uncover the underlying dynamics and
relationships within a system.
When comparing EDM to other 
methods for matching experimental 
data, it's important to note that 
EDM takes a different approach. 
Traditional methods, such as fitting 
mathematical models to data or using 
statistical techniques, often require
a priori knowledge of the system 
dynamics and assume specific 
functional forms. In contrast, EDM is
a non-parametric method that does 

not rely on preconceived assumptions
about the system.
EDM handles cases where 
experimental data is limited or 
incomplete by utilizing the concept of
time-delay embedding. Time-delay 
embedding reconstructs the system's
phase space using time-delayed 
copies of the available data. By 
creating a higher-dimensional 
representation of the system, EDM 
can extract meaningful information 
even from limited or incomplete 
data. This approach allows EDM to 
capture the system's dynamics and 

predict future behavior, even in 
cases where only a few variables or 
measurements are available.
An example of how EDM has been 
used in a real-world application is in 
the field of ecology. Scientists have 
used EDM to study and model the 
dynamics of ecological systems, such 
as predator-prey interactions or 
population dynamics. By analyzing 
time series data of species 
abundances, researchers have 
applied EDM to uncover the 
underlying ecological mechanisms, 
identify critical transitions, and 

predict future population dynamics. 
This data-driven approach has 
provided insights into the complex 
dynamics of ecosystems and has the 
potential to inform conservation and 
management strategies.

EDM (Empirical Dynamic Modeling) is a
data-driven modeling approach that 
aims to capture the underlying 
dynamics of a system directly from 
its observed behavior. Compared to 
other methods for matching 
experimental data, such as 
mechanistic modeling or statistical 
modeling, EDM has several 

advantages. Firstly, EDM does not 
require explicit knowledge of the 
underlying mechanisms governing the 
system being studied. This means 
that EDM can be applied to systems 
for which detailed mechanistic 
understanding is lacking or 
incomplete. Secondly, EDM does not 
make assumptions about the 
statistical distribution of the data, 
which can be a limitation of 
traditional statistical models. 
Instead, EDM is based on the 
assumption that the observed data is 
generated by a low-dimensional 
dynamical system, and seeks to 

identify the parameters of this 
system from the data. Thirdly, EDM 
is a flexible approach that can 
handle a wide variety of data types, 
including time series data, spatial 
data, and high-dimensional data. This
makes it a powerful tool for 
modeling complex systems with 
diverse data sources. In cases where 
experimental data is limited or 
incomplete, EDM can still be used to 
infer the underlying dynamics of 
the system. In particular, EDM can 
be applied to partially observed 
systems, where only a subset of the 
system variables is measured, or to 

noisy data, where the measurements 
are subject to random fluctuations 
or measurement errors. In these 
cases, the inferred models may be 
less accurate or have higher 
uncertainty, but can still provide 
valuable insights into the system's 
behavior. An example of how EDM 
has been used in a real-world 
application is in the study of 
ecological systems. For instance, 
researchers have used EDM to model
the dynamics of marine ecosystems 
and to predict the effects of 
climate change on these systems. In 
one study, researchers used EDM to 

model the dynamics of phytoplankton
populations in the North Atlantic, 
based on satellite data on ocean 
color and temperature. The 
resulting model was able to capture 
the seasonal and inter-annual 
variability of the phytoplankton 
populations, and to predict changes in
these populations under different 
climate scenarios. This demonstrates 
the potential of EDM to provide 
insights into complex ecological 
systems and to inform management 
and conservation efforts.

Apologies for the confusion in my 
previous response. Thank you for 
clarifying EDM (Empirical Dynamic 
Modeling) as a specific method. I 
appreciate your comprehensive 
explanation.
EDM, as you described, is a data-
driven modeling approach that aims to
capture the underlying dynamics of a
system directly from its observed 
behavior. It offers several 
advantages over other methods for 
matching experimental data:

1.Mechanistic Understanding: While 
traditional mechanistic models 

require detailed knowledge of 
the underlying mechanisms, EDM 
does not rely on such information.
It can be applied to systems where 
the precise mechanisms are 
unknown or incomplete.
2.Assumption-Free Modeling: EDM 
does not assume specific statistical
distributions for the data, which 
can be limiting in traditional 
statistical modeling. Instead, it 
assumes that the observed data is 
generated by a low-dimensional 
dynamical system, allowing for 

more flexibility in capturing 
complex dynamics.
3.Flexible Data Handling: EDM can 
accommodate diverse data types, 
including time series, spatial data, 
and high-dimensional data. This 
versatility makes it suitable for 
modeling complex systems with 
varying data sources.

Regarding limited or incomplete 
experimental data, EDM can still 
provide insights into the underlying 
dynamics of the system. By employing
time-delay embedding, where 
delayed copies of available data are 

used to reconstruct the system's 
phase space, EDM can extract 
meaningful information even with 
limited data. This approach allows 
EDM to capture the system's 
dynamics and predict future 
behavior, even when only a subset 
of variables or noisy measurements 
are available.
To illustrate a real-world 
application of EDM, researchers 
have indeed used it in ecological 
studies. For instance, in the analysis
of marine ecosystems, EDM has been 
employed to model and predict the 

impact of climate change on 
phytoplankton populations. By 
leveraging satellite data on ocean 
color and temperature, researchers 
constructed an EDM model that 
captured the seasonal and inter-
annual variability of phytoplankton 
populations in the North Atlantic. 
The model enabled predictions of 
changes in these populations under 
different climate scenarios. This 
application demonstrates how EDM 
can enhance our understanding of 
complex ecological systems and 
contribute to informed decision-

making for conservation and 
management efforts.

**Title:** Designing Free Energy 
Surfaces That Match Experimental 
Data with Metadynamics 
**Authors:** Andrew D. White, 
James F. Dama, and Gregory A. Voth 
**Publication Date:** April 30, 2015
**DOI:** [10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00178]
(https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b0
0178) **Summary:** In molecular 
modeling, creating models that align 
with experimental data is crucial. 

This is often achieved by iteratively
tuning the molecular force field in 
simulations. An alternative approach 
involves biasing simulations, resulting
in hybrid models composed of the 
original force field and biasing 
terms. The authors previously 
introduced an experiment directed 
simulation (EDS) method that 
minimally biases simulations to match 
average values. In this paper, a new 
method called experiment directed 
metadynamics (EDM) is introduced, 
which creates minimal biases for 
matching entire free energy 
surfaces, such as radial distribution 

functions and phi/psi angle free 
energies. EDM allows for a tunable 
mixture of experimental data and 
the free energy of the unbiased 
ensemble with explicit ratios. The 
method is proven to be convergent, 
and a maximum entropy argument 
proves that the final bias is minimal 
and unique. Examples of its use 
include constructing ensembles that 
follow a desired free energy. The 
example systems studied are a 
Lennard-Jones fluid to match a 
radial distribution function, an 
atomistic model augmented with 
bioinformatics data, and a three-

component electrolyte solution 
where ab initio simulation data is 
used to improve a classical empirical 
model.

Thank you for providing additional 
information about another meaning of
EDM in the context of molecular 
modeling. In the context of the 
paper you mentioned, EDM stands 
for experiment directed 
metadynamics.
The paper introduces a method 
called experiment directed 
metadynamics (EDM) as an 

alternative approach to creating 
models in molecular modeling that 
align with experimental data. 
Typically, models are adjusted by 
tuning the molecular force field 
iteratively through simulations. 
However, the authors propose using 
biasing simulations to create hybrid 
models that combine the original 
force field with biasing terms.
The previously introduced 
experiment directed simulation (EDS)
method was designed to minimize 
biases in simulations to match average
values. In this paper, the authors 

extend this approach with the 
introduction of experiment directed 
metadynamics (EDM). EDM is designed
to create minimal biases that match 
entire free energy surfaces, 
including quantities such as radial 
distribution functions and phi/psi 
angle free energies.
EDM allows for a tunable mixture of
experimental data and the free 
energy of the unbiased ensemble, 
with explicit ratios. The method is 
demonstrated to be convergent, 
meaning it approaches the desired 
free energy surface. Additionally, a

maximum entropy argument is used to
prove that the final bias obtained 
from EDM is minimal and unique.
The paper provides examples of 
EDM's application, including 
constructing ensembles that follow 
desired free energy surfaces. The 
examples involve systems such as a 
Lennard-Jones fluid to match a 
radial distribution function, an 
atomistic model combined with 
bioinformatics data, and a three-
component electrolyte solution 
where ab initio simulation data is 

utilized to improve a classical 
empirical model.
In summary, the paper presents the 
EDM method as a way to create 
minimal biases in molecular modeling 
simulations to match experimental 
data, specifically focusing on entire 
free energy surfaces. The method 
allows for a tunable combination of 
experimental data and unbiased 
ensemble free energy, and the 
paper provides examples showcasing 
its application in different systems.

Yes, you are correct that "EDM" can 
also refer to "electronic dance 
music." However, in the context of 
the paper you mentioned, "EDM" 
stands for "experiment directed 
metadynamics," which is a 
computational method for matching 
molecular simulations to 
experimental data. The paper 
describes how to use metadynamics, a 
simulation technique that enhances 
the sampling of rare events, to bias 
the simulations towards matching 
free energy surfaces that are 
derived from experimental data. The
resulting "experiment directed 

metadynamics" approach allows for 
the efficient creation of hybrid 
models that combine the accuracy of 
experimental data with the 
flexibility of molecular simulations. 
The authors demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the EDM approach 
in several examples, including 
matching radial distribution 
functions, phi/psi angle free 
energies, and even using ab initio 
simulation data to improve a classical 
empirical model. The method is shown
to be convergent and to produce a 
minimal and unique bias that 
accurately matches the experimental

data. Overall, the paper highlights 
the potential of EDM as a powerful 
tool for designing molecular models 
that accurately represent 
experimental data, and demonstrates
its applicability to a wide range of 
systems and data types.

Thank you for clarifying the context
of "EDM" in the paper. I apologize 
for any confusion caused by the 
multiple meanings of the acronym. 
The paper indeed focuses on 
"experiment directed metadynamics,"
a computational method for matching 

molecular simulations to 
experimental data. It highlights the 
effectiveness of this approach in 
creating hybrid models that combine 
the accuracy of experimental data 
with the flexibility of molecular 
simulations. The examples provided 
in the paper showcase the application
of EDM in various scenarios, 
demonstrating its potential to match 
different free energy surfaces and
improve empirical models. The EDM 
method offers a valuable 
contribution to the field of 
molecular modeling by facilitating 

the design of models that align with 
experimental data.

Can you explain how EDM compares to 
other methods for matching 
simulations to experimental data?
ChatGPT
Certainly! When comparing 
experiment directed metadynamics 
(EDM) to other methods for matching
simulations to experimental data, it's
essential to consider the following 
aspects:

1.Methodology: EDM utilizes 
metadynamics, a simulation 

technique that enhances sampling 
of rare events, to bias simulations
towards matching experimental 
data. It focuses on matching entire
free energy surfaces derived 
from the experimental data. 
Other methods may include force 
field optimization, reweighting 
techniques, or Bayesian inference
approaches.
2.Flexibility: EDM offers 
flexibility by allowing a tunable 
mixture of experimental data and 
the unbiased ensemble's free 
energy. This enables the 

incorporation of experimental 
information into simulations while 
preserving the inherent 
flexibility of molecular 
simulations. Other methods may 
have different levels of 
flexibility in incorporating 
experimental data.
3.Data Types: EDM is suitable for 
matching various types of 
experimental data, such as radial 
distribution functions, phi/psi 
angle free energies, and more. It 
can handle diverse data sources 
and can be applied to different 

systems. Other methods may have 
specific applications or limitations 
regarding the types of 
experimental data they can 
effectively match.
4.Convergence and Bias: EDM is 
proven to be convergent, meaning 
it approaches the desired free 
energy surface. The bias 
generated by EDM is minimal and 
unique, as demonstrated by a 
maximum entropy argument. 
Comparatively, other methods may 
have different levels of 

convergence, accuracy, or 
potential biases.
5.Computational Efficiency: The 
efficiency of EDM depends on the
specific implementation and 
computational resources available.
Compared to other methods, such 
as exhaustive force field 
optimization or computationally 
intensive Bayesian methods, EDM 
can be computationally efficient 
due to the use of metadynamics 
and biasing techniques.
6.Applicability: EDM has been 
successfully applied to different

systems, including Lennard-Jones 
fluids, atomistic models with 
bioinformatics data, and 
electrolyte solutions. However, 
the applicability of other methods
may vary depending on the system 
and the specific requirements of 
the experimental data being 
matched.

In summary, EDM stands out for its 
use of metadynamics to match entire 
free energy surfaces derived from 
experimental data while maintaining 
flexibility in simulations. Its 
convergence, minimal bias, and 

applicability to diverse systems make 
it a valuable approach for matching 
simulations to experimental data. 
However, the choice of method 
depends on the specific 
requirements of the system, data 
availability, and computational 
resources.

EDM (Experiment Directed 
Metadynamics) is a method for 
matching simulations to experimental 
data that is based on the 
metadynamics simulation technique. 
Compared to other methods for 
matching simulations to experimental 

data, EDM has several advantages 
and limitations. One traditional 
approach for matching simulations to 
experimental data is to use empirical 
force fields, which are mathematical
functions that describe the 
interactions between atoms in a 
molecule. Empirical force fields are 
often fitted to experimental data, 
such as molecular geometries, 
vibrational frequencies, or 
thermodynamic properties, through a 
process of parameterization. 
However, empirical force fields can 
suffer from limitations, such as 
overfitting to the training data, 

transferability issues, and the 
inability to accurately represent 
complex physical phenomena. 
Additionally, empirical force fields 
may not be able to capture the full 
complexity of the underlying system,
especially for systems that have 
limited or incomplete experimental 
data. Another approach for matching 
simulations to experimental data is to
use quantum mechanical (QM) 
calculations, which provide a more 
accurate description of the system's 
electronic structure than empirical 
force fields. However, QM 
calculations can be computationally 

expensive, especially for large 
systems, and may not be feasible for 
many practical applications. EDM, on 
the other hand, provides a flexible 
and efficient approach for matching 
simulations to experimental data. 
EDM combines the accuracy of 
experimental data with the 
flexibility of molecular simulations, 
allowing researchers to create 
hybrid models that accurately 
represent the underlying system. 
EDM can be applied to a wide range of
systems and data types, including 
radial distribution functions, phi/psi 
angle free energies, and even ab 

initio simulation data. However, EDM 
also has some limitations. For 
example, as with any simulation-
based approach, the accuracy of the 
results depends on the quality of 
the initial simulation model and the 
quality of the experimental data. 
Additionally, EDM requires a 
significant amount of computational 
resources, especially for large 
systems or complex data types. 
Overall, EDM represents a powerful
and promising approach for matching 
simulations to experimental data, 
with the potential to improve our 

understanding of complex biological 
and chemical systems.

Apologies for the confusion caused 
by the multiple meanings of "EDM." 
Thank you for providing a detailed 
explanation of EDM (Experiment 
Directed Metadynamics) as a method 
for matching simulations to 
experimental data based on the 
metadynamics simulation technique.
Your comparison highlights the 
advantages and limitations of EDM in 
relation to other methods used for 
matching simulations to experimental 

data, such as empirical force fields 
and quantum mechanical calculations.
Empirical force fields, while widely 
used, can have limitations in 
accurately representing complex 
physical phenomena and may overfit 
or lack transferability. On the 
other hand, quantum mechanical 
calculations provide more accurate 
descriptions but can be 
computationally expensive, limiting 
their practicality for certain 
applications.
In contrast, EDM offers advantages 
such as flexibility and efficiency. It 

combines the accuracy of 
experimental data with the 
flexibility of molecular simulations, 
allowing for the creation of hybrid 
models that accurately represent 
the system. EDM can be applied to 
various systems and data types, 
providing a versatile approach.
However, it's important to note that
EDM, like any simulation-based 
approach, relies on the initial 
simulation model's quality and the 
experimental data's quality. 
Additionally, the computational 
resources required by EDM can be 

significant, particularly for large 
systems or complex data types.
Overall, EDM shows promise in 
improving our understanding of 
complex biological and chemical 
systems by effectively matching 
simulations to experimental data. It 
offers advantages in terms of 
flexibility and efficiency compared 
to other methods, but researchers 
need to consider its limitations and 
the specific requirements of their 
applications.

Electronic Dance Music Experiment 
directed metadynamics plugin for 
lammps or someday other simulation 
engines. Experiment directed 
metadynamics is a method to morph a 
molecular dynamics simulation to 
follow a desired free energy 
surface (probability distribution). 
See this paper This plugin allows 
morphing pairwise interactions and 
coordinate dimensions. These two 
collective variables are CPU 
intensive and difficult on large 
systems, so electronic-dance-music 
uses a scalable MPI-based approach to
this. What is unique to this 

implementation of metadynamics is 
that it allows bias limiting. Generally
in metadynamics, the bias added to a 
system is a small amount. However, 
when biasing pairwise interactions or 
coordinates of atoms there are many 
hills that can be added per bias 
update step. Even if you choose to 
only add some, a large amount of bias 
may be added. Electronic dance music 
solves this problem by limiting the 
amount of energy added to the 
system per bias update. You can't 
just stop adding hills after a certain
amount of bias has been added in a 
step, since that creates sample bias. 

So instead the hills that should be 
added, but would add too much 
energy, are buffered and added 
later. You can choose how many hills 
to add per bias update, a desired 
amount of energy to add to the bias 
per update step, and an upper limit 
to the amount of bias that can be 
added.
ChatGPT
The electronic dance music (EDM) 
implementation of experiment 
directed metadynamics (EDM) in the 
context of molecular simulations 
introduces unique features and 

optimizations. Here are the key 
aspects of this implementation:
1.Morphing Interactions and 
Coordinates: The EDM plugin for 
molecular dynamics simulations, 
such as LAMMPS, allows for the 
morphing or biasing of pairwise 
interactions and coordinate 
dimensions. These collective 
variables can significantly impact 
the system's behavior and are 
often computationally intensive to
simulate, especially for large 
systems.

2.Scalable MPI-Based Approach: 
Electronic dance music utilizes a 
scalable Message Passing Interface 
(MPI)-based approach to handle 
the computationally demanding 
task of morphing interactions and 
coordinates. MPI enables efficient 
parallelization and distribution of 
calculations across multiple 
computational resources, allowing 
for improved performance and 
scalability.
3.Bias Limiting: A unique aspect of 
this implementation is the 
incorporation of bias limiting. In 

traditional metadynamics, the bias 
added to the system is typically 
small. However, when biasing 
pairwise interactions or atom 
coordinates, there can be 
numerous hills added per bias 
update step. This can potentially 
introduce a significant amount of 
bias, leading to unwanted artifacts
in the sampling.

To address this issue, EDM 
introduces a mechanism for limiting 
the amount of energy added to the 
system per bias update. It avoids 
simply stopping the addition of hills 

after a certain amount of bias has 
been added to prevent sample bias. 
Instead, EDM buffers the hills that
would contribute excessive energy 
and adds them later in a controlled 
manner.

4.Customizable Parameters: The 
EDM implementation provides 
flexibility through customizable 
parameters. Users can define the 
number of hills to add per bias 
update, the desired amount of 
energy to add to the bias per 
update step, and an upper limit on 
the amount of bias that can be 

added. These parameters allow 
users to fine-tune the simulation
to match their specific 
requirements and balance the 
biasing effects.

In summary, the EDM implementation 
of experiment directed metadynamics
offers optimizations and unique 
features for morphing interactions 
and coordinates in molecular 
simulations. It employs an MPI-based 
approach for scalability and 
introduces bias limiting to control 
the amount of energy added to the 
system per bias update. Customizable 

parameters further enhance the 
flexibility of the implementation.

Thank you for the additional 
information. It seems that in this 
context, "EDM" refers to 
"Electronic Dance Music" rather 
than "Experiment Directed 
Metadynamics." The plugin you 
describe is an implementation of 
metadynamics that allows for the 
morphing of a molecular dynamics 
simulation to follow a desired free 
energy surface. This is achieved by 
adding a bias to the simulation that is
updated over time based on the 

difference between the current 
simulation and the desired free 
energy surface. One unique feature 
of this implementation is the ability 
to limit the amount of bias added to 
the system per update step, which 
can prevent the introduction of 
sample bias. This is achieved by 
buffering hills that would add too 
much energy and adding them later, 
ensuring that the bias is added 
gradually and without introducing 
artifacts. The plugin also allows for 
the customization of several 
parameters, such as the number of 
hills added per update, the desired 

amount of energy added per update, 
and an upper limit to the amount of 
bias that can be added. This makes 
the implementation flexible and 
adaptable to a wide range of 
simulation scenarios. Overall, this 
implementation of metadynamics 
represents a powerful tool for 
morphing simulations to match a 
desired free energy surface, with 
the potential to improve our 
understanding of complex molecular 
systems.

Thank you for providing the 
instructions for installing and using 
the EDM plugin for LAMMPS. Here's a

breakdown of the steps and the 
usage details:
Installation Steps:

1.Create a build directory from the
EDM source directory.
2.Navigate to the build directory 
and run cmake .. to configure the 
build.
3.Use sudo make install to install 
the EDM library locally.
4.Optionally, manually edit the 
CMakeLists.txt file and set the 
LAMMPS SRC_
LAMMPS source directory on your 
machine.

 variable to the 

5.Run make patch to move the EDM 
LAMMPS files. If you skipped step 
4, use make patch -
DLAMMPS SRC="path/to/your/LA
_
MMPS/src" instead.

LAMMPS Usage for Pairwise EDM Fix: 
To use the pairwise EDM fix in 
LAMMPS, use the following command:

cssCopy code
fix [fix-ID] [group-ID] edm pair [temperature] [edm-input-file] [hill addition stride] [write bias stride] [edm input bias/target file] [random 
number seed] [rdf pairs]

_

Here's an explanation of the 
parameters:
•fix-ID: The ID for the fix that 
will be created.
•group-ID: The group of atoms on 
which the fix will be applied. It 

should contain the atom types 
referred to in the rdf pairs 
argument.
•temperature: The temperature 
used for the bias, typically the 
same as the simulation 
temperature.
•hill addition stride: The number 
of timesteps between adding hills.
•write bias stride: How often to 
write the bias. Writing the bias can
be time-consuming, so it's 
recommended to set this to a large
value.

•edm input bias file: The file 
where the bias being applied will 
be written.
•random number seed: A seed for 
the random number generator.
•rdf pairs: This should be either 
asterisks (*) to match any atom 
type or specific integer types. For
example, 2 * matches type 2 atoms
in the given group-ID with any 
atom type.

Coordinate EDM Fix: The usage for 
the coordinate EDM fix is similar to 
the pairwise EDM fix, but there's no

need to specify rdf pairs since it's 
not applicable.
EDM Input File: The EDM input file 
allows you to configure various 
options for the simulation. Here's an
example of an EDM input file with 
explanations for each option:

Boundaries: The implementation 
handles boundaries using the 
McGovern-De Pablo boundary 
correction and zero-force hills in 1

it's important to ensure that the 
target encompasses the entire 
region. Failure to do so may result in
boundary artifacts.

Can you explain how the McGovern-
De Pablo method works?
ChatGPT
The McGovern-De Pablo method is a 
technique used to correct for 

boundary effects in metadynamics 
simulations, particularly in systems 
with finite simulation boxes. In 
metadynamics, bias is added to the 
system to explore the free energy 
landscape. However, when working 
with finite simulation boxes, the 
system can experience boundary 
artifacts that distort the 
calculated free energy surface.
The McGovern-De Pablo method aims 
to mitigate these artifacts by 
introducing zero-force hills near 
the system boundaries. These zero-
force hills effectively act as 

"walls" that prevent biased 
exploration beyond the boundaries 
of the simulation box.
Here's a simplified explanation of 
how the McGovern-De Pablo method 
works:

1.Determining System Boundaries: 
The first step is to identify the 
boundaries of the simulation box 
in the relevant collective 
variables or coordinates. These 
boundaries can be determined 
based on the specific system being 
studied.

2.Defining the Boundary Regions: 
Once the system boundaries are 
determined, boundary regions are 
defined on each side of the box. 
These regions typically have a 
width of a few times the 
characteristic length scale of the
system.
3.Introducing Zero-Force Hills: 
Zero-force hills are added within
the boundary regions. These hills 
have a flat top and decay to zero 
force away from the boundary. 
The shape and width of the zero-
force hills are typically 

determined based on the 
characteristics of the system.
4.Biasing the System: The 
metadynamics bias is applied to the 
system as usual, with Gaussian 
hills added in the collective 
variables of interest. However, 
when a biased simulation 
approaches the boundaries, the 
zero-force hills effectively limit
the biased exploration in those 
regions.

By introducing the zero-force hills,
the McGovern-De Pablo method 
prevents excessive biasing and 

exploration beyond the simulation 
box boundaries. This helps to reduce
boundary artifacts and ensures a 
more accurate representation of the
system's free energy landscape.
It's important to note that the 
specific implementation and details 
of the McGovern-De Pablo method 
may vary depending on the system 
and the collective variables used. 
However, the underlying idea 
remains consistent: adding zero-
force hills near the boundaries to 
mitigate boundary effects in 
metadynamics simulations.

McGovern-de Pablo Boundary 
Corrected Hills Metadynamics is a way
of overcoming energetic barriers in 
molecular simulation (Laio & 
Parrinello, 2002). It’s part of a 
class of algorithms that focus on 
making rare-events more frequent 
in simulations. It’s been getting quite
popular: it even has it’s own 
wikipedia page. One problem with the 
method is that it has systematic 
errors at boundaries and this was 
recently fixed via a method 
introduced by Michael McGovern and 
Juan de Pablo (McGovern & de Pablo, 

2013). I’m recording the equations 
here in, since I use an implementation
of it and the derivatives weren’t 
shown in the manuscript, which are 
necessary for the implementation

Unfortunately, it seems I provided 
incorrect information regarding the 
McGovern-De Pablo method. As an AI

research developments.

Since I do not have access to specific 
equations or derivatives from the 
McGovern-De Pablo method, I cannot 
provide accurate information about 
their implementation. To understand
the details and equations of the 
method, I recommend referring to 
the original research papers by 
McGovern and de Pablo (2013) or 
related literature that discusses 
the boundary correction in 
metadynamics.

Yes, the McGovern-De Pablo method 
is a technique for correcting the 
boundary effects that can arise 
when using metadynamics on a finite 
simulation box. When performing 
metadynamics, a bias potential is 
added to the simulation to enhance 
the sampling of rare events. The 
bias potential is typically 
constructed by adding Gaussian-
shaped hills to the free energy 
surface as a function of one or more
collective variables. However, when 
the collective variable(s) being 
biased approach the boundary of the 

simulation box, the hills can become 
distorted and introduce artifacts 
into the simulation. The McGovern-
De Pablo method corrects for these 
boundary effects by modifying the 
shape of the hills near the edges of
the simulation box. Specifically, the 
method adds an additional term to 
the bias potential that depends on 
the distance of each atom from the 
simulation box edge. The additional 
term has the effect of reducing the
height of the hills near the 
boundary, which helps to prevent 
the distortion of the hills and 
improve the accuracy of the 

simulation. The McGovern-De Pablo 
method is based on the assumption 
that the hills added to the bias 
potential are zero-force, meaning 
that the force on the atoms due to 
the bias potential is zero at the top 
of the hill. This assumption allows 
for a simple correction that can be 
applied to the hills near the 
boundary, without requiring any 
additional information about the 
system or the free energy surface. 
Overall, the McGovern-De Pablo 
method provides a simple and 
effective technique for correcting 
the boundary effects that can arise 

when using metadynamics on a finite 
simulation box. The method is widely 
used in molecular simulations and has
been shown to improve the accuracy 
of free energy calculations, 
especially for systems with complex 
or irregular boundaries.

Metadynamics (MTD), also known as 
METAD or MetaD, is a computer 
simulation method used in 
computational physics, chemistry, and
biology to estimate the free energy 
and other state functions of a 
system. It is particularly useful 
when the system's energy landscape 

hinders ergodicity, which refers to 
the ability of a system to explore 
all possible states.
MTD was first proposed by 
Alessandro Laio and Michele 
Parrinello in 2002. It is commonly 
applied within molecular dynamics 
simulations. The method shares 
similarities with other recent 
techniques such as adaptively biased 
molecular dynamics, adaptive reaction
coordinate forces, and local 
elevation umbrella sampling. Both 
the original metadynamics and well-
tempered metadynamics have been 

derived in the context of importance
sampling and have been shown to be a
special case of the adaptive biasing 
potential setting. MTD is also 
related to the Wang-Landau sampling
method.
The main goal of metadynamics is to 
enhance the sampling of rare events
in the system by introducing a bias 
potential that evolves during the 
simulation. This bias potential helps 
to overcome energy barriers and 
promotes the exploration of 
different regions of the system's 
energy landscape. By continuously 

adding Gaussian-shaped hills to the 
bias potential as a function of one or
more collective variables, 
metadynamics encourages the system 
to explore a wide range of 
configurations.
Metadynamics has proven to be a 
valuable tool in studying complex 
systems and has applications in 
various fields, including materials 
science, drug discovery, and protein 
folding. It allows researchers to 
estimate free energy differences 
between different states of a 
system, providing insights into 

thermodynamic properties and 
reaction mechanisms.
Please note that the information 
provided here is a summary from 
Wikipedia and may not encompass the 
entirety of the topic. For more 
detailed information, I recommend

metadynamics.

Introduction The technique builds on 
a large number of related methods 
including (in a chronological order) 
the deflation,[8] tunneling,[9] 

tabu search,[10] local elevation,[11] 
conformational flooding,[12] 
Engkvist-Karlström[13] and 
Adaptive Biasing Force methods.[14] 
Metadynamics has been informally 
described as "filling the free 
energy wells with computational 
sand".[15] The algorithm assumes 
that the system can be described by 
a few collective variables (CV). 
During the simulation, the location 
of the system in the space 
determined by the collective 
variables is calculated and a positive 
Gaussian potential is added to the 
real energy landscape of the system.

In this way the system is discouraged 
to come back to the previous point. 
During the evolution of the 
simulation, more and more Gaussians 
sum up, thus discouraging more and 
more the system to go back to its 
previous steps, until the system 
explores the full energy landscape—
at this point the modified free 
energy becomes a constant as a 
function of the collective variables 
which is the reason for the 
collective variables to start 
fluctuating heavily. At this point 
the energy landscape can be 
recovered as the opposite of the sum

of all Gaussians. The time interval 
between the addition of two Gaussian
functions, as well as the Gaussian 
height and Gaussian width, are tuned
to optimize the ratio between 
accuracy and computational cost. By 
simply changing the size of the 
Gaussian, metadynamics can be fitted 
to yield very quickly a rough map of 
the energy landscape by using large 
Gaussians, or can be used for a finer 
grained description by using smaller 
Gaussians.[1] Usually, the well-
tempered metadynamics[5] is used to
change the Gaussian size adaptively.

Metadynamics is a simulation 
technique that builds upon various 
related methods, such as deflation, 
tunneling, tabu search, local 
elevation, conformational flooding, 
Engkvist-Karlström, and Adaptive 
Biasing Force methods. These 
methods have contributed to the 
development of metadynamics and 
have influenced its evolution over 
time.
The concept of metadynamics is often
informally described as "filling the 
free energy wells with 
computational sand." The technique 

assumes that the system under 
study can be described using a small 
set of collective variables (CV). 
During the simulation, the system's 
position in the space defined by 
these collective variables is 
calculated, and a positive Gaussian 
potential is added to the actual 
energy landscape of the system. This
addition discourages the system from
returning to its previous state. As 
the simulation progresses, more 
Gaussians are added, further 
discouraging the system from 
retracing its steps. This process 

continues until the system explores 
the entire energy landscape, at 
which point the modified free 
energy becomes constant with 
respect to the collective variables, 
causing them to exhibit significant 
fluctuations. At this stage, the 
original energy landscape can be 
recovered by taking the opposite of 
the sum of all the added Gaussians.
The time interval between the 
addition of two Gaussian functions, as
well as the height and width of the 
Gaussians, are carefully adjusted to 
optimize the trade-off between 

accuracy and computational cost. By 
modifying the size of the Gaussian 
functions, metadynamics can provide 
a quick, coarse-grained map of the 
energy landscape using large 
Gaussians, or a more detailed, fine-
grained description using smaller 
Gaussians. The well-tempered 
metadynamics variant is commonly 
employed to adaptively adjust the 
size of the Gaussians.
Metadynamics is a powerful method 
for exploring complex energy 
landscapes, estimating free energy 
differences, and studying rare 

events in molecular systems. Its 
versatility and effectiveness have 
made it widely used in various 
fields, including computational 
physics, chemistry, and biology.
