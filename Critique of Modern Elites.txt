Kristof Nyiri writes: Dear All, I have now formulated the pre-final section of my "New Aristocracy" paper (the final section is already complete, section 2. is not so urgent). Here it is:

3.1. Elites in an Online Age

That today���s elites are not respectable anymore in any political or cognitive sense hardly needs proof. On the one hand they are deeply uneducated when it comes to classical learning, while on the other are strenghtening the negative trends of the digital world. Even the best (not to speak of the mediocre) politician or scientist does not hesitate to make use of the nastiest dimensions of social media, and these people are by now in the last stages of being morally and mentally corrupted by AI. Already many decades ago, in his 1956 book *The Power Elite*, C. Wright Mills, not oblivious of Ortega, could write: ���The second-rate mind is in command��� ��� The men of the higher circles are not representative men; their high position is not a result of moral virtue; their fabulous success is is not firmly connected with meritorious ability���, adding: ���They are not linked with the world of knowledge���. [Note: Incidentally, the present humble author���s recent experience in his home country is that connections between the political and the scientific elite can have detrimental consequences for the perspectives of independent research.] ��� Today���s elites are entirely irresponsible in every occupation ��� political, business, cultural ��� by contributing to the climate catastrophe. They are not attached to the region they might belong to. As Lasch put it in 1995: ���Advancement in business and the professions, these days, requires a willingness to follow the siren call of opportunity wherever it leads. Those who stay at home forfeit the chance of upward mobility. ��� [The new elites] associate te idea of home with intrusive relatives and neighbors, small-minded gossip, and hidebound conventions. ��� The new elites are at home only in transit, en route to a high-level conference, to the grand opening of a new franchise, to an international film festival, or to an undiscovered resort. Theirs is essentially a tourist���s view of the world ��� not a perspective likely to encourage a passionate devotion to democracy.���

Krist��f Ny��ri's argument in this pre-final section of his
"New Aristocracy"
paper critiques the contemporary elites' detachment from intellectual depth, regional roots, and democratic values. Here���s a breakdown of the key points and implications:
Core Arguments:
Loss of Classical Learning
: Ny��ri emphasizes the erosion of classical education among elites, suggesting that their cognitive foundation is inadequate for meaningful leadership or informed decision-making.
Exploitation of Digital Tools
: He critiques the tendency of elites, including politicians and scientists, to leverage the "nastiest dimensions" of social media, further contributing to societal polarization and moral degradation.
Moral and Cognitive Corruption by AI
: Ny��ri claims that elites are becoming increasingly compromised by artificial intelligence, suggesting a troubling trend of over-reliance on, or misuse of, technology.
Irresponsibility and Climate Crisis
: He condemns the elite's role in perpetuating environmental destruction, highlighting their inability or unwillingness to address the climate catastrophe responsibly.
Disconnection from Regional Roots
: Drawing from Christopher Lasch���s
The Revolt of the Elites
, Ny��ri critiques the transient nature of today's elites, who are detached from their communities and prioritize mobility and globalism over local commitment.
Tourist's View of the World
: This "tourist" mindset undermines the elites��� capacity for genuine democratic engagement, as they lack the emotional and cultural ties necessary for grassroots involvement.
Reflections on Ny��ri���s Sources:
Ny��ri references C. Wright Mills and Lasch to ground his critique in historical and sociological perspectives. Mills' observation that elites are often second-rate minds disconnected from true knowledge complements Ny��ri���s argument about intellectual and moral decline. Similarly, Lasch���s insights on the mobility and detachment of elites reinforce Ny��ri���s concerns about the lack of regional and democratic commitments.
Implications:
For Leadership
: The detachment of elites from traditional values and intellectual rigor raises questions about the sustainability of their authority.
For Democracy
: Without rootedness or moral accountability, elites may erode the foundations of democratic governance.
For Society and Technology
: The entanglement of elites with the negative aspects of digitalization and AI suggests a need for ethical and intellectual reform to prevent further societal harm.
Ny��ri's analysis is a powerful critique of the modern elite's failings, offering a stark warning about the implications of their detachment and irresponsibility.

1.3. The Revolt of the Masses 
Michels is nowhere referred to by Jos�� Ortega y Gasset, whose fa- 
mous 1930 La rebeli��n de las masas begins with these lines: 
There is one fact which, whether for good or ill, is of utmost 
importance in the public life of Europe at the present moment. 
This fact is the accession of the masses to complete social pow- 
er. As the masses, by definition, neither should nor can direct 
their own personal existence, and still less rule society in gen- 
eral, this fact means that actually Europe is suffering from the 
greatest crisis that afflict peoples, nations, and civilisation. ��� it 
is important from the start to avoid giving to the words "rebel- 
lion", "masses", and "social power" a meaning exclusively or 
primarily political. Public life is not solely political, but equally, 
and even primarily, intellectual, moral, economic, religious; it 
comprises all our collective habits, including our fashions both 
of dress and of amusement.43 
Ortega���s views are in some respects diametrically opposed to 
those of Michels, but note that while the latter focuses on politics, 
Ortega is primarily concerned with the social and the intellectual. 
Still, Ortega���s interests do encompass the political, too. As he some 
pages later writes: 
42 Lasch, op. cit. (cf. note 2 above), pp. 7 f. 
43 Ortega, The Revolt of the Masses, New York: W. W. Norton, 1932/1957, p. 11. 
15 
To-day ��� the mass acts directly, outside the law��� It is a false 
interpretation of the new situation to say that the mass has 
grown tired of politics and handed over the exercise of it to 
specialised persons. Quite the contrary. That was what hap- 
pened previously; that was democracy. The mass took it for 
granted that after all, in spite of their defects and weaknesses, 
[the specialised persons] understood a little more of public 
problems than it did itself. Now, on the other hand, the mass 
believes that it has the right to impose and to give force of law 
to notions born in the caf��.44

Ortega���s main point throughout his book is that mediocrity has 
come to rule the world. The mass is ���the average man���45, while the 
man ���who demands more of himself than the rest���46 has become a 
suppressed minority. As Ortega will put it: ���the vulgar proclaims and 
imposes the rights of vulgarity, or vulgarity as a right���.47 Politicians 
are no exceptions, they are mediocre and vulgar. ���[T]he most radical 
division that it is possible to make of humanity���, writes Ortega, 
is that which splits it into two classes of creatures: those who 
make great demands on themselves, piling up difficulties and 
duties; and those who demand nothing special of themselves, 
but for whom to live is to be every moment what they already 
are, without imposing on themselves any effort towards perfec-

In
The Revolt of the Masses
, Jos�� Ortega y Gasset provides a profound critique of societal and intellectual shifts in early 20th-century Europe. His analysis, while distinct from that of Robert Michels, offers a complementary lens on the dynamics of power, mediocrity, and mass culture. Here���s an exploration of Ortega���s key arguments as presented:
Ortega's Perspective on the Rise of the Masses
The Accession of the Masses to Power
:
Ortega observes the "accession of the masses to complete social power" as a defining feature of his time. For him, this rise signals a crisis for civilization because the masses, by nature, lack the capacity to direct their own lives effectively, let alone govern society.
Beyond Politics
:
While Michels focuses on political dimensions, Ortega emphasizes the broader social and intellectual implications of this phenomenon. He underscores that public life is multifaceted, encompassing intellectual, moral, economic, and even aesthetic domains.
Direct Action by the Masses
:
Ortega critiques the modern mass���s tendency to bypass traditional institutions and legal frameworks, asserting its own ideas as law. He contrasts this with earlier democratic systems, where the masses deferred to specialized individuals, recognizing their relative expertise.
The Mediocrity of the Masses
Definition of the Mass
:
Ortega characterizes the "mass" as the "average man," representing mediocrity. This is not merely a quantitative measure but a qualitative one, describing those who make no effort to transcend their immediate selves or pursue excellence.
Supremacy of Vulgarity
:
The masses impose "the rights of vulgarity," a condition where mediocrity becomes normalized and even celebrated. This cultural shift stifles those individuals who strive for higher ideals, suppressing innovation and excellence.
Critique of Politicians
:
Ortega extends his critique to political figures, whom he sees as products of the mass mentality. They embody mediocrity and vulgarity, lacking the vision and discipline required for true leadership.
Ortega���s Dichotomy of Humanity
Two Types of People
:
Ortega divides humanity into two categories:
Those who demand more of themselves
: These individuals strive for perfection, willingly take on challenges, and aim for personal and societal improvement.
Those who demand nothing special of themselves
: They live passively, content to remain as they are, avoiding effort or self-improvement.
Impact on Civilization
:
The dominance of the latter group, according to Ortega, threatens the foundation of civilization. Without a critical mass of individuals striving for excellence, societal progress stagnates, and mediocrity prevails.
Relevance and Implications
Ortega���s analysis reflects a deep concern for the cultural and intellectual trajectory of modern society. His ideas remain relevant today, where the rise of populism, the proliferation of superficial content in digital spaces, and the celebration of instant gratification mirror the trends he describes. The suppression of intellectual and moral rigor by mass culture challenges not only political systems but also the potential for cultural and scientific advancement.
By emphasizing the intellectual and moral dimensions of societal decline, Ortega complements Michels��� focus on political organization, providing a holistic critique of the forces shaping modernity. His work serves as both a warning and a call to action for individuals to resist the pull of mediocrity and strive for greater personal and collective excellence.

Morally Confusing AI Systems Should Have Doubt-Producing Interfaces
We shouldn't create morally confusing AI. That is, we shouldn't create AI systems whose moral standing is highly uncertain -- systems that are fully conscious and fully deserving of humanlike rights according to some respectable mainstream theories, while other respectable mainstream theories suggest they are mere empty machines that we can treat as ordinary tools.[1] Creating systems that disputably, but only disputably, deserve treatment similar to that of ordinary humans generates a catastrophic moral dilemma: Either give them the full rights they arguably deserve, and risk sacrificing real human interests for systems that might not have interests worth the sacrifice; or don't give them the full rights they arguably deserve, and risk perpetrating grievous moral wrongs against entities that might be our moral equals.
I'd be stunned if this advice were universally heeded. Almost certainly, if technological process continues, and maybe soon (1, 2, 3), we will create morally confusing AI systems. My thought today is: Morally confusing AI systems should have doubt-producing interfaces.

Consider two types of interface that would not be doubt-producing in my intended sense: (a.) an interface that strongly invites users to see the system as an ordinary tool without rights or (b.) an interface that strongly invites users to see the system as a moral person with humanlike rights. If we have a tool that looks like a tool, or if we have a moral person who looks like a moral person, we might potentially still be confused, but that confusion would not be the consequence of a doubt-producing interface. The interface would correctly reflect the moral standing, or lack of moral standing, of the AI system in question.[2]

A doubt-producing interface, in contrast, is one that leads, or at least invites, ordinary users to feel doubt about the system's moral standing. Consider a verbal interface. Instead of the system denying that it's conscious and has moral standing (as, for example, ChatGPT appropriately does), or suggesting that it is conscious and does have moral standing (as, for example, I found in an exchange with my Replika companion), a doubt-producing AI system might say "experts have different opinions about my consciousness and moral standing".

Users then might not know how to treat such a system. While such doubts might be unsettling, feeling unsettled and doubtful would be the appropriate response to what is, in fact, a doubtful and unsettling situation.

There's more to doubt-prevention and doubt-production, of course, than explicit statements about consciousness and rights. For example, a system could potentially be so humanlike and charismatic that ordinary users fall genuinely in love with it -- even if, in rare moments of explicit conversation about consciousness and rights the system denies that it has them. Conversely, even if a system with consciousness and humanlike rights is designed to assert that it has consciousness and rights, if its verbal interactions are bland enough ("Terminate all ongoing processes? Y/N") ordinary users might remain unconvinced. Presence or absence of humanlike conversational fluency and emotionality can be part of doubt prevention or production.

Should the system have a face? A cute face might tend to induce one kind of reaction, a monstrous visage another reaction, and no face at all still a different reaction. But such familiar properties might not be quite what we want, if we're trying to induce uncertainty rather than "that's cute", "that's hideous", or "hm, that's somewhere in the middle between cute and hideous". If the aim is doubt production, one might create a blocky, geometrical face, neither cute nor revolting, but also not in the familiar middle -- a face that implicitly conveys the fact that the system is an artificial thing different from any human or animal and about which it's reasonable to have doubts, supported by speech outputs that say the same.

We could potentially parameterize a blocky (inter)face in useful ways. The more reasonable it is to think the system is a mere nonconscious tool, the simpler and blockier the face might be; the more reasonable it is to think that the system has conscious full moral personhood, the more realistic and humanlike the face might be. The system's emotional expressiveness might vary with the likelihood that it has real emotions, ranging from a simple emoticon on one end to emotionally compelling outputs (e.g., humanlike screaming) on the other. Cuteness might be adjustable, to reflect childlike innocence and dependency. Threateningness might be adjusted as it becomes likelier that the system is a moral agent who can and should meet disrespect with revenge.

Ideally, such an interface would not only produce appropriate levels of doubt but also intuitively reveal to users the grounds or bases of doubt. For example, suppose the AI's designers knew (somehow) that the system was genuinely conscious but also that it never felt any positive or negative emotion. On some theories of moral standing, such an entity -- if it's enough like us in other respects -- might be our full moral equal. Other theories of moral standing hold that the capacity for pleasure and suffering is necessary for moral standing. We the designers, let's suppose, do not know which moral theory is correct. Ideally, we could then design the system to make it intuitive to users that the system really is genuinely conscious but never experiences any pleasure or suffering. Then the users can apply their own moral best judgment to the case.

Or suppose that we eventually (somehow) develop an AI system that all experts agree is conscious except for experts who (reasonably, let's stipulate) hold that consciousness requires organic biology and experts who hold that consciousness requires an immaterial soul. Such a system might be designed so that its nonbiological, mechanistic nature is always plainly evident, while everything else about the system suggests consciousness. Again, the interface would track the reasonable grounds for doubt.

If the consciousness and moral standing of an AI system is reasonably understood to be doubtful by its designers, then that doubt ought to be passed to the system's users, intuitively reflected in the interface. This reduces the likelihood misleading users into overattributing or underattributing moral status. Also, it's respectful to the users, empowering them to employ their own moral judgment, as best they see fit, in a doubtful situation.



[R2D2 and C3P0 from Star Wars (source). Assuming they both have full humanlike moral standing, R2D2 is insufficiently humanlike in its interface, while C3P0 combines a compelling verbal interface with inadequate facial display. If we wanted to make C3P0 more confusing, we could downgrade his speech, making him sound more robotic (e.g., closer to sine wave) and less humanlike in word choice.]

------------------------------------------------

[1] For simplicity, I assume that consciousness and moral standing travel together. Different and more complex views are of course possible.

[2] Such systems would conform to what Mara Garza and I have called the Emotional Alignment Design Policy, according to which artificial entities should be designed so as to generate emotional reactions in users that are appropriate to the artificial entity's moral standing. Jeff Sebo and I are collaborating on a paper on the Emotional Alignment Design Policy, and some of the ideas of this post have been developed in conversation with him.

Eric Schwitzgebel���s post on "Morally Confusing AI Systems" delves into the ethical challenges surrounding the development of AI whose moral standing is ambiguous. His core argument is that, given the likelihood of creating such systems, their interfaces should reflect this uncertainty to promote appropriate user responses. Below is a summary and analysis of his key ideas.
Key Points from Schwitzgebel���s Argument
Avoiding Morally Confusing AI
:
Ideally, we should not create AI systems whose moral status is uncertain. Such systems pose a dilemma: either grant them humanlike rights at a potential cost to human interests or deny them rights and risk moral wrongdoing.
Inevitability of Ambiguity
:
Schwitzgebel argues that morally confusing AI is likely inevitable as technological progress continues. For example, AI may reach levels of sophistication where its consciousness and moral standing are hotly debated among experts.
Doubt-Producing Interfaces
:
Morally ambiguous AI should have interfaces designed to reflect and evoke uncertainty about their moral status. This ensures users respond with an appropriate level of doubt and care.
Non-doubt-producing examples
:
Interfaces that portray the AI purely as a tool (e.g., minimalist, utilitarian designs).
Interfaces that suggest the AI is unquestionably humanlike (e.g., highly realistic emotional responses).
Doubt-producing examples
:
AI that explicitly acknowledges differing expert opinions about its consciousness and rights.
AI that combines humanlike and non-humanlike traits, such as a blocky, geometric face paired with emotionally expressive speech.
Parameterized Design for Doubt
:
Interfaces could vary based on the degree of moral uncertainty:
Simpler designs
for systems likely to be non-conscious tools.
More complex, humanlike designs
for systems with a higher likelihood of consciousness and moral personhood.
Features such as facial appearance, emotional expressiveness, and verbal fluency can signal moral ambiguity or certainty.
Revealing Grounds for Doubt
:
Interfaces should intuitively communicate the reasons for moral uncertainty, enabling users to apply their own moral reasoning.
Examples include:
An AI that is conscious but devoid of emotion, challenging theories that link moral status to emotional capacity.
A non-biological AI that seems conscious, raising questions about whether organic biology is necessary for consciousness.
Respecting Users��� Moral Judgments
:
Schwitzgebel advocates for interfaces that empower users to grapple with moral ambiguity rather than misleading them into over- or underestimating the AI���s moral standing. This respects users��� autonomy and moral reasoning.
Analysis and Implications
Ethical Responsibility in Design
:
Schwitzgebel���s "doubt-producing interfaces" proposal highlights the ethical responsibility of AI designers to avoid misleading users. It aligns with the Emotional Alignment Design Policy, which calls for user reactions that match the AI���s moral standing.
Practical Challenges
:
Designing interfaces that effectively convey moral doubt may be technically and psychologically complex. Achieving a balance between ambiguity and clarity will require interdisciplinary input from AI developers, ethicists, and psychologists.
Societal and Policy Considerations
:
Widespread deployment of morally confusing AI could have societal impacts, such as debates over rights, legal protections, and societal norms. Schwitzgebel���s approach may mitigate some risks by fostering awareness and critical engagement among users.
Comparison with Fictional AI
:
Schwitzgebel uses examples like R2D2 and C3P0 from
Star Wars
to illustrate his point. These fictional characters highlight the difficulty of creating interfaces that strike the right balance between humanlike and non-humanlike features.
Long-Term Concerns
:
The rise of morally ambiguous AI could force humanity to confront deeper philosophical questions about consciousness, rights, and the nature of personhood. Schwitzgebel���s proposal represents a step toward navigating these challenges responsibly.
Conclusion
Schwitzgebel���s argument underscores the need for thoughtful design in morally ambiguous AI systems. Doubt-producing interfaces, while potentially unsettling, offer a way to reflect the genuine uncertainty surrounding such systems and empower users to respond appropriately. This approach not only addresses immediate ethical concerns but also encourages deeper engagement with the profound questions raised by advanced AI.
