PREFACE AND GENERAL INTRODUCTION


I remember with nostalgia, how I used to wonder as a child, why Mr. Gabriel Michael (our church electrician) would press buttons on the walls of our church building and the `bottles' hanging on the ceiling would glow with light. What made this possible, I, honestly never knew; but I would worry my parents with barrages of child-like questions; why the `bottles' glowed after a touch on the buttons fixed on the walls; whether the light hid under the buttons, or were in the wires. Answers given were hardly satisfactory, especially as they came from a historian on the one hand and a physical educationist on the other hand. Again, while playing football on the sandy roadside in the village (where not up to five cars would pass in a week), we would halt our sweet game of football to wonder in rapt admiration and utter amazement, how a small Volkswagen car would speed past and overtake the almighty truck. We would reason aloud that, `if this small car could run faster than the bigger vehicle now that it is still young, then no other vehicle would ever catch up with its speed by the time it would grow to the size of the truck'. Certainly, at this stage, I lacked true knowledge of growth and decay and of metamorphosis. I lacked knowledge of thermodynamics, electrodynamics, or mechanics. And even now, I lack complete knowledge of them. Newton, Maxwell, Einstein and Hawking might know all of those stuffs.


We are not physicists or scientists, but philosophers; and we investigate the validity of the claims made by the investigators of nature. We are investigators of the investigators of nature. We are investigators of thought. It is noticeable that, while study of law aids understanding of the groundwork for social existence, scientific philosophy, at least, in part, aids one's focus on the principles of nature. How nature works is partly described in science. There may be aspects of life not described in science; and part of the scientific description of reality may not be correct after all. Scientific realism, a doctrine that boasts that what science describes about reality is all that exists, is hereby rejected. Physicalism, a scientific doctrine which boasts that all of reality is physical, is also rejected theretofore. While we reject and jettison scientific realism and physicalism, we also note, however, that science has offered us a clue, a window into the dark side of nature. Science is a pathfinder into the secrets of nature. But science is not absolute.


My childhood experience: the pressing of buttons on the wall and the consequent lighting of `bottles' (bulbs) are explained in science. That I would dial a set of given numbers and I would speak to, say, Professor David Papineau or Professor Steven French (both of whom I have never met), or to my darling parents in Nigeria, is credited to science. Science, with its concomitant technology, has enveloped the world and advanced the welfare of mankind. For instance, as you read this line now, there is, at least, something about you that is a product of science: your cell phone, or your laptop computer, or your wristwatch, or your fax machine, or your television, or your radio set, or your dress, or your eyeglasses, or your microwave cooker, or your car. And their usefulness are evident: your car to go places; your cooker to prepare your meals; your eyeglasses to aid your sight; your dress to cover your nakedness; your radio to get the news; your television to watch the games; your fax machine to send the files; your wristwatch to guide your time; your laptop to write your notes; and your phone to make your calls. Modern life is dictated by science, and nearly everything tends to go under the sway and hegemony of science and technology: Education, religion, politics, economy, agriculture, medicine, sports, transportation, communication, etc. As we sing the glories of science and of the invincible, insatiable human spirit, we do so with a caveat, knowing very well also that science is a human device.


Purpose of the book

As a course text in the History and Philosophy of Science, this book introduces students to the history and philosophy of the natural sciences. In the book, we examined the major topics in the history and philosophy of science, including, among others, the meaning, nature, goal and method of science; the meaning, nature and goal of philosophy of science; the problems of induction and causation and the inductive reasoning as the primary logic of science. In the work, we emphasized the core issue of demarcation of science from non-science as a major problem which led to different philosophies of science. In the sphere of the philosophies of science, we examined Positivism, Logical Positivism and the analytic philosophical tradition. We examined Falsificationism of Karl Popper within the context of his grand philosophy of Critical Rationalism. We examined Methodology of Scientific Research Programme of Imre Lakatos; Scientific Revolution of Thomas Kuhn; and Methodological Anarchism of Paul Feyerabend. We traced the history and evolution of the Western sciences and the philosophical issues associated with them. The origin theories of the universe and, by implication, of man, were also discussed and analysed in perspective. Issues on the environment, its sustainability and renewability were sufficiently discussed. This included an essay on climate change. We also treated the theme of health, reproductive health, nutrition and diseases, including HIV/AIDS and Ebola. This volume also contains issues in contemporary philosophy of science.


Composition of the book

This volume is a composition of some contents of my earlier works, Elements of History and Philosophy of Science (2013) and Philosophy of Science and Space-Time Cosmology (2015). We acknowledge all authors whose works are cited in this book, and we take responsibility for inadequacies this work contains.

THE COMPATIBILITY THEORY




Compatibility theory states that compatibility exists if units are equivalent, or approximates, or similar, or intersected, or complements (Essien: 2008; 2008b; 2011b; 2011d). Hence, the formula:

C={(���)|(���)|(~)|(���)|(c)},

Where

C is compatibility,

��� is equivalence,

��� is approximation,

~ is similarity,

��� is intersection,

c is complement.


The compatibility theory presents equivalence, approximation, similarity, intersection and complementation as the basic conditions for compatibility between or among units and systems.

The compatibility principle affirms that entities are often compatible by their common property and yet by implicate order when they appear dissimilar. The order in each unit of a system is defined by the order of the system. In other words, the wholeness of a system is the common property and the implicate order which exist in the system. Compatibility principle thrives on the premise that entities which share a common property are often compatible and that there is compatibility by implicate order in entities that appear to be dissimilar.

There are thus three interdependent postulates of the compatibility principle

Postulate 1: The order in each unit of a system in relation to the order in another or other unit(s) within the same system is the order of the system.

Postulate 2: There is compatibility by implicate order.

Postulate 3: The all are in the one and the one is with the all, such that a set is defined only by the elements that it contains.
ChatGPT
The Compatibility Theory, as presented, proposes a systematic way to understand the relationships between units or entities within a system. It emphasizes the ways in which entities can be considered compatible, including through equivalence, approximation, similarity, intersection, and complementation.
Here's a summary and breakdown:
1. Definition of Compatibility:
The theory defines compatibility as the existence of certain relationships or conditions between units. These relationships are:
Equivalence (���): Two units are exactly the same in some respect.
Approximation (���): They are nearly the same but not exact.
Similarity (~): They share certain qualities or characteristics.
Intersection (���): There are shared elements between the two units.
Complementation (c): They complete each other or fit together in a way that forms a whole.
2. Compatibility Principle:
It introduces the idea that entities, even if they seem dissimilar, can be compatible if they share a common property or an implicit order. This emphasizes the underlying interconnectedness of things, even when they might appear distinct or unrelated.
3. Three Interdependent Postulates:
Postulate 1:
Every unit within a system takes its order or structure from the system as a whole. This means that understanding a single unit requires understanding the system it belongs to.
Postulate 2:
Compatibility is not always explicit. Even if things appear different, they can still be compatible because of an underlying or hidden ("implicate") order.
Postulate 3:
There is a relationship between the whole and its parts. The entire system (the whole) is defined by the units (parts) it contains. Each part is a reflection of the whole, and the whole is made up of its parts.
In essence, the Compatibility Theory seeks to provide a structured approach to understanding how different parts of a system relate to each other and to the whole system. This understanding can be used in various fields or disciplines to analyze systems, be it in technology, philosophy, biology, or any area where systems and relationships need to be understood.
CHAPTER ONE


BASIC CONCEPTS IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE



Ephraim-Stephen Essien and Joseph Alphonsus Okon



Introduction

This chapter intends to present a conceptual analysis of basic terms in the history and philosophy of science. The history and philosophy of science is a study of the gradual development of the entire series of human activities which has culminated in what is now termed science. As can be seen and expected, the terms, ���History���, Philosophy��� and ���Science���, stare us in the face begging for explanations. We shall, therefore, analyze these terms in their nuances and ramifications. The question of science, what science is and what it exists for will be presented. There will be an attempt to analyze ���scientific method��� and distinguish it from ���scientific technique���. The features and goals of science will also be discussed here. The notions of facts, hypothesis, scientific theory and scientific law will be briefly explained. With an analysis on the scientific method, we shall realize that the scientific process involves inductive reasoning in the most part and a quantum of deduction. There will be a cursory explanation of the nature and place of philosophy of science.

The scientific method is analyzed in this work in terms of being a body of procedural rules and as a number or processes or stages of activities. Here is an allusion to understanding science as a rule-governed system, that is, a conceptual structure, as well as a human activity (Giddings, 1924). Taking a voyage into everyday paradigms of scientific practice, a balanced judgment would acknowledge an inherent and co-existing romance between inductive and deductive procedures in scientific method. Granted that both inductive and deductive procedures are identified in the scientific method, the inductive reasoning tends to be more dominant and so predominant that, in some departments of learning, induction is said to be the all about science.

The nature of science with scientific discoveries has made it an imperative to pay serious attention to scientific method. This is done with the view of ascertaining the way of science. Here the question of science and what it is poses itself. Nevertheless, we must know ahead that the concept of science and its analyses is deeply enmeshed in an avalanche of polysemicity. In other words, the notion of science has been variously defined or described. But, here, we need a specific, operational definition. First, we take on the concepts of history and philosophy.


History

The term history is an English version of the Greek historia and the Latin historia. While the Greek historia means inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation; the Latin historia means story or account. As coined by Nikolaos Gysis, historia is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the discovery, collection, organization and presentation of information about those events. Also, history could be termed a chronological account of events in time. This idea is well represented in the Latin version of historia, which means story or account. As an academic discipline, history uses a narrative technique to examine and analyze a sequence of past events as well as objectively determine the dynamics and peculiar root causes of the events. Thus, history is characterized with:

1: Passion for research/investigation

2: Objectivity in recording the discoveries

3: Concern for the preservation of facts

4: Ability to understand/interpret facts and pieces of information


However, the 5th century Greek Herodotus has been identified as the father of the western tradition of history. His unique interest in culture and the military interest of Thucydides, his contemporary, became foundational to modern western history. The relevance of history need not be over emphasized. Hence, George Santayana held that `those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it'.

Chapter Summary
Title:
Basic Concepts in History and Philosophy of Science
Authors:
Ephraim-Stephen Essien and Joseph Alphonsus Okon
Introduction:
The chapter sets out to explore fundamental concepts in the history and philosophy of science. It emphasizes the need to understand the meanings and significance of the terms ���History,��� ���Philosophy,��� and ���Science��� in this context.
Key Points:
Purpose:
The study focuses on the evolution of human activities leading up to the establishment of modern science.
Science:
An in-depth look is given to the meaning of science, its objectives, and its raison d'��tre. The chapter differentiates between ���scientific method��� and ���scientific technique���. The attributes and aims of science are explored, alongside the concepts of facts, hypothesis, scientific theory, and scientific law.
Scientific Method:
The method is analyzed both as a set of procedural rules and as a series of activity stages. The relationship between inductive and deductive reasoning in scientific method is highlighted. Inductive reasoning is underscored as dominant in some areas of study.
Nature of Science:
Given the significance of scientific discoveries, there's a concentrated effort to understand the scientific method to determine the 'way of science'. While many definitions exist for science, this chapter seeks a precise, operational definition.
History:
The origins of the term "history" from Greek and Latin are discussed. History is described as a record of past events, and its methods include investigation, discovery, organization, and presentation. Key characteristics of history include a passion for research, objectivity, preservation of facts, and the interpretation of facts. The chapter pays homage to Herodotus, recognizing him as foundational to western history. The value of history is emphasized with a quote from George Santayana about the importance of remembering the past.
Overall,
this chapter aims to provide a foundational understanding of the terms and concepts critical to the history and philosophy of science. It underscores the importance of both the methodological and conceptual aspects of science, while also highlighting the invaluable lessons that history offers to the present and future.
Philosophy

The term philosophy is also an English version of the Greek phrase Philos tes Sophia. `Philos' means `love', `Philein' means `to love' and `Sophia' means `wisdom'. Thus, etymologically (from the root of the word), philosophy means `love of wisdom'. This literal translation, simple as it is, aptly defines philosophy in entirety. But the concept of love here does not imply a mere affective orientation or admiration of wisdom or knowledge. For instance, one could say of an eloquent speaker, ���I love (admire) his command of language��� or of a persuasive/motivational speaker, ���I always love (admire) his gaits���. Again, one may be fascinated and endeared to plausible results/outcome of certain intellectual endeavor; s/he may as well be in perpetual sincere appreciation of what the human mind can/actually sachieve(s). Yet, such levels of affective orientation do not, in the least sense, explain the word love, as used in the original Greek sense. Love in this context, goes beyond a passive attitude to become an active exercise voluntarily embarked upon. It goes beyond a passive attitude of admiring any given thing to become a commitment to an active exercise of the intellects natural desire to understand. Philia, a feminine gender of the verb philein, simply implies an irresistible drive (eros), a burning desire, a passion which often overwhelms the individual. Love of wisdom therefore, goes beyond a passive admiration of values and or concepts to imply an active radical exercise of the intellect in attempts to articulate fundamental principles and evaluate/ justify certain claims, values or concepts. As an exercise of love, it is a commitment freely embarked upon and exercised in an ambience of liberty and simplicity. Hence, philosophy is a voluntary commitment to articulate fundamental principles, evaluate/justify certain claims and dispassionately search for values in human affairs/concerns through a dynamic radical exercise of the intellect. In a similar vein, Olusegun Oladipo underscored philosophy in three perspectives: as the formulation or construction of world-views, critical thinking and as a rational, but non-scientific, quest for understanding ( Thinking about Philosophy,12).

Given this understanding of philosophy from the roots of the word, it becomes necessary to hold that philosophy could be seen as a natural disposition and as a cultivated habit. It is a natural disposition for those who have the propensity by nature, to articulate fundamental principles, evaluate/ justify certain claims and dispassionately search for values in human affairs/concerns through a dynamic radical exercise of the intellect. But it is a cultivated habit for those who, either through formal tutelage or social acquaintance, voluntarily commit themselves to articulating fundamental principles, evaluate/justify certain claims and dispassionately search for values in human affairs/concerns through a dynamic radical exercise of the intellect.

In this sense, philosophy is characterized by three major qualities:

Personal Commitment: an individual has to be deeply involved and concerned. S/he requires limitless interest and disposition to cogitate, meditate, reflect and discourse whatever crosses the mind not necessarily for any material advantage but more so for the satisfaction of the natural desire to understand. Again, conclusions arrived at must be solely personal not a group idea; authenticity is the watch word.

Broad based liberty: there must be a broad based liberty for there to be a philosophy. This is so precisely because the scope of interest of the subject cuts across whatever can be thought of and whatever exists. Hence, the domain of philosophy is unrestrictive; nothing delimits its concerns. Again, maximum liberty of thought is a necessity in philosophy; thinking should not be restricted or checkmated. Hence, the philosopher radically contemplates and seeks to understand whatever crosses his mind.

Critical mindedness: the exercise requires not only a high level of curiosity but also much vigor for criticism (even of self-criticism). Again, a high level of alertness/discipline is required for the appreciation of values and salient points even in a rival's opinion. Hence, it shuns narrow mindedness.

Given this understanding of philosophy as its unique characteristics, note is worthy of the often agnostic argument that philosophy is difficult to define. Any view that philosophy is difficult to define cast immense doubt on the proponent's knowledge of the subject as such knowledge must necessarily be founded on the whatness of the subject. Some scholars hold a somewhat apologetic view that a common/ acceptable definition of philosophy is impossible. But these are not to be taken seriously. As could be reasoned above, philosophy is quite definable in terms of its most fundamental denominators; a perspective that can stand any weight of criticism. Again, the characterization of philosophy above could well be seen in virtually any of the purported diverse definitions of philosophy not merely because what is here articulated is eclectic, but more so on the grounds that it aptly articulates the fundamental characteristics of the subject.

Chapter Summary
Title:
Philosophy
Main Points:
Etymology of Philosophy:
The term "philosophy" is derived from the Greek phrase "Philos tes Sophia."
"Philos" and "Philein" denote "love," while "Sophia" signifies "wisdom." Therefore, philosophy translates to the "love of wisdom."
Depth of 'Love' in Philosophy:
The term "love" in this context surpasses a mere admiration or appreciation for wisdom or knowledge.
It represents an active, overwhelming passion for wisdom, pushing individuals beyond passive admiration to an active intellectual pursuit to comprehend the fundamental principles and values.
Definition of Philosophy:
Philosophy is described as a voluntary commitment to articulate essential principles and evaluate claims and values. It emphasizes a dynamic exercise of intellect in its pursuits.
Olusegun Oladipo defines philosophy in three ways: the creation of world-views, critical thinking, and a rational non-scientific quest for understanding.
Natural Disposition vs. Cultivated Habit:
Philosophy can emerge as a natural disposition for those inherently driven to understand fundamental principles.
Alternatively, it can be a cultivated habit developed through education or societal interactions.
Characteristics of Philosophy:
Personal Commitment:
Authenticity is crucial. Philosophers are driven by a natural desire to understand, reflecting and considering various ideas for intellectual satisfaction rather than material gain.
Broad-based Liberty:
Philosophy requires a vast domain of freedom since it encompasses everything thinkable. This freedom allows for unrestricted contemplation.
Critical Mindedness:
Philosophers maintain a heightened level of curiosity and a strong inclination towards criticism, including self-criticism. They appreciate values and essential points even in contrasting views.
Defining Philosophy:
The chapter addresses the argument that philosophy is challenging to define, suggesting that such a belief casts doubt on one's knowledge of the subject.
While some believe that a universally acceptable definition of philosophy is unattainable, the chapter affirms that philosophy can be adequately defined by its fundamental aspects.
Conclusion:
Philosophy, stemming from the Greek words that symbolize the love for wisdom, represents a profound commitment to understanding the core principles of existence. It requires personal dedication, vast liberty, and a critical mindset. Contrary to some views, philosophy can indeed be defined by its essential characteristics, offering a perspective that can withstand scrutiny.
For instance, in holding the view that it is difficult to proffer a common definition of philosophy, C.S.Momoh identified five factors as the sources of the perceived difficulty. As outlined in The Substance of African Philosophy, they include: the cultural and social influences on the particular philosopher; the historical epoch in which the philosopher lives; the school of thought (the strand/ direction of thought) that a philosopher belongs; the specific subject areas (branch) of philosophy of the philosopher's interest; and the personal motive/ agenda of the particular philosopher (cf.p.5-7). For C.S.Momoh therefore, difference in the definition of philosophy follows from the differences in culture, history, interest and motive of the particular philosopher. Hence, C.S.Momoh identified the following as the different definitions of philosophy:

1. Philosophy is the search for a comprehensive view of nature, an attempt at the universal explanation of things.

2. The business of philosophy is to analyze the concepts of science.

3. The task of philosophy is to change the world.

4. Philosophy is the pursuit of wisdom and its formulation in words.

5. Philosophy interprets the knowledge of life.

6. Philosophy is the search for the reality.

7. Philosophy is the search for the truth.

8. Philosophy is the search for the goal of human existence.

9. Philosophy is the critical discussion of critical discussion.

10. Philosophy is a direct personal intuition of general conclusions.

11. Philosophy is the uncovering of nonsense.

12. Philosophy is the art of life.

13. Philosophy is the scientific knowledge of man.

14. Philosophy is the theory of being.

15. Philosophy is the theory of culture. ( cf: p.15)

Of the varied perspectives of the subject so identified, one thing stands out: each is a reflection on a particular aspect of the entire gamut of human experience. As such, they all approximate to certain concerns of philosophy not, stricto sensu, a definition of philosophy. Definition, as a concept, entails the setting of limits, the delineation of the domains/ concerns of a given concept.

In a similar vein, K. A. Ojong identified some purported definitions of philosophy to include: a discipline of study in an academic institution; any general theory or idea dealing with important questions about life; a free rational inquiry into the nature and meaning of reality; thought about thought ( cf: A.F.Uduigwomen & G.O. Ozumba, ed.p3-4). But what disturbs most about Ojong's notions of philosophy is the rather permissive and apologetic expression that ���the concept philosophy like any other abstract concept, is capable of diverse interpretations depending on the perspective from which the particular philosopher views it, and what problem he intended to solve with the definition. This could be called anarchistic as it accepts any view as definitive of the subject.

Title:
Diverse Interpretations of Philosophy
Main Points:
C.S.Momoh's View on the Definition of Philosophy:
C.S.Momoh argues that the difficulty in establishing a universal definition of philosophy is due to various factors, including cultural and social influences, historical context, the school of thought to which a philosopher belongs, the specific branches of philosophy they're interested in, and their personal motivations.
Momoh enumerates fifteen distinct definitions of philosophy. While they touch upon various aspects of human experience, they might be more accurately described as reflecting specific concerns within philosophy rather than encapsulating its entirety.
Definitions of Philosophy by K. A. Ojong:
Ojong offers additional interpretations of philosophy, such as:
Philosophy as an academic discipline.
Philosophy as a general theory addressing life's essential questions.
Philosophy as a free inquiry into reality's nature and meaning.
Philosophy as a thought about thought.
Ojong's perspective, however, seems overly permissive. He suggests that philosophy's definition can be shaped by individual interpretations and the problems a philosopher aims to solve. This view might be considered "anarchistic" as it appears to embrace all views as valid definitions of the subject.
The Nature of Definition:
While multiple interpretations of philosophy exist, it's crucial to differentiate between an examination of a particular aspect of human experience and a holistic definition of philosophy. A definition typically seeks to demarcate the scope or boundary of a concept.
Conclusion:
The multifaceted nature of philosophy gives rise to numerous interpretations, each reflecting a different facet or concern. While these interpretations provide insight into philosophy's depth and breadth, they might not, on their own, offer a comprehensive definition. The challenge lies in distinguishing between descriptions of specific philosophical concerns and a holistic definition that captures philosophy's essence.
What is Science?

Science is a systematic body of knowledge which is made, popularised, confirmed and sometimes rejected by the scientific community. Otherwise expressed, science is a systematic body of knowledge which is enacted, promulgated, ratified and sometimes repealed by the scientific community (Essien, ���The Logic of Scientific Method���, 2008). Science involves a step-by step observation, experimentation and investigation of nature.

Etymologically, science means knowledge, from the Latin word `Scientia'. Natural philosophy was the name under which science was studied before it broke away from philosophy when much emphasis was placed on the scientific method by Galileo Galilei, Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes. The scientific method involves acquiring knowledge through critical observation, formation of hypothesis or informed guess and experimenting to see whether the results match the hypothesis. Results that match the hypothesis become theories and theories that pass the test of time become scientific laws. In the scientific method is the scientific technique which involves the use of scientific tools in carrying out experiments. The tools include physical tools such as the apparatus and equipment used, and non-physical like the ideas that are in the mind of the researcher.


The Greek word ���Episteme���, the Latin word ���Scientia���, the German word ���Wissenschaft���, and the Russian word ���Nauka��� all refer to science as a systematic body of knowledge. For Heidegger, the term ���science��� today means something essentially different from the ���doctrina��� and the ���scientia��� of the Middle Ages, and also from Greek ���episteme��� (Heidegger, 1977). Heidegger means that one commonly characterizes modern science in contradistinction to medieval science by saying that modern science starts from facts while medieval science started from general speculative propositions and concepts (Heidegger, 1977). For placing theory before facts and observation, Popper may be referred to as thinking science the medieval way, if the said characterization of science is anything to go by. Galileo's thought experiment would not be far from this analysis, therefore. Nonetheless, one may likely get a clearer view of the concept of ���science��� when it is understood in broad and narrow senses.


Broad and Narrow meanings of Science

To say that science is any body of knowledge or systematic body (corpus) of knowledge over broadens the scope of science. In this broad sense, all of physics and philosophy, history and law, economics and music, biology and geography, mathematics and chemistry, astronomy, architecture, medicine and psychology would all be rightly named sciences. This is a general sense of conceptualizing science which the ancients and medieval thinkers gave credence to. Science in this sense, Robert Morgan (1979), affirms, is any activity resulting in knowledge and understanding about the world around us. Science in this sense is equated with human knowledge, ���scientia���.

In its narrow and conventional sense, the term ���science��� is employed to signify the natural sciences, such as physics, chemistry and biology. These disciplines are called pure sciences because their objects of study are natural kinds. It was in this sense that I defined science as a systematic body of knowledge which is enacted, promulgated, ratified and sometimes repealed by the scientific community (Essien, ���The Logic of Scientific Method���, 2008). It was in this sense that I described science as a step-by-step observation, experimentation and investigation of nature. It is this narrow sense of science that is our concern in this work. From the above, one must note that the object of science must be a natural kind or the properties and behavioral pattern of natural objects.


Technology: There is the attendant concept of technology associated with science. This term is often used to refer to the application of science in practical concerns of life. Technology is then said to be an application of scientific theories and discoveries. Agassi (1980) observes the ultimate goal of the applied sciences is to be able to control the course of events and enhance man's comfort and happiness on earth by inventing more and more technological facilities (Agassi, 1980 quoted in Aigbodioh).


Science in its conventional, ���purely��� scientific predication fairly traces its genesis to the works of Copernicus, Kepler, Brahe, Galileo, Descartes and then Newton, who was the culmination, the acme, the zenith, the apogee and the blossoming of classical science. The conventional notion of science and the popular notion of science are then convertible. U. D. Rohansky's characterization of science enters into this scientific level of analysis. The reason he suggested include the mathematisation of science; the evolution and application of fruitful scientific method which employs both the theoretical and experimental levels of cognition. He included the existence of scientific collectives, engineers, programmists, instruments, apparatii, experimental situation as sine qua non for a scientific enterprise (Alozie, 2001).


Although one may discern implied features and goals of science from the above analysis, since the human mind always seeks to receive or know more, one would be justified in describing the basic features and goals of science more clearly. To these we turn.

Title:
Understanding Science: Features, Goals, and Its Relationship with Technology
Main Points:
Origins and Etymology of Science:
The term "science" is derived from the Latin word 'Scientia' which means 'knowledge'. Historically, it was known as 'natural philosophy' and became distinct from philosophy due to the emphasis on the scientific method by luminaries such as Galileo, Bacon, and Hobbes.
The scientific method is an iterative process of observation, hypothesis formulation, experimentation, and theory generation. Over time, well-tested theories may transform into scientific laws.
Evolution of the Concept of Science:
Throughout history, the understanding and definition of science have evolved. Notably, Heidegger draws a distinction between modern science, which is grounded in empirical facts, and medieval science, rooted in speculative concepts.
The ancients and medieval thinkers had a broader conception of science, encompassing all disciplines that resulted in knowledge and understanding about the world. This expansive definition encompassed fields like philosophy, music, history, and more.
Broad vs. Narrow Definitions of Science:
In its broader sense, science encapsulates all bodies of knowledge. In contrast, the narrower and more conventional definition restricts science to natural sciences like physics, chemistry, and biology. These are deemed "pure sciences" as they study natural phenomena and objects.
This narrower understanding emphasizes observation, experimentation, and investigation of the natural world.
Science and Technology:
Science and technology are intertwined, with technology being the practical application of scientific knowledge. The goal of applied sciences and technology is to enhance human life, improving comfort and facilitating various human endeavors.
Historical Development of Conventional Science:
Classical or conventional science, as understood today, owes its foundation to the works of pioneers like Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton. They set the foundation for a scientific approach that integrated mathematical precision and rigorous experimental verification.
The development of science also necessitated the establishment of scientific collectives, tools, methods, and instruments. All these components became integral to the scientific enterprise.
Features and Goals of Science:
Although the text provides a detailed exploration of the concept of science, a further dissection of its inherent features and primary objectives is crucial. Understanding the features and goals provides a deeper insight into what drives scientific inquiry and how it benefits humanity.
Conclusion:
Science, in its essence, is an ever-evolving body of knowledge that strives to understand the natural world through systematic observation and experimentation. Whether viewed broadly or narrowly, it remains a pivotal tool for human progress. Its relationship with technology showcases the practical implications of scientific discoveries, underscoring the importance of science in shaping the future of humanity.
Features of Science

According to Aigbodioh (1997), Philosophers of science and scientists generally assume four different, but closely related characteristics of the scientific enterprise. These are:

i Specific

ii Public

iii Impersonal and

iv Objective

Ernest Gellner (1974) is in praise of this characterization of science in his Legitimation of Belief.


i The Specific Character of Science

There are two sense of looking at the specific character of science. First, science deals with particular, observable or identifiable objects of this immanent world, instead of some abstract general ideas or beings in this or some possible world. Science studies the properties, components and behaviour of such natural objects as water, air, space, the planet, soil, trees and animals, all of which cross our sensory spectrum.


Secondly, the science are specific or said to be specific in that they furnish us with information about our world as it actually is .in other words, some authors claim that what scientist discover about our word represents the world as it is (Aigbodioh,1997).




ii The Public character of Science

The conclusions and knowledge claims in the sciences are open to public scrutiny and are interpersonally variable. The techniques and methods as well as the findings and products are capable of being communicated and taught to the generally of persons.


iii The Impersonal character of Science

Science does not involve idiosyncratic beliefs resulting from a person's peculiar power of imagination. The impersonal character of science also means that the sciences are unprejudiced methods redeem science from the interests of a biased theorist and accords science with the status of near universality.


iv The Objective character of Science

An objective is claimed by scientists in as much as the conclusions of science. In terms of concepts, laws and theories are inferred directly from the facts from the world of everyday trial experience. The facts which are alleged to be involved are such that no one can make mistakes about them (Aigbodioh, 1997). It is on this that Paul Feyerabend (1993) affirms that a point of view or a procedure is ���valid irrespective of human expectations, ideas, attitudes, wishes��� and is mostly associated with today's scientists and intellectuals.


We do not claim such absoluteness. We do not know everything about bodies. In the face of modern physics, the claim to objectivity in scientific knowledge is a mere misnomer, a chimera, flight of fantasy and a figment of the mind. This is because our knowledge of an object is relative to the motion of the object and that of the observer. With the relativity theory propositions which used to be proved by reasoning become conventions or approximate truths ratified by observation (Russell, 1979). With indeterminacy, we cannot know the exact positions or velocity of particles. Theories, such as uniformity of nature, law of universal causation, one-embracing absolute time, all crumble before relativity and quantum physics. Wither the objectivity in science and human knowledge save relative objectivity?


To put the characteristic of science in a nutshell, however, one observes that the explanatory schemata of scientific knowledge are impersonal, indifferent to idiosyncrasy and identity, and articulated in terms which are socially ad morally blind, and which are indeed, generally un-intelligible without specialized and technical training (Gellner, 1974).

Summary and Reflection on the Features of Science:
Features of Science:
Specific:
Science addresses tangible, observable entities and phenomena. Its focus is on the concrete elements of the universe that we can sense, such as air, water, planets, and animals. Furthermore, science provides knowledge about the world as it truly exists. This specificity differentiates science from other disciplines that may deal with abstract or general concepts.
Public:
Scientific knowledge is available for public examination. This means that the methods and results of scientific inquiries can be communicated, taught, and critically evaluated by anyone with the requisite understanding. This openness ensures that scientific findings undergo rigorous peer review, reinforcing the reliability and credibility of scientific conclusions.
Impersonal:
Science doesn't cater to individual whims or imaginations. Instead, it employs unbiased methods, ensuring that the outcomes are universally applicable and not merely the result of a singular perspective or bias.
Objective:
Science seeks to produce knowledge that directly arises from empirical evidence. These facts are, in theory, undeniable and form the backbone of scientific conclusions. However, as Feyerabend notes, true objectivity ��� independent of human perspectives or desires ��� is highly esteemed among scientists.
Reflection:
The features outlined by Aigbodioh present an idealized image of the scientific process. Science, as described, seeks to offer a precise, transparent, neutral, and evidence-based understanding of the world. However, the modern landscape of scientific inquiry, particularly in the realms of relativity and quantum physics, challenges some of these notions.
The inherent limitations of our observations, as highlighted by the theory of relativity and the indeterminacy principle in quantum mechanics, suggest that complete objectivity is elusive. These challenges compel us to reconsider and potentially revise traditional ideas about the absolute objectivity of science.
While these features set an admirable standard for scientific investigation, they also highlight the dynamic nature of science. As our understanding deepens and our perspectives shift, so too do our conceptions of what is specific, public, impersonal, and objective. In this light, science becomes not just a static body of knowledge but an evolving discipline, perpetually refining its methods and understanding in response to new insights and challenges.
The Basic Goals of Science

The goals of science may be said to be multifarious, in that there is no single ultimate goal of science. Scientific endeavours are readily characterized as acts of explaining, understanding, predicting or describing the occurrences of natural events or phenomena. Stating the ultimate aim of science is an initiation a controversy for philosophers of science. Since the scientists may go on with their theories irrespective of what philosopher of science say about them and their advances (Hawking, 1988), Philosophers too, must go on with what they are familiar with, controversies, since through them they can increase the vistas of human knowledge.


Some say that science is pursued for its own sake. This view supports the assertion that science aims to discover more and more about the world, or about the phenomena under investigation, whatever the world or the phenomena may turn out to be like (Maxwell, 1974). In support of this view, Einstein says that ���there exists a passion for comprehension just as there exists a passion for music��� without this passion there would be neither mathematics nor natural science.

Again, Einstein questioned: what, then impels us to devise theory after theory? Why do we device theories at all? The answer to the latter question is simply because we enjoy ���comprehending��� i.e., reducing phenomena by the process of logic to something already known or (apparently) evident. This view arrogates the acquisition of human knowledge per science. However, we have indicated how this scientific theories of relativity and quantum mechanics.


If science is not pursued merely for knowledge sake, some others argue, it must be for its practical benefits. This is utilitarian view about science that is science exists for its useful end. This view has been criticized with the argument that the attainment of utilitarian values cannot be the principle and ultimate goal of science. For instance, many of the primary products of the sciences, like theoretical physics, are not limited to limited to the achievement of immediate practical and technological ends (Aigbodioh, 1997).


There is the third view that sees the scientists in the question how best to understand the world. Science is thus viewed as the supreme human effort to explain and predict the world. Maxwell (1994) opines: Science constitutes search for an underlying simplicity, unity, harmony, order, coherence, beauty or intelligibility which we conjecture to be inherent in the universe, new scientific hypotheses only constituting contributions to our knowledge to the extent they promise to help us towards realizing this basic aim.


Science explains the world and world phenomena by establishing observed regularities in the world and expressing such observed regularities in the world and expressing such observed regularities in terms of hypothesis, laws and theories which may be employed to predict future occurrences.


Science tends to have varied goals. It exists for its own sake; it explains understands, predicts and describes the occurrences and processes of natural evens and phenomena. There is, however, a greater proclivity and prediction among analysts of science towards the explanatory and predictive goal of science. Mach, Poincare, Einstein, Maxwell and Carl Hempel, et cetera, vouched for the explanatory and predictive goal of science. For Professor Carl Hempel: Empirical science, in all its major branches, seeks not only to describe the phenomena in the world of our experience, but also explains or understands their occurrences. It is concerned not just with ���what���?, ���when?��� and ���where?'', but definitely and often predominantly with the ���why?'' of the phenomena it investigates. Hempel presented the Deductive-Nomological and Inductive-Probabilistic models of scientific explanation (Hempel, 1970). For him science has explanatory and predictive powers.


Scientific inquiry presents us with ideas of discovery of facts and building of hypotheses and theories are meant to predict the occurrence of events or results of experiments with a vision of anticipating new facts. Explanation renders intelligible facts which have already been recorded. Whereas prediction looks forward from what is, to what is to come, explanation usually looks back from what is to what on in the past.

The object of explanation, its position and motion, the measuring instrument, the mental disposition of the observer and the functionality of his sense, all these stare in the face any claim to objective knowledge through science. Quantum mechanics upholds epistemological subjectivism.
ChatGPT
Summary and Reflection on the Basic Goals of Science:
Goals of Science:
Understanding and Explanation:
Science seeks to explain the natural phenomena around us. Scientists aim to develop theories that make sense of observations, looking for patterns, regularities, and underlying principles.
Prediction:
Once phenomena are understood, they can often be predicted. This predictive power is one of the hallmarks of a strong scientific theory.
Description:
Science seeks to describe phenomena in detailed and systematic ways, often leading to new discoveries or deeper insights.
Knowledge Acquisition:
Some argue that science exists for its own sake, driven by a passion for understanding, as highlighted by Einstein's perspective on the "passion for comprehension."
Practical Benefits (Utilitarian View):
Others argue that science is conducted for its practical applications and benefits, such as technological advancements. However, not all scientific discoveries have immediate practical applications.
Reflection:
The goals of science, as presented, demonstrate its multifaceted nature. While it might seem like a straightforward endeavor, science is driven by various motivations, from pure curiosity and the pursuit of understanding to the desire for practical applications and solutions.
Einstein's perspective underscores the intrinsic human desire to understand and make sense of the world, emphasizing that the joy of comprehension can be as compelling as any practical benefit. On the other hand, the utilitarian view of science stresses its role in bringing about tangible benefits and technological advancements.
However, science's quest for knowledge is not without its challenges. As highlighted in the piece, modern scientific theories, especially in fields like quantum mechanics, challenge traditional notions of objective reality. The very act of observing or measuring can change the outcome, suggesting that our understanding is inherently influenced by our actions and perceptions.
Despite these challenges, the essence of science remains: a quest for understanding, explanation, prediction, and knowledge. As technology and understanding evolve, the goals of science might shift or expand, but the core drive to comprehend and describe the universe will likely remain unchanged.
Scientific Method and Scientific Technique

The scientific method is held to be the procedure by which conclusions and discoveries are alleged to be made in every science. The scientific technique does not necessarily imply scientific method. There is a distinction. The phrase ���Scientific Technique��� may be said to refer to the manner in which a scientific tool is used. A scientific tool refers to any physical or conceptual instrument which is employed in the scientific inquiry (Ackoff, 1962). Whereas conceptual scientific tools include mathematical symbols and ���structural terms��� such as ���Theory ���,���Law���, ���Observation���, ���Hypothesis���, and ���Evidence���, physical scientific tools include microscopes, thermometers, cyclotrons, et cetera. That scientific technique is the way in which a scientific tool is used is contrasted with ���scientific method���. Ackoff considers scientific method as ���the way techniques are selected in science; hat is, the evaluation of scientific courses of scientific action. ���It is argued that the actual techniques which the scientists employ are as a result of his personal decision. The method is said to be the decision rules which guide the scientists in making his decisions or choices. Methods are then said to be rules of choices whereas the techniques are the choices themselves.


Except we go beyond semantics, the above distinction may land our audience in confusion. This may be due to kindred elements in method and technique as the way or style of doing something. The distinction would be deep or deeper in the section that follows.


Given that the procedure by which conclusions and discoveries are alleged to be made in every science is referred to as the ���scientific method���. Danto (1972) conceives of the method of consisting of in:


(a) Explaining natural processes through identification of the natural causes responsible for them, and

(b) Testing any given explanation with regard to consequences that must hold if it is true.

   On this method, Ernest Nagel and Moris Cohen (1934) say that it is ���the most assured technique man has yet devised for controlling the flux of things and establishing stable beliefs. The above outlay of the method by Danto, according to Aigbodioh (1997) can be analyzed into for stages as follows:


a. The identification of the problem or a puzzling phenomenon;

b. The making of a large number of observations

c. Drawing and hypothesis on inductive grounds, and

d. Confirming or verifying by the process of deduction.


The above, so far, indicates that there is a step by step process in scientific research.

However, scholars are not agreed on the exact number of the research stages in scientific method. Ackoff (1962) identifies observation, Generalization and Experimentation as the three phases of scientific research. A.D. Abro names three phases, but these are varied from Ackoff's list. D'Abro's list includes the observational stage, the experimental stage, and the theoretical and the mathematical stage.


F. G Giddings (1924) presents to us a six stage process of scientific research as follows:


1. Formulating the problem

2. Constructing the model

3. Testing the model

4. Deriving the solution from the model

5. Testing and controlling the solution

6. Implementing the solution


Following this modality in the process of scientific research, Giddings (1924) argues that:

We control everything that happens. We determine when it shall occur and where. We arrange circumstances and surroundings, atmosphere and temperature; possible ways of getting out something that has been in, or put in something that has been out, and see what happens.

Irving Copi (2000) suggest a seven-stage description of the scientific method in what he designates as ���the Detective as scientist���. The stages are as follows:


1. The selection of problem for study

2. Preliminary hypothesis.

3. Collecting addition facts

4. Formulating the hypothesis

5. Deducing further consequences

6. Testing the consequences

7. Application


The details of Copi's stages of scientific method shall be given below under the brief on familiar everyday paradigms of scientific method.

From what we have done so far it is presupposes that the scientific method involves both a body of procedural rules as well as a number of stages or process of activities. In so far as the scientific method is concerned, neither method as the body of procedural rules nor the number of stages or process of activities is mutually exclusive. There is an entailment of process in system-building and the stages of activities, or say the scientific activities are rules-laden.
ChatGPT
Summary: Scientific Method vs. Scientific Technique
1. Distinction:
Scientific Technique:
Refers to how a scientific tool is used. A scientific tool can be:
Physical
(e.g., microscopes, thermometers, cyclotrons)
Conceptual
(e.g., mathematical symbols, "Theory," "Law," "Observation," "Hypothesis," "Evidence")
Scientific Method:
Concerned with how techniques are chosen in science. Ackoff describes it as the evaluation of courses of scientific action and sees it as the decision rules guiding scientists in their choices. In essence, methods are the rules of choice, whereas techniques are the choices themselves.
2. Scientific Method Process:
Danto (1972):
Explaining natural processes by identifying natural causes.
Testing explanations against their consequent truths.
Aigbodioh (1997) ��� Analysis of Danto:
Identifying a problem or puzzling phenomenon.
Making numerous observations.
Formulating a hypothesis inductively.
Confirming or verifying the hypothesis deductively.
Ackoff (1962):
Observation.
Generalization.
Experimentation.
D'Abro:
Observational stage.
Experimental stage.
Theoretical and mathematical stage.
Giddings (1924):
Formulating the problem.
Constructing the model.
Testing the model.
Deriving the solution from the model.
Testing and controlling the solution.
Implementing the solution.
Copi (2000) ��� ���Detective as scientist���:
Selecting the problem.
Making a preliminary hypothesis.
Collecting additional facts.
Formulating the hypothesis.
Deducting further consequences.
Testing these consequences.
Application.
Reflection:
The piece contrasts two fundamental concepts in science:
technique
and
method
. While both are critical to the scientific process, they serve different roles. Technique focuses on how tools (both physical and conceptual) are used in research, while the method pertains to the procedural steps and decision-making rules that guide scientific inquiry.
Notably, the various interpretations of the scientific method, as offered by different scholars, underline its dynamic nature. Even if they differ in number and specific steps, they all encompass a pattern of observation, hypothesis formulation, testing, and validation.
The divergence in defining the exact steps of the scientific method suggests its inherent flexibility. The stages adapt based on the nature of the research, the problem at hand, and the tools available. However, regardless of the number or the sequence of steps, the essence of the method remains: a structured, systematic approach to understanding the world around us.
I am reminded of the child scientist theory of Gopnik
ChatGPT
The "child as a scientist" theory is a prominent idea in developmental psychology and has been popularized by researchers like Alison Gopnik. Here's a concise overview:
Child as a Scientist Theory:
Basic Premise:
Children, similar to scientists, actively engage with the world, forming theories, making predictions, and testing their hypotheses through exploration and play.
Learning through Experimentation:
Just as scientists run experiments to test their theories, children learn about the world by trying things out and observing the results. This could be as simple as dropping a toy to see if it bounces or mixing different play-dough colors to see the outcome.
Probabilistic Models:
Gopnik and her colleagues suggest that children, like scientists, use probabilistic models to predict outcomes based on their observations and then update their beliefs when new data is available.
Hypothesis Testing and Revision:
Children are continuously updating their understanding of the world. When they encounter evidence that contradicts their current beliefs or theories, they adjust their thinking, much like how scientists revise their theories in light of new data.
Importance of Play:
Play is seen as a vital component of this scientific exploration. Through play, children can simulate different scenarios, test the boundaries of their environment, and learn from their experiences.
Implications for Education:
Understanding children as natural explorers and learners can inform educational practices. Emphasizing exploration, curiosity, and hands-on learning can cater to children's inherent "scientist" nature.
Gopnik's work underscores the active and curious nature of children's minds. By likening their cognitive processes to that of scientists, we can better appreciate their innate drive to understand the world and the importance of supporting this curiosity in educational and developmental settings.
This is related to active inference, predictive coding, and the Bayesian brain hypothesis.
ChatGPT
Absolutely! The concepts of active inference, predictive coding, and the Bayesian brain hypothesis all fall under the broader umbrella of theories suggesting that the brain is a prediction machine, constantly updating its beliefs based on new evidence. Let's briefly delve into how these ideas relate:
Predictive Coding:
This is the idea that the brain constantly generates predictions about incoming sensory information based on prior experiences. When there's a mismatch between prediction and actual sensory input, a "prediction error" occurs. The brain then updates its beliefs (or internal models) to minimize this error.
Bayesian Brain Hypothesis:
This idea is rooted in Bayesian statistics, which deals with probability inference. The Bayesian brain hypothesis suggests that the brain updates its beliefs about the world using a form of Bayesian inference. Essentially, it combines prior beliefs (priors) with current sensory evidence to form a posterior belief.
In simpler terms, the brain uses what it already knows (prior beliefs) and new information (evidence) to make educated guesses or predictions about the world.
Active Inference:
This concept extends predictive coding by emphasizing not just perception but action. The brain doesn't just passively predict sensory inputs; it also actively samples the environment to reduce prediction errors.
For instance, if you think there's a cat behind a curtain (prediction), you might pull back the curtain (action) to see if you're right.
Active inference suggests that our actions in the world aim to confirm our predictions or, put another way, to minimize the surprise or prediction errors.
When we relate these ideas to the "child as a scientist" theory, it becomes evident that children's exploration, experimentation, and play can be seen as active inference in action. Children form predictions about the world (e.g., "If I build this tower of blocks too high, it might fall"), act on these predictions (e.g., adding more blocks), and then update their beliefs based on the outcomes they observe (e.g., the tower collapsing or staying upright).
Overall, these theories underscore the dynamic, predictive nature of the brain and its constant endeavor to understand and interact with the world in a manner that aligns with its beliefs and minimizes surprise.
Predictive coding sounds a lot like how perceptual control theory uses feedback to maintain stimulus or proxy representation of a model predictive model of behavior and environment
ChatGPT
Indeed, both Predictive Coding (PC) and Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) share similarities in their foundational ideas, especially regarding feedback mechanisms and the way our brain or system responds to discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes. Let's break down the similarities and distinctions between the two:
Predictive Coding (PC)
:
Core Idea
: The brain generates predictions about incoming sensory information based on prior experiences. Discrepancies between the predictions and actual sensory input result in a "prediction error". This error is then used to update the brain's internal models.
Feedback Mechanism
: The prediction error (the difference between the predicted and actual sensory data) is fed back through the system to refine subsequent predictions.
Perceptual Control Theory (PCT)
:
Core Idea
: PCT proposes that behavior is the control of perception. Instead of responding to stimuli in the environment, organisms act to bring their perceptions in line with internally set reference values or goals.
Feedback Mechanism
: PCT employs a negative feedback loop. When there's a discrepancy between the perceived state and the reference state (set by the organism), this produces an error signal, which then drives behavior to reduce the discrepancy.
Hierarchical Structure
: In PCT, control systems are organized hierarchically. Lower-level systems control immediate and specific perceptions, while higher-level systems control more abstract and generalized perceptions.
Similarities
:
Both theories emphasize the importance of error-based feedback mechanisms to adjust and adapt based on discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes.
They both acknowledge the central role of internal models or reference values in shaping perception and behavior.
Differences
:
While PC predominantly focuses on how the brain processes sensory information, PCT offers a broader view, proposing a general framework for understanding behavior in terms of control systems that work to maintain specific perceptions.
PCT's hierarchical nature, with multiple nested feedback loops working at different levels of abstraction, distinguishes it from the more sensory-focused PC.
In summary, while both Predictive Coding and Perceptual Control Theory revolve around feedback loops and error correction, they offer different perspectives on perception and behavior. Predictive Coding emphasizes the brain's role in predicting sensory inputs, while Perceptual Control Theory focuses on how organisms act to control their perceptions in line with internally set goals.
I don't know if this is accurate but maybe predictive coding focuses more on finding some pattern or principle needed to generate useful or consistent predictions
ChatGPT
Yes, that's a fair assessment. Predictive coding primarily revolves around the idea that the brain constantly anticipates or predicts sensory input based on its internal models, which are formed from previous experiences. The primary objective is to minimize the error between the predicted sensory input and the actual sensory input. This is achieved through a hierarchical process where predictions flow downward from higher cognitive layers and errors (or mismatches between prediction and reality) flow upward to refine the model.
In essence, predictive coding emphasizes:
Efficiency
: By predicting sensory input, the brain can minimize the amount of information it needs to process. If the predictions are accurate, there's less new information to handle.
Pattern Recognition
: The brain identifies patterns based on prior experiences, using them to predict future sensory inputs. This is crucial for recognizing familiar environments, objects, or situations.
Consistency
: The goal is to achieve a consistent and coherent understanding of the world by constantly updating and refining internal models based on the feedback of prediction errors.
So, yes, predictive coding is very much centered on the notion of leveraging patterns or principles from past experiences to generate useful and consistent predictions about the present and future.
What if instead of minimizing error we maximized correctness?
ChatGPT
The distinction between minimizing error and maximizing correctness might seem like semantics at first glance, but it can provide different perspectives when applied to computational or theoretical models.
Minimizing Error
: This perspective is reactive. The system anticipates or predicts an outcome based on its current model. When the real-world outcome deviates from the prediction, the system measures this as an "error" and adjusts accordingly. It's about constantly refining the model to make it less wrong over time. Predictive coding, for instance, focuses on this by updating the internal model based on the discrepancies between predicted and actual sensory inputs.
Maximizing Correctness
: This approach is proactive. Instead of reacting to errors, the system actively seeks to make its predictions or actions as accurate as possible right from the start. This might involve additional upfront computation, using more robust algorithms, or accessing more data before making a prediction. The goal here is to be right from the outset rather than refining after the fact.
In practical terms:
Minimizing error can be computationally more efficient in the short term because the system only adjusts when there's a deviation. This is especially useful in dynamic environments where perfect predictions are challenging.
Maximizing correctness might require more resources upfront, as the system tries to get things right from the beginning. This can be effective in more stable environments where the parameters don't change as rapidly.
In many real-world scenarios, a balance between the two approaches is sought. For instance, in machine learning, training a model might be about maximizing correctness on the training data, but once the model is deployed in the real world, it needs to adapt to new data, which might be more about minimizing error.
It's also worth noting that, philosophically, the idea of "maximizing correctness" presupposes that there's a known and achievable "correct" state. In many complex systems, especially those dealing with human behavior, such a definitive correct state might not exist, making error minimization a more pragmatic approach.
The second sounds like choice theory by glasser which involves the construction of higher level models of idea worlds which he calls needs.
ChatGPT
Yes, Dr. William Glasser's "Choice Theory" (previously known as "Control Theory" and "Reality Therapy") does resonate with the idea of constructing higher-level models to guide behavior.
Choice Theory posits that:
Behavior is Chosen
: People always have a choice in how they behave. This choice is driven by internal motivations rather than external stimuli.
Basic Human Needs
: Glasser identifies five basic needs - survival, love and belonging, power, freedom, and fun. These are genetically driven and act as the foundation for our behaviors. These needs are conceptualized as internal "worlds" that individuals continually attempt to satisfy through their behaviors.
Current Behavior as the Best Choice
: According to Choice Theory, at any given moment, we are doing our best to satisfy these needs based on our current knowledge and skills.
Quality World
: Glasser introduced the concept of the "quality world," which is a mental picture of all the people, things, ideas, and ideals that we have discovered increase the quality of our lives. This world is subjective and unique to each individual.
Total Behavior
: Behavior is made up of four components - acting, thinking, feeling, and physiology. All these components are interconnected, and a change in one can affect the others.
In relation to the concept of "maximizing correctness," Glasser's model suggests that individuals are proactively trying to shape their behaviors based on their internal needs and the "quality world" they've constructed. They aren't just reacting to external stimuli or trying to minimize errors in their environment; they're actively striving to fulfill their needs based on their understanding of the world.
This proactive approach aligns with the idea of constructing higher-level models (in this case, the quality world and basic human needs) to guide and optimize behavior. The objective is not just to react to the environment but to act in ways that align with one's internal model of what is fulfilling and meaningful.
CHAPTER FOUR


HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS: EGYPT, BABYLON, INDIA AND GREECE


Ephraim-Stephen Essien



INTRODUCTION


Afrocentricism as pan-Africanism is a consciousness which seeks to apprehend world immanent reality from a purely African point of view. But this is unnecessarily dogmatic, for it closes our window to the rest of the world. Nonetheless, it has been founded that formal learning and civilization, as understood in Western orthodoxy, originated in Egypt. African scholars need not write apologies for these realities, for what is evident needs no evidence. Far from being an apologia, this chapter attempts to trace the origins of the discipline of mathematics from its ancient conceptions. Incidentally, Egypt remains the cradle of mathematics, and this is made evident in the works of the philosophers- Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle. Recourse is made in this paper to the existence of mathematics in Babylonia as well as India. Emphasis is, however placed on Egyptian mathematics, as this was the primary take-off point for the Greeks who systematized what they learnt from the mystery schools in Egypt. The systematization of mathematics by the Greeks developed the deductive system, which remains in se, mathematical, logical. While geometry, trigonometry and arithmetic were strongly founded by the ancients, algebra had to wait for some time for its proper establishment. Yet, this algebra had to be founded on ancient deductive logic, such that logic remains the foundation of mathematics.



The primordial history of mathematics entails an account of mathematics from its beginning. In other words, it traces the origin or beginning of mathematics. The history of mathematics in ancient time dates back to 2900 B.C., when Egyptian civilian reached its advanced stage.

Mathematics was developed in response to needs of early societies. With growing numbers of people living, working, and even fighting together came the need to solve practical problems of their civilization. There were such problems like calculating the quality of materials needed to build a store house or the amount of food needed for the army. Besides practical problems of mathematics were problems arising from religion, including geometric problems arising in the construction of altars and temples.

Many writers on the history of mathematics often ignore mentioning Africa, but world history correctly presented without bias would show that the Africans were learned in the field of mathematics like in other spheres of human endeavour (Alozie, 2001:10). For thousands of years, Africa was in the mainstream of mathematics history. This history began first with written numerical of Egypt, a culture whose African origin has been reaffirmed by recent discoveries in archaeology. Although almost all people have played a role in the history of mathematics, the contributions of Africa are still unacknowledged by western historians. This work seeks to trace the origin of mathematics to the Africa of the Nile, Egypt and to show how Africa bequeathed the mathematical legacy to the West through the Greeks.

The Babylonian and Indian origins of mathematics are also given a place in discourse. Thus, the first part of this work is all about the early origins of mathematics, talking its departure from Egypt. The second part is on Greek mathematics, the origin of the deductive system, Greek number system and Greek geometry are also discussed. The work concludes with the affirmation that the origin of mathematics is Africa and that mathematics reached Europe through the Greeks, who systematized mathematics.


Early mathematics

The earliest origins of mathematics are found in the early civilizations of Egypt, Babylonia, and India. That is why we wish to discuss the origins of mathematics of these early civilizations here.


Egypt

One of the earliest examples of writing were the hieroglyphs on Narmer's Pallette, named after the first king of upper and lower Egypt, who was also known as Menes. The numerical used cited thousands of heads of cattle and thousands of prisoners, indicating the numerical and hieroglyphs already had a long history in Egypt (Alan Gardiner, 1978:5). The early beginnings of algebra and geometry in ancient Egypt are briefly covered in many history books. But the full scope and depth of ancient Egyptian mathematics have been largely overlooked because of the first judgment of the European translators of the papyri who dismissed this mathematics as primitive.

As long as 2900 B.C. Egyptian civilization was advanced enough to be able to build one of the wonders of the world, the Great pyramids. No records of any mathematics of that time have been preserved. The main mathematical documents in existence refer to the period of the middle kingdom which spanned the years from about 2100 B.C. to 1800 B.C.

It is amazing that any documents at all remain from that period, and in fact, there are very few Egyptian mathematical texts. The only writings which have been preserved are those either purposely placed in tombs or were by some accident kept insulated from the elements for thousands of years. The Egyptians wrote on papyrus, a type of paper made from leaves that grew near the water. Being an organic substance, it would soon deteriorate if left to the elements. You can imagine what would happen to the pages of this paper on which I write in 6000 years, for instance, if nothing is done to preserve them. Therefore, it is lucky that some pieces of papyrus have remained as evidence of the extent to which the Egyptians had developed their knowledge of mathematics.

Hieroglyphics, the earliest Egyptian writings, are made up of pictorial characters, a picture possibly representing an object. A house, for instance, might have been represented by a picture of a house. Later the picture became simplified into a conventional sign which was easier to write but looked less like a house. The concept of numbers was also portrayed pictorially by hieroglyphics (Gittleman, 1975:2).

A main source of information on Egyptian mathematics is a papyrus brought by a Scottish Egyptologist, Rhind, in the nineteenth century, often referred to as the Rhind papyrus (Iroebgbu, 1994:124). It is also called the Ahmes Papyrus in honour of the scribe who wrote it. The Ahmes Papyrus was copied about 1650 B.C. from an older work of the middle kingdom and is a collection of solved problems used in a school for scribes (Gittleman, 1975:3). Then very few people could write. So, being a scribe was a revered profession, and this prestige earned the scribe a position close to the people in power. Scribes were afforded such respect that their profession was honoured by a famous stable of a scribe dated 2500 B.C. (Gittleman, 1975:3).

The great accuracy of the dimensions of the pyramids still gives rise to words. Geometry, literally, the measurement of the land (`Geos' and `metros', meaning `land' and `measurement' respectively) is a primordial mathematics. The Ancient Egyptian mathematics developed methods of measuring the land through formulas for the areas of rectangles, triangles, circles and even the area of a curved dome. It is not the case that the Egyptians systematized all of mathematics. They originated mathematics. For Herododtus, ���Egyptian geometry originated the need created by the annual overflow of the Nile to determine the boundaries of the lands owed by the farmers��� (Herodotus II, trans. George Rawlinson, 1956). However, they had their limitations. The limited Egyptian algebra employed practically no symbolism . In the Ahmes papyrus, addition and subtraction are represented respectively by the legs of a man coming and going, and the symbol is used to denote square root. The Egyptians did not separate arithmetic and geometry.

Our emphasis is that mathematics originated in Egypt. Plato, in the laws, reports a dialogue between Clinias and Athenian in which Plato admits and regrets that the Greeks were ignorant of mathematics, which young Egyptians learned at an early state. Onyewuenyi gives a representation of the dialogue.

The chapter you provided offers an in-depth look at the historical origins of mathematics, emphasizing the contributions of ancient civilizations, particularly Egypt. The Afrocentric perspective argues for the acknowledgment of Africa's foundational role in the history of mathematics, which has often been overlooked or downplayed in some Western narratives.
A few takeaways from the chapter include:
Afrocentricism and Mathematics
: The introduction establishes the perspective of Afrocentricism and its value in understanding the history of mathematics. It also states that while Afrocentricism has its merits, it shouldn't close off knowledge from other parts of the world.
Egypt as the Cradle of Mathematics
: The chapter presents evidence that Egypt was a significant player in the early history of mathematics. This is supported by references to famous philosophers like Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle, who were influenced by Egyptian mathematical concepts.
Egyptian Mathematical Documentation
: The mention of Narmer's Pallette and hieroglyphs indicates the ancient nature of Egyptian record-keeping and their advanced mathematical knowledge. The Rhind or Ahmes Papyrus serves as a vital artifact that sheds light on the mathematical prowess of ancient Egypt.
Significance of Geometry
: The construction of pyramids and the importance of land measurement highlight the role of geometry in ancient Egyptian society. The origins of the word "geometry" and its connection to land measurement further emphasize this point.
Greek Acknowledgment of Egyptian Mathematics
: The dialogue between Clinias and Athenian, as recounted by Plato, underlines the idea that even ancient Greeks recognized the importance and foundational role of Egyptian mathematics.
Other Civilizations
: While Egypt is the main focus, the chapter also acknowledges the contributions of Babylonia and India to the early history of mathematics. This suggests a holistic approach to understanding the origins of the subject.
This chapter encourages readers to appreciate the depth and breadth of ancient mathematical knowledge, particularly in Africa, and challenges narratives that may have marginalized these contributions. It provides a foundation for further exploration into the rich tapestry of mathematical history across different civilizations.
Athenian: ���Well, then, I maintain that free-born should learn of those various subjects as much as in Egypt is taught to vast numbers of children along with their letters. To begin with, lessons have been devised there in ciphering for the various children which they can learn with a good deal of fun and amusement, problems about the distribution of a fixed total number of apples and garlands among larger and small groups, and the arranging of a successive of `byes' and `pair' between boxers and wrestlers as the nature of such contests require��� In this way, they, as I was saying, incorporate the elementary application of arithmetic in the children's play, give the pupils a useful preparation for the dispositions, formations and movements of military life as well as for domestic management��� They then go on to exercises in measurement of lengths; surface and cubical content, by such they dispel the native and general, but ludicrous and shameful ignorance of mankind about the whole subject.


Clinias: And in what may this ignorance consist?


Athenian: ���My dear Clinias, when I was told, rather belatedly of our condition in this matter, like you, I was utterly astounded. Such ignorance seems to me more worthy of a stupid beast like the hog than of a human being, and I blushed not for myself alone but for our whole Hellenic world��� (Plato, The Laws, 819 B-E), in: (Onyewuenyi, 1994: 49-50).


���Let no one who has no sense of the mathematical come in here��� was the inscription at the entrance of Plato's Academy. Plato apparently refused Eudoxus entry into his Academy due to his lack of a sense of mathematics (Onyewuenyi, 51). Eudoxus had to proceed to Egypt to learn mathematics (Diogenes Lartius, Vo. 2, p. 401).

Aristotle consolidated this claim that mathematics originated in Egypt. This is found in his book, Metaphysics, where he says: ������the mathematical arts were founded in Egypt, for there the priestly caste was allowed to be at leisure��� (Metaphysics, Book 1 (A), 20).

The Egyptians had a well-developed mathematical tradition and were capable of solving many useful mathematical problems. Their ideas and techniques influenced later generations of mathematics. The doubling of a number, a basic step in the Egyptian method of multiplication, was one of the fundamental operations in many medieval arithmetic texts, although those texts also included more significant techniques learned from other peoples. That is why we need to consider the contribution of Babylonia and India.


Babylonia

Mesopotamia is the region between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers which is now known as Iraq. In other words, the Babylonian kingdom is the modern day Iraq. Since Babylon was such an important city in the area, primarily from 2000 B.C. to 600 B.C., the name Babylonia is also often applied to the entire region.

Cuneiform is to Babylonia as hieroglyphics is to Egypt. Babylonian writing, called cuneiform, is one of the oldest forms of writing. A rod, or stylus, was pressed into clay producing wedge-shapes, and the clay was then dried. This material was more durable than the papyrus which the Egyptians used. In the ruins of ancient Babylonian cities those clay tablets were naturally preserved by being buried. As a result, many thousands have been recovered, which only decompose when exposed to the air (Gittleman, 10). Most of the recovered tablets came from the old Babylonian period around the time of the great leader, Hammurabi (ca. 2100 B.C), or from the later Seleucive period (300 B.C), named after one of Alexander's generals (Gittleman, 10).

The Babylonians, in writing numbers, used a sexagesimal system (base 60) but with only two symbols. The wedge in one position gives V=1, turned sideways it gives < = 10. Any number up to 60 is written in a straight forward manner. For example, 32= <<<v the Babylonians based their system on 60 while modern day system is based on 10 (Gittleman, 10).


India

There was an early civilization in India, dating back to at least 3000 B.C. Written records from the early period are very scarce, however, because the Indians did not build large tombs like the Egyptians, in which documents were preserved. Again, the writings were not protected by being buried, as was the case with the Babylonian tablets.

Early mathematics in India was closely related to religious rites. A work called Sulvasutras (rules of the Cord) which contained many mathematical ideas was written in about 800-500 B.C (Gittleman, 17). In the Sulvasutras, one finds rules for constructing right-angled altars using a cord of length 8 and two pegs placed 4 units apart. In the Sulvasutras constructions of straight lines and circles are done with pegs and cords.

But the Indian geometry was replete with problems and difficulties. For example, there was the problem of increasing the size of the altar while maintaining its shape. There were problems of constructing a circular altar which had the same area as a given square altar. Constructing a rectangle equal in area to a given square is another problem mentioned in the Sulvasutras (see Seidenberg, A., ���The Ritual Origin of Geometry,��� pp. 517-18).

Inter alia, Egyptian mathematics predates the other two in this discussion. Yet the origin of mathematics is traced to Greece by Westerners. Let us now discuss Greek mathematics and how it borrowed from Egypt.



Greek Mathematics


By 700 B.C, the Greek culture extended from mainland Greece to the islands in the Aegean Sea and to the west coast of what is now Turkey. Trade was expanding, and Miletus, a city on the coast of Turkey, was an important Greek trading centre in the growing empire.

Homer and Hesiod had, earlier, described the origin of the world in human terms and presented a mythological origin of the universe. By the 6th century B.C., nonetheless, philosophers began to give natural explanations of creation. They suggested that everything was made of a combination of any or all of the four basic elements: water, air, earth and fire.

In an exclusive history of Greek mathematics, there are certain names or personalities which must not be left out, such as Thales, Pythagoras, Zeno, Hippocrates of Chios (not the Hippocrates of the Hippocratic Oath who was from Cos), Plato, Eudoxus, Euclid, Eratosthenes, Archimedes, Apollonius, and Ptolemy. But suffice it to say that ours is not to exhaust an analytic of Greek mathematics. We rather wish to say that all classical Greek mathematicians, some of whom are mentioned above, drew their mathematical knowledge from ancient Egypt.


Thales (600 B.C.)

Thales of Miletus is the first figure of importance in Greek mathematics. Thales was among the people who were thinking about the nature of the world. He was the first known Greek philosopher who said that water is the basic principle underlying everything in nature.

Being a trader, he had contacts in his travels with Egyptian and Babylonian scholars. He probably organized some of the known facts of geometry which he learned from them, but was not content with mere facts. Being a thinker he was capable of abstraction. Among the few propositions that Thales is credited with are the following:


The angles at the base of isosceles triangles are equal.

Any circle is bisected by its diameter.


His notion of proof was probably that of intuitive visualization, reminiscent of the Egyptian proof of the area of an isosceles triangle by breaking it into two right angle triangles and recombining them into a rectangle to show the method (Gittleman 27).


Pythagoras

Pythagoras of Samos was one of the most important figures in the history of science. He not only influenced Plato, but also other philosophers and scientists up to the time of the Renaissance.

Pythagoras went to Egypt and Asia, learning about their cultures, through his travels. He was aware of many mystery rites, and he undoubtedly became familiar with religious rituals and their connection with number lore and geometrical rules. The cultures of these civilizations obviously impressed Pythagoras, and he assimilated some of their beliefs into his own philosophies while rejecting others.

He returned from his journeys with his newly acquired wisdom and founded a brotherhood of believers, the Order of Pythagoreans. In contrast to some Greek cults, which believed in ecstasy as a means of purification, the Pythagoreans believed that the contemplation of geometric form and numerical relations gave spiritual release. Music had always been thought to be a means of giving release, of purging the soul, and the Pythagoreans found that numbers underlay the harmony of music. For example, when a string is shortened to half its length the tone produced when it is plucked is an octave higher. It gives a 2:1 ratio.

The Pythagoreans felt that it was harmony which united the diverse aspect of segments into a whole. Harmony consists of numerical ratios. Thus, in a way, it is numerical ratios of things which determine what they are and relate them to each other. That the Pythagoreans tried to understand the world through numbers is a very significant fact. Only in Western world did modern science develop and the Pythagoreans initiated that development because of their beliefs concerning number.

Greek Mathematics (Continued)
Euclid
Euclid, often referred to as the "father of geometry," lived in Alexandria around 300 B.C. Although not much is known about his life, his work, particularly the book "Elements," had a profound influence on mathematics. This book, which consists of thirteen books, covers topics ranging from plane geometry to number theory. It systematized and organized much of the mathematical knowledge that existed up until his time.
Euclid's ���Elements��� showcased the Greek method of proving mathematical theorems deductively, starting from a set of clearly stated axioms. While it's unclear how much of the material in the "Elements" originated with Euclid himself, he certainly brought together and systematized the work of many previous mathematicians.
Eudoxus, a predecessor to Euclid, also contributed significantly to Greek mathematics, particularly in the realm of proportions and the concept of magnitude. He developed a method to handle irrational numbers, which was incorporated into Book V of Euclid���s "Elements."
Archimedes
Archimedes of Syracuse (287-212 B.C.) is another colossal figure in ancient Greek mathematics and engineering. He is known for his discoveries in hydrostatics, especially the Archimedes Principle, which states that a body immersed in fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. Archimedes also made significant contributions to geometry, especially the calculation of areas and volumes of geometric shapes.
Conclusion
It's clear that Greek mathematics was influenced significantly by other ancient cultures, particularly that of Egypt and Babylonia. However, what set the Greeks apart was their systematic approach and emphasis on deductive reasoning. While they borrowed and learned from previous civilizations, they also added, refined, and organized knowledge in a way that laid the foundations for subsequent mathematical development.
Historically, the West has often highlighted the contributions of Greece while downplaying those of other ancient cultures. Yet, it's important to recognize that mathematics, like all human endeavors, is a collective enterprise. Every civilization built upon the achievements of those that came before, and the Greeks were no exception. Their genius lay in synthesizing, refining, and advancing the mathematical knowledge they inherited from their predecessors.
The  Pythagoreans applied their theories of numbers to points, lines, and planes. They made an assumption which appears very plausible, namely, that given any two lines there is a unit (perhaps small) which goes evenly into both of them an integral number of times. It was thought that for any two lines such a unit could be found and two lines with this property are called commensurable. They used this assumption of commensurability in their reasoning about geometry. This way their philosophy that ���all is number��� was maintained, so it proved to be a great crisis for their school when they found that this theory was not true in all cases. Thus, given a square, the side and diagonal are incommensurable.

They had to reject many of their application of numbers to geometry due to the proof of incommensurability. However, they maintained that, in any right triangle the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the opposite and adjacent, a2=b2+c2. This is called the Pythagorean theorem.

Some of the Pythagorean concepts have been preserved in Euclid's Elements. Theorems 21-34 and Theorem 36 of Book IX have been shown to be the oldest parts of the Elements and are Pythagorean in origin. For example,


Theorem IX.21 `A sum of even number is even'.

Theorem IX.27 `Odd less odd is even'.


Zeno

Some scholars believe that Zeno had great influence on mathematics with his arguments. Zeno was a disciple of Parmenides of Elea whose followers formed a school of philosophers, the Eleatics. Zeno gave brilliant argument criticizing views of other philosophers, especially the Pythagoreans, showing that the other person's hypothesis led to two contradictory conclusions.

His paradoxes were quite amusing and have influenced thought to this day. Imagine a race between the swift Achilles and a slow tortoise where Achilles is pursuing the tortoise. Because he is a fast runner, Achilles gives the tortoise a head start. Zeno argues that runner, Achilles, cannot ever overtake the tortoise and that logically the tortoise will always be ahead. The distance between Achilles and the tortoise will always be divisible and no point can be reached before the previous point has been reached, and the effect is that there can be no motion at all. Against the Pythagoreans, Zeno argued that there is no motion.

Does an arrow move when the archer shoots it at the target? Here, again, the Pythagoreans, who had argued the reality of space, and, therefore, of its divisibility, would have to say that the arrow must occupy a particular position in space. But for an arrow to occupy a position in a space equal to its length is precisely what is meant when one says that the arrow is at rest. Since the arrow must always occupy a position in space equal to its length, the arrow must always be at rest. Moreover, since any quality is infinitely divisible, the space occupied by the arrow is infinite and as such it must coincide with everything else, in which case everything must be one instead of many. There is no space, motion is an illusion, Zeno argues ( see Stumpf, 19-20).

A new crisis had arisen for the Pythagoreans, because another of their basic notions had apparently been proven false. They could not consider a line to be made up of points, because then they would have to respond to the argument that a shorter line having just as many point as a longer line was, in fact, equal to it. Rather than give up the study of geometry, the Pythagoreans refused to consider a line as made up of points, and they accepted the common notion that the whole is greater than the part. The Eleatic's arguments influenced the Pythagoreans to adopt axioms rather than abandon their ideas. Therefore, a possible explanation for the development of propositions which were accepted as self-evident truth is that the Eleatics forced the Pythagoreans to adopt as axioms statements in which they believe despite the argument of the Eleatics against them.


Euclidean Geometry

The school of Alexandria marked a new period in the history of mathematics. Alexander the Great had conquered much of the known world, and Greeks settled in these conquered territories. In Egypt, Alexander named a city after himself, Alexandria, and a school was founded in Alexandria which was perhaps one of the greatest in ancient times. The school existed for about 800 years, from 300 B.C. to A.D. 500. During this period Alexandria was the center of mathematics.

Euclid, who lived in Alexandria, wrote The Elements. His Elements had dominated the study of geometry every since it was written. Euclid organized the material already available using his own methods where appropriate. The Elements, as indicated by the title, covers fundamental topics in mathematics from several areas. Euclid's work is really the first systematic Greek mathematics to survive. Greek views of mathematics, particularly geometry, were summarized in Euclid's Elements.

Euclid divided the laws of geometry into two. On the one hand, there is a small group of laws which need not be proved, but which are adopted as basic premises. These he calls `postulates'. These laws are about lines, angles, figures. On the other hand, there is an indefinitely large group of laws each of which is provable by an appeal to the basic premises. These are called theorems. It is thinkable that if a basic truth is not particularized to a discipline, that is, if it is a general truth (common notion), it becomes an axiom.

The Elements is divided into 13 books, similar to chapters. Five postulates, five common notions and forty eight theorems are given in book 1, some of which are given below.

A point is that which has no parts (it has no magnitude or size).

A line is that which has a breadth and length (has no thickness or width, it extends indefinitely in two directions).

A straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself.

A surface is that which has length and breadth only.

A plane surface is a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines or itself (a table - top, a page in a book).

When a straight line setup on another straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is called right and the straight line standing on the other is called perpendicular to it.

A plain angle is the inclination to one another of two lines in a plane that meets one another and do not lie in a straight line.

A figure is that which is contained by any boundary or boundaries.

A circle is a plane figure contained by one line such that all the straight lines failing upon it form one point among those lying within the figure are equal to one another.

Parallel straight lines are straight lines which being in the same plane and being produced indefinitely in both directions do not meet one another in either direction.

The five axioms are:

Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to other.

If equals are added to equals, the sums are equal.

If equals are subtracted from equal, the remainders are equal

Figures which coincide with one another are equal.

The whole is greater than any of its parts.

The five postulates of Euclid's geometry are as follows:

Two points determine one and only one straight line.

A straight line extends indefinitely far in either of the directions.

A circle can be drawn with any given centre and any given radius.

All right angles are equal to one another.

If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than the two right angles.

Post Euclidean mathematics

There is much history concerning the fifth postulate, designated ���the parallel postulate���. Postulate five brought a lot of controversy in mathematics. Attempts to solve this controversy opened the way to non-Euclidian geometry, which is associated with Girolamo Sachieri, Karl Gauss, Lobachevsky, Janos Bolyai, and Reimann.

So far, we have been discussing Greek mathematics, especially geometry. Besides those discussed extensively, we have to mention that:

Eratosthenes developed the prime numbers and calculated the circumference of the earth.

Besides the buoyancy principle in physics,

Archimedes was concerned with the problem involving the ratio of the volume of a cone, hemisphere and a cylinder. He discovered the 1:2:3 ratio. He also developed a method for finding an approximation for ��, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

Apollonius was concerned particularly with cones. The names Apollonius gave to conic sections are ���ellipse���, ���parabola���, and ���hyperbole���.

In modern physics, we see the significance of the buoyancy principle of Archimedes. The importance of Apollonius' conics is also found in the physics of projectiles and in new approaches to the motion of planets. It was discovered that planets move in elliptical orbits (John Kepler), and that a projectile follows the path of a parabola. Conic sections have become practical in optics and in the analysis of maximum and minimum problems in engineering (Gittleman,75).

Ptolemy is mostly associated with trigonometry and astronomy. He developed the geometrical theory of epicycles and the doctrine of geocentricism (a theory which upholds that the earth is the center of the universe), its opposite being heliocentricism (a theory by Nicholas Copernicus, upholding the thesis that the sun is at the center of the universe).


Evaluation and conclusion

How wonderful these Greeks were! In our cursory study of Greek mathematics, we realized that modern mathematics and physics could be traced to their systems: the area of an isosceles triangle in Thales, Pythagoras theorem, infinite space in the Eleatics, Euclidean geometry, perfect number (Pythagorean), prime number of Erathosthenes, Archimedes' principle, 1:2:3 ratio and volumes of the three solids, conic sections, and projectiles of Apollonius, trigonometry, etc. They did all these. Yet, their mathematical studies were done in Egypt. That is to say, some studied in any of the mystery schools at Hermpolas, Heliopolis, Thebes and Memphis. Others studied at Alexanderia.

Thales and Pythagoras laid the foundation for other Greeks to study mathematics. It was shown above how Aristotle in the Metaphysics and Plato in the Laws acknowledged the primacy of Egypt as the home of mathematics. Thales was the Greek pupil of the Egyptians and after his return he introduced geometry in Greece (Kirk and Raven, 1988:76). Pythagoras was a disciple of Thales. Pythagoras learned from Thales. He also stayed for twenty two years in Egyptian temples in order to learn mathematics (Onyewuenyi, 50). Mathematics comes from the Greek word `mathemata', which means things learned or learnable. `Mathemata' involved arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy. From all these, one can conveniently say that Egypt is the birthplace of mathematics. However, the core point is this: that mathematics is founded on the logic of deduction.
ChatGPT
Summary:
The Greeks, particularly Pythagoreans, believed in the fundamental role of numbers in understanding the universe. They initially assumed that all lines were commensurable, but eventually discovered the concept of incommensurability, which posed a crisis to their mathematical worldview. Zeno of Elea introduced paradoxes that challenged basic notions of motion, forcing the Pythagoreans to revise their understanding and adopt axioms.
Euclid, working in the great school of Alexandria, laid down the foundation of Euclidean geometry in his work "The Elements." He established postulates, theorems, and axioms that defined the framework of geometry. The fifth postulate, concerning parallel lines, became a major point of debate and later led to the development of non-Euclidean geometry.
Several other Greek mathematicians made significant contributions. Eratosthenes explored prime numbers, Archimedes worked on the principles of buoyancy and volume ratios, and Apollonius introduced the names of conic sections that are still in use today. Ptolemy contributed to trigonometry and defended the geocentric model of the universe.
In conclusion, the Greeks made remarkable advancements in the realm of mathematics and their legacy has profoundly influenced modern mathematical thought. Notably, many of these Greeks studied in Egypt, indicating that Egypt played a pivotal role in the early development of mathematics. The systematic approach to math and its foundational reliance on logic and deduction remain enduring contributions of the ancient Greeks.

An essay on these topics, titled "critiques of anarcho-primitivism"
ChatGPT
Critiques of Anarcho-Primitivism
Anarcho-primitivism is a radical socio-political ideology that advocates for a return to a pre-industrial, often pre-agricultural, way of life. It is underpinned by a critique of civilization itself, with proponents arguing that many of the ills of modern society, from environmental degradation to social alienation, can be traced back to the advent of large-scale societies and technological advancements. While this perspective raises valid concerns about the pitfalls of modernity, it is not without its own critiques. By examining the aforementioned concepts���ranging from the nature of science to the philosophy of knowledge���one can draw insights into the limitations and challenges of the anarcho-primitivist view.
Compatibility Theory and Anarcho-Primitivism
: At its core, anarcho-primitivism contends that human beings and technological civilization are fundamentally incompatible. However, as the compatibility theory suggests, entities with differing characteristics can coexist without inherent conflict. Throughout history, humans have integrated various levels of technology into their lives without necessarily compromising their well-being or the environment. The challenge lies in finding the balance.
Historical Analysis
: While anarcho-primitivists romanticize pre-agricultural societies, historical examination shows that such societies had their own challenges, from food scarcity to conflicts over resources. Moreover, the delineation between 'civilized' and 'primitive' is not as clear-cut; various societies have existed on a spectrum with diverse social structures and technologies.
Philosophical Critique
: Anarcho-primitivism���s rejection of all forms of structured knowledge systems���like science���undermines its own position. Philosophy, with its emphasis on critical thinking, highlights the need for a nuanced understanding. Dismissing the entirety of modern knowledge systems is an oversimplification.
The Wisdom of Ancient Greek Mathematics
: Ancient civilizations, like the Greeks, demonstrate that structured societies and advanced knowledge are not inherently harmful. Greek mathematical innovations didn't detract from their connection to nature or the human experience but enriched it.
Understanding Science and Its Goals
: Science, often criticized by anarcho-primitivists for propelling harmful technologies, is a tool. Its goal, at its core, is understanding. The misuse of scientific discoveries is a societal issue, not a flaw in the scientific method itself.
Cognitive and Behavioral Insights
: Cognitive theories, like the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis, show that humans have evolved to adapt and predict their environment. This adaptability suggests that the problem isn't technology or civilization per se but how they are integrated and used. Glasser���s Choice Theory further indicates that humans have basic needs that must be met���needs that can be addressed in various societal structures, not just primitive ones.
In conclusion, while anarcho-primitivism raises essential points about the drawbacks of unchecked technological advancement and the loss of a deep connection with nature, a blanket rejection of civilization and its benefits is not the solution. A nuanced understanding, drawing from history, philosophy, and cognitive sciences, suggests that the challenge is to harness the best of both worlds, respecting our primitive roots while mindfully engaging with the modern world.
A few illustrative examples
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's delve into some illustrative examples to illuminate the critiques of anarcho-primitivism.
Compatibility Theory and the Amish
: The Amish communities in the U.S. are an example of people integrating certain modern conveniences into their lives while still largely living without technology. They have found a balance that respects their traditional values without entirely rejecting the modern world. This challenges the anarcho-primitivist view that humans and technology are wholly incompatible.
Historical Nuances with the San People
: Often idealized by anarcho-primitivists, the San people of Southern Africa have lived as hunter-gatherers for millennia. However, even they have experienced challenges such as territorial disputes and environmental changes. Their adaptability in using both ancient and modern knowledge to navigate these challenges shows that 'primitive' societies had their own complexities.
Philosophical Dilemmas in Buddhism
: Buddhist philosophies, while emphasizing simplicity and detachment from materialism, also promote the Middle Way���not veering to extremes. This resonates with the idea that rejecting all of modernity might be as unbalanced as unchecked technological consumption.
Ancient Greek Water Clocks
: The Greeks' invention of the clepsydra, or water clock, is a testament to their innovative spirit. They harnessed their mathematical knowledge not to dominate nature but to understand and work in harmony with it. Such inventions enhanced their civilization without disconnecting them from the natural world.
Science and the Polio Vaccine
: Anarcho-primitivists often critique science for leading to harmful technologies. However, science has also given us life-saving innovations, such as the polio vaccine. Before its invention, polio crippled thousands. The vaccine's development wasn't a detraction from nature but a boon for human well-being.
Choice Theory and Modern Work Structures
: With the rise of remote work and flexible schedules, modern society reflects Glasser's Choice Theory by allowing individuals to cater to their basic needs better. People can now balance work, relationships, and personal freedom more efficiently than in rigid, traditional work setups.
These examples shed light on the multifaceted relationship between humans, their environment, and their creations. They also emphasize the need for a balanced perspective, rather than an absolute rejection or acceptance of a given ideology.
Tie in relevant topics from The shock of the old and the ingenuity gap
ChatGPT
Certainly! "The Shock of the Old" by David Edgerton and "The Ingenuity Gap" by Thomas Homer-Dixon both offer valuable insights that can be woven into the tapestry of critiques against anarcho-primitivism.
"The Shock of the Old"
challenges the conventional wisdom that focuses on the innovation of new technologies, instead shining a light on the enduring use of older technologies. Edgerton���s examination of the persistent relevance and importance of older technologies suggests that technological progress is not linear, but multifaceted.
Example:
The continued use of horses in certain agricultural contexts, even after the widespread adoption of the automobile and tractor, demonstrates that older technologies can still have a place in a modernizing world. This challenges the anarcho-primitivist view that there is a dichotomy between primitive and modern, suggesting instead that various technologies can coexist and remain functional in different contexts.
"The Ingenuity Gap"
posits that as global problems become more complex, the gap between the problems we create and our capacity to solve them widens. This perspective critiques both the unchecked progressivism of technophiles and the idealized primitivism of anarcho-primitivists.
Example:
Climate change is a complex challenge stemming from various technological and societal advancements. While anarcho-primitivism might argue for a complete reversion to pre-technological ways to counter this, the nuanced solution lies in leveraging both old and new know-hows���like integrating indigenous practices of land conservation with modern sustainable technology.
Interweaving these themes, it becomes clear that both unchecked faith in new technology and an idealized nostalgia for pre-technological times are oversimplified views. A balanced understanding acknowledges the enduring utility of old technologies, the potential dangers of unchecked innovation, and the necessity of creative problem-solving to bridge the ingenuity gap. This mosaic of perspectives offers a more holistic critique against the extremes of anarcho-primitivism, suggesting a more nuanced relationship between humanity, technology, and nature.
I wanted to build a geometry based on swinging rocks to make music and hitting stones to make sounds with resonant acoustic properties

To create a controlled swinging motion, consider using pendulums. The length of the pendulum arm and the weight of the rock will affect the speed and force of the swing.
You can adjust the length of the pendulum to alter the rhythm or speed of the swing.
3. Resonant Chambers:
To amplify the sound, consider placing the stones above resonant chambers, like hollow wooden or metal boxes. The size and material of these chambers will impact the acoustic properties.
You can adjust the size or shape of these chambers to fine-tune the resonance and volume.
4. Geometry and Arrangement:
Design a grid or pattern for the arrangement of rocks and stones based on their tonal qualities, from lowest to highest pitch or in any pattern you prefer.
Ensure that the rocks and stones are spaced out enough so they don't collide unless that's an intended part of your design.
5. Playing the Instrument:
The instrument can be played by setting the rocks in motion and allowing them to swing and hit stationary stones or other objects.
Alternatively, use mallets or hands to strike the rocks, creating patterns of rhythm and melody.
Experiment with different striking points on the rocks for varied tonal effects.
6. Integration with Technology (Optional):
You can enhance the instrument by integrating microphones or contact mics. These can pick up the sound directly from the rocks and stones, allowing for amplification or electronic manipulation.
Software can be used to loop, layer, or process the sounds in real time, adding depth and texture to the acoustic sounds.
