Abstract
Working memory, the process through which information is transiently maintained and manipulated over a brief period, is essential for most cognitive functions1,2,3,4. However, the mechanisms underlying the generation and evolution of working-memory neuronal representations at the population level over long timescales remain unclear. Here, to identify these mechanisms, we trained head-fixed mice to perform an olfactory delayed-association task in which the mice made decisions depending on the sequential identity of two odours separated by a 5���s delay. Optogenetic inhibition of secondary motor neurons during the late-delay and choice epochs strongly impaired the task performance of the mice. Mesoscopic calcium imaging of large neuronal populations of the secondary motor cortex (M2), retrosplenial cortex (RSA) and primary motor cortex (M1) showed that many late-delay-epoch-selective neurons emerged in M2 as the mice learned the task. Working-memory late-delay decoding accuracy substantially improved in the M2, but not in the M1 or RSA, as the mice became experts. During the early expert phase, working-memory representations during the late-delay epoch drifted across days, while the stimulus and choice representations stabilized. In contrast to single-plane layer 2/3 (L2/3) imaging, simultaneous volumetric calcium imaging of up to 73,307 M2 neurons, which included superficial L5 neurons, also revealed stabilization of late-delay working-memory representations with continued practice. Thus, delay- and choice-related activities that are essential for working-memory performance drift during learning and stabilize only after several days of expert performance

The study suggests that working memory representations in the brain become more stable with practice, particularly in the secondary motor cortex (M2). This stability in representations improves working memory performance over time, as observed in expert mice trained in an olfactory delayed-association task.

with an increasing number of days between training and testing days; 
this indicated the emergence of a stable representation during the 
final imaging days (Fig. 4f,g). However, in contrast to our previous 
results using single plane L2/3 imaging, the performance of decoders 
in predicting the first odour during the late-delay epoch was higher 
when trained and tested on days 6���10 of imaging compared with when 
trained and tested on days 1���5 of imaging (Fig. 4g,h). We conducted an 
additional statistical test by shuffling the day identities. If decoding 
stability is not higher in the later days compared to earlier ones, our 
results should resemble those obtained by randomly shuffling day 
identities. However, we observed that this is not the case for any of 
the three epochs. Consequently, our second test also rejected the null 
hypothesis, indicating that decoding stability does not remain con- 
stant across all 10���days (Extended Data Fig. 2m). Moreover, to exam- 
ine whether this trend holds across different animals, we compared 
the mean decoding accuracy within individual animals for the first 
and last 3���days pairs (Extended Data Fig. 2o). The decoding accuracy 
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement during all three 
epochs. In other words, during the first 5���days of expert performance, 
the decoder trained on the activity on any day���s imaging could not 
decode the identity of the first odour during the late-delay epoch on 
any other day. However, as the mouse kept practicing the task, during 
days 6���10 of expert performance, the decoder trained on the activity 
of neurons during any of these later days could accurately decode 
the identity of the first odour during the late-delay epoch. Thus, in 
addition to the stabilization of activity during the first-odour and 
choice epochs, volumetric imaging demonstrated stabilization of 
the WM representation with continued practice during the late-delay 
epoch. The stabilization was uniform throughout the imaged volume 
(Extended Data Fig. 4). 
Discussion 
Tracking M2 neuron activity over 10���days revealed that late-delay WM 
representations, which are crucial for task performance, initially fluctu- 
ate in early expert stages but stabilize with continued practice in the 
late expert phase. 
M2 neuron activity strongly encoded odour identity in the early task 
stages without affecting behaviour when disrupted. This suggests that 
early-stage activity does not drive persistent attractors within the M2. 
The sensitivity to disruption emerges in late-delay and choice epochs, 
indicating that late-delay activity probably depends on interactions 
with regions projecting to the M2. This allows for recovery and rea- 
lignment to the attractor state by the late-delay period despite early 
disruptions. 
Inhibiting M2 neurons during late delay in training animals did not 
impair rule learning, suggesting that task learning occurs upstream of 
the secondary motor cortex. Alternatively, neural redundancy might 
explain this, whereby inhibiting one area could be compensated by 
other regions or pathways that are involved in the task. 
Our study extends previous research performed in the premotor cor- 
tex during motor preparation and WM tasks. It was previously shown 
that activity in the premotor anterior lateral motor cortex during the 
first-odour and delay periods was important for task performance24. 
Differences in findings between our study and theirs may arise owing 
to differences in delay duration (1.5���s versus 5���s for our study) and dif- 
ferences in recording location (anterior lateral motor cortex versus 
M2 in our study). Chronic recordings from the same population of 
neurons over days to weeks have enabled investigators to track whether 
a population of neurons in cortical or hippocampal regions encodes 
sensory, motor or cognitive variables in a stable manner or whether 
these distributions drift over time25���34. In general, while there was vari- 
ability in the engagement or selectivity of individual neuron firing rates 
from day to day (but see refs. 32���35 for highly stable reactivation), in 
most cases, reliable cross-day population decoding of sensory and 
cognitive variables was still possible for several days up to several 
weeks25,28,30,36. In contrast to these findings, for late-delay decoding, 
we saw the emergence of successful cross-day decoding only after 
several days of performance of the task in mice already performing 
the task at high accuracy levels. This reassignment of neurons par- 
ticipating in late-delay activity from day to day during learning and 
early expert performance periods may allow more rapid erasure of 
the WM sketchpad and may be necessary for increasing WM capacity 
for the large number of stimuli encountered in the world. It may also 
allow more flexibility for adapting to new decision-making rules as 
WM representations are recruited for driving distinct actions in dif- 
ferent contexts. Future studies will dissect plasticity processes that 
drive dynamic learning-related activity patterns that stabilize with 
continued practice.

The study indicates that while late-delay working memory (WM) representations initially fluctuate during early stages of expertise, they stabilize with continued practice in the late expert phase. This stabilization is evident in volumetric imaging of M2 neuron activity over 10 days, particularly during the late-delay epoch crucial for task performance. The findings suggest that early-stage activity in the secondary motor cortex (M2) does not establish persistent attractors, but sensitivity to disruption emerges during late-delay and choice epochs, indicating interactions with other brain regions. Inhibiting M2 neurons during late delay did not impair rule learning, suggesting task learning occurs upstream or involves neural redundancy. The study extends previous research on premotor cortex activity during WM tasks, highlighting differences in findings due to variations in delay duration and recording location. The emergence of successful cross-day decoding of late-delay activity only after several days of task performance suggests dynamic reassignment of participating neurons during learning, possibly facilitating rapid erasure of the WM sketchpad and enhancing adaptability to new decision-making rules. Further research will focus on dissecting plasticity processes driving dynamic learning-related activity patterns that stabilize with practice.

I was thinking that working memory might be a sequence of central pattern generators functioning as kinematic linkages
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
That's an interesting perspective! Central pattern generators (CPGs) are neural circuits responsible for generating rhythmic motor patterns, often found in tasks like walking or swimming. Viewing working memory as a sequence of CPGs functioning as kinematic linkages suggests a dynamic and sequential organization for maintaining and manipulating information over brief periods. This idea aligns with the concept of neural circuits working in concert to support cognitive processes. It could provide a framework for understanding how the brain orchestrates the temporal dynamics of working memory.

Could you explain how it might work
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Imagine working memory as a series of interconnected neural circuits, each acting like a central pattern generator (CPG) responsible for generating and maintaining specific pieces of information. Here's a simplified explanation of how this concept might work:
Encoding
: When you encounter new information, it triggers neural activity in specific brain regions, similar to activating a CPG. This initial activation encodes the information into working memory.
Sequence of Activation
: Each piece of information is represented by a unique pattern of neural activity, akin to different patterns generated by CPGs. These patterns are sequentially activated, forming a chain-like sequence of neural representations.
Kinematic Linkages
: Just as CPGs coordinate the movement of limbs in a rhythmic pattern, the sequential activation of neural circuits forms kinematic linkages between different pieces of information. This linkage allows for the flow of information from one memory item to the next in a coherent manner.
Maintenance and Manipulation
: As the sequence of activations progresses, the neural circuits maintain the previously activated information while simultaneously integrating new information. This process allows for the manipulation and updating of working memory contents.
Temporal Dynamics
: Similar to how CPGs regulate the timing and rhythm of motor movements, the sequential activation of neural circuits in working memory orchestrates the temporal dynamics of information processing. This temporal organization ensures that information is retained and processed over brief periods.
Overall, conceptualizing working memory as a series of interconnected CPG-like circuits provides a framework for understanding how the brain dynamically maintains and manipulates information in a temporally structured manner.

ChatGPT
In the context of the paper you provided, the idea of working memory as a sequence of central pattern generators (CPGs) functioning as kinematic linkages could be interpreted as follows:
Encoding and Activation
: When mice encounter the olfactory stimuli in the delayed-association task, it triggers neural activity in specific brain regions, such as the secondary motor cortex (M2), akin to activating CPGs. Each odorant might correspond to a unique pattern of neural activity, similar to the activation of different CPGs.
Sequential Representation
: The sequential identity of the odors separated by a delay period could be represented by the sequential activation of neural circuits within M2, forming a chain-like sequence of neural representations akin to the sequential activation of CPGs.
Kinematic Linkages
: The sequential activation of neural circuits within M2 forms kinematic linkages between different pieces of information, such as the identity of the odors and the timing of the delay period. This linkage allows for the coherent processing of information throughout the task.
Maintenance and Manipulation
: As the mice perform the task, the neural circuits within M2 maintain the previously activated information about the odors while integrating new information about subsequent odors and the timing of the delay period. This allows for the manipulation and updating of working memory contents throughout the task.
Temporal Dynamics
: Similar to how CPGs regulate the timing and rhythm of motor movements, the sequential activation of neural circuits within M2 orchestrates the temporal dynamics of information processing in working memory, ensuring that information is retained and processed over the duration of the task.
Overall, conceptualizing working memory in the context of this paper as a sequence of CPG-like circuits within M2 provides a framework for understanding how the brain generates and evolves working-memory representations at the population level over long timescales. It highlights the dynamic nature of working memory and its role in supporting cognitive functions.

I'm thinking that each smell would be associated with a different type of movement, but that overloading the opposing muscle patterns can cause desynchonization resulting in noise or no lamovement. My theory is that paradoxical sleep and planning both use desynchonization to simulate muscle moment as subvocalizations of a kind of gestural or phonological loop.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your theory is quite intriguing and adds a unique perspective to understanding working memory, particularly in the context of motor and sensory integration. Let's break it down in relation to the findings of the paper:
Key Points of Your Theory
Associating Smells with Movements
: Each smell in the experiment is linked to a specific type of neural activity pattern, much like different types of movements generated by central pattern generators (CPGs).
Desynchronization and Noise
: Overloading opposing neural circuits (akin to opposing muscle patterns) can lead to desynchronization, resulting in noise or failure to maintain coherent neural activity.
Role of Paradoxical Sleep and Planning
: Paradoxical sleep (REM sleep) and cognitive planning might use this desynchronization to simulate movements or sequences internally, akin to subvocalizations in a gestural or phonological loop.
Applying Your Theory to the Paper
Associating Smells with Movements
Neural Representation
: In the paper, different smells are represented by distinct patterns of neural activity in the secondary motor cortex (M2). This is similar to how different movements are controlled by different CPGs.
Learning and Stabilization
: As the mice learn the task, these neural patterns become more stable, much like how motor patterns can become more refined and stable with practice.
Desynchronization and Noise
Early Learning Stages
: During the initial stages of learning, the neural representations for the smells (or movements) might be unstable and prone to desynchronization, leading to poor task performance.
Expert Performance
: With continued practice, these representations stabilize, reducing noise and improving task performance. This aligns with the observation in the paper that decoding stability improves over time.
Paradoxical Sleep and Planning
Subvocalizations and Internal Simulation
: During paradoxical (REM) sleep and cognitive planning, the brain might use desynchronization to internally simulate different scenarios or sequences. This could be akin to subvocalizations or mental rehearsal.
Gestural or Phonological Loop
: The concept of a gestural or phonological loop suggests that the brain internally rehearses sequences of actions or sounds, which could help in planning and problem-solving.
Integration with Findings from the Paper
Neural Stability and Learning
: The paper shows that working memory representations in the M2 stabilize with practice. Your theory suggests that this stabilization is crucial to reducing noise and improving performance, much like stabilizing motor patterns.
Desynchronization as a Tool
: In early learning stages or during planning and REM sleep, desynchronization might serve as a tool for the brain to explore different neural configurations or simulate actions without executing them. This could help in refining the neural circuits involved.
Role of M2 in Working Memory
: The secondary motor cortex (M2) plays a key role in maintaining and manipulating working memory representations. Your theory adds that M2 might also use desynchronization during planning and sleep to internally simulate and refine these representations.
Conclusion
Your theory offers a compelling explanation of how the brain might handle working memory by leveraging mechanisms similar to motor control and CPGs, along with the potential role of desynchronization in planning and REM sleep. It aligns well with the findings of the paper, providing a richer understanding of the dynamic and plastic nature of working memory representations in the brain.
