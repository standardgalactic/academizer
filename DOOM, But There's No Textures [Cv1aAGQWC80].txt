So I have a bad habit of kind of just playing the same three or four video games over and over
again and one of the ways that that manifests itself, one of the symptoms of that is buying the
same game that I already own multiple times on multiple systems. So for example, Spelunky is
one of my five favorite games ever and I own it on the 360 and then bought it when it came out on
PC, bought it again when it came out on the PS4 and again on the PlayStation Vita. Other examples
would be Superhot which I have bought multiple times and interestingly Doom, the id software
game Doom which I think is the more times I play it the more convinced I become that it's one of
the best video games of the past decade maybe and that's a game that I owned on PC and owned on PS4
when it first came out and then later went on to buy on Switch actually just because the novelty of
playing Doom portable seemed like hard to pass up. So last week I was setting up a Xbox One X that
I had just bought to replace the Xbox I lost in my apartment fire months and months and months ago
and normally I wouldn't buy something as expensive as an Xbox One X especially as a guy who mostly
plays PC games but there was this big elaborate target sale pricing error thing and long story
short it was very very cheap to get this Xbox and as part of that deal the Xbox came with a
one month subscription to Game Pass which is Microsoft's sort of attempt at doing a Netflix
style a la carte play all the games you want for a flat subscription fee service and while I'm not
sure that I'm sold on that service as a concept I do like getting a new system and then suddenly
having like 50 or something games for it and among those games that comes as part of Game Pass
is Doom and I think part of the appeal for me of games like Doom or Spelunky or any game that's
repeatable and I know is consistent is that it's like it's almost like a comfort food video game
where I just find myself coming back to it over and over and it just feels good to play and I kind
of couldn't resist downloading it onto the Xbox for free because that way I knew if I sat down at
this Xbox and I didn't know what to do with it Doom would always be sitting there waiting for me and
it would be just as fun as it was all the previous times I'd played through it so I sat down at the
Xbox in pretty much that exact situation recently unsure of what to play saw Doom on the home screen
and went ahead and booted it up and I'd already played through Doom twice once on the default
difficulty hurt me plenty on the ps4 version and then later I played through the game on Ultra
Violence which is the second hardest difficulty when I eventually played through it again on PC and
then my thinking was okay I still haven't ever played Doom on Nightmare difficulty it's probably
going to be too much for me but this is a great opportunity to try it I've got this new system
set up I've got this TV set up like I might as well give Nightmare mode a shot so I booted up
Doom in Nightmare mode for the first time and I I'm just going to show you exactly what I saw when
I booted it up so I booted up Doom on Nightmare difficulty for the very first time and I was
really struck by how it looked it was very like dark a lot of like silhouettes and stuff it was kind
of hard to tell what was going on a lot of like very melodramatic almost like time splitters
to looking-ass mood lighting and I was like huh this is really interesting I didn't realize that
when you played on the hardest difficulty they'd gone through and redone all the lighting and all
this stuff and like adjusted the textures this is a really cool detail that really adds to the
atmosphere of playing this on the hardest difficulty like that's a nice touch from the
developers but the more I played through that initial few minutes of the game and the more I
sort of looked closely at the in-game cutscenes that were happening it started to seem like maybe
this was not an intentional cool design decision that it had added to the game it was starting to
look like something was the matter like entire parts of the opening cutscene were just pure pitch
black darkness and walking up to put on the praetor suit for the first time was just you couldn't
see anything I just had to rely on a combination of having played it a half dozen times and and
onscreen button prompts to know what to do and I started to realize that like something was
definitely awry here and and something was going on with this xbox something was wrong and I still
to this day even now as I make this video like five days later I still don't know what was happening
here but for whatever reason it the whole thing just looks like this sort of monochromatic very
very little color very lighting heavy version of doom now the more I played of it the more it became
clear that something had clearly gone horribly wrong either with my xbox itself or with the install
of doom but I for whatever reason I kept playing it's it's so rare I think that you play a console
game and see it just completely break in this specific way like this feels like such a
uh such a pc game problem right like such a weird uh video card either dying or driver
error or something like it just the promise of console games is that shit like this doesn't happen
but I was I was captivated I kept playing it because it just the look of it was so striking
and so unique now the more I played the more I started to hone in on a few things that seemed to
have broken here it seemed like pretty much every single bit of geometry in the game was just
completely pitch black by default and it resulted in this really unbelievably atmospheric cool
version of doom that was even more hellish than the original game the the lack of like textures
meant that every single other component of the game was suddenly really stylized and highlighted
and not only did it look really cool there were actual gameplay ramifications for what was happening
see uh in this mode because everything was pitch black um the glowing of the glory kills on enemies
was at least felt to me extremely exaggerated like a very very very bright unignorable glow
same with any pickups and collectibles and so while that made some of the gameplay like interaction
things easier to locate um the fact that your enemies were now the same color as most of the
environment meant that you were fighting these sort of textureless practically invisible killing
machines because remember this is nightmare difficulty which is already drastically harder
than the doom experience I was used to so on top of that I'm now fighting these enemies that I can
barely see um it was just this very weird cool uh kind of pure version of doom it I found that I
was really able to kind of zone out and get really really lost and and focused on just the pure gameplay
of it you know what I mean like because it was just stripped down to the barest simplest elements
um it I was almost immediately in that zone of like seeing movement firing at it uh going in for
a glory kill and just that that beautiful sort of like violence ballet that you end up performing
when you play doom at a high level like this enhanced that for me for whatever reason um and
and that's to say nothing of the fact that it just looks awesome like I think one of the most
memorable moments in the 2016 doom game is after the first half of the first level when you exit
the facility for the first time and you go out onto the surface of Mars and that was the moment I had
no idea what it was going to look like but based on the dramatic shifts from like all red lighting
to all blue lighting in the indoor area I was like really excited to see what the surface of Mars
looked like so yeah I'll just be quiet and let you see it this is what the surface of Mars looked
like for the first time in these broken busted ass version of doom
and I just immediately started grinning I mean doom is a great looking game already
but seeing that like incredible skybox that it built for the surface of Mars like juxtaposed with
this this sort of pitch black geometric tree it just looked awesome like it looked really really
cool and it was occasionally sort of inscrutable from a gameplay perspective occasionally enemies
would just like I said like kind of disappear into the background but it was always beautiful the
entire way through and uh I I was really hesitant to mess with it too much you know what I mean I
felt like I had I had stumbled into this weird cool beautiful version of doom and I was really like
scared to even exit out of the main menu because I thought it might fix itself I thought it might
undo whatever had gone wrong but eventually after I'd captured a bunch of footage of me
playing the opening level of doom and dying a whole bunch I figured I needed to see what the
later stages look like which was something I wasn't going to be able to do like all in one
night all in one sitting on nightmare difficulty so I backed out I loaded up arcade mode and I
crossed my fingers that the same visual glitch the same whatever was going on whether it was a dying
video card or what I crossed my fingers that would still be happening if I booted into arcade mode
and sure enough it did it it it was still happening and so the first stage I booted into
was foundry which is a relatively well lit but completely indoors stage with a ton of verticality
and it was just darkness it was it really really changed the vibe it felt like something out of
like the first half of doom 3 or something like it just the tone was so different and I started
learning all these like really weird um ways that I had to play doom differently in this
broken version of it so one of my favorite examples of what I'm talking about is uh this
siphon grenade the you know that like grenade you throw in doom where it like makes sort of a
red orb that like sucks health out of demons and gives it to you uh the siphon grenade suddenly
had a entirely new utility to it because in rooms that it was just straight up too dark to see anything
the siphon grenade would not only help me light up the geometry of the room because it does have
that lighting effect and that was something that was still visible in this version of the game it
would also help me like see where enemies were which was a huge deal in some of the darker parts
of the game I couldn't help myself I kind of wanted to see what every level looked like so I
loaded into uh Lazarus labs and advanced research complex those like parts from the middle of the
game the um that's sort of like bright white very clean sterile facility the level where you get
the bfg and it just looked crazy it just looked completely different it was almost unrecognizable
because it was just darkness ever with these little tiny pinpoint highlights of light it just
it felt like a horror game it made doom scarier it made it way harder um and it really changed how
I I experienced a game that I had already played through like two and a half or three times already
um as I hopped into more and more levels to see how this weird glitch uh manifested I it I just
really found myself growing like embarrassingly attached to this like corrupted broken version
of the game and and I don't know if it was again I don't know if it was my xbox dying or the game
installing wrong or what I had had other weird issues on my xbox something is definitely the
matter and it seems to be with my xbox itself um but at any rate I just like I I really enjoyed
getting to experience a game I already love with a massive unintentional visual modifier applied to
the entire thing top to bottom um and I wound up staying up till god let me check the timestamps
on these files I wound up staying up till like oh god really late like uh I wound up staying up
till like 247 in the morning just experimenting with this and playing with these different
weird versions of doom and eventually I played as much consecutive doom as I could pretty much
handle and I needed to get some sleep so reluctantly I turned off my xbox and I went to bed
the next morning I woke up and I walked out in the living room and because you can't use like the
xbox capture stuff on the dashboard I filmed this um which is why I'm like filming this offscreen
with a camera and not using direct feed um but I booted into doom just to see what would happen
and I I wasn't really sure what to expect I wasn't sure if if maybe my all of it would still be the
way I remembered it or if it would have quote-unquote fixed itself and so sure enough I I loaded up the
game and it had been fixed everything that was broken about the game the night before had
corrected itself the game looked the same way I was used to it looking on on every platform
I've played it on pretty much and um I was it was I don't it was weird I was surprised by
how much I missed it once it was gone um I'm glad that I took a lot of videos of it even
if they were like weird 30 second chunk 4k videos on the xbox um and I'm glad I got to experience
it and I'm sure someone somewhere could recreate this on pc right like there's gotta be some
smarter could create a version of doom that rips all the textures out and creates the experience
I had but man what like a what a cool weird unique thing to have happen to you when sitting down to
play a game that you know inside it out on a console like you don't expect to load up a game
on a console and have it visually break in a in a way that's this fascinating it was really
really cool to see and so I just wanted to throw together this video really quickly and share this
experience with y'all um if anyone smarter than me who knows more about um hardware can explain to
me what happened if my xbox is dying or overheating or if it was a problem with the game install
or like let me know what you think happened here because I have literally no idea and I am forever
going to be haunted by the mystery of this weird night where doom broke on my xbox but yeah thank
you for watching uh I've got some other videos on the way that are nothing like this but this
just happened to me over the weekend and I was like I have to make a video about this so yeah
thank you for watching I hope this was enjoyable for you as it was for me um and yeah have a good week
