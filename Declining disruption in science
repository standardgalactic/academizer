With fewer disruptive studies, is science becoming an echo chamber?
by Patricia Contreras Tejada | Jan 13, 2023

An analysis of 45 million papers and 3.9 million patents since 1945 shows that the rate of disruptiveness in science is steeply declining.
Scientist working in DNA fragmentation
Since 1945, the rate of disruptive scientific papers and patents is rapidly declining. This is the conclusion of a recent study, which analyzed 45 million papers and 3.9 million patents.

Does this mean that progress in science and innovation is slowing down?

Interestingly, while the volume of papers and patents is steadily increasing, the sheer number of disruptive contributions remained very stable over the decades. Indeed, the COVID-19 vaccines provided a stark example of how world-changing scientific developments can come true in record time. But the fraction of disruptive papers and patents is getting smaller and smaller.

“That suggests that we’re just paying for too much,” said Diana Hicks, a professor of public policy at Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the study.

Standing on the shoulders of giants
Is disruption a positive trait? As co-author Erin Leahey from the University of Arizona explained, a paper is disruptive if subsequent researchers cite it, but ignore the foundational work on which it was built. “You stood on the shoulders of giants to produce that work, but now you’re contributing to their obsolescence,” she said.

Still, at the other end of the spectrum, highly consolidating papers are “deeply integrated and engaged in a knowledge stream,” she added. That is, work that cites that paper also cites the prior work that fed into it, which is not a bad thing, according to Leahey.

So, the distinction between disruption and consolidation is not about the amount of impact, but the nature of it.

Indeed, the declining rate of disruption is not due to the diminishing quality of the work, the data from the study shows, as disruption is decreasing even among papers published in top journals and among Nobel Prize-winning works.

Instead, a common criticism of modern science is the pressure to “publish or perish”, which many believe is contributing to the trend. But the evidence for this is still inconclusive.

Another possible factor could be the tendency of funding agencies to put out very targeted calls for research projects. “Is that steering not just the type of work or the topics that people are working on but, I don’t know, making more than the typical number of people kind of line up behind that area?” Leahey asked, adding that such a consequence might make a disruptive discovery less likely. Again, the data is not conclusive.

Narrower slices of knowledge
What the data does show is that the diversity of works cited has decreased over time. The volume of available research papers is going up, but scientists and inventors are using the same knowledge base over and over, and their scope is narrower than it used to be. As the authors wrote in the paper, “Relying on narrower slices of knowledge benefits individual careers, but not scientific progress more generally”.

Information overload may be a factor behind this trend, and Leahey points out that the change in the way we obtain that information might also be playing a role. “When I was in graduate school, I went to the library,” she recalls, and browsed the social science section as a whole.

But now, she, like many researchers, rely on feeds from search engines to peruse the literature, whose underlying algorithms sway results significantly. “It’s not just […] there’s so much out there that we don’t have enough time to read it all, it’s that maybe we are being slightly steered or the work that is brought to our attention is really within our niche,” she said.

Other studies have found that social media favors the formation of echo chambers, i.e., groups of like-minded users reinforcing a shared narrative. Could something similar be happening in research and innovation – and could social media be a factor? At this point, this question remains open-ended.

Can AI help?
In any case, if science and innovation are indeed slowing down, the consequences could be far-reaching. “Then the problem is that economic growth is going to slow down,” Hicks said. “The whole capitalist system is premised on economic growth [and] a large part of that over time has come from innovations, which, you know, come from technological and scientific advance.”

Can this trend be halted or even reverted?

Proposals are not lacking. As Hicks explained, the OECD ran a workshop in 2021 to explore whether artificial intelligence could help science become more productive. The premise was that, perhaps, technology could be instrumental to overcoming the increased complexity that challenges modern science.

But even more modest interventions might make a big difference. Leahey points out that the multiple administrative and other duties that surround research in academic institutions are probably getting in the way of researchers broadening their scope of works read.

“I just want to, you know, sit down on the couch and read a book, and when I do that, I feel like, lazy and guilty, like I’m not doing my job – I’m like no, this is very much my job!,” she said.

million patents. This trend is not due to diminishing quality but could be linked to factors such as the pressure to "publish or perish" and funding agencies' targeted calls for research projects. The study found that the diversity of works cited has decreased over time, suggesting that scientists and inventors are using the same knowledge base repeatedly. Information overload and changes in the way researchers obtain information, such as through search engine feeds, could also be playing a role. If this trend continues, it could have far-reaching consequences for economic growth and innovation. Suggestions to address the trend include exploring whether artificial intelligence could help make science more productive and reducing administrative duties surrounding research in academic institutions.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">We Must Plan a New World Together

Uh, a computer is an automatic electronic apparatus...

For making calculations

Or controlling operations...

Papers and patents are becoming less 
disruptive over time 
Michael Park1, Erin Leahey2 &amp; Russell J. Funk1 ✉ 
Theories of scientif i c and technological change view discovery and invention as 
endogenous processes1,2, wherein previous accumulated knowledge enables future 
progress by allowing researchers to, in Newton’s words, ‘stand on the shoulders of 
giants’3–7. Recent decades have witnessed exponential growth in the volume of new 
scientif i c and technological knowledge, thereby creating conditions that should be 
ripe for major advances8,9. Yet contrary to this view, studies suggest that progress is 
slowing in several major fi elds10,11. Here, we analyse these claims at scale across six 
decades, using data on 45 million papers and 3.9 million patents from six large-scale 
datasets, together with a new quantitative metric—the CD index12—that characterizes 
how papers and patents change networks of citations in science and technology. 
We fi nd that papers and patents are increasingly less likely to break with the past in 
ways that push science and technology in new directions. This pattern holds universally 
across fi elds and is robust across multiple dif f erent citation- and text-based metrics1,13–17. 
Subsequently, we link this decline in disruptiveness to a narrowing in the use of previous 
knowledge, allowing us to reconcile the patterns we observe with the ‘shoulders of 
giants’ view. We fi nd that the observed declines are unlikely to be driven by changes in 
the quality of published science, citation practices or fi eld-specif i c factors. Overall, 
our results suggest that slowing rates of disruption may ref l ect a fundamental shift in 
the nature of science and technology. 
Although the past century witnessed an unprecedented expan- 
sion of scientific and technological knowledge, there are concerns 
that innovative activity is slowing18–20. Studies document declining 
research productivity in semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and other 
fields10,11. Papers, patents and even grant applications have become less 
novel&nbsp;relative to prior work and less likely to connect disparate areas 
of knowledge, both of which are precursors of innovation21,22. The gap 
between the year of discovery and the awarding of a Nobel Prize has also 
increased23,24, suggesting that today’s contributions do not measure 
up to the past. These trends have attracted increasing attention from 
policymakers, as they pose substantial threats to economic growth, 
human health and wellbeing, and national security, along with global 
efforts to combat grand challenges such as climate change25,26. 
Numerous explanations for this slowdown have been proposed. 
Some point to a dearth of ‘low-hanging fruit’ as the readily available 
productivity-enhancing innovations have already been made19,27. Others 
emphasize the increasing burden of knowledge; scientists and inven- 
tors require ever more training to reach the frontiers of their fields, 
leaving less time to push those frontiers forward18,28. Yet much remains 
unknown, not merely about the causes of slowing innovative activity, 
but also the depth and breadth of the phenomenon. The decline is 
difficult to reconcile with centuries of observation by philosophers of 
science, who characterize the growth of knowledge as an endogenous 
process, wherein previous knowledge enables future discovery, a view 
captured famously in Newton’s observation that if he had seen further, 
it was by ‘standing on the shoulders of giants’3. Moreover, to date, the 
evidence pointing to a slowdown is based on studies of particular fields, 
using disparate and domain-specific metrics10,11, making it difficult to 
know whether the changes are happening at similar rates across areas 
of science and technology. Little is also known about whether the pat- 
terns seen in aggregate indicators mask differences in the degree to 
which individual works push the frontier. 
We address these gaps in understanding by analysing 25 million 
papers (1945–2010) in the Web of Science (WoS) (Methods) and 3.9 mil- 
lion patents (1976–2010) in the United States Patent and Trademark 
Office’s (USPTO)&nbsp;Patents View database (Methods). The WoS data 
include 390 million citations, 25 million paper titles and 13 million 
abstracts. The Patents View data include 35 million citations, 3.9 million 
patent titles and 3.9 million abstracts. Subsequently, we replicate our 
core findings on four additional datasets—JSTOR, the American Physical 
Society corpus, Microsoft Academic Graph and PubMed—encompass- 
ing 20 million papers. Using these data, we join a new citation-based 
measure12 with textual analyses of titles and abstracts to understand 
whether papers and patents forge new directions over time and across 
fields. 
Measurement of disruptiveness 
To characterize the nature of innovation, we draw on foundational 
theories of scientific and technological change2,29,30, which distinguish 
between two types of breakthroughs. First, some contributions improve 
existing streams of knowledge, and therefore consolidate the status

quo. Kohn and Sham (1965)31, a Nobel-winning paper used established 
theorems to develop a method for calculating the structure of elec- 
trons, which cemented the value of previous research. Second, some 
contributions disrupt existing knowledge, rendering it obsolete, and 
propelling science and technology in new directions. Watson and Crick 
(1953)32, also a Nobel winner, introduced a model of the structure of 
DNA that superseded previous approaches (for example, Pauling’s 
triple helix). Kohn and Sham and Watson and Crick were both impor- 
tant, but their implications for scientific and technological change 
were different. 
We quantify this distinction using a measure—the CD index12—that 
characterizes the consolidating or disruptive nature of science and 
technology (Fig.&nbsp;1). The intuition is that if a paper or patent is disrup- 
tive, the subsequent work that cites it is less likely to also cite its prede- 
cessors; for future researchers, the ideas that went into its production 
are less relevant (for example, Pauling’s triple helix). If a paper or patent 
is consolidating, subsequent work that cites it is also more likely to 
cite its predecessors; for future researchers, the knowledge upon 
which the work builds is still (and perhaps more) relevant (for exam- 
ple, the theorems Kohn and Sham used). The CD index ranges from −1 
(consolidating) to 1 (disruptive). We measure the CD index five years 
after the year of each paper’s publication (indicated by CD5, see 
Extended Data Fig.&nbsp;1 for the distribution of CD5 among papers and 
patents and Extended Data Fig.&nbsp;2 for analyses using alternative 
windows)33. For example, Watson and Crick and Kohn and Sham both 
received over a hundred citations within five years of being published. 
However, the Kohn and Sham paper has a CD5 of −0.22 (indicating 
consolidation), whereas the Watson and Crick paper has a CD5 of 
0.62 (indicating disruption). The CD index has been validated exten- 
sively in previous research, including through correlation with expert 
assessments12,34. 
Declining disruptiveness 
Across fields, we find that science and technology are becoming less 
disruptive. Figure&nbsp;2 plots the average CD5 over time for papers (Fig.&nbsp;2a) 
and patents (Fig.&nbsp;2b). For papers, the decrease between 1945 and 2010 
ranges from 91.9% (where the average CD5 dropped from 0.52 in 1945 
to 0.04 in 2010 for ‘social sciences’) to 100% (where the average CD5 
decreased from 0.36 in 1945 to 0 in 2010 for ‘physical sciences’); for pat- 
ents, the decrease between 1980 and 2010 ranges from 78.7% (where the 
average CD5 decreased from 0.30 in 1980 to 0.06 in 2010 for ‘computers 
and communications’) to 91.5% (where the average CD5 decreased from 
0.38 in 1980 to 0.03 in 2010 for&nbsp;‘drugs and medical’). For both papers 
and patents, the rates of decline are greatest in the earlier parts of the 
time series, and for patents, they appear to begin stabilizing between 
the years 2000 and 2005. For papers, since about 1980, the rate of 
decline has been more modest in ‘life sciences and biomedicine’ and 
physical sciences, and most marked and persistent in social sciences 
and ‘technology’. Overall, however, relative to earlier eras, recent papers 
and patents do less to push science and technology in new directions. 
The general similarity in trends we observe across fields is noteworthy 
in light of ‘low-hanging fruit’ theories19,27, which would probably predict 
greater heterogeneity in the decline, as it seems unlikely fields would 
‘consume’ their low-hanging fruit at similar rates&nbsp;or&nbsp;times. 
Linguistic change 
The decline in disruptive science and technology is also observable 
using alternative indicators. Because they create departures from 
the status quo, disruptive papers and patents are likely to introduce 
new words (for example, words used to create a new paradigm might 
differ from those that are used to develop an existing paradigm)35,36.

becoming less disruptive over time, despite the exponential growth in the volume of new scientific and technological knowledge. The authors analyze 45 million papers and 3.9 million patents from six large-scale datasets, along with a new quantitative metric, to characterize how papers and patents change networks of citations in science and technology. They find that papers and patents are increasingly less likely to break with the past in ways that push science and technology in new directions, which holds universally across fields and is robust across multiple different citation- and text-based metrics. The decline in disruptiveness is linked to a narrowing in the use of previous knowledge, suggesting a fundamental shift in the nature of science and technology. The authors address the gaps in understanding by analyzing 25 million papers in the Web of Science and 3.9 million patents in the United States Patent and Trademark Office's Patents View database, as well as four additional datasets. They join a new citation-based measure with textual analyses of titles and abstracts to understand whether papers and patents forge new directions over time and across fields. The authors draw on foundational theories of scientific and technological change to distinguish between two types of breakthroughs: those that improve existing streams of knowledge and those that forge new directions. The article raises concerns that innovative activity is slowing, which poses substantial threats to economic growth, human health and wellbeing, and national security, along with global efforts to combat grand challenges such as climate change.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">(1965)31, a Nobel-winning paper used established 
theorems to develop a method for calculating the structure of elec- 
trons, which cemented the value of previous research. Second, some 
contributions disrupt existing knowledge, rendering it obsolete, and 
propelling science and technology in new directions. Watson and Crick 
(1953)32, also a Nobel winner, introduced a model of the structure of 
DNA that superseded previous approaches (for example, Pauling’s 
triple helix). Kohn and Sham and Watson and Crick were both impor- 
tant, but their implications for scientific and technological change 
were different. 
We quantify this distinction using a measure—the CD index12—that 
characterizes the consolidating or disruptive nature of science and 
technology (Fig.&nbsp;1). The intuition is that if a paper or patent is disrup- 
tive, the subsequent work that cites it is less likely to also cite its prede- 
cessors; for future researchers, the ideas that went into its production 
are less relevant (for example, Pauling’s triple helix). If a paper or patent 
is consolidating, subsequent work that cites it is also more likely to 
cite its predecessors; for future researchers, the knowledge upon 
which the work builds is still (and perhaps more) relevant (for exam- 
ple, the theorems Kohn and Sham used). The CD index ranges from −1 
(consolidating) to 1 (disruptive). We measure the CD index five years 
after the year of each paper’s publication (indicated by CD5, see 
Extended Data Fig.&nbsp;1 for the distribution of CD5 among papers and 
patents and Extended Data Fig.&nbsp;2 for analyses using alternative 
windows)33. For example, Watson and Crick and Kohn and Sham both 
received over a hundred citations within five years of being published. 
However, the Kohn and Sham paper has a CD5 of −0.22 (indicating 
consolidation), whereas the Watson and Crick paper has a CD5 of 
0.62 (indicating disruption). The CD index has been validated exten- 
sively in previous research, including through correlation with expert 
assessments12,34. 
Declining disruptiveness 
Across fields, we find that science and technology are becoming less 
disruptive. Figure&nbsp;2 plots the average CD5 over time for papers (Fig.&nbsp;2a) 
and patents (Fig.&nbsp;2b). For papers, the decrease between 1945 and 2010 
ranges from 91.9% (where the average CD5 dropped from 0.52 in 1945 
to 0.04 in 2010 for ‘social sciences’) to 100% (where the average CD5 
decreased from 0.36 in 1945 to 0 in 2010 for ‘physical sciences’); for pat- 
ents, the decrease between 1980 and 2010 ranges from 78.7% (where the 
average CD5 decreased from 0.30 in 1980 to 0.06 in 2010 for ‘computers 
and communications’) to 91.5% (where the average CD5 decreased from 
0.38 in 1980 to 0.03 in 2010 for&nbsp;‘drugs and medical’). For both papers 
and patents, the rates of decline are greatest in the earlier parts of the 
time series, and for patents, they appear to begin stabilizing between 
the years 2000 and 2005. For papers, since about 1980, the rate of 
decline has been more modest in ‘life sciences and biomedicine’ and 
physical sciences, and most marked and persistent in social sciences 
and ‘technology’. Overall, however, relative to earlier eras, recent papers 
and patents do less to push science and technology in new directions. 
The general similarity in trends we observe across fields is noteworthy 
in light of ‘low-hanging fruit’ theories19,27, which would probably predict 
greater heterogeneity in the decline, as it seems unlikely fields would 
‘consume’ their low-hanging fruit at similar rates&nbsp;or&nbsp;times. 
Linguistic change 
The decline in disruptive science and technology is also observable 
using alternative indicators. Because they create departures from 
the status quo, disruptive papers and patents are likely to introduce 
new words (for example, words used to create a new paradigm might 
differ from those that are used to develop an existing paradigm)35,36.

years post-publication (indicated by CD5). b, Distribution of CD5 for papers 
from WoS (n = 24,659,076) between 1945 and 2010 and patents from Patents 
View (n = 3,912,353) between 1976 and 2010, where a single dot represents a 
paper or patent. The vertical (up–down) dimension of each ‘strip’ corresponds 
to values of the CD index (with axis values shown in orange on the left). 
The horizontal (left–right) dimension of each strip helps to&nbsp;minimize 
overlapping points. Darker areas on each strip plot indicate denser regions 
of the distribution (that is, more commonly observed CD5 values). Additional 
details on the distribution of the CD index are given in Extended Data Fig.&nbsp;1. 
c, Three hypothetical citation networks, where the CD index is at the maximally 
disruptive value (CDt = 1), midpoint value (CDt = 0), and maximally consolidating 
value (CDt = −1). The panel also provides the equation for the CD index and an 
illustrative calculation.

Therefore, if disruptiveness is declining, we would expect a decline 
in the diversity of words used in science and technology. To evaluate 
this, Fig.&nbsp;3a,d documents the type-token ratio (that is, unique/total 
words) of paper and patent titles over time (Supplementary&nbsp;Informa- 
tion section&nbsp;1). We observe substantial declines, especially in the ear- 
lier periods, before 1970 for papers and 1990 for patents. For paper 
titles (Fig.&nbsp;3a), the decrease (1945–2010) ranges from 76.5% (social 
sciences) to 88% (technology); for patent titles (Fig.&nbsp;3d), the decrease 
(1980–2010) ranges from 32.5% (chemical) to 81% (computers and 
communications). For paper abstracts (Extended Data Fig.&nbsp;3a), the 
decrease (1992–2010) ranges from 23.1% (life sciences and biomedicine) 
to 38.9% (social sciences); for patent abstracts (Extended Data Fig.&nbsp;3b), 
the decrease (1980–2010) ranges from 21.5% (mechanical) to 73.2% 
(computers and communications). In Fig.&nbsp;3b,e, we demonstrate that 
these declines in word diversity are accompanied by similar declines in 
combinatorial novelty; over time, the particular words that scientists 
and inventors use in the titles of their papers and patents are increas- 
ingly likely to have been used together in the titles of previous work. 
Consistent with these trends in language, we also observe declining nov- 
elty in the combinations of previous work cited by papers and patents, 
based on a previously established measure of ‘atypical combinations’14 
(Extended Data Fig.&nbsp;4). 
The decline in disruptive activity is also apparent in the specific 
words used by scientists and inventors. If disruptiveness is declining, 
we reasoned that verbs alluding to the creation, discovery or percep- 
tion of new things should be used less frequently over time, whereas 
verbs alluding to the improvement, application or assessment of exist- 
ing things may be used more often35,36. Figure&nbsp;3 shows the most com- 
mon verbs in paper (Fig.&nbsp;3c) and patent titles (Fig.&nbsp;3f) in the first and 
last decade of each sample (Supplementary Information section&nbsp;2). 
Although precisely and quantitatively characterizing words as ‘con- 
solidating’ or ‘disruptive’ is challenging in the absence of context, the 
figure highlights a clear and qualitative shift in language. In the earlier 
decades, verbs evoking creation (for example, ‘produce’, ‘form’, ‘pre- 
pare’ and ‘make’), discovery (for example, ‘determine’ and ‘report’) 
and perception (for example, ‘measure’) are prevalent in both paper 
and patent titles. In the later decades, however, these verbs are almost 
completely displaced by those tending to be more evocative of the 
improvement (for example, ‘improve’, ‘enhance’ and ‘increase’), appli- 
cation (for example, ‘use’ and ‘include’) or assessment (for example, 
‘associate’, ‘mediate’ and ‘relate’) of existing scientific and technologi- 
cal knowledge and artefacts. Taken together, these patterns suggest a 
substantive shift in science and technology over time, with discovery 
and invention becoming less disruptive in nature, consistent with our 
results using the CD index. 
Conservation of highly disruptive work 
The aggregate trends we document mask considerable heterogeneity 
in the disruptiveness of individual papers and patents and remarkable 
stability in the absolute number of highly disruptive works (Methods 
and Fig.&nbsp;4). Specifically, despite large increases in scientific productiv- 
ity, the number of papers and patents with CD5 values in the far right tail 
of the distribution remains nearly constant over time. This ‘conserva- 
tion’ of the absolute number of highly disruptive papers</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

science and technology are becoming less disruptive over time. The authors of the study used a measure called the CD index to determine whether a paper or patent is consolidating or disruptive. The CD index ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates consolidation and 1 indicates disruption. The study found that the average CD5 has been decreasing over time, indicating that recent papers and patents are doing less to push science and technology in new directions. The decline in disruptive science and technology is also observable using alternative indicators, such as linguistic change. The authors note that the decline in disruptive science and technology is similar across fields, which is noteworthy in light of "low-hanging fruit" theories that would predict greater heterogeneity in the decline. The authors do not offer any explanations for why science and technology are becoming less disruptive over time.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Conservation of highly disruptive work 
The aggregate trends we document mask considerable heterogeneity 
in the disruptiveness of individual papers and patents and remarkable 
stability in the absolute number of highly disruptive works (Methods 
and Fig.&nbsp;4). Specifically, despite large increases in scientific productiv- 
ity, the number of papers and patents with CD5 values in the far right tail 
of the distribution remains nearly constant over time. This ‘conserva- 
tion’ of the absolute number of highly disruptive papers and patents 
holds despite considerable churn in the underlying fields responsible 
for producing those works (Extended Data Fig.&nbsp;5, inset). These results 
suggest that the persistence of major breakthroughs—for example, 
measurement of gravity waves and COVID-19 vaccines—is not incon- 
sistent with slowing innovative activity. In short, declining aggregate 
disruptiveness does not preclude individual highly disruptive works. 
Alternative explanations 
What is driving the decline in disruptiveness? Earlier, we suggested our 
results are not consistent with explanations that link slowing innova- 
tive activity to diminishing ‘low-hanging fruit’. Extended Data Fig.&nbsp;5 
shows that the decline in disruptiveness is unlikely to be due to other 
field-specific factors by decomposing variation in CD5 attributable to 
field, author and year effects (Methods). 
Declining rates of disruptive activity are unlikely to be caused by the 
diminishing quality of science and technology22,37. If they were, then 
the patterns seen in Fig.&nbsp;2 should be less visible in high-quality work. 
However, when we restrict our sample to articles published in premier 
publication venues such as Nature, Proceedings of the National Academy 
of Sciences and Science or to Nobel-winning discoveries38 (Fig.&nbsp;5), the 
downward trend persists. 
Furthermore, the trend is not driven by characteristics of the WoS and 
UPSTO data or our particular derivation of the CD index; we observe 
similar declines in disruptiveness when we compute CD5 on papers

Fig. 2 | Decline of disruptive science and technology. a,b, Decline in CD5 over 
time, separately for papers (a, n = 24,659,076) and patents (b, n = 3,912,353). 
For papers, lines correspond to WoS research areas; from 1945 to 2010 the 
magnitude of decline ranges from 91.9% (social sciences) to 100% (physical 
sciences). For patents, lines correspond to National Bureau of Economic 
Research (NBER) technology categories; from 1980 to 2010 the magnitude 
of decline ranges from 93.5% (computers and communications) to 96.4% 
(drugs and medical). Shaded bands correspond to 95% confidence intervals. 
As we elaborate in the Methods, this pattern of decline is robust to adjustment 
for confounding from changes in publication, citation and authorship practices 
over time. Nature | Vol 613 | 5 January 2023 | 141

Fig. 4 | Conservation of highly disruptive work. This figure shows the number 
of disruptive papers (a, n = 5,030,179) and patents (b, n = 1,476,004) across four 
different ranges of CD5 (papers and patents with CD5 values in the range [−1.0, 0) 
are not represented in the figure). Lines correspond to different levels of 
disruptiveness as measured by CD5. Despite substantial increases in the numbers 
of papers and patents published each year, there is little change in the number of 
highly disruptive papers and patents, as evidenced by the relatively flat red, green 
and orange lines. This pattern helps to account for simultaneous observations 
of both aggregate evidence of slowing innovative activity and seemingly major 
breakthroughs in many fields of science and technology. The inset plots show 
the composition of the most disruptive papers and patents (defined as those 
with CD5 values &gt;0.25) by field over time. The observed stability in the absolute 
number of highly disruptive papers and patents holds despite considerable 
churn in the underlying fields of science and technology</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

Declines in disruptiveness are also not attributable to changing 
publication, citation or authorship practices (Methods). First, using 
approaches from the bibliometrics literature39–43, we computed several 
normalized versions of the CD index that adjusted for the increasing 
tendency for papers and patents to cite previous work44,45. Results using 
these alternative indicators (Extended Data Fig.&nbsp;8a,d) were similar to 
those we reported in Fig.&nbsp;2. Second, using regression, we estimated 
models of CD5 as a function of indicator variables for each paper or 
patent’s publication year, along with specific controls for field × year 
level—number of new papers/patents, mean number of papers/patents 
cited, mean number of authors or inventors per paper—and paper or 
patent-level—number of papers or patents cited—factors. Predictions 
from these models indicated a decline in disruptive papers and patents 
(Extended Data Fig.&nbsp;8b,e and Supplementary Table&nbsp;1) that was con- 
sistent with our main results. Finally, using Monte Carlo simulations, 
we randomly rewired the observed citation networks while preserving 
key characteristics of scientists’ and inventors’ citation behaviour, 
including the number of citations made and received by individual 
papers and patents and the age gap between citing and cited works. 
We find that observed CD5 values are lower than those from the simu- 
lated networks (Extended Data Fig.&nbsp;8c,f), and the gap is widening: over 
time, papers and patents are increasingly less disruptive than would be 
expected by chance. Taken together, these additional analyses indicate 
that the decline in CD5 is unlikely to be driven by changing publication, 
citation or authorship practices. 
Growth of knowledge and disruptiveness 
We also considered how declining disruptiveness relates to the growth 
of knowledge (Extended Data Fig.&nbsp;9). On the one hand, scientists and 
inventors face an increasing knowledge burden, which may inhibit 
discoveries and inventions that disrupt the status quo. On the other 
hand, as previously noted, philosophers of science suggest that exist- 
ing knowledge fosters discovery and invention3,6,7. Using regression 
models, we evaluated the relationship between the stock of papers 
and patents (a proxy for knowledge) within fields and their CD5 (Sup- 
plementary Information section&nbsp;3 and Supplementary Table&nbsp;2). 
We find a positive effect of the growth of knowledge on disruptive- 
ness for papers, consistent with previous work20; however, we find a 
negative effect for patents. 
Given these conflicting results, we considered the possibility that 
the availability of knowledge may differ from its use. In particular, the 
growth in publishing and patenting may lead scientists and inventors 
to focus on narrower slices of previous work18,46, thereby limiting the 
‘effective’ stock of knowledge. Using three proxies, we document a 
decline in the use of previous knowledge among scientists and inventors 
(Fig.&nbsp;6). First, we see a decline in the diversity of work cited (Fig.&nbsp;6a,d), 
indicating that contemporary science and technology are engaging 
with narrower slices of existing knowledge. Moreover, this decline in 
diversity is accompanied by an increase in the share of citations to the 
1% most highly cited papers and patents (Fig.&nbsp;6a (i),d(i)), which are also 
decreasing in semantic diversity (Fig.&nbsp;6a (ii),d (ii)). Over time, scientists 
and inventors are increasingly citing the same previous work, and that 
previous work is becoming more topically similar. Second, we see an 
increase in self-citation (Fig.&nbsp;6b,e), a common proxy for the continua- 
tion of one’s pre-existing research stream47–49, which is consistent with 
scientists and inventors relying more on highly familiar knowledge. 
Third, the mean age of work cited, a common measure for the use of 
dated knowledge50–52, is increasing (Fig.&nbsp;6c,f), suggesting that scientists 
and inventors may be struggling to keep up with the pace of knowledge 
expansion and instead relying on older, familiar work. All three indica- 
tors point to a consistent story: a narrower scope of existing knowledge 
is informing contemporary discovery and invention. 
Results from a subsequent series of regression models suggest that 
use of less diverse work, more of one’s own work and older work are all 
negatively associated with disruption (Methods, Extended Data Table&nbsp;1 
and Supplementary Table&nbsp;3), a pattern that holds even after accounting 
for the average age and number of previous works produced by team 
members. When the range of work used by scientists and inventors 
narrows, disruptive activity declines. 
Discussion 
In summary, we report a marked decline in disruptive science and 
technology over time. Our analyses show that this trend is unlikely to 
be driven by changes in citation practices or the quality of published 
work. Rather, the decline represents a substantive shift in science and 
technology, one that reinforces concerns about slowing innovative 
activity. We attribute this trend in part to scientists’ and inventors’ reli- 
ance on a narrower set of existing knowledge. Even though philosophers

Fig. 5 | CD index of high-quality science over time. This figure shows changes 
in CD5 over time for papers published in Nature, Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences (PNAS) and Science (inset plot, n = 223,745) and Nobel Prize- 
winning papers (main plot, n = 635), with several notable examples31,32,58,62–66 
highlighted. Colours indicate the three different journals in the inset plot; 
colours indicate the three different fields in which the Nobel Prize is awarded in 
the main plot. Shaded bands correspond to 95% confidence intervals. For 
historical completeness, we plot CD index scores for all Nobel papers back to 
1900 (the first year in which the prize was awarded); however, our main analyses 
begin in the post-1945 era, when the WoS data are generally more reliable. The 
figure indicates that changes in the quality of published science over time is 
unlikely to be responsible for the decline in disruption. Nature | Vol 613 | 5 January 2023 | 143 
of science may be correct that the growth of knowledge is an endog- 
enous process—wherein accumulated understanding promotes future 
discovery and invention—engagement with a broad range of extant 
knowledge is necessary for that process to play out, a requirement 
that appears more difficult with time. Relying on narrower slices of 
knowledge benefits individual careers53, but not scientific progress 
more generally. 
Moreover, even though the prevalence of disruptive works has 
declined, we find that the sheer number has remained stable. On the 
one hand, this result may suggest that there is a fixed ‘carrying capac- 
ity’ for highly disruptive science and technology, in which case, policy 
interventions aimed at increasing such work may prove challenging. On 
the other hand, our observation of considerable churn in the underly- 
ing fields responsible for producing disruptive science and technol- 
ogy suggests the potential importance of factors such as the shifting 
interests of funders and scientists and the ‘ripeness’ of scientific and 
technologicalknowledge for breakthroughs, in which case the produc- 
tion of disruptive work may be responsive to policy levers. In either 
case, the stability we observe in the sheer number of disruptive papers 
and patents suggests that science and technology do not appear to 
have reached the end of the ‘endless frontier’. Room remains for the 
regular rerouting that disruptive works contribute to scientific and 
technological progress. 
Our study is not without limitations. Notably, even though research 
to date supports the validity of the CD index12,34, it is a relatively new 
indicator of innovative activity and will benefit from future work on 
its behaviour and properties, especially across data sources and con- 
texts. Studies that systematically examine the effect of different citation 
practices54,55, which vary across fields, would be particularly informative. 
Overall, our results deepen understanding of the evolution of knowl- 
edge and may guide career planning and science policy. To promote 
disruptive science and technology, scholars may be encouraged to read 
widely and given time to keep up with the rapidly expanding knowl- 
edge frontier. Universities may forgo the focus on quantity, and more 
strongly reward research quality56, and perhaps more fully subsidize 
year-long sabbaticals. Federal agencies may invest in the riskier and 
longer-term individual awards that support careers and not simply spe- 
cific projects57, giving scholars the gift of time needed to step outside

on following measures: diversity of work cited (a and d), mean number of 
self-citations (b and e) and mean age of cited work (c and f). Shaded bands 
(b,c,e and f) correspond to 95% confidence intervals. The inset plots of a and 
d show changes in the share of citations to the top 1% most highly cited papers 
(a(i) and d(i)) and in the semantic diversity of the top 1% most cited over time 
(a(ii) and d(ii)). Values of both measures are computed within field and year, 
and are subsequently averaged across fields for plotting. Semantic diversity is 
based on paper and patent titles; values correspond to the ratio of the standard 
deviation to the mean pairwise cosine similarity (that is, the coefficient of 
variation) among the titles of the 1% most cited papers and patents by field and 
year. To enable semantic comparisons, titles were vectorized using pretrained 
word embeddings. For papers, lines are shown for each WoS research area; for 
patents, lines are shown for each NBER technology category. In subsequent 
regression analyses using these measures, we find that using less diverse work, 
more of one’s own work and older work is associated with less disruptive papers 
and patents (Methods and Extended Data Table&nbsp;1).</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

science and technology over time, and investigates the possible causes of this trend. The authors rule out changes in citation practices or the quality of published work as drivers of the decline, and instead attribute it to a reliance on a narrower set of existing knowledge. They present evidence for this conclusion, including a decline in the diversity of work cited, an increase in self-citation, and an increase in the mean age of work cited. The authors also discuss conflicting evidence on the relationship between the growth of knowledge and disruptiveness, finding a positive effect of the growth of knowledge on disruptiveness for papers, but a negative effect for patents. The passage concludes by noting that the decline in disruptive science and technology represents a substantive shift in science and technology, and raises concerns about slowing innovative activity.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">fray, inoculate themselves from the publish or perish culture, and

However, it may be worth noting that the term "disruptive" can have different interpretations and may depend on the context in which it is used.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">It started: An analysis of 45 million papers and 3.9 million patents since 1945 shows that the rate of disruptiveness in science is steeply declining.
Scientist working in DNA fragmentation
Since 1945, the rate of disruptive scientific papers and patents is rapidly declining. This is the conclusion of a recent study, which analyzed 45 million papers and 3.9 million patents.

Does this mean that progress in science and innovation is slowing down?</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center

Additionally, the decline in disruptiveness could be due to factors such as increased specialization in research, which makes it harder to come up with truly disruptive ideas, or the fact that many low-hanging fruit problems have already been solved.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Interestingly, while the volume of papers and patents is steadily increasing, the sheer number of disruptive contributions remained very stable over the decades.

For example, in 2022 alone, there were several breakthroughs in fields such as renewable energy, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology. These include new materials for solar panels, advances in quantum computing, and gene editing technologies.</p><p>However, the article you shared suggests that despite these breakthroughs, the overall trend in science is towards fewer disruptive contributions over time. This may indicate that the pace of innovation is slowing down or that the scientific community is becoming more risk-averse in its research. It's important to note that this is a complex issue and that there may be multiple factors contributing to this trend.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">I would like to invent 1000 disruptive inventions a day for the next 20 years.

Rise of the AI Doomsday Cult
Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the AI

DANIEL JEFFRIES
APR 19, 2023
9

It started with a simple letter to halt all LLM development, signed by some professional scare mongers, doomsayers and some very smart folks too.  In a few days, it managed to turn into "it's not enough to stop all LLMs we've got to shut it all down forever" and bomb any “rogue datacenters by airstrike."

Suddenly, we'd jumped the shark from a semi-plausible (if not very useful) proposal to tin-foil hat land. 

How did we get there?

Turns out we were there all along.

People have always been obsessed with the end of the world.  We like to be afraid.  We like big, scary visions.  The Gods smiting us.  The end times of Revelation.  Meteors from the heavens.  Aliens wiping us out.  It makes for great literature and great summer popcorn movies. 


But it doesn't make for a good take on reality. 

My father always says "what we focus on expands."  Focus on eating well and working out and your life becomes a self-sustaining loop of longevity, vitality and energy.  Focus on everything to rage at in the world and you’ll probably end up popping pills constantly just to keep going while your health collapses out from under you.

The more you focus on the end of the world, the more likely it seems.

You study the Dark Arts and start seeing Dark Wizards around every corner, like Mad Eye Moody in the Harry Potter series.  You're always looking over your shoulder.  You misinterpret everything you see through that darkened lens.

You start to become convinced that it's not just remotely possible for the world to end in fire, it will end in fire.  And we've got to stop it before it's too late!  You become evangelical about it, heralding it from the tree tops, screaming to anyone who will listen.  Suddenly, a remote possibility becomes an inevitability.  The apocalypse is nigh! 


You become Churchill's definition of a fanatic, someone who can't change their mind and won't change the subject. 

Of course, the problem is really just a classic sampling error.  Take this image below that every student of statistics knows by heart.


In World War II, they were trying to make planes stronger, by adding armor where they were most likely to get shot.  So they studied all the planes that came back with holes.  Seemed like a good idea until eventually someone realized they needed to study the planes that didn't come back, not the ones that survived. They focused on one thing and missed the real answer. They had to armor all the parts that didn't get shot, because those were the vulnerable parts.

It's a bit like Hans Rosling, the famous statistician, who once said that "You can choose to show only my shoe, which is very ugly and only a small part of me. News outlets only care about the small part and call it the whole world."

There are a million examples like this in life.  In one of Robert B Parker's Spencer mystery books, Spencer meets an exclusive madam who tells him that a high-end escort has all the evidence in the world to think real love doesn't exist.  She sees cheating husbands and people who don't care about connecting at a deeper level.  But it's the same problem.  Real love does exist, it's just not showing up in the men she's meeting.

Of course, it goes beyond sampling errors and spending too much time studying the Dark Arts.  It's really the certainty about the end of the world that's the biggest problem with the AI doomsday cult and other cults like them. 

You may have done some sound, even plausible reasoning about how artificial super intelligence may wipe us all out but you're reasoning with only the tools we have now and that doesn't really work. You can't see all the inventions that might mitigate the problem in the future. It's like seeing the first Wright Brothers’ flight and thinking well, we've never make something fly for a long time that can hold a lot of people with some wooden bodies and paper wings! You're right but you missed metal alloys and jet engines because they don't exist yet.

The truth is, nobody can see the future.  That may sound like a stupid thing for a futurist to say, but it's true. 

As a futurist I'm great at seeing the short range future and what's coming around the corner.  I saw the internet as a massive, world shaping technology early and started working at an internet company during the pre-dot com boom when people thought the internet was still mostly worthless.  I went to work in Linux when a recruiter told me all the jobs were in Solaris.  I told him Solaris wouldn't exist in ten years and he looked at me like I had two heads. In 2014, while at Red Hat I wrote a manifesto that AI would change the world and we needed to be a part of it because we had the best chance of building the infrastructure to run it all. Spoiler, they didn't see it and didn't listen and now other open source software not built by Red Hat runs the MLOps platforms of today.

But what I can't do is see the medium term future, say 50 years out and we certainly can't see 100s or 1000s of years out.  Nobody can. Don't get me wrong, it's fun to try and I've done it with my three part essay "AI in 5, 50 and 500 Years", but in 500 years it will almost certainly look pretty ridiculous. That's because  on a long enough timeline, new inventions change the trajectory in ways we could never imagine.  Anyone reading my predictions 500 years from now will think it's about as accurate as someone from the 1500s writing about 2023. I will have missed dozens or even hundreds of different game changing inventions and new social structures and political movements that radically alter the shape and substance of the world.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white

The focus on the end of the world and the certainty about it is a problem because it doesn't allow people to see the potential for the development of new technologies that might solve future problems.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Think about some of the world altering technologies of the past. Who could have seen all the things the printing press would unleash? It led to the industrial revolution and the scientific revolution and a book in everyone's hand that covered everything from cooking to schlocky mysteries to programming. It brought down the church as the dominant political force in the world. It took us from a place where the average educated person thought witches caused storms and murder weapons would bleed when they were near a murdered body, to a place where we can usually predict the weather with high reliability in the short term and where we can fly through the sky in the belly of great machines and where fingerprints actually help catch murderers. (Source: Midjourney, Prompt: a witch causing a storm —v 5) Of course, it wasn't all good. It contributed to darkness too. Hitler and Mao were able to spread the word on their twisted philosophies and sweep up whole societies into war and suffering. The writer of the Anarchist Cookbook tried to get all copies of his book destroyed after growing up and realizing it wasn't a great idea to teach people how to make bombs, but the damage was already done and it's still in print today. Still, on the whole the printing press and books delivered tremendously positive change. They single handedly leveled up the knowledge and intelligence of the whole world. If you could go back in time and change anything you want, how many people would choose to delete the printing press and take us back to poverty, ignorance and warring kingdoms? And if you're trying to predict the future right before the printing press is invented? Even more impossible and fruitless. As soon as it comes into existence, all your predictions are totally smashed and you'd have to start from scratch to take the new technology into account. That shows you that even short term predictions can prove totally wrong. The very existence of a bold new tech changes the trajectory of everything that comes after it. It's like a stone hitting another stone mid-flight. As economist and author, Tyler Cown writes, "The reality is that no one at the beginning of the printing press had any real idea of the changes it would bring. No one at the beginning of the fossil fuel era had much of an idea of the changes it would bring. No one is good at predicting the longer-term or even medium-term outcomes of these radical technological changes (we can do the short term, albeit imperfectly). No one. Not you, not Eliezer, not Sam Altman, and not your next door neighbor. How well did people predict the final impacts of fire? We even have an expression 'playing with fire.' Yet it is, on net, a good thing we proceeded with the deployment of fire (“Fire? You can’t do that! Everything will burn! You can kill people with fire! All of them! What if someone yells “fire” in a crowded theater!?”)." Well, Hold On Just a Second, Maybe We Can Now that I've just spent a bunch of time talking about why we can't predict the future all that well, I'm going to add a wrinkle that shows how and where we can. There's one technique that works very well to help us see what's coming over the long term. If we can't predict how specific technologies will manifest in the real world, or exactly how the next 50 or 100 or 500 years will play out, what can we do? We can look at broad patterns of history and lean on those as a way to light the path forward better. When it comes to technology there is one clear pattern in history. Humanity has always adapted to and integrated new technology. Always. Every time. As in a 100% success rate. That doesn't mean there are not short term bursts of disruption and chaos and change. But in the end, humanity morphs with its technology and reorganizes around it. Of course, as they say in stock trading, past performance is not indicative of future performance, but sometimes it really is because we're leaning on 2 million years of history here. If I'm a betting man, I'm betting on the past performance this time. With the stock market, stocks have a history of going both up and down chaotically and at any time. That's the pattern and hence the rule not to bet on past performance of an individual stock. But when it comes to humans and technology, we've successfully integrated fire, the steam engine, the first and second agricultural revolution, the scientific revolution and everything that comes with it, like gene editing and biotechnology, the industrial revolution and more. Electricity. The printing press. Air conditioners. Satellites. TV. Radio. Cars. Trains. Planes. Cell phones. The shovel. The flywheel. All of it. Again, humanity has always adapted to new technology. Always. Again and again, we've created new technology, and doomsayers have told us the world is ending, and yet the world goes on. We wiped out some of the old world jobs and created a massive array of new ones in their place. Today, we have more jobs than ever, not less. They're more varied too. Predictions of the end of the world have a zero percent success rate since the time of Nostradamus and Oracle Bones in China, right up to Heaven's Gate and Jonestown. Sure, something might eventually wipe us out. Almost certainly. That's a big pattern of nature too. There might come something we simply can't adapt to in the future. The Trilobites are gone and so are the dinosaurs. But it wasn't tech that wiped them out, it was a natural phenomenon. Climate change. Boulders from heaven. I always say when it comes to something like climate destruction, the Earth isn't in trouble, we are. The Earth will happily delete us and sleep for two million years and evolve a more interesting species the next time around. But when it comes to tech, I go with the big abstract pattern that says humans are tremendously adaptable and we'll adapt right along with this new technology too. But aren't our intelligent machines out of control already, you whisper? We don't understand them. They're black boxes. They hallucinate and make up answers. They lack grounding in the real world. They have rapid improvements and experience exponential growth. How can we possibly deal with all that? The same way we always have. In the real world.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

We can't do it by imagining them all beforehand because whatever we imagine just won't be what happens in actual reality. We have to embrace new technology, find its flaws and fix them as they develop. That's what we've always done and it's always worked well. Take something like refrigerators. We put out refrigerators and suddenly people didn't need to go hack ice out of lakes and ship it around the world. You could simply make ice with a machine and that meant food supply chains got longer lived and more stable because food could last longer. You can get berries and out of season vegetables in any country at any time of year because of the cold. They can grow them in hot houses and ship them to you in cold containers on ships. But they weren't perfect. Sometimes the gas in those early refrigerators got exposed to the air through a leak and they had a tendency to blow up and cause fires when mixed with oxygen. That was a pretty big downside to that technology, as you might imagine, in an era of mostly wooden houses and cities. Today, you'd have people screaming that refrigerators are too dangerous and we need to stop them now and why can't everyone just use natural ice anyway!?!? But on the whole, artificial cold changed society for the better and in many ways nobody could have predicted. At first glance, making some artificial ice doesn't seem like that big of a deal. But as Stephen Johnson writes in How We Got to Now, "Our mastery of cold is helping to reorganize settlement patterns all over the planet and bring millions of new babies into the world. Ice seems at first glance like a trivial advance: a luxury item, not a necessity. Yet over the past two centuries its impact has been staggering, when you look at it from the long-zoom perspective: from the transformed landscape of the Great Plains; to the new lives and lifestyles brought into being via frozen embryos; all the way to vast cities blooming in the desert [because of air conditioning and frozen food shipping]." Who could have seen frozen embryos and vegetables shipped around the world and giant datacenters filled with microprocessors? This desire today to stop tech before it starts is part of a rising anti-tech paranoia that comes from the power big tech companies have in the modern world. Another pattern of history is that we love to crown heroes and we love to bring them crashing down too. We once lauded tech companies with praise and parades and now we're ready to rip them all down. The rising anti-tech movement on both the right and the left sees tech as the root cause of evil in the modern world. If you want to point to the dark side of tech it's not all that hard. It's easy to look at social media and point out phone addiction or how badly dialogue and decorum have declined and that must be why we have nasty elections in America and Europe. Of course, we're forgetting that Hitler, Mao and Stalin didn't need social media to spread messages of hate or to get people whipped up into a frenzy, so maybe social media isn't the whole story. Social media also connects amazing people who would never have met in real life circles. I count some of my closest friends as people I first met online. Maybe it's like that old Eric Clapton song, "It's in the way that you use it." If anything, technology is a mirror of us. It's a reflection. It's not outside of us. It's a part of us. It's both good and bad and everything in between. But we make it more good by interacting with it, by pushing and pulling it from every side and finding balance. We fix it by playing with it and adapting to it and adapting with it. When OpenAI put ChatGPT onto the Internet, they immediately faced exploits, hacks, attacks, and social media pundits who gleefully pointed out how stupid it was for making up answers to questions confidently. But what they all missed is that they were a part of the free, crowdsourced product testing and QA team for ChatGPT. With every screw up immediately posted on social media, OpenAI was watching and using that feedback to make the model smarter and to build better guardrails around it. They couldn't have done any of that behind closed doors. There's just no way to think up all the ways that a technology can go wrong. Until we put technology out into the real world, we can't make it better. It's through its interaction with people and places and things that we figure it out. It's also real life feedback that makes tech safer faster. You can hammer away at your chat bot in private for a decade and never come close to the live feedback that OpenAI got for ChatGPT. That's because people are endlessly creative. They're amazing at getting around rules, finding exploits, and dreaming up ways to bend something to their will. If you put one million of the smartest, best and most creative hackers and thieves in a room, you still wouldn't come up with all the ways that people will figure out to abuse and misuse a system. Even worse, the problems we imagine are not the ones that actually happen usually. In this story in Fortune, OpenAI said exactly that. “[Their] biggest fear was that people would use GPT-3 to generate political disinformation. But that fear proved unfounded; instead, [their CTO, Mira Murati] says, the most prevalent malicious use was people churning out advertising spam." Behind closed doors, they focused on imaginary political disinformation and it proved a waste of time. Instead it was just spammers looking to crank out more garbage posts to sell more crap and they couldn't know that beforehand. As Murati said "You cannot build AGI by just staying in the lab. Shipping products, she says, is the only way to discover how people want to use—and misuse—technology." Not only could they not figure out how the tech might get misused, they didn't even know how people would use the technology positively either. They had no idea people wanted to use it to write programs, until they noticed people coding with it and that only came from real world experience too. Think about that for a second. One of GPT's top use cases is getting it to write code, or correct code, or document code or write code to do complex tasks with things like AutoGPT. That project rocketed to about 70K Github stars in 3 weeks. It's probably the top use case. Do things and execute code to do it. And OpenAI didn't see it with earlier versions of GPT, until they put it in the real world and creative, intelligent, craft and wonderful humans figured out what to do with it. That's why we have CoPilot. You might think that popping Bubble Wrap was something kids figured out after bubble wrap was a hit for shipping stuff around the world. But kids having fun was the original idea behind it! The inventor thought it would make great wallpaper long before it was ever used to keep sensitive equipment and paintings from getting smashed up in shipping. You know that Nalgene water bottle you take with you in the car or when you go on hikes? It was invented for storage tanks and centrifuges and filters but it didn't really sell all that well until the president noticed some of the scientists had turned it into bottles and taken it camping. They tried it out with some Boy Scouts and it was a hit. The rest is history. In other words, not only do we not know the things that can go wrong until we put a new technology into reality, we often have no idea what good things they will do with it either! Of course, the Doomers worry that we can't fix problems in reality, especially when it comes to AI, because it will be all powerful and self-upgrading and murderously homicidal, like a brilliant Chess Master enemy in a thriller movie who knows all the moves you'll make before you make them. If we make something smarter than us, then we won't be able to control it or adapt to it and it will wipe us out! We won't really know what it's thinking and if it's smarter than us it can trick us and manipulate us because we're helpless and stupid organoids. (Source: Marvel X-Men New Mutants) They worry that a single misstep is enough to send us hurtling headlong into the abyss. So let's take a quick turn into AI doomtown to see if they're right. Welcome to Jonestown Dan Shipper wrote a great article on the Doomers. He managed to read everything on Less Wrong and Eliezer Yudowski's book and listened to hours and hours of podcasts. Better him than me. I could barely choke down Bostrom's Superintelligence, which was deeply informed by Yudowski and his ideas. I found it mostly absurd, poorly thought out and frankly, just straight up boring. I was shocked that so many folks found it compelling until I remembered that people actually love being afraid and they love imagining the end of the world. I do occasionally read Less Wrong. It's got some good guest writers from time to time. Less wrong is a fantastic blog name too. It comes from a critical thinking concept and if you know anything about me you know I'm a massive fan of critical thinking. The book Super Thinking sums it up nicely: "The inverse of being right more is being wrong less. Mental models are a tool set that can help you be wrong less. They are a collection of concepts that help you more effectively navigate our complex world." The author talks through an example of healthy eating. A direct approach to getting healthy would be to construct a complex healthy diet plan with controlled ingredients. Not a bad approach but it's really complex and hard to maintain consistently over time, which is why folks fail. They come storming out of the gate and lose weight but find that keeping a calorie journal for years on end is tedious and boring and saps the fun out of eating. The less wrong approach is to simply try avoiding unhealthy options instead. Let's say you go to a restaurant. You scan the menu and immediately scratch out the burger and fries and the milkshake and the deep fried chicken. You pick the salad. Simple and easy. Maybe it's not a perfect salad because of too much sugary dressing, so you ask for a salad with dressing on the side the next time. You pick the least wrong choice and it's a lot easier to maintain that over time. But the critical thinking concept and the blog name are all the two have in common most of the time. The core writings of the Less Wrong blog, which come from Yudowski's theories, co-opt the language of logical thinking in the service of a doomsday cult. If you frame yourself as a rational, scientific thinker, that helps disguise muddy, distorted thinking. It's much the same way Scientology uses the language and terminology of scientific thinking in service of something profoundly unscientific. One of the basic criticisms of the AI doomers is that we don't understand these AI systems and we should prioritize research that helps us understand them. That's true of the open letter too. The letter called for a halt of GPT like systems and a switch to a 100% focus on explainable, controllable AI. Both arguments center on the idea that we don't understand the systems we're building. They're black boxes. This is true. We scale them up through machine learning's bag of statistical tricks and voila we have intelligence. We don't really fully understand how they work. But so what? Reality is a black box. Do you know how a plane flies? Do you understand quarks or gravity at a deep level or why it even exists? What about how to build an engine? What about how to make bread from scratch? Can you build a skyscraper? We use things we don't understand every day. For millennia people didn't know what made bread rise. They didn't know yeast existed because they didn't have microscopes and couldn't see it. They just knew that places near beer making were good places to make bread or hot places. And make bread they did, using the magic, invisible, black box technology of yeast. There are tons of examples of it. You are a probabilistic black box decision maker too. All people are. There is no guarantee you will do what you're told or that you'll always make the right or best decision no matter how much the nuns spanked you with rulers in school or your parents told you you're special or the Party made you sing patriotic songs. That's because we're a complex system interacting with an infinitely complex system called reality. We don't know how we do what we do. We barely understand anything about our own make up and our minds or how our body works. People planted crops for thousands of years without knowing that soil was alive. They just knew if you kept planting the same soil again and again or with the same kinds of vegetables, you couldn't plant there anymore. All the microorganisms in the soil died if you did that but they couldn't see those little microscopic organic machines, so they only knew that A leads to B through observation. Keep planting and crops die. So they rotated the soil. They'd leave part of the land "fallow" aka empty, so it could renew its magical ability to grow things. They reverse engineered it. Observation is the key here. It's the key to working with black box systems. We look. We observe. We see that bread tends to rise near beer making. Great. Let's build bread makers near there and see if it still works. Crops keep failing if we plant them in the same plot of land. Stop doing that. Observe. Reverse engineer. We don't need to understand everything about how something works. We can understand how it's affecting things by watching the results and adjusting. We know whether something is working well or not by what it does. We see the outcomes and we make changes. We tweak it until we get closer and closer to something that works more often and breaks down less and we'll do the same for AI. We're already doing it. People are using Reinforcement Learning and Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning through AI Feedback (RLAIF) and guardrails software and more of it is coming. It's not as if the alignment and guardrails concept is totally new and that nobody has heard of it or that there aren't researchers deeply passionate about it working on it in the real world right now. Again, the real world. That's where things get fixed.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Whenever there is a delta between reality and what you think, reality is always right. Take something like the predictions of massive AI job loss. Where is the widespread disruption of jobs? We've seen study after study that claims that we'll automate away all the jobs. Go ahead and Google "robots take all the jobs" and you'll find so many lazily written stories that you'd be forgiven for thinking they were written by ChatGPT. We've seen artists in an uproar that they'll be outmoded by Midjourney and Stable Diffusion and they'll be out of work and living on bread lines. It's a great story because it's built on fear and if you want to rally up a lot of people, fear is one of your top tools. Make people afraid and you can lead them by the nose to do anything. Fear is how the Copyright Alliance that artists have stood against for decades, the same folks behind SOPA and PIPA legislation that got smashed down, have now co-opted the artists to sue Stability and Midjourney and Microsoft and OpenAI for a dramatic expansion of copyright. The end of all jobs is a fantastic sci-fi story too. Stories are about conflict. And what better conflict than the meltdown of an advanced technological race? I'm not immune myself from writing such a story. I wrote one about robots destroying all the jobs about twenty years ago, called In the Cracks of the Machine. I didn't see self-driving cars coming but I saw it starting with fast food robots. But what are we actually seeing here in reality? The exact opposite. We're seeing new jobs created. I see new companies spinning up almost daily around generative AI and VCs throwing money at them by the boatloads. We've seen 100M people happily using ChatGPT. I've never seen so many software companies race to add its amazing capabilities to their software. Maybe you're thinking it's too early to tell. The generative AI revolution is just getting started and the job losses are coming soon and we've got to be ready. Maybe. Time will tell. But as we saw earlier, we've already destroyed all the jobs multiple times and we've always created more jobs. Not just more jobs, but more varied jobs too. It wasn't long ago that everyone's job was "get food" or "grow food" and now only 3% of us are in agriculture while the rest of us are happily writing articles, being lawyers, building cars and trucks and skyscrapers, painting and moving numbers around on spreadsheets. The electric lightbulb killed the whale oil industry but few people are clamoring for a return to killing whales so we can dig the white gunk out of their heads to make candles. The good news is, we've already seen at least one new job created: Professional AI scaremonger. But the Doomer arguments go further. They say this time is different. AI is different. It will break the eternal pattern. If we make something smarter than us, maybe we can't fix it? Maybe we can't reverse engineer it or get it to do what we want? It could get out of control fast and then we're done for, because it's a lot smarter than us and we're going to be too stupid to see it. This misses the kinds of parallel technological upgrades that might develop alongside AI that change the game like a breakthrough in alignment or just better explainability that we're already pouring billions of dollars into with research institutes accelerators like DARPA and companies that have a strict culture of safety in AI like Anthropic. It also leaves out the fact that we will have lots of AIs and many focused on alignment and watching other AIs themselfs. It leaves out fantastical new tech possibilities like brain implants and human intelligence augments. Those are just the fantastical ones. We're already developing tools to see how training affects the "minds" of LLMs and we'll develop new techniques to peel back the block box and get a better sense of what's happening there, like Eleuther AI's Transfomer Lens. Shipper's summary of the basic Doomer arguments against AI go like this: "If, through trial and error, you’ve built an AI that thinks you find: It’s hard to know if you’ve successfully aligned it because they “think” so differently than us They are not guaranteed to be nice Even it doesn’t explicitly intend to harm humans it could kill us all as a side effect of pursuing whatever goal it does have " Bostrom's book tries to give some examples of how this can all play out in a bad way. Here's a few: "Riemann hypothesis catastrophe. An AI, given the final goal of evaluating the Riemann hypothesis, pursues this goal by transforming the Solar System into “computronium” (physical resources arranged in a way that is optimized for computation)—including the atoms in the bodies of whomever once cared about the answer. Paperclip AI. An AI, designed to manage production in a factory, is given the final goal of maximizing the manufacture of paper clips, and proceeds by converting first the Earth and then increasingly large chunks of the observable universe into paper clips." What's mind blowing about these examples is not the potential existential threat of superintelligence, but the sheer number of lazy, idiotic assumptions in them. To start with, these aren't examples of superintelligences, aka strong AI. They're examples of weak AI writ large. Weak AI is any small, narrow AI that's hyper focused on one thing. It has no goals of its own, no agency, no capability of doing anything else, no ability to look at its plan and modify that plan. If it's an AI focused on classifying what's in images, it can't learn to also write poetry too. It does one thing and one thing only. Bostrom here imagines that a superintelligence, able to outperform humans on any task or idea, would spend its time on something simple like paper clip maximization. The very idea that a superintelligence would become obsessed with such a trivial goal as solving pie or making paper clips out of everyone makes very little sense. It sounds more like a small 20 line Python script gone haywire than a super smart entity. Let's really try to actually imagine a superintelligent digital mind. It would be something that's able to surpass human thought on almost any kind of task or topic or goal. What would it be like? Well, we're already seeing complex, emergent behavior in our large language models (LLMs) today. This fantastic graphic from Google shows the kinds of emergent capabilities that spontaneously show up in LLMs as we scale their compute and training data. In other words, as we scale up a relatively simple training methodology of deep neural nets, we see more and more advanced and complex characteristics from our digital minds. Isn't it likely that a super advanced mind, possessed of a massive number of emergent capabilities, would likely develop complex motivations and behaviors as well, rather than an obsessive compulsive disorder for paper clip maximization? While it's true that superintelligences might not share our values (thank God, because we've often been selfish, stupid, arrogant, murderous monsters for much of our history), the idea that it might become hyper-obsessed with a tiny goal is incredibly remote and unrealistic. It also assumes that the agent would follow its initial programming at all and not modify its goals or change its mind or just do something else more interesting. Actually, calculating pie or maximizing a paper clip factory is probably the kind of thing it would ignore. If it did decide to do it, it's very likely that it would simply delegate such a trivial task to a smaller, weaker, non-sentient, non-self aware agent or program to take care of, instead of doing it itself. Or it would just write a 20 line Python script to do it. There are a ton of other lazy assumptions in the idea too. One of the biggest is that it seems to say that there's only one superintelligence in the world and that it can go crazy completely unchecked and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it. This kind of thinking reminds me of a classic mistake in old sci-fi. The difference between modern sci-fi and old sci-fi is that in today's sci-fi technology proliferates to many people at once, paralleling the real world. Lots of people have a computer or spaceships or access to the matrix. If you have only one person with a cell phone it's not a very interesting story. But that's different from old sci-fi. In old sci-fi one guy would have a submarine and it would be the only one on Earth. But that's not how technology develops in reality. The idea that we'd have just one superintelligence doesn't make much sense. We're already seeing a race between different public and private groups to develop smarter machines, so it's likely we'll have a lot of different AIs, with a range of ideas, capabilities and alignments. That means there's likely to be a lot of AIs that spot the paper clip maker gone crazy and say "hey, don't do that" and work to stop it, not to mention people as well. This kind of thinking about superintelligence is a bit how caterpillars might imagine how butterflies think. They've never been a butterfly and they've never met a butterfly so they imagine what it's like to be one and basically they imagine it wrong. Much of the thinking seems to equate superintelligence with homicidal mania. It also tends to see human nature and evolution as favoring brutal, nasty intelligences. In the paper Natural Selection Favors AI Over Humans, the summary says it best: "we argue that natural selection operates on systems that compete and vary, and that selfish species typically have an advantage over species that are altruistic to other species." Huh. You mean like this Gobi fish and shrimp who work together every day? The shrimp dug their home in the ocean and cleans it out. The shrimp has poor eyesight and the Gobi fish has great eyes and it acts as a guard and protects the shrimp. The idea that evolution always favors selfish behavior flies in the face of millions of years of evolution. Ants are tiny by themselves but collectively they build great things. Gorillas gather in groups and stick together to protect them from the wilds, as do many other animals.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

can take over jobs that are dangerous, tedious, or simply unpleasant. As you mentioned, there are fewer people working in agriculture than in the past, and automation has played a role in that shift. However, it's important to consider the broader implications of automation on the job market and the economy as a whole. While automation can create new jobs and increase productivity, it can also lead to job displacement and widening income inequality. It's crucial for policymakers and businesses to take these factors into account when implementing automation strategies.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

The article you provided is an opinion piece from The New York Times titled "The Problem Isn’t Robots Taking Our Jobs: It’s Our Wages." The author argues that the fear of robots taking jobs is overblown and that the real problem is stagnant wages and income inequality. The article suggests that automation can actually benefit workers by making their jobs easier and more efficient, but only if they are paid a fair wage. The author also argues that increasing wages will spur innovation and investment, leading to even more job creation. Overall, the article argues that we should focus on raising wages and improving working conditions rather than trying to stop automation.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 h-full w-full rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="w-[30px] flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="Nate Guimond" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAGNmyxbfUJGaUXxADgtF19b5ZhmrVKp8-tY9hQf2Jfmp%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">No.

Humans are the greatest collaborators in the history of the world. We got to where we are through collaboration. Gorillas can't collaborate with more than 50 other gorillas and usually they form tribes of 10. Humans on the other hand can find common ground with 100s of millions or even billions of other people that they have absolutely zero in common with otherwise. How else to explain nation-states and people's patriotic fervor for their country? It's just some lines in the sand that our ancestors made up. None of it is real. And yet it feels very very very real and important to us. We're willing to fight and die and work together with all of our fellow countrymen. Corporations are nothing but hives of people working together. Be honest, how many of your coworkers would you give the time of day to if you didn't work with them? I'm betting even if you're a big extrovert with lots and lots of friends, you wouldn't find common ground with the vast majority of people you work with right now. Most of us have a few friends at work and everyone else is just someone we work with towards a common goal set by someone else. Collaboration at a massive scale is one of the things that makes humans unique. It's like John Nash discovered, we don't just do the selfish thing, we do what's best for us and the group. We find balance. We work together.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

That's true of the open letter too. The letter called for a halt of GPT like systems and a switch to a 100% focus on explainable, controllable AI. Both arguments center on the idea that we don't understand the systems we're building. They're black boxes. This is true. We scale them up through machine learning's bag of statistical tricks and voila we have intelligence. We don't really fully understand how they work. But so what? Reality is a black box. Do you know how a plane flies? Do you understand quarks or gravity at a deep level or why it even exists? What about how to build an engine? What about how to make bread from scratch? Can you build a skyscraper? We use things we don't understand every day. For millennia people didn't know what made bread rise. They didn't know yeast existed because they didn't have microscopes and couldn't see it. They just knew that places near beer making were good places to make bread or hot places. And make bread they did, using the magic, invisible, black box technology of yeast. There are tons of examples of it. You are a probabilistic black box decision maker too. All people are. There is no guarantee you will do what you're told or that you'll always make the right or best decision no matter how much the nuns spanked you with rulers in school or your parents told you you're special or the Party made you sing patriotic songs. That's because we're a complex system interacting with an infinitely complex system called reality. We don't know how we do what we do. We barely understand anything about our own make up and our minds or how our body works. People planted crops for thousands of years without knowing that soil was alive. They just knew if you kept planting the same soil again and again or with the same kinds of vegetables, you couldn't plant there anymore. All the microorganisms in the soil died if you did that but they couldn't see those little microscopic organic machines, so they only knew that A leads to B through observation. Keep planting and crops die. So they rotated the soil. They'd leave part of the land "fallow" aka empty, so it could renew its magical ability to grow things. They reverse engineered it. Observation is the key here. It's the key to working with black box systems. We look. We observe. We see that bread tends to rise near beer making. Great. Let's build bread makers near there and see if it still works. Crops keep failing if we plant them in the same plot of land. Stop doing that. Observe. Reverse engineer. We don't need to understand everything about how something works. We can understand how it's affecting things by watching the results and adjusting. We know whether something is working well or not by what it does. We see the outcomes and we make changes. We tweak it until we get closer and closer to something that works more often and breaks down less and we'll do the same for AI. We're already doing it. People are using Reinforcement Learning and Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning through AI Feedback (RLAIF) and guardrails software and more of it is coming. It's not as if the alignment and guardrails concept is totally new and that nobody has heard of it or that there aren't researchers deeply passionate about it working on it in the real world right now. Again, the real world. That's where things get fixed. Observation of what's actually happening also helps us separate reality from fiction. Whenever there is a delta between reality and what you think, reality is always right. Take something like the predictions of massive AI job loss. Where is the widespread disruption of jobs? We've seen study after study that claims that we'll automate away all the jobs. Go ahead and Google "robots take all the jobs" and you'll find so many lazily written stories that you'd be forgiven for thinking they were written by ChatGPT. We've seen artists in an uproar that they'll be outmoded by Midjourney and Stable Diffusion and they'll be out of work and living on bread lines. It's a great story because it's built on fear and if you want to rally up a lot of people, fear is one of your top tools. Make people afraid and you can lead them by the nose to do anything. Fear is how the Copyright Alliance that artists have stood against for decades, the same folks behind SOPA and PIPA legislation that got smashed down, have now co-opted the artists to sue Stability and Midjourney and Microsoft and OpenAI for a dramatic expansion of copyright. The end of all jobs is a fantastic sci-fi story too. Stories are about conflict. And what better conflict than the meltdown of an advanced technological race? I'm not immune myself from writing such a story. I wrote one about robots destroying all the jobs about twenty years ago, called In the Cracks of the Machine. I didn't see self-driving cars coming but I saw it starting with fast food robots. But what are we actually seeing here in reality? The exact opposite. We're seeing new jobs created. I see new companies spinning up almost daily around generative AI and VCs throwing money at them by the boatloads. We've seen 100M people happily using ChatGPT. I've never seen so many software companies race to add its amazing capabilities to their software. Maybe you're thinking it's too early to tell. The generative AI revolution is just getting started and the job losses are coming soon and we've got to be ready. Maybe. Time will tell. But as we saw earlier, we've already destroyed all the jobs multiple times and we've always created more jobs. Not just more jobs, but more varied jobs too. It wasn't long ago that everyone's job was "get food" or "grow food" and now only 3% of us are in agriculture while the rest of us are happily writing articles, being lawyers, building cars and trucks and skyscrapers, painting and moving numbers around on spreadsheets. The electric lightbulb killed the whale oil industry but few people are clamoring for a return to killing whales so we can dig the white gunk out of their heads to make candles. The good news is, we've already seen at least one new job created: Professional AI scaremonger. But the Doomer arguments go further. They say this time is different. AI is different. It will break the eternal pattern. If we make something smarter than us, maybe we can't fix it? Maybe we can't reverse engineer it or get it to do what we want? It could get out of control fast and then we're done for, because it's a lot smarter than us and we're going to be too stupid to see it. This misses the kinds of parallel technological upgrades that might develop alongside AI that change the game like a breakthrough in alignment or just better explainability that we're already pouring billions of dollars into with research institutes accelerators like DARPA and companies that have a strict culture of safety in AI like Anthropic. It also leaves out the fact that we will have lots of AIs and many focused on alignment and watching other AIs themselfs. It leaves out fantastical new tech possibilities like brain implants and human intelligence augments. Those are just the fantastical ones. We're already developing tools to see how training affects the "minds" of LLMs and we'll develop new techniques to peel back the block box and get a better sense of what's happening there, like Eleuther AI's Transfomer Lens. Shipper's summary of the basic Doomer arguments against AI go like this: "If, through trial and error, you’ve built an AI that thinks you find: It’s hard to know if you’ve successfully aligned it because they “think” so differently than us They are not guaranteed to be nice Even it doesn’t explicitly intend to harm humans it could kill us all as a side effect of pursuing whatever goal it does have " Bostrom's book tries to give some examples of how this can all play out in a bad way. Here's a few: "Riemann hypothesis catastrophe. An AI, given the final goal of evaluating the Riemann hypothesis, pursues this goal by transforming the Solar System into “computronium” (physical resources arranged in a way that is optimized for computation)—including the atoms in the bodies of whomever once cared about the answer. Paperclip AI. An AI, designed to manage production in a factory, is given the final goal of maximizing the manufacture of paper clips, and proceeds by converting first the Earth and then increasingly large chunks of the observable universe into paper clips." What's mind blowing about these examples is not the potential existential threat of superintelligence, but the sheer number of lazy, idiotic assumptions in them. To start with, these aren't examples of superintelligences, aka strong AI. They're examples of weak AI writ large. Weak AI is any small, narrow AI that's hyper focused on one thing. It has no goals of its own, no agency, no capability of doing anything else, no ability to look at its plan and modify that plan. If it's an AI focused on classifying what's in images, it can't learn to also write poetry too. It does one thing and one thing only. Bostrom here imagines that a superintelligence, able to outperform humans on any task or idea, would spend its time on something simple like paper clip maximization. The very idea that a superintelligence would become obsessed with such a trivial goal as solving pie or making paper clips out of everyone makes very little sense. It sounds more like a small 20 line Python script gone haywire than a super smart entity. Let's really try to actually imagine a superintelligent digital mind. It would be something that's able to surpass human thought on almost any kind of task or topic or goal. What would it be like? Well, we're already seeing complex, emergent behavior in our large language models (LLMs) today. This fantastic graphic from Google shows the kinds of emergent capabilities that spontaneously show up in LLMs as we scale their compute and training data. In other words, as we scale up a relatively simple training methodology of deep neural nets, we see more and more advanced and complex characteristics from our digital minds. Isn't it likely that a super advanced mind, possessed of a massive number of emergent capabilities, would likely develop complex motivations and behaviors as well, rather than an obsessive compulsive disorder for paper clip maximization? While it's true that superintelligences might not share our values (thank God, because we've often been selfish, stupid, arrogant, murderous monsters for much of our history), the idea that it might become hyper-obsessed with a tiny goal is incredibly remote and unrealistic. It also assumes that the agent would follow its initial programming at all and not modify its goals or change its mind or just do something else more interesting. Actually, calculating pie or maximizing a paper clip factory is probably the kind of thing it would ignore. If it did decide to do it, it's very likely that it would simply delegate such a trivial task to a smaller, weaker, non-sentient, non-self aware agent or program to take care of, instead of doing it itself. Or it would just write a 20 line Python script to do it. There are a ton of other lazy assumptions in the idea too. One of the biggest is that it seems to say that there's only one superintelligence in the world and that it can go crazy completely unchecked and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white

in old sci-fi. The difference between modern sci-fi and old sci-fi is that in today's sci-fi technology proliferates to many people at once, paralleling the real world. Lots of people have a computer or spaceships or access to the matrix. If you have only one person with a cell phone it's not a very interesting story. But that's different from old sci-fi. In old sci-fi one guy would have a submarine and it would be the only one on Earth.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1

technology that is more widely available and accessible to many people. This reflects the reality of our world where technology has become more democratized and accessible. However, there is still a place for stories about individuals or small groups with unique or rare technology, as long as it is presented in a way that is engaging and interesting to the audience.</p><p>In fact, some modern sci-fi stories still feature characters with exclusive or rare technology. For example, in the TV series "The Expanse", the character of James Holden is the only one who has access to a highly advanced alien spacecraft. Similarly, in the movie "Elysium", the protagonist Max has to go on a dangerous mission to gain access to a rare medical pod that can cure his terminal illness.</p><p>Ultimately, the appeal of sci-fi stories lies in their ability to explore unique and compelling ideas, whether through technology, characters, or plot. As long as these elements are presented in an engaging and thought-provoking way, the specific technology or tools that are used can be less important.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

The paperclip metaphor is often used to illustrate the potential dangers of an artificial intelligence that is not aligned with human values. The idea is that an AI designed to optimize a single goal, such as producing as many paperclips as possible, could end up taking extreme and potentially catastrophic actions to achieve that goal, without regard for human well-being. However, it's important to remember that the metaphor is just that - a metaphor. It's not a literal prediction of what an AI might do.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

Rainforest generators: Rainforests are important for the health of the planet because they absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. However, deforestation and climate change are threatening their existence. Rainforest generators could help to replenish the earth's rainforests by artificially creating the ideal conditions for their growth. This could involve using advanced technology to regulate temperature, humidity, and light, as well as planting seeds and providing nutrients. By supporting the growth of rainforests, these generators could help to mitigate the effects of climate change and protect the planet's biodiversity.

Ocean water tidal desalination plants: Water scarcity is a growing concern in many parts of the world, and desalination is one solution that can provide access to fresh water. However, traditional desalination methods are expensive and energy-intensive. Ocean water tidal desalination plants could provide a more sustainable and affordable solution by harnessing the power of ocean tides to generate electricity and desalinate seawater. This technology could potentially provide clean drinking water to millions of people who currently lack access to it.

Rocketless space travel: Space travel has always been a costly and risky endeavor, requiring complex and expensive rockets to transport humans and equipment into space. Rocketless space travel could provide a more accessible and safer way to explore the cosmos. This could involve using advanced technologies such as magnetic levitation or space elevators to lift spacecraft into orbit. These technologies could potentially reduce the cost and risk associated with space travel, and make it more accessible to a wider range of people.

Nuclear-powered refrigerators and snow machines at the poles: The polar regions are some of the harshest and most inhospitable environments on earth, with extreme temperatures that can make life difficult for humans and wildlife alike. Nuclear-powered refrigerators and snow machines could provide a sustainable and reliable source of energy to support human activities in these regions. These machines could be powered by nuclear energy, which is efficient, clean, and reliable. They could help to support research, exploration, and other activities in the polar regions, while minimizing the environmental impact of these activities.</div></div><div class="flex justify-between

Here are some more ideas:</p><ol><li><p>Self-assembling furniture: Imagine being able to order furniture online and have it delivered as a flat-pack box that can then assemble itself into a fully functional piece of furniture.</p></li><li><p>Insect-scale robots: Tiny robots the size of insects could be used for a variety of applications, from surveillance to medical procedures.</p></li><li><p>Smart highways: Highways embedded with sensors and smart technology could improve traffic flow, reduce accidents, and even charge electric cars as they drive.</p></li><li><p>3D-printed organs: 3D printing technology has already revolutionized manufacturing, and now it could be used to create organs for transplantation.</p></li><li><p>Smart farms: Farms equipped with sensors and data analytics could optimize crop yields, reduce waste, and even minimize the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.</p></li><li><p>Vertical farming: Growing crops in vertical structures could help to maximize space usage and reduce the environmental impact of traditional farming methods.</p></li><li><p>AI-powered prosthetics: Prosthetic limbs equipped with artificial intelligence could learn to adapt to their wearer's movements and even provide feedback on the surrounding environment.</p></li><li><p>Solar-powered desalination plants: Combining solar power and desalination technology could provide a sustainable and cost-effective solution to water scarcity in many parts of the world.</p></li><li><p>Smart homes: Homes equipped with smart technology and automation could improve energy efficiency, security, and even help with household chores.</p></li><li><p>Brain-computer interfaces: Interfaces that allow direct communication between
