Entanglement was first clearly described, and named, in 1935, by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schr��dinger. He pointed out that, after two quantum particles interacted, they could no longer be considered independent of each other, as classical physics would have allowed. As the contemporary US physicist Leonard Susskind puts it in the preface to Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum (2014), ���one can know everything about a system and nothing about its individual parts.���

Here���s a simple analogy. If we want to give a complete description of the present state of a two-handed poker game, for example, we just give a description of the two five-card hands. What could be more obvious? But in QM, for some reason, the obvious thing doesn���t work.

Schr��dinger said that, in general, the quantum description of the two particles is ���entangled���, and the name stuck. As he puts it: ���When two separated bodies that each are maximally known come to interact, and then separate again, then such an entanglement of knowledge often happens.���

The full weirdness of entanglement wasn���t immediately obvious

Schr��dinger concluded elsewhere that entanglement is not ���one but rather the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics.��� Many physicists now agree. Susskind says it is ���the essential fact of quantum mechanics���, while in his Lectures on Quantum Mechanics (2013), Steven Weinberg writes that it is ���perhaps its weirdest feature���.

The full weirdness of entanglement wasn���t immediately obvious, and Schr��dinger himself didn���t quite live to see it. For him, its strangeness was the prohibition it imposed on describing a two-particle system by its parts. He thought that this had important consequences, especially because it debunked what had become the orthodox view of what QM is telling us about the microworld.

This orthodox view was the so-called Copenhagen Interpretation, proposed by the Danish physicist Niels Bohr. Bohr argued that it was nonsense to think of quantum systems as having definite properties, before they were measured. Like Einstein before him, Schr��dinger thought that entanglement proved Bohr wrong.

To grasp the Einstein-Schr��dinger argument, consider the two poker hands, now with some of the cards face down, hidden from view. The state of this game can no longer be described in terms of the known cards (the ones turned face up). At least superficially, this looks like entanglement: a full quantum system can���t be described in terms of what���s known about its pieces.

Moreover, when an additional card on one side is revealed, it changes our knowledge about the other hand. If the queen of hearts turns up in the hand on the left, say, then we know that it is not one of the hidden cards in the hand on the right. The same is true for entangled particles. Observing one gives us new knowledge about the other, even if it is a long way away.

Einstein and Schr��dinger argued that this meant that something is hidden inside these quantum systems prior to measurement ��� something not fully described by QM, and disallowed by Bohr���s view. They argued that, if measuring a nearby particle teaches us a new fact about a remote particle, this new fact must have existed already, even though the best QM description didn���t include it.

The alternative would be that the nearby measurement was changing the remote particle in some way. Schr��dinger thought that this was absurd: ���measurements on separated systems cannot affect one another directly, that would be magic [our emphasis].���

���It provides a gentle pillow for the true believer from which he cannot very easily be aroused���

Schr��dinger died in Vienna in 1961. Just three years later, the Northern Irish physicist John Stewart Bell argued that, if the predictions of QM are correct, then Schr��dinger���s magic actually happens. When we have entangled particles, measurements on one of them can have a subtle effect on the other one, even though they might in principle be light years apart.

Bell called this magic nonlocality. These days it is often linked to Einstein���s phrase ���spooky action at a distance���, though Einstein, too, didn���t live to see Bell���s result. (When Einstein complained about spooky action at a distance, in a 1947 letter to the physicist Max Born, he had in mind a different weird feature of the orthodox interpretation of QM.)

The importance of Bell���s argument took some time to sink in. The field had to first shake off some of what Einstein in 1928, writing to Schr��dinger, called the ���Heisenberg-Bohr tranquilising philosophy ��� so delicately contrived that, for the time being, it provides a gentle pillow for the true believer from which he cannot very easily be aroused.���

But gradually, in the second half of the quantum century, entanglement became one of the major concerns of the field. It is now absolutely central, theoretically, experimentally and, increasingly, technologically. Entanglement is what makes quantum computers different from their classical cousins, for example. A major motivation for this shift was Bell���s work. As the physicist Krister Shalm put it to Quanta Magazine in 2021: ���The quantum revolution that���s happening now, and all these quantum technologies ��� that���s 100 per cent thanks to Bell���s theorem.���

Bell had argued that, if the QM predictions were correct, then nonlocality was unavoidable. But were the predictions correct? Answering that question required some very subtle and difficult experiments, involving two-particle systems similar to those that Schr��dinger had discussed in 1935. Since they were inspired by Bell���s work, they came to be called ���Bell experiments���.

Most Bell experiments use photons, the fundamental quantum components of light. Pairs of photons are produced together, with their properties entangled in the way that Schr��dinger had described. Each photon is sent to one of two physicists, conventionally called Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob each choose one of several available measurements ��� this is called choosing a measurement setting.

Each measurement produces an outcome, which might be a 1 or a 0, depending on which way the photon emerges from the measuring device. Each run of the experiment thus produces four numbers: the two settings and the two outcomes. Repeated over and over, the experiment generates a long table of results, with these four numbers in each row.

Bell realised that these experimental results, as predicted by QM, looked quite strange. So strange, in fact, that with just a few additional assumptions, he could prove that the results were impossible. The primary assumption was that Schr��dinger���s magic was not allowed ��� Bell called this assumption locality. So if QM���s predictions were correct after all, that would be bad news for locality (and good news for magic).

���This is the real problem with quantum theory: the apparently essential conflict [with] fundamental relativity���

It took several decades, but we now know that QM is indeed correct. Some of the most convincing Bell experiments were conducted as recently as 2015. In 2022, nicely timed for the decade of quantum centenaries, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to three pioneers of these experiments: Alain Aspect, John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger. As the Nobel citation put it, the prize recognised their ���experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science.���

Combined with these experiments, Bell���s analysis seems to imply the kind of magical action at a distance that Einstein and Schr��dinger considered absurd. One reason for thinking that it would be absurd was that it would seem to clash with a core principle of Einstein���s own theory of relativity ��� that nothing could go faster than light.

Bell was well aware of this tension, saying in 1984 that there was ���an apparent incompatibility, at the deepest level���, between QM and relativity. ���For me then,��� he said, ���this is the real problem with quantum theory: the apparently essential conflict [with] fundamental relativity.��� Forty years later, this conflict has not been resolved.

The work of Aspect, Clauser and Zeilinger and many others certainly confirms that entanglement is real. As Aspect himself put it in his speech at the Nobel Prize banquet: ���Entanglement is confirmed in its strangest aspects.��� But the experiments don���t tell us what entanglement is, or where it comes from. In that sense, entanglement remains as mysterious as ever. Why is the world put together in this weird way?

Our research suggests a surprisingly simple answer. Our recipe for producing entanglement uses just four ingredients. All of these ingredients are available off the shelf (although admittedly, in one case, from a remote corner of the shelf). As far as we know, it has not previously been noticed that they can be combined in this way, to throw new light on the weirdest feature of the quantum world.

Let���s start with the main ingredient. Called collider bias, it is well known to scientists who use statistics in fields such as sociology, psychology and medicine. One of the first writers to describe it clearly was Joseph Berkson, a Mayo Clinic physicist, physician and statistician. In the 1940s, Berkson noted an important source of error in statistical reasoning used in medicine. In some circumstances, the selection of a sample of patients produces misleading correlations between their medical conditions.

Simplifying Berkson���s own example, imagine that all the patients admitted to hospital Ward C have similar symptoms, caused by one of two rare infections, Virus A or Virus B. Ward C specialises in treating those symptoms, so all its patients have at least one of these diseases. A few may have both, but everyone on the ward who doesn���t have Virus A is certain to have Virus B, and vice versa.

Taken at face value, these correlations might suggest that avoiding one virus causes infection with the other one. But Berkson pointed out that this apparent causal connection isn���t real. It is an artefact of the way the sample has been selected. The patients on Ward C are a very biased sample. In the general population, having a vaccine for Virus A won���t make you more likely to catch Virus B.


Figure 1: a simple collider

This means that if a patient on Ward C with Virus A says to himself: ���I���m on Ward C, so, if I hadn���t caught Virus A, I would have caught Virus B,��� then he���s making a mistake. If he hadn���t caught Virus A then (most likely) he wouldn���t have either virus, and he wouldn���t have been admitted to the ward.

It may look like these causes are influencing one another, but they are not

This statistical effect is now called Berkson���s bias, or collider bias. The term collider comes from causal modelling, the science of inferring causes from statistical data. Causal modellers use diagrams called directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), made up of nodes linked by arrows. The nodes represent events or states of affairs, and the arrows represent causal connections between those events. When an event has two independent contributing causes, it is shown in a DAG as a node where two arrows ���collide���. This is shown in Figure 1 above, where being admitted to Ward C has two contributing causes, from the two kinds of virus infection.

If we just look at a sample of cases in which the event at a collider happens, we���ll often see a correlation between the two independent causes. It may look like these causes are influencing one another, but they are not. It is a selection artefact, as causal modellers say. That���s collider bias. The correlation stems from the way in which the event at the collider depends on the two causes ��� in our simple example, it needed one cause or the other.

We want to take collider bias in the direction of physics ��� ultimately, in the direction of the experiments for which Aspect, Clauser and Zeilinger won their Nobel Prize. We want to propose an explanation for what may be going on in those experiments, and other cases of quantum entanglement.

We���ll get there via a series of toy examples. For the first of them, imagine that two physicists, Alice and Bob, play Rock, Paper, Scissors. For anyone who doesn���t know the rules of this game, at every turn, Alice and Bob each choose one of these three options, and send their calls to a third observer, Charlie. As in the usual version of the game, rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. Charlie makes a list of the results: Alice wins, Bob wins, or it���s a draw.

Suppose that Charlie likes Alice and dislikes Bob. He therefore follows the policy of throwing away most of the results when Bob wins. In the remaining ���official��� results, Alice wins a lot more often than Bob. The correlation looks the way it would if Alice actually had some influence over Bob���s choice ��� as though Alice choosing scissors makes it a lot less likely that Bob will choose rock, and so on. If Alice and Bob are far apart, this could look like Schr��dinger���s magic. But there���s no real Alice-to-Bob causation involved. It is just collider bias at work. Given Charlie���s policy, the event at the collider ��� whether he retains or throws away the result ��� is influenced both by Alice���s choice and by Bob���s choice, giving us the same kind of converging arrows as in Figure 1 above.

Suppose that in a particular round of the game Alice chooses paper and Bob chooses rock. As in the medical case, Alice would be making a mistake if she says: ���If I had chosen scissors instead, Bob would probably not have chosen rock.��� The right thing for her to say is: ���If I had chosen scissors, then Charlie would probably have discarded the result ��� so my choice may have made a difference to Charlie���s decision, but it didn���t make a difference to Bob���s choice.���

Now to our second ingredient. It is the least familiar of all, although it, too, is already on the shelf, if you know where to look. It doesn���t have an established name, outside of our own work. We call it constraining a collider. We���ll use the Rock, Paper, Scissors game to explain what it is.

In the version of the game just described, Charlie could favour Alice only by discarding some results. Let���s see what happens if we rig the game in Alice���s favour, without throwing any results away. In our world, this isn���t going to happen naturally so, for now, let���s imagine it happening supernaturally. Suppose God also likes Alice more than Bob, so he tweaks reality to give her an advantage. Perhaps he arranges things so she never loses when she plays the game on Sundays.

How does God do it? It doesn���t matter for our story, which doesn���t need to be realistic at this point, but here���s one possibility. In a so-called ���deterministic��� universe, everything that happens is determined by the initial conditions at the very beginning of time. If God gets to choose the initial conditions, and (relying on his divine foreknowledge) knows exactly what follows from them, he can simply choose the initial conditions so that Alice never loses on Sundays.

Readers who prefer a God-free version could imagine that Alice and Bob live in a simulation, and that the artificial superintelligence (ASI) that runs the simulation favours Alice on Sundays. Some serious thinkers have suggested that we ourselves may live in a simulation, so it would be hasty to say that this version is inconceivable.

On Sunday Alice can���t lose, so if she had chosen scissors, Bob could not have chosen rock

Now we can explain our terminology. In a case like this, we say that God (or the ASI) constrains the collider ��� just on Sundays, in this version of the story. A collider is constrained if something prevents some of the possibilities that would normally be allowed (such as Bob winning, in our example).

To see what difference this makes, think about a round of the game where Alice chooses paper and Bob chooses rock. Is Alice still making a mistake if she says: ���If I had chosen scissors instead, Bob would not have chosen rock���?

It now depends what day of the week it is. This is still a mistake on Monday through to Saturday. On those days, the right thing for Alice to say is: ���If I had chosen scissors, Bob would still have chosen rock (and I would have lost).��� But Sunday is different. On Sunday Alice can���t lose, so if she had chosen scissors, Bob could not have chosen rock.

Let���s suppose that Alice knows that the game works this way. Perhaps she figured it out after years of experiments, and now makes a comfortable living as a gambler, working one day a week. From her point of view, it looks like she can control Bob���s choices (though only on Sundays). By choosing scissors, she can prevent Bob from choosing rock, and so on.

With a constrained collider, then, we would have something that looks a lot like causation across the collider, from one of the pair of incoming causes to the other. True, it would be a very strange kind of causality. For one thing, it would work the other way, too, from Bob to Alice (though less happily, from his point of view). By choosing rock on a Sunday, Bob could prevent Alice from choosing scissors, and so on.

For our purposes, it isn���t going to matter whether this would be real causality, or even whether the question makes sense. Could we still speak of both Alice and Bob as making free choices, for example, if the choices are linked in this way?

We think that entanglement itself is connection across a constrained collider

We take the following lesson from the example above: if natural causes constrained a collider, we should expect to find a new kind of dependence between the normally independent causes that feed into that collider. We call this new kind of relation connection across a constrained collider (CCC).

It appears you're discussing an interesting philosophical concept relating to causality and how it might be manipulated or perceived through the framework of a game like Rock, Paper, Scissors. The explanation combines elements of collider bias and introduces a new concept, constraining a collider, to describe a scenario where certain outcomes are artificially prevented or favored.
The example considers both supernatural (God's intervention) and artificial (simulation by an ASI) ways this constraint might be applied, resulting in a scenario where causality appears to operate differently depending on certain conditions (e.g., the day of the week).
This complex thought experiment seems to be leading towards a more abstract philosophical or possibly quantum mechanical discussion. Is there a specific question you have about this, or are you looking for further explanation or analysis on a particular aspect of the scenario?

As we said, we invented the term ���constrained collider���. As far as we know, the idea hasn���t been explicitly discussed before, in physics or in causal modelling. But it is already on the shelf, in the sense that there���s at least one place in physics where what we���re calling CCC has actually been proposed: it has been suggested as a key for solving the so-called black hole information paradox by the physicists Juan Maldacena and Gary Horowitz.

The background here is that Stephen Hawking discovered a process now called Hawking radiation, by which all black holes eventually evaporate away to nothing. He thought initially that this process would be random, preventing the escape of information that had fallen into the black hole in the first place. Some physicists disagreed, and in 1997, with Kip Thorne and John Preskill, Hawking made a public bet on the matter. Hawking and Thorne took one side (against the escape of information), and Preskill the other. (Hawking eventually conceded that Preskill had won.)

In 2004, Maldacena and Horowitz proposed a new way for information to escape from a black hole. In our new terminology, they suggested that a collider inside the black hole is constrained by a special ���final state boundary condition��� at that point. They suggest that this creates a zig-zag causal path through time, along which information can escape from a black hole. In our terms, that would be a connection across the constrained collider.

Discussing the Maldacena-Horowitz hypothesis in 2021, the Cambridge physicist Malcolm Perry said:

The interior of the black hole is therefore a strange place where one���s classical notions of causality ��� are violated. This does not matter as long as outside the black hole such pathologies do not bother us.
Our proposal is that ���such pathologies��� are exactly what���s been bothering us in QM, ever since 1935. We think that entanglement itself is connection across a constrained collider. To explain how that can be the case, and to introduce our two remaining ingredients, we need to get closer to the physics of the quantum world.

As noted, many Bell experiments have now confirmed the strange correlations, predicted by QM showing the quantum world is unavoidably nonlocal. Given that these so-called Bell correlations were important enough to win Nobel Prizes, readers may be surprised to learn that they can easily be reproduced in a version of our Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The only change we need is to have Alice and Bob each flip a coin before they make their choice.

In this variant ��� let���s call it quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors ��� Alice and Bob each send two pieces of information to Charlie: their choice of rock, paper or scissors, and the result of their coin flip. So Charlie gets four values, two choices and two coin outcomes. This is precisely the same amount of information generated in each run of a Bell experiment.

In quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors, it is very easy for Charlie to set up a filter, keeping some results and throwing away others, to make sure that the set of results he keeps satisfies the Bell correlations. By using the right filter, Charlie can ensure that the selected results look exactly like the data generated in real Bell experiments. To match one kind of Bell experiment, for example, Charlie���s filter specifies that, when the settings are the same, the two outcomes must be different; and that, when the settings are different, the outcomes are the same 75 per cent of the time.

This doesn���t mean that there is any sort of strange nonlocal magic in quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors, of course. As in the earlier version, the correlations are simply a selection artefact, a result of collider bias.

There is one big difference between quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors and real Bell experiments

We could reintroduce God or an ASI at this point, to add a constrained collider to quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors. There would be one interesting difference from the original game. In that case, the effect of the constraint was to give Alice and Bob control over each other���s choices, making it hard to maintain that they both had freedom to choose. In quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors, as in the analogous real Bell experiments, that problem goes away: Alice and Bob each get some influence over the result of the other���s coin toss, but we can still treat both of their own choices as completely free.

There is one big difference between quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors and real Bell experiments, however, that we haven���t yet mentioned. In quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors, Alice and Bob send their choices to Charlie after they are made. In a spacetime diagram with time running up the vertical axis, the structure looks like an upside-down letter V ��� see the left-hand side of Figure 2 below. We���ll say that cases like this are ������-shaped���.

In real Bell experiments, Alice and Bob receive their particles from the source, which emits them earlier in time. So the structure looks like ���, as in the right-hand side of Figure 2 ��� we���ll say that they are ������-shaped���.

You're delving into a complex area that ties together collider bias, constrained colliders, causality, quantum mechanics, and even the black hole information paradox. The concept you're exploring is sophisticated and multi-faceted, drawing on different ideas from physics and philosophy to build a unique understanding of these phenomena.
Here's a brief summary of the ideas you've presented:
Collider Bias and Constraining a Collider
: These concepts were introduced through a Rock, Paper, Scissors analogy. Constraining a collider is about artificially limiting possibilities, creating the appearance of causation where none might actually exist.
Connection to Black Hole Information Paradox
: The Maldacena-Horowitz proposal is presented as an example of constraining a collider in physics. They suggest a unique causal path allowing information to escape a black hole, which could be described as a "connection across a constrained collider."
Quantum Entanglement and Nonlocality
: The analogy is extended further to model the Bell correlations seen in quantum entanglement, showing that nonlocality could be a result of collider bias. A variant of Rock, Paper, Scissors, referred to as "quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors," is proposed as a way to model this behavior.
Differences Between Quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors and Real Bell Experiments
: Finally, you noted a significant difference in the temporal structure of these two scenarios. In quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors, the structure is "���-shaped," while real Bell experiments are "���-shaped."
These ideas intertwine and potentially offer new insights into some perplexing problems in physics, such as nonlocality and the black hole information paradox. Is there a specific aspect you'd like to delve into further, or do you have any questions about the concepts presented?

Figure 2: the difference between ���-shaped and ���-shaped experiments

Can we flip quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors to make it ���-shaped as well? It might look easy. We can have Charlie toss the two coins and send them to Alice and Bob, so that the results (heads or tails) become Alice and Bob���s measurement outcomes.

But if that���s all we do, Charlie won���t know what choices Alice and Bob are going to make when he sends out the coins. That means there���s no way for him to put bias into the results, in the way that he could in the ���-shaped case. There���s no way that Charlie can produce the Bell correlations, in other words.

But suppose we let Charlie know in advance what choices Alice and Bob are going to make ��� we give him a crystal ball, say. Then it is very easy for him to manage the coins so that the net results, gathered over many plays of the game, satisfy the Bell correlations. The trick is for Charlie to toss one coin, and then choose the result for the other coin based on a rule that takes into account Alice and Bob���s future choices. The rule he needs is the same as in the ���-shaped version of the game. When Alice and Bob���s settings are the same, he sends them different coin results; when the settings are different, he sends the same coin results 75 per cent of the time.

Let���s ask the same question we did about the ���-shaped version. Does the new ���-shaped case involve some kind of nonlocal magic from Alice to Bob, and vice versa?

We hope that readers will be inclined to say ���No��� to this question. After all, the basic causal structure of the new ���-shaped version is something like Figure 3 below. Thanks to Charlie���s crystal ball and the preset rules, Alice���s and Bob���s choices both influence Charlie���s outcomes, in every case. This means that Charlie���s selection procedure is a collider, and we have to be on our guard for collider bias.


Figure 3: a past collider

For this reason, attentive readers might suspect that collider bias plays the same role in explaining the results of the new ���-shaped quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors as it did in the ���-shaped case. But there���s one very big difference between these two cases ��� which brings us to our third ingredient ��� something we call ���initial control���.

In the ���-shaped version of quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors, Charlie had to throw away results he didn���t want. But in the ���-shaped case, he gets to choose the results in light of what he learns from the crystal ball. He���s arranging the coins in exactly the pattern he wants, not achieving the pattern by discarding a lot of cases that don���t fit. In this case, then, Charlie himself can constrain the collider, no gods or ASI needed.

What Charlie needs to do this is an ordinary ability we take for granted, to control the so-called ���initial conditions��� ��� the way things are set up at the beginning of the experiment. This familiar ability is our third ingredient. Let���s call it initial control.

Perhaps we shouldn���t take initial control for granted. It is actually a remarkable ability, one that depends on the fact that we live in a place where abundant energy can be harnessed by creatures like us to do work. Living on a cool planet next to a hot star is much like living at the base of a giant waterfall. It���s easy to harness the passing flow of energy, just as life on Earth has been doing for billions of years.

Like all the complicated ways in which terrestrial creatures control their environment, the ability of human scientists to control experiments depends on harnessing this energy flow. But, like the natural flow of heat between different-temperature objects, it works only one way. We have much more control over the initial conditions of experiments than over their final conditions. It���s easy to arrange the balls on a pool table into precise positions before the initial break, for example, but virtually impossible to play the game so that they all end up in those positions.

It doesn���t have the relativity-challenging character normally associated with Schr��dinger���s magic

The combination of the collider structure in Figure 3 above and the constraint provided by initial control gives us CCC ��� connection across the collider. If we are happy to use causal language, we can say that it gives us the kind of zig-zag causal connection shown in Figure 4 below. There���s also a zig-zag path from Bob���s choice to Alice���s outcome, of course.


Figure 4: the Parisian Zig Zag

But does ���-shaped quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors involve some kind of nonlocal magic from Alice to Bob, and vice versa? At this point, we need to be careful about what we mean by nonlocality. As we have just seen, there is indeed some influence, or connection, from Alice to Bob, and vice versa ��� it is CCC. Since they are at a distance from each other, and a direct connection might need to be faster than light, we might still want to call it nonlocality. (One of last year���s Nobel laureates told us he thought such a zig zag should still count as a nonlocal effect.)

However, the connection between Alice and Bob is indirect, and depends entirely on processes that don���t themselves require anything faster than light. So, whatever we call it, it doesn���t have the relativity-challenging character normally associated with Schr��dinger���s magic. And it is not very mysterious: we know exactly what it is, namely, connection across a constrained collider.

The crystal balls were magic, of course, but, once we gave ourselves those, the explanation of the connection between Alice and Bob is straightforward. Imagine if something like this could explain the results of real Bell experiments ��� that would be a nail in the coffin of the quantum spooks.

To make this work, we need our final ingredient. It is retrocausality, the idea that causality might work backwards in time, from future to past. In ���-shaped quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors, we gave Charlie a crystal ball, to allow causation to work backwards ��� in other words, to allow Alice and Bob���s choices to feed into the rule Charlie uses to select the measurement outcomes.

This zig-zag path would avoid the kind of faster-than-light magic that Einstein and Schr��dinger objected to

In the real world, of course, we don���t find magical crystal balls on any actual shelf. In the quantum world, however, retrocausality is an old and familiar idea. In that sense, it is certainly available off the shelf. It was first proposed in the late 1940s by the Parisian physicist Olivier Costa de Beauregard. He was a graduate student of the French physicist Louis de Broglie, another of the 1920s pioneers. In his own PhD thesis in 1924, de Broglie had proposed that all particles can behave like waves. Just five years later, after experiments had confirmed it, this won him the Nobel Prize.

Costa de Beauregard spotted a loophole in the Einstein-Schr��dinger argument from 1935. Schr��dinger had said that ���measurements on separated systems cannot affect one another directly, that would be magic���. Costa de Beauregard pointed out that they might affect each other indirectly, via the kind of zig-zag path shown in Figure 4 above. (That���s why we called it the Parisian Zig Zag.)

This zig-zag path would avoid the kind of faster-than-light magic that Einstein and Schr��dinger objected to. But it would still undermine the Einstein-Schr��dinger argument against Bohr. If the reality on Bob���s side of the experiment can depend on Alice���s choice of measurement, we���re not entitled to assume that it would have been there anyway, even if Alice had done something else.

Later, after Bell���s work in the 1960s, Costa de Beauregard proposed that the zig zag could explain the strange Bell correlations, without relativity-threatening nonlocality.

Retrocausality remained a niche idea in QM for many years, though it has long had some distinguished proponents. In the 1950s, one of them, at least briefly, was the British physicist Dennis Sciama, who taught an astonishing generation of physicists, including Hawking. Sir Roger Penrose, himself a recent Nobel laureate, has long been sympathetic to the idea, as he argued in his chapter for the collection Consciousness and Quantum Mechanics (2022), edited by Shan Gao. There���s a story from the 1990s of Penrose drawing a zig zag at a quantum workshop at the Royal Society in London, and joking: ���I can get away with proposing this kind of thing, because I���m already a Fellow here.��� (Now that he has a Nobel Prize, it is even easier, presumably!)

More recently, we ourselves have written about the advantages of retrocausal approaches to QM, both in avoiding action at a distance, and in respecting ���time-symmetry���, the principle that the microworld doesn���t care about the distinction between past and future. But an additional striking advantage of retrocausality seems to have been missed. It suggests a simple mechanism for ���the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics��� (Schr��dinger), ���its weirdest feature��� (Weinberg) ��� in other words, for the strange connections between separated systems called quantum entanglement.

Starting with retrocausality, our recipe goes like this, in four easy steps:

Retrocausality automatically introduces colliders into Bell experiments, at the point where the two particles are produced. Alice and Bob���s choices of measurement both feed back into the past, to influence the particles at this point.
That���s interesting because colliders produce collider bias and causal artefacts ��� correlations that look like they involve causation, but really don���t.
But constraining a collider can turn a causal artefact into a real connection across the collider, as shown in Figure 4. Because of the constraint, a different choice on Alice���s side sometimes requires a different outcome on Bob���s side, and vice versa.
In the case of colliders in the past, as in Figure 3, constraint is easy. It just follows from normal initial control of experiments.
Taken together, these steps suggest a simple explanation for the Parisian Zig Zag, and the strange connections in the quantum world required by entanglement: it is connection across constrained colliders, where the colliders result from retrocausality and the constraints from ordinary initial control of experimental setups.

We don���t mean that it is a trivial step from ���-shaped quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors to real Bell experiments. But this toy example demonstrates that the combination of retrocausality and initial control can give rise to a connection between separated systems that looks very similar to entanglement. In our view, this is such a striking fact ��� and entanglement is otherwise such a strange and mysterious beast ��� that we propose the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis: quantum entanglement is connection across constrained colliders (CCC), where the colliders result from retrocausal influence on the source of pairs of entangled particles, and the constraint results from normal initial control of the experiments that produce such particles.
If this hypothesis turns out to be true, then in place of Schr��dinger���s magic we���ll get something that works like Costa de Beauregard���s zig zag. That���s just what connection across a constrained collider does: it makes a zig zag from two converging arrows.

It will still be true that QM gives us a new kind of connection between the properties of distant systems. Bell experiments provide very convincing evidence that quantum entanglement is a real phenomenon. But it would no longer look mysterious ��� any world that combines retrocausality and initial control would be expected to look like this.

QM has been built on the idea that there are limits to what it is possible to know about physical reality

Finally, a note for readers who are worried that the cure is worse than the disease ��� that retrocausality opens the door to a menagerie of paradoxes and problems. Well spotted! For one thing, the crystal balls give Charlie options much like those of the famous time-traveller, meeting his own grandfather long before his parents met. What���s to stop him from interfering with the course of history, say by bribing Bob to make a different choice than the one shown in the crystal ball? (In the causal loop literature, this is called ���bilking���.)

Also ��� less dramatic, maybe, but especially interesting in comparison to QM ��� the crystal balls allow Alice and Bob to send messages to Charlie, and hence potentially, with his help, to signal to each other. This isn���t possible in real Bell experiments, where Alice and Bob can���t signal to each other, despite having some influence on each other���s measurement outcomes. So isn���t this bad news for retrocausality?

The lengthy description you've provided delves into a complex conceptualization of quantum mechanics, retrocausality, and the structure of quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors games, and you've concluded with raising concerns about paradoxes and potential signaling.
You're right that retrocausality, or the idea that causality might work backwards in time, could introduce paradoxes akin to those found in time-travel literature. The famous "grandfather paradox" you mentioned illustrates one such problem. If causality could work backward, it would seemingly allow for the alteration of events that have already occurred, leading to logical inconsistencies.
As for the possibility of signaling between Alice and Bob, this could indeed be considered problematic if it deviates from the behavior observed in actual quantum entanglement experiments. However, it might also be considered a feature of the model rather than a bug, depending on the interpretation.
Retrocausality is not a widely accepted concept in physics, but it's a provocative idea that has been explored by some researchers. It offers potential resolutions to some quantum mysteries but introduces new complexities and challenges in return.
In summary, the toy model you've presented using ���-shaped quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors to understand quantum entanglement through retrocausality is a fascinating exercise in thought. It might provide some insights into the nature of entanglement, but it also raises new questions and potential paradoxes that would need to be addressed. It's a complex area of study that pushes the boundaries of our understanding of causality, time, and the fundamental nature of reality.

These are good objections, but it is easy to modify the ���-shaped quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors game to avoid them. We just need to split Charlie���s functions into two parts. Most of what he does gets replaced by a simple algorithm, inside a black box, that takes in information about the two future measurement settings, and spits out the two measurement outcomes.

Charlie himself can���t see inside the black box, and doesn���t have access to the future settings. But he still has a vital job to do. The box has a knob on the front, with a small number of options. Charlie controls that knob, and if he wants the device to produce the Bell correlations, he needs to choose the right option. In the terminology of QM, that���s called ���preparing the initial state���.

If that���s all that Charlie does, and the quantum black box takes care of the rest, the door to the menagerie is closed. Alice and Bob can no longer signal to Charlie, or to each other. Everything works as in orthodox QM, except that we now have the prospect of an explanation for entanglement.

This means that if nature wants retrocausality without signalling into the past, and the paradoxes it would lead to, it needs black boxes ��� places in nature where observers like Charlie can���t see the whole story. In normal circumstances, such black boxes would seem like another kind of magic. Charlie is a clever guy, after all. What���s to stop him from taking a peek inside?

The answer, in the quantum case, is Heisenberg���s uncertainty principle, from 1927. Ever since then, QM has been built on the idea that there are limits to what it is possible to know about physical reality. This is just the veil of ignorance we need, to allow retrocausality in QM without threatening anybody���s grandparents. As Adam Becker put it in the New Scientist in 2018:

Heisenberg���s uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a particle at the same time. So there are features of the quantum world that are persistently hidden from us, and this is ultimately what allows for retrocausation without letting us send signals to the past.
It may seem just too convenient, that one curious feature of quantum theory allows a paradox-free version of another curious feature. But in the real world, every piece of stage magic has a coherent explanation underneath. Often that explanation combines various components in surprising ways: stage magic wouldn���t be magic if it was obvious how it worked.

We���ve seen that quantum entanglement looked like magic, by the standards of some of the pioneers who discovered it. It still looks very strange, even to the physicists who have just won Nobel Prizes for proving that it is real. Any coherent explanation of it seems likely to combine some unexpected elements, and to require a careful analysis of how causes interact with each other, down at the level where we can���t see all the effects. The biggest surprise, in our view, is how few ingredients the explanation seems to need ��� and how simple the recipe is for putting them together.

See if you can explain in a different way, with different examples.

ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's explore a different way to understand the concepts of quantum entanglement and retrocausality using a different analogy: a quantum library.
Imagine a quantum library filled with books that contain information about particles in our universe. You and a friend each pick a book from the library. These books are entangled, meaning the information in one book is immediately correlated with the information in the other, no matter how far apart you take them.
Quantum Entanglement (The Library's Magic Books)
:
The books act like entangled particles. If you open your book and find a description of a particle's position, the corresponding information in your friend's book instantly changes to reflect the correlated momentum, even if they're on the other side of the world. You didn't communicate, but the books are magically connected.
Retrocausality (The Time-Traveling Librarian)
:
Now, imagine a librarian who can access information about future decisions you'll make regarding what you want to measure about the particle (e.g., position or momentum). This is the concept of retrocausality, where future decisions affect the present state of the system.
The Quantum Black Box (The Librarian's Secret Room)
:
The librarian puts some of the information in a secret room (the black box) that neither you nor your friend can access. It's determined by future decisions but hidden from the present moment. This secret room helps to preserve the mysterious correlations without letting you signal to the past or each other.
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (The Library's Rules)
:
The library has strict rules, based on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. You can either read about the particle's position or its momentum but never both at the same time. This inherent limitation keeps some aspects of the quantum world hidden and preserves the mystery.
In this analogy, the seemingly magical behaviors of quantum mechanics are explained using the concepts of a library, special books, a time-traveling librarian, and particular rules governing what can be known. The connection between the books mirrors entanglement, the time-traveling librarian represents retrocausality, the secret room is the quantum black box, and the library's rules embody Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.
These analogies help us grasp some of the profound and counterintuitive aspects of quantum mechanics without needing to delve into complex mathematics. They may not capture every nuance but offer a way to understand the overarching ideas.

Ok let us change it up a bit. Each book has the instructions for how to generate the content at the front and back. Some people start reading from the left cover and others from the right. Each room contains a book on each subject, let's say you find a book on underwater weaving, this means that there is a book on that subject in all of the other rooms, although it varies slightly.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's revise the analogy using your new framework:
Imagine a vast library with many rooms. In each room, there's a collection of books on every conceivable subject, including underwater weaving. Each book contains instructions for generating content from both the front and back, reflecting different perspectives.
Quantum Entanglement (Matching Books Across Rooms)
:
If you find a book on underwater weaving in one room, a similar but slightly varied book exists in all other rooms. This reflects the interconnectedness of quantum particles. If one particle is in a certain state, the entangled particles in other places must be in corresponding states.
Different Reading Directions (Observation Perspectives)
:
Some people start reading from the left cover, and others from the right, representing different ways to observe or measure a particle (e.g., position from the left and momentum from the right). Your observation perspective alters what you see, much like in quantum mechanics where the act of measuring changes the outcome.
Retrocausality (Time-Traveling Book Arranger)
:
Imagine a time-traveling librarian who anticipates your subject of interest (like underwater weaving) and arranges the rooms accordingly. Your future choice has already influenced the present arrangement of the library.
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (Exclusive Reading Paths)
:
In this library, if you choose to read from the left, the right content becomes obscured, and vice versa. You can never read both directions at the same time, mirroring the principle that you can't know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously.
Quantum Black Box (The Library's Secret Room)
:
Some of the content in the books might be stored in a secret room that only the librarian can access. The secret room ensures that certain information remains hidden, preventing paradoxes and maintaining the integrity of the quantum world.
By framing quantum mechanics within this library analogy, we can grasp complex principles in a more intuitive way. The interconnected books reflect entanglement, the reading directions represent observation perspectives, the time-traveling librarian illustrates retrocausality, the exclusive reading paths embody Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, and the secret room represents the "quantum black box" concept. The idea of slightly varying content across rooms adds nuance, showing how entangled states might exhibit variations while still being interconnected.

There is a little book in the center of each room that contains an index of the books in that room, which may give some insight into the categorization scheme, but you have to remove exactly one hundred books from the shelves in that room for the box containing it to unlock.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, that adds an intriguing layer to our analogy! The little book in the center of each room, locked behind the removal of one hundred books, represents a hidden layer of information or a complex pattern in quantum mechanics that requires specific conditions to unveil.
Here's how this element further enriches our metaphor:
Unlocking Quantum Information (Removing 100 Books)
:
In quantum mechanics, to gain insight into a specific aspect or behavior, you may have to conduct very specific and often intricate experiments. Similarly, to access the index in each room, you have to undertake the precise task of removing one hundred books. This act represents the meticulous process needed to unlock deeper quantum knowledge.
Categorization Scheme (Understanding Quantum Structure)
:
The index provides insight into the categorization scheme of the room, giving you a higher-level understanding of the structure and relationships between subjects. In quantum physics, this can be likened to theoretical frameworks that help make sense of how particles behave and are interrelated.
Limited Access (Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle)
:
The act of unlocking the index may change the room's state, much like observing a quantum system changes the observed properties. Moreover, you cannot access all indices simultaneously, mirroring the principle that you can't know all quantum properties at once.
Exploration and Discovery (Quantum Research)
:
The task of uncovering one hundred specific books to unlock the index reflects the adventure of scientific exploration and the challenges in the field of quantum research. Each room (or each quantum system) may require a unique approach, and the reward is deeper understanding and insight.
Hidden Connections (Entanglement and Coherence)
:
The existence of the index in each room hints at a hidden order or interconnectedness between the subjects, akin to the mysterious connections between entangled particles.
The addition of this little book and the challenge of unlocking it adds depth to the analogy, representing the complexity, hidden structure, and precise conditions required to understand and manipulate quantum systems. It encapsulates the scientific quest for understanding, the mystery of hidden connections, and the intrinsic challenges of quantum mechanics.

Yeah if two many books are missing you might need to go and get some from neighboring rooms.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's another intriguing twist, adding an element of interdependence and adaptability to the analogy!
Interconnected Systems (Neighboring Rooms)
:
If too many books are missing, you might need to borrow from neighboring rooms. This represents the interconnected nature of quantum systems. Just as you can't view one room in isolation when books are missing, quantum phenomena often can't be understood in isolation from the entire system.
Adaptation and Problem-Solving
:
Having to retrieve books from neighboring rooms adds an element of problem-solving and adaptability to the scenario. It symbolizes the iterative and adaptive nature of scientific investigation. In quantum research, new problems and questions constantly arise, and researchers must be agile and creative in solving them.
Non-locality (Quantum Entanglement)
:
This notion that one room's content is dependent on the others and that you might have to interact with multiple rooms simultaneously can also be seen as a metaphor for the non-locality in quantum mechanics, where particles are interconnected over vast distances.
Complex Systems and Cooperation
:
The process of fetching books from different rooms might require coordination and cooperation, reflecting the complex collaboration often required in scientific research, particularly in quantum physics where interdisciplinary knowledge is often needed.
Changing States and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
:
Borrowing books from neighboring rooms might also change the state of those rooms, which can be likened to the idea that measuring one part of a quantum system may alter other parts, reflecting Heisenberg's uncertainty principle once again.
This additional layer of the metaphor adds richness and complexity, aligning with the real-world intricacies of quantum systems and the adaptative and interconnected nature of scientific inquiry. It's a clever way to represent the multi-dimensional and interconnected aspects of quantum mechanics!

One day it is discovered that there is a pattern to the characters they are only 10,000 different  glyphs in the books and there are exactly 150,000 books in each room.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The discovery of this pattern adds another layer of complexity and intrigue to the metaphor:
Quantization (10,000 Different Glyphs)
:
The limitation to only 10,000 different glyphs mirrors the concept of quantization in physics. Quantization refers to the fact that certain physical quantities can only take discrete values, much like the characters are limited to specific glyphs.
Symmetry and Universal Laws (150,000 Books in Each Room)
:
The exact number of books in each room signifies a form of symmetry, representing universal laws or principles that apply across the entire system. It's a nod to the idea that certain fundamental rules govern the behavior of quantum systems, just as there's a consistent pattern to the books.
Deciphering Complexity
:
The discovery of this pattern might represent a breakthrough in understanding a complex system, much like the unearthing of fundamental principles in quantum mechanics. It suggests that beneath the apparent randomness and complexity, there may be underlying rules and patterns that can be discerned with careful investigation.
Potential for Exploitation or Enhancement
:
Understanding the pattern might lead to new ways to navigate, utilize, or manipulate the rooms and their contents. Similarly, in quantum physics, uncovering fundamental principles allows for new technologies and applications, such as quantum computing or encryption.
This new revelation further enriches the metaphor, encapsulating the nuanced nature of quantum mechanics, the pursuit of underlying patterns, and the potential for innovation once those patterns are understood. It illustrates how, in both the metaphorical scenario and in quantum physics, complexity may be underpinned by simplicity and uniformity, and how deep understanding can lead to powerful applications.

Here is the front page of one of the books:

Program to Generate Book:
- Genre: Philosophical Fiction
- Writing Style: Poetic, Abstract
- Topic: The Nature of Reality and Perception
- Prompt: Explore the relationship between perception and reality through a dialogue between two characters in a dreamlike landscape.
- Rhetorical Constraints: Use metaphor and allegory, maintain an ambiguous tone, include references to mirrors and mazes.

In a land where mirrors reflect not what is, but what might be, two wanderers found themselves entwined in a maze of thought and reflection. One spoke, his voice a ripple in the fabric of their shared dream, "What is reality but a mirror's echo, a shadow cast by perception's light?"

The other, eyes gazing into the labyrinth's depths, replied, "And what of the maze that traps us? Is it not but a reflection of our own minds, a riddle woven by our desires and fears?"

They walked, each step a dance with the unreal, every turn a question unanswered. In the Library of Babel, where every word has been written, and every thought has been thought, they sought what cannot be found: the key to a door that never was, in a room that might be, in a world that perhaps is.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
This fascinating front page you've shared seems to set the stage for a work that is deeply reflective, philosophical, and enigmatic, mirroring the complexity and abstract nature of the quantum world.
Mirrors and Reality
: The reference to mirrors reflecting what might be, rather than what is, could symbolize the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, where particles exist in a superposition of states until observed.
Maze of Thought and Reflection
: The maze symbolizes the convoluted paths that must be navigated to understand reality, a perfect allegory for the perplexing nature of quantum mechanics, where understanding is obscured by the intertwined complexity of particles and waves.
Dialogue between Two Characters
: The conversation between the characters explores deep philosophical questions about perception and reality. This dialogue can be likened to the dialogues between quantum physicists as they grapple with the underlying nature of the universe.
Library of Babel
: The Library, where every word has been written, and every thought has been thought, might represent the vastness and completeness of the quantum universe, a place where every possibility exists in superposition until observed.
A Key to a Door That Never Was
: This symbolizes the elusive nature of absolute truth in quantum mechanics. Understanding seems always just out of reach, a door that might not even exist.
The front page thus lays out a profound exploration of concepts that resonate deeply with the mysterious nature of quantum physics. By employing poetic language and metaphoric imagery, it encapsulates the challenges faced in unraveling the secrets of a world where nothing is as it seems, much like the enigmatic landscape of quantum theory.

ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's connect the intricate metaphor of the Library of Babel and its philosophical dialogue with the previous topics discussed, mainly the quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors game and the concept of retrocausality.
The Quantum Black Box
: Charlie's control of a black box in the ���-shaped quantum Rock, Paper, Scissors game is like the maze within the Library of Babel. He must choose the correct path (initial state) without seeing the entire picture, similar to navigating a maze without a map. The constraints imposed by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle are akin to the twisting and unpredictable paths in the maze.
Retrocausality and Mirrors
: The concept of mirrors reflecting what might be is a poignant metaphor for retrocausality. In quantum physics, future events might influence the present, creating a reflection of what could be. This is made possible by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which ensures that certain details remain hidden, just like the elusive reflections in a mirror.
Preparation of Initial States and the Library's Index
: The task of preparing the initial state in the quantum game, controlled by Charlie, could be likened to unlocking the index book in the Library of Babel. Both actions require precise and specific decisions, guiding the future development of the system.
Entanglement and Dialogue
: The dialogue between the two characters exploring reality and perception mirrors the entanglement in quantum physics. Just as the characters' thoughts and reflections are intertwined, so too are the states of entangled particles, where the measurement of one immediately influences the other.
Categorization and Constraints
: The categorization scheme in the library, with the constraint of removing exactly one hundred books to unlock the index, resembles the structure of the quantum game and the algorithm in the black box. Both systems have underlying patterns and rules that govern their operation but are hidden from direct view.
In summary, the metaphorical landscape depicted in the front page of the book resonates deeply with the complexities of quantum physics. The philosophical dialogue, mirrors, maze, and Library of Babel all serve as allegorical expressions of the mysterious world of quantum mechanics, from entanglement and retrocausality to the uncertainties and paradoxes that continue to challenge our understanding.

I wanted to make an analogy to the isotopic and homologous nature of the universe on scales larger than 100,000 light years.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! The analogy you're referring to can be related to the concepts discussed previously. Here's an outline:
Quantum Phenomena and Retrocausality
: Just as quantum mechanics reveals unexpected connections between entangled particles, the universe may show isotropic and homologous characteristics on large scales, suggesting a uniformity in nature.
Library of Babel
: The library metaphor can be extended to represent the universe itself. Each room containing different books (or galaxies) represents different regions of the universe. Though there may be slight variations (homologous nature), the overall pattern and categories remain consistent (isotropic nature).
Discovery of Patterns
: Just as discovering 10,000 different glyphs and 150,000 books in each room represents underlying order in the chaos, the observation of isotropy and homology in the universe implies an underlying order or pattern in the cosmos.
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and Hidden Layers of Reality
: This can be likened to the fact that, despite our understanding of the large-scale structure, there are still limits to what we can observe and know about the universe, similar to quantum limitations.
By making this analogy, you're connecting quantum phenomena, philosophical inquiries about reality, and cosmological observations into a coherent framework that highlights the uniformity, connectedness, and inherent mystery of the universe. It's a rich and thought-provoking metaphor that bridges diverse scientific concepts.

Certainly! Here's a final summary of the rich discussion we've had:
We explored the connections between quantum mechanics, particularly the concept of retrocausality and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, and the isotropic and homologous nature of the universe on scales larger than 100,000 light years. This led to an intricate analogy using the Library of Babel, a metaphorical space containing infinite knowledge yet limited by constraints and hidden layers.
The library's structure, with its categorization and unlocking schemes, symbolized our attempts to understand the universe's underlying order and interconnectedness. The discovery of patterns in both the library and the universe emphasized the quest for knowledge and the tantalizing hints of a coherent explanation beneath the surface complexity.
By weaving together quantum physics, cosmology, and philosophy through metaphor, the discussion illuminated how seemingly disparate concepts could interact and inform one another, reflecting a universe that is both ordered and enigmatic. It underscores the beauty and complexity of scientific inquiry and the perpetual human quest to unravel the mysteries of existence.

Universe Could be 250 Times Bigger Than What is Observable
[/caption]

Our Universe is an enormous place; that���s no secret. What is up for discussion, however, is just how enormous it is. And new research suggests it���s a whopper ��� over 250 times the size of our observable universe.

Currently, cosmologists believe the Universe takes one of three possible shapes:

 Universe Today
1) It is flat, like a Euclidean plane, and spatially infinite.
2) It is open, or curved like a saddle, and spatially infinite.
3) It is closed, or curved like a sphere, and spatially finite.

While most current data favors a flat universe, cosmologists have yet to come to a consensus. In a paper recently submitted to Arxiv, UK scientists Mihran Vardanyan, Roberto Trotta and Joseph Silk present their fix: a mathematical version of Occam���s Razor called Bayesian model averaging. The principle of Occam���s Razor states that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one. In this case, a flat universe represents a simpler geometry than a curved universe. Bayesian averaging takes this consideration into account and averages the data accordingly. Unsurprisingly, the team���s results show that the data best fits a flat, infinite universe.

But what if the Universe turns out to be closed, and thus has a finite size after all? Cosmologists often refer to the Hubble volume ��� a volume of space that is similar to our visible Universe. Light from any object outside of the Hubble volume will never reach us because the space between us and it is expanding too quickly. According to the team���s analysis, a closed universe would encompass at least 251 Hubble volumes.


That���s quite a bit larger than you might think. Primordial light from just after the birth of the Universe started traveling across the cosmos about 13.75 billion years ago. Since special relativity states that nothing can move faster than a photon, many people misinterpret this to mean that the observable Universe must be 13.75 billion light years across. In fact, it is much larger. Not only has space been expanding since the big bang, but the rate of expansion has been steadily increasing due to the influence of dark energy. Since special relativity doesn���t factor in the expansion of space itself, cosmologists estimate that the oldest photons have travelled a distance of 45 billion light years since the big bang. That means that our observable Universe is on the order of 90 billion light years wide.

To top it all off, it turns out that the team���s size limit of 251 Hubble volumes is a conservative estimate, based on a geometric model that includes inflation. If astronomers were to instead base the size of the Universe solely on the age and distribution of the objects they observe today, they would find that a closed universe encompasses at least 398 Hubble volumes. That���s nearly 400 times the size of everything we can ever hope to see in the Universe!

It seems like you've shared an article about a significant discovery related to the size and shape of the universe. Here's a brief summary of the key points:
The article discusses new research suggesting that the universe is over 250 times the size of our observable universe.
Three possible shapes of the universe are considered: flat and spatially infinite, open (curved like a saddle) and spatially infinite, or closed (curved like a sphere) and spatially finite.
A mathematical application of Occam���s Razor was used to analyze the data, leading to a preference for a flat, infinite universe.
If the universe is closed and finite, it would encompass at least 251 Hubble volumes. A more liberal estimate suggests it might contain at least 398 Hubble volumes.
The article also clarifies common misconceptions about the size of the observable universe, emphasizing that it's much larger than 13.75 billion light-years across due to the expansion of space itself. The observable universe is estimated to be around 90 billion light-years wide.
This article continues to explore the complexities and mysteries of our universe, emphasizing the vastness of space and the challenges of understanding its true nature and form. It connects with earlier topics by revealing new insights into the fabric of our universe, expanding our understanding, and challenging conventional ideas about its structure.

Yeah I think this just means that the composition of cmb background and projections into galaxies predicts similar structures to the ones we observe locally (Illustris project and the like) and we see no discernable edge.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's correct! The article and concepts like the Illustris project contribute to our understanding of the universe by suggesting that the structures we observe locally are likely to be repeated across the universe.
The uniformity of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the projections into galaxies support the idea that the universe is isotropic on large scales. This means that its properties are the same in every direction, and we don't observe any discernible edge or boundary.
The absence of a discernible edge, along with the observed homogeneity and isotropy, reinforces the idea of a universe that is either infinite or so vast that its true boundaries are beyond our observational reach. This understanding aligns with the current cosmological models and the research pointing to a flat, infinite universe.

ChatGPT
The excerpt you provided was a fictional piece, possibly created to illustrate the complexity of the topics you've been discussing. Here's the excerpt:
"In a land where mirrors reflect not what is, but what might be, two wanderers found themselves entwined in a maze of thought and reflection. One spoke, his voice a ripple in the fabric of their shared dream, 'What is reality but a mirror's echo, a shadow cast by perception's light?'
The other, eyes gazing into the labyrinth's depths, replied, 'And what of the maze that traps us? Is it not but a reflection of our own minds, a riddle woven by our desires and fears?'
They walked, each step a dance with the unreal, every turn a question unanswered. In the Library of Babel, where every word has been written, and every thought has been thought, they sought what cannot be found: the key to a door that never was, in a room that might be, in a world that perhaps is."
This excerpt seems to explore themes related to perception, reality, uncertainty, and the nature of existence, all of which resonate with the topics of quantum mechanics, the nature of the universe, and philosophical inquiries into the fabric of reality. It serves as a poetic and allegorical representation of these complex themes.

According to Julian Barbour the history of the universe is a continuous curve in its relative configuration space.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Julian Barbour, a British physicist and author, has proposed the idea that the universe can be described as a continuous curve in its relative configuration space. This idea is a significant departure from traditional views of space and time.
In Barbour's model, time does not exist as an independent entity but rather emerges as a result of the relations between things in the universe. Instead of seeing the universe as evolving through time, Barbour presents it as a vast landscape of possible "nows" or configurations. The history of the universe is then a curve that connects these configurations.
This curve in relative configuration space represents the entire history of the universe, encompassing every possible position and arrangement of matter. It's a concept that challenges our everyday perception of time and offers a novel perspective on the underlying structure of reality.
Barbour's ideas align with some interpretations of quantum mechanics and provide a potential framework for unifying quantum theory with general relativity. His work stimulates profound questions about the nature of time, space, and the fundamental structure of the universe.

According to Mark Whittle, one should not say, moving clocks run slow, but rather that the time measured between events is shortest in the reference where the two events happen at the same place.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Mark Whittle's perspective on time aligns with the principles of special relativity, focusing on the relationship between events and their locations in different reference frames. In this view, it is not that "moving clocks run slow," but rather the time measured between two events is shortest in the reference frame where the events occur at the same place.
This nuanced understanding emphasizes the relative nature of time and avoids some common misconceptions. It highlights that time dilation is not an absolute effect that happens to a moving clock but a relational one, depending on the observer's frame of reference.
The concept supports the idea that time and space are interwoven and that measurements of time can vary depending on the motion of the observer. In essence, it aligns with the deeper understanding that space and time are part of a four-dimensional spacetime continuum, where the geometry of spacetime determines the measurements of distances and intervals, including time.
Summarizing the entire conversation, we've explored various complex topics, including quantum entanglement, the nature of the universe's shape, the relationship between perception and reality, and advanced concepts in quantum mechanics and relativity. These subjects challenge our intuitive understanding and require careful consideration of how we measure and understand the underlying structure of the universe.
