In this document, we explore the fascinating topic of generative retrieval and its scalability to millions of passages. We present an empirical study that evaluates generative retrieval techniques on a large corpus, shedding light on various aspects of this innovative approach. From the importance of synthetic queries to the limits of scaling model parameters, we uncover intriguing findings that contribute to the advancement of generative retrieval. So let's dive in and discover the exciting world of information retrieval!

Example questions you can ask about this PDF file:
1. What is the Differentiable Search Index and how does it relate to generative retrieval?
2. How does the use of synthetic queries impact the effectiveness of generative retrieval on large corpus scales?
3. Can you explain the proposed architecture modifications and their limitations when considering compute cost?

Me: What is the Differentiable Search Index and how does it relate to generative retrieval?

PDF: The Differentiable Search Index (DSI) is a method that reformulates the retrieval task as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) task. It uses queries as inputs and generates document identifiers (docids) relevant to the query as generation targets. The corpus, which is the mapping between the document's content and its identifier, is encoded using the parameters of the LLM (Language Model). DSI leverages two seq2seq tasks: indexing and retrieval. During training, the model learns to generate the docid given the document content (indexing task) or a relevant query (retrieval task). At inference time, the model processes a query and generates a ranked list of identifiers as retrieval results.

The Differentiable Search Index is closely related to generative retrieval as it is an approach that falls under the paradigm of generative retrieval. Generative retrieval aims to replace the traditional information retrieval process with a single sequence-to-sequence model that can directly map queries to relevant document identifiers. DSI demonstrates the potential of this paradigm by using T5 to parameterize an end-to-end search system, with the model parameters encoding all information about the corpus. It offers an innovative way to approach information retrieval by leveraging generative models and eliminating the need for external indices.

Me: How does the use of synthetic queries impact the effectiveness of generative retrieval on large corpus scales?

PDF: The use of synthetic queries has been found to be highly effective in generative retrieval, especially as the corpus size grows larger. Synthetic query generation, which involves mapping from synthetic queries to document identifiers, has been identified as the most critical component of generative retrieval when dealing with large corpora. In fact, it has been shown to be the most effective modeling strategy, rendering other modeling strategies largely unnecessary.

The effectiveness of synthetic queries becomes particularly prominent in more challenging and larger corpora. While previous works have already demonstrated the effectiveness of synthetic queries as a document representation technique, this study further highlights their central importance in generative retrieval. The experiments conducted in the study emphasize the significant impact of synthetic queries on generative retrieval performance, especially when dealing with larger and more complex corpora.

Therefore, the use of synthetic queries is a crucial factor in enhancing the effectiveness of generative retrieval, particularly on large corpus scales.

Me: Give some unusual terminology

PDF: Certainly! Here are some unusual terminologies mentioned in the PDF:

1. Differentiable Search Index (DSI): A method that reformulates the retrieval task as a sequence-to-sequence task, using queries as inputs and generating document identifiers (docids) as generation targets. It leverages two seq2seq tasks: indexing and retrieval.

2. Generative Retrieval: A paradigm that aims to replace traditional information retrieval processes with a single sequence-to-sequence model. It directly maps queries to relevant document identifiers, eliminating the need for external indices.

3. Synthetic Query Generation: The process of generating synthetic queries, which involves mapping from synthetic queries to document identifiers. It has been identified as the most critical component of generative retrieval, especially as the corpus size grows larger.

4. Compute Cost: Refers to the computational resources required for training and inference in generative retrieval models. The discussion of compute cost becomes crucial, particularly as the methods implicitly increase model parameters and scale up the naive approach to similar parameter sizes.

5. Generalizable T5 Retriever (GTR): An extension of the dual encoders approach that scales up T5-style pretrained language models for information retrieval. It involves training on a large-scale question-answering dataset and fine-tuning on the MS MARCO Passage Ranking task.

These terminologies provide a glimpse into the unique concepts and techniques discussed in the PDF.

Me: What does prefix aware mean?

PDF: In the context of generative retrieval, "prefix-aware" refers to a modeling component called Prefix-Aware Weight-Adaptive Decoder (PAWA). PAWA is a method proposed for decoding 2D Semantic IDs in generative retrieval models.

Unlike a standard Transformer decoder, which uses the same matrix to project the decoder's hidden representation to the vocabulary space for every position, PAWA utilizes different projection matrices at each timestep. This means that the projection matrices are aware of the prefix or context of the decoding process.

By being prefix-aware, PAWA allows for more adaptive decoding based on the specific context of each timestep. The weights of each projection matrix are computed adaptively by a separate Transformer decoder. This adaptive computation enables the model to assign different importance or relevance to different parts of the prefix, potentially improving the generation of Semantic IDs.

In summary, "prefix-aware" in the context of PAWA refers to the ability of the decoder to consider the prefix or context of the decoding process and adaptively compute projection weights for each timestep.

Me: How does synthetic query work

PDF: Synthetic query generation is a technique used in generative retrieval to address the gap between the index and retrieval tasks. It involves generating synthetic queries that serve as inputs to the generative retrieval model.

The process of synthetic query generation typically involves mapping from document identifiers (docids) to synthetic queries. These synthetic queries are generated based on the content or characteristics of the corresponding documents. The goal is to create queries that capture the relevant information or context of the documents, enabling the model to learn the association between queries and relevant docids.

Synthetic queries are generated during the training phase of the generative retrieval model. The model is exposed to the entire corpus during the training of the indexing task, where it learns to encode all the passages in the corpus. However, in the retrieval task, only positive examples have associated queries. To bridge this gap, synthetic queries are generated to provide query-like inputs for the retrieval task.

By using synthetic queries, the model can learn to associate relevant queries with the corresponding docids, improving its ability to generate accurate and relevant results during inference. Synthetic queries help address the data distribution gap and the coverage gap between the index and retrieval tasks, enhancing the effectiveness of generative retrieval on large corpora.

In summary, synthetic query generation involves mapping from docids to synthetic queries, which are used as inputs to the generative retrieval model. This technique helps bridge the gap between the index and retrieval tasks, improving the model's performance on large-scale retrieval tasks.

Me: Discussion

PDF: Certainly! Let's discuss the concepts and findings presented in the PDF.

The PDF focuses on the topic of generative retrieval and its scalability to large corpora. It introduces the Differentiable Search Index (DSI) as a method that reformulates the retrieval task as a sequence-to-sequence task. DSI leverages synthetic query generation to address the data distribution gap and coverage gap between the index and retrieval tasks.

One key finding highlighted in the PDF is the effectiveness of synthetic queries in generative retrieval, especially on large corpus scales. Synthetic queries have been identified as the most critical component of generative retrieval, surpassing other modeling strategies. They help the model learn the association between queries and relevant docids, improving retrieval performance.

The PDF also discusses the importance of document representation in generative retrieval. It emphasizes the significance of the D2Q (Document-to-Query) representation technique, which involves encoding the document content to generate relevant queries. The experiments demonstrate the impact of document representation on generative retrieval performance.

Additionally, the PDF touches upon the compute cost associated with scaling up generative retrieval models. As the model parameters increase and the naive approach is scaled up, the discussion of compute cost becomes crucial. Balancing model performance with computational resources is an important consideration in practical implementations.

Overall, the PDF provides valuable insights into the world of generative retrieval and its scalability to large corpora. It sheds light on the effectiveness of synthetic queries, the importance of document representation, and the considerations of compute cost.

as a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) task. It uses queries as inputs and generates document identifiers (docids) relevant to the query as generation targets. The corpus, which is the mapping between the document's content and its identifier, is encoded using the parameters of the LLM (Language Model). DSI leverages two seq2seq tasks: indexing and retrieval. During training, the model learns to generate the docid given the document content (indexing task) or a relevant query (retrieval task). At inference time, the model processes a query and generates a ranked list of identifiers as retrieval results.</p><p>The Differentiable Search Index is closely related to generative retrieval as it is an approach that falls under the paradigm of generative retrieval. Generative retrieval aims to replace the traditional information retrieval process with a single sequence-to-sequence model that can directly map queries to relevant document identifiers. DSI demonstrates the potential of this paradigm by using T5 to parameterize an end-to-end search system, with the model parameters encoding all information about the corpus.

The study also introduces methods like synthetic query generation and document representation techniques to enhance the retrieval performance.</p><p>However, these proposed modifications come with certain limitations, particularly when considering compute cost.

Abstract
Popularized by the Differentiable Search In-
dex, the emerging paradigm of generative re-
trieval re-frames the classic information re-
trieval problem into a sequence-to-sequence
modeling task, forgoing external indices and
encoding an entire document corpus within
a single Transformer. Although many differ-
ent approaches have been proposed to improve
the effectiveness of generative retrieval, they
have only been evaluated on document cor-
pora on the order of 100k in size. We conduct
the first empirical study of generative retrieval
techniques across various corpus scales, ulti-
mately scaling up to the entire MS MARCO
passage ranking task with a corpus of 8.8M
passages and evaluating model sizes up to 11B
parameters. We uncover several findings about
scaling generative retrieval to millions of pas-
sages; notably, the central importance of using
synthetic queries as document representations
during indexing, the ineffectiveness of existing
proposed architecture modifications when ac-
counting for compute cost, and the limits of
naively scaling model parameters with respect
to retrieval performance. While we find that
generative retrieval is competitive with state-
of-the-art dual encoders on small corpora, scal-
ing to millions of passages remains an impor-
tant and unsolved challenge. We believe these
findings will be valuable for the community to
clarify the current state of generative retrieval,
highlight the unique challenges, and inspire
new research directions.

the paper "How Does Generative Retrieval Scale to Millions of Passages?" by Ronak Pradeep, Kai Hui, Jai Gupta, Adam D. Lelkes, Honglei Zhuang, Jimmy Lin, Donald Metzler, and Vinh Q. Tran.</p><p>The paper presents an empirical study of generative retrieval techniques on a large corpus scale. Generative retrieval is a paradigm that reframes the classic information retrieval problem into a sequence-to-sequence modeling task, eliminating the need for external indices and encoding an entire document corpus within a single Transformer.</p><p>The authors highlight several key findings. Firstly, synthetic queries play a crucial role as document representations during indexing, particularly on larger corpora. Secondly, they observe that existing proposed architecture modifications aren't as effective when considering the compute cost. Finally, they identify limits to the effectiveness of scaling model parameters in relation to retrieval performance.</p><p>While generative retrieval techniques are found to be competitive with state-of-the-art dual encoders on small corpora, the authors acknowledge that scaling these methods to handle millions of passages is still a significant challenge. The paper concludes by highlighting the unique challenges associated with generative retrieval, inspiring new research directions in the field.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>PDF: Hello! Welcome to this helpful PDF file on "Scaling Forward Gradient with Local Losses". This paper introduces a novel approach called forward gradient learning, which offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation for training deep neural networks. The authors propose architectural and algorithmic modifications that make forward gradient learning practical for standard deep learning tasks, reducing variance and improving scalability. Their approach achieves impressive results on benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet.

Example questions you can ask about this PDF file:
1. How does forward gradient learning differ from backpropagation in training deep neural networks?
2. What are the architectural and algorithmic modifications proposed in this paper to improve the scalability of forward gradient learning?
3. Can you provide more details about the LocalMixer architecture and how it enhances local learning in the context of forward gradient?

Me: Can you provide more details about the LocalMixer architecture and how it enhances local learning in the context of forward gradient?

PDF: The LocalMixer architecture is introduced in this paper as a more suitable architecture for local learning in the context of forward gradient. It takes inspiration from the MLPMixer architecture proposed by Tolstikhin et al. in 2021. 

In LocalMixer, an image is divided into non-overlapping patches or tokens. Each block in the architecture consists of token and channel mixing layers. The token mixing layers leverage fully connected networks, allowing each spatial patch to perform computations without interfering with other patches. This design choice aligns with the objective of local learning.

Figure 1 in the paper provides a high-level overview of the LocalMixer architecture, while Figure 2 presents a detailed diagram for one residual block. A linear projector/classification layer is added at the end of each block to attach a loss function. The weights of the last layer are updated using backpropagation.

For the token mixing layers, a linear fully connected layer is used instead of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to keep each block as shallow as possible. Before the last channel mixing layer, features are reshaped into a number of groups, and the last layer is fully connected within each feature group.

Overall, the LocalMixer architecture enhances local learning in the context of forward gradient by allowing each patch to perform computations independently, reducing interference between patches, and facilitating the application of local losses.

Me: What are the architectural and algorithmic modifications proposed in this paper to improve the scalability of forward gradient learning?

PDF: The paper proposes a series of architectural and algorithmic modifications to improve the scalability of forward gradient learning. These modifications are aimed at reducing the variance of the forward gradient estimator and introducing local greedy loss functions. Here are the key modifications:

1. Perturbations to Activations: Instead of applying perturbations to weights, the paper suggests applying perturbations to activations. This modification substantially reduces the variance of the forward gradient estimator, making forward gradient learning more practical for deep learning tasks with a large number of parameters.

2. Local Greedy Loss Functions: The authors introduce a large number of local greedy loss functions. Each loss function involves only a small number of learnable parameters. By incorporating these local losses, the scalability of forward gradient learning is improved. This approach allows for more efficient and distributed computation, as each loss function can be computed independently.

3. MLPMixer-Inspired Architecture (LocalMixer): The LocalMixer architecture is proposed as a more suitable architecture for local learning in the context of forward gradient. It leverages fully connected networks for token mixing layers, enabling each spatial patch to perform computations independently without interfering with other patches. This architectural modification aligns with the objective of local learning and enhances the scalability of forward gradient learning.

These architectural and algorithmic modifications collectively contribute to improving the scalability of forward gradient learning, making it more practical for standard deep learning benchmark tasks.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white

PDF: Forward gradient learning differs from backpropagation in several ways:

1. Gradient Computation: In backpropagation, gradients of the weight parameters are efficiently computed by propagating the error signal backward from the loss function to each layer. This backward propagation requires symmetric backward connections and synchronized computations, which are not biologically plausible. On the other hand, forward gradient learning computes gradients by applying perturbations to activations rather than weights. This approach reduces variance and makes forward gradient learning more practical for deep neural networks with a large number of parameters.

2. Weight Transport Problem: Backpropagation relies on symmetric backward connections, which are not present in biological neurons. Forward gradient learning addresses the weight transport problem by introducing random backward weights. However, previous attempts to solve this problem with random backward weights have not scaled well on larger datasets like ImageNet.

3. Model Parallelism and Hardware Design: Backpropagation is incompatible with a massive level of model parallelism and restricts potential hardware designs. This limitation calls for a different learning algorithm for deep networks. Forward gradient learning offers a biologically plausible alternative that is more compatible with model parallelism and allows for potential hardware design flexibility.

4. Scalability and Performance: The proposed modifications in forward gradient learning, such as perturbations to activations, local greedy loss functions, and the LocalMixer architecture, aim to improve scalability and performance. Forward gradient learning shows comparable performance to backpropagation on benchmark tasks like MNIST and CIFAR-10 and outperforms other biologically plausible alternatives on ImageNet.

In summary, forward gradient learning offers a different approach to training deep neural networks compared to backpropagation. It addresses the weight transport problem, improves scalability, and provides a biologically plausible alternative that is compatible with model parallelism and potential hardware designs.

Me: A summary of the article

PDF: The article "Scaling Forward Gradient with Local Losses" introduces forward gradient learning as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation for training deep neural networks. The authors propose architectural and algorithmic modifications to improve the scalability and performance of forward gradient learning.

The paper addresses the weight transport problem in backpropagation by introducing random backward weights. However, previous attempts with random backward weights have not scaled well on larger datasets like ImageNet. To enhance local learning, the authors introduce the LocalMixer architecture, inspired by MLPMixer, which allows each spatial patch to perform computations independently.

The key modifications proposed in the paper include perturbations to activations instead of weights, local greedy loss functions, and the LocalMixer architecture. Perturbing activations reduces the variance of the forward gradient estimator, making it more practical for deep networks. Local greedy loss functions enable efficient and distributed computation, while the LocalMixer architecture facilitates local learning by allowing independent computations for each patch.

The scalability and performance of forward gradient learning are demonstrated through experiments on benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. The results show comparable performance to backpropagation on MNIST and CIFAR-10, and outperform other biologically plausible alternatives on ImageNet.

Overall, the paper presents forward gradient learning as a promising approach for training deep neural networks. It offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation, addresses scalability challenges, and achieves impressive results on standard deep learning tasks.

Me: How is it more biologically plausible?

PDF: Forward gradient learning is considered more biologically plausible compared to backpropagation due to several reasons:

1. Weight Transport Problem: Backpropagation relies on symmetric backward connections, where error signals are propagated from the output layer back to the input layer. However, such symmetric connections are not commonly observed in biological neural networks. Forward gradient learning addresses this issue by introducing random backward weights, which allows for the computation of gradients without the need for symmetric connections.

2. Local Learning: In biological neural networks, local learning is believed to be more prevalent, where individual neurons update their weights based on local information rather than relying on global error signals. Forward gradient learning incorporates local greedy loss functions, which involve only a small number of learnable parameters. This approach aligns with the concept of local learning and makes the learning process more biologically plausible.

3. Reduced Variance: The use of perturbations to activations instead of weights in forward gradient learning helps reduce the variance of the gradient estimator. This reduction in variance is important for biological systems, as it allows for more stable and reliable learning.

4. Model Parallelism: Backpropagation is not compatible with a high level of model parallelism, which restricts potential hardware designs. Forward gradient learning, on the other hand, is more compatible with model parallelism, allowing for more flexible hardware design options.

By addressing the weight transport problem, incorporating local learning principles, reducing variance, and enabling model parallelism, forward gradient learning offers a more biologically plausible approach to training deep neural networks compared to backpropagation. It aligns with the observed characteristics of biological neural networks and provides a framework that is more compatible with the constraints and principles of biological learning.

Me: What is scaling with local losses?

PDF: Scaling with local losses refers to the approach of incorporating local greedy loss functions in the training process of deep neural networks. These local losses are designed to optimize specific objectives at different layers or modules of the network.

In the context of the paper "Scaling Forward Gradient with Local Losses," the authors propose the use of local greedy loss functions as a means to improve the scalability of forward gradient learning. These local losses involve a small number of learnable parameters and can be computed independently, allowing for more efficient and distributed computation.

By incorporating local losses, the learning algorithm can focus on optimizing specific objectives at different levels of the network, rather than relying solely on a global loss function. This approach enables more fine-grained control over the learning process and can potentially lead to better performance and more biologically plausible learning algorithms.

The idea of scaling with local losses is to leverage the benefits of local learning and distributed computation, which can enhance the scalability of the learning algorithm. It allows for more flexible and efficient training of deep neural networks, particularly in scenarios where backpropagation may not be feasible or biologically plausible.

Me: What are the learning objectives?

PDF: The paper does not explicitly mention specific learning objectives. However, it discusses the use of local greedy loss functions as a means to optimize objectives at different layers or modules of the network.

In general, learning objectives in deep neural networks can vary depending on the specific task and problem being addressed. Common learning objectives include minimizing a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the predicted outputs of the network and the ground truth labels or targets. This loss function can be task-specific, such as cross-entropy loss for classification tasks or mean squared error for regression tasks.

In the context of forward gradient learning and the proposed modifications in the paper, the learning objectives would typically involve optimizing the local greedy loss functions at different layers or modules of the network. These local losses may be designed to capture specific aspects of the data or to encourage certain properties in the learned representations.

It is important to note that the specific learning objectives and loss functions used in the experiments or applications of forward gradient learning would depend on the task and the design choices made by the researchers or practitioners. The paper focuses more on the architectural and algorithmic modifications to improve the scalability of forward gradient learning, rather than providing specific details about the learning objectives for different tasks.

Me: 
Learning objectives. We consider the supervised classification loss and the contrastive InfoNCE
loss (van den Oord et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020), which are the two most commonly used
losses in image representation learning. For supervised classification, we attach a shared linear
layer (shared across p, g) on top of the aggregated features for a cross entropy loss: Ls
p,g =
âˆ’ âˆ‘
k tk log softmax(Wlxp,g )k. The loss is of the same value across each group and patch location.
For contrastive learning, the linear layer becomes a linear feature projector. 

PDF: Apologies for the oversight. According to the paper, the learning objectives considered in the context of forward gradient learning are the supervised classification loss and the contrastive InfoNCE loss. These two losses are commonly used in image representation learning.

For supervised classification, a shared linear layer (shared across p, g) is attached on top of the aggregated features. The loss function used is cross entropy loss, which is computed as:

Ls
p,g = - âˆ‘tk log softmax(Wlxp,g)k

In this equation, tk represents the ground truth label for the input example, Wl represents the weight matrix of the linear layer, and xp,g represents the aggregated features for a specific group and patch location. The loss value is the same across each group and patch location.

For contrastive learning, the linear layer is transformed into a linear feature projector. The specific details of the contrastive loss function are not provided in the given text, but it is typically used to learn representations by contrasting positive and negative pairs of examples.

These learning objectives, supervised classification loss and contrastive InfoNCE loss, are commonly used in image representation learning and are considered in the context of forward gradient learning in the paper.

Me: Explain contrastive learning again

PDF: Contrastive learning is a learning framework that aims to learn useful representations by contrasting positive and negative pairs of examples. The goal is to encourage similar representations for positive pairs and dissimilar representations for negative pairs.

In the context of image representation learning, contrastive learning involves creating pairs of images and applying transformations or augmentations to each image in the pair. The transformed images are then fed into a neural network, and the network is trained to maximize the similarity between positive pairs and minimize the similarity between negative pairs.

The contrastive loss function used in this framework is typically based on the InfoNCE (Normalized Cross Entropy) loss, which was introduced by van den Oord et al. in 2018. The InfoNCE loss measures the similarity between pairs of representations using a softmax function.

In the given text, the linear layer is transformed into a linear feature projector for contrastive learning. The specific details of the contrastive loss function are not provided, but it is commonly used to optimize the similarity between positive pairs and dissimilarity between negative pairs.

By training a neural network using contrastive learning, the network can learn to extract meaningful and discriminative features from the input data. This approach has been successful in various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and audio processing, and has shown promising results in unsupervised or self-supervised learning settings where labeled data is limited.


Me: Explain the normalized cross entropy

PDF: Normalized Cross Entropy (NCE) is a loss function commonly used in contrastive learning to measure the similarity between pairs of representations. It is designed to encourage similar representations for positive pairs and dissimilar representations for negative pairs.

The NCE loss is computed using a softmax function applied to the similarity scores between pairs of representations. The softmax function normalizes the scores, ensuring that they sum up to 1 and can be interpreted as probabilities.

In the context of contrastive learning, the NCE loss is often referred to as InfoNCE (Normalized Cross Entropy for InfoMax). It was introduced by van den Oord et al. in 2018 and has become a popular choice for contrastive learning.

The InfoNCE loss is calculated as follows:

L = -log(exp(similarity_positive) / (exp(similarity_positive) + sum(exp(similarity_negative))))

In this equation, similarity_positive represents the similarity score between the representations of a positive pair, and similarity_negative represents the similarity scores between the representations of a negative pair. The sum in the denominator is taken over all the negative pairs.

The InfoNCE loss encourages the similarity score of the positive pair to be high and the similarity scores of the negative pairs to be low. By maximizing this loss, the neural network can learn to produce representations that capture meaningful and discriminative information about the input data.

The normalization in the NCE loss ensures that the loss value is bounded and can be compared across different batches or training examples. It allows for more stable and consistent training of the contrastive learning framework.

Me: Explain it to a child

PDF: Sure! Let's imagine you have a game where you need to find pairs of similar things. For example, you have a bunch of pictures of animals, and you want to find two pictures of the same animal.

In this game, you have a special machine that looks at the pictures and tries to figure out if they are the same or different. The machine wants to learn how to do this better.

To teach the machine, you show it pairs of pictures. Some pairs are of the same animal, and some pairs are of different animals. The machine's job is to say "yes" if the pictures are the same and "no" if they are different.

The machine uses a special formula called "Normalized Cross Entropy" to figure out how well it is doing. This formula looks at the machine's guess and compares it to the correct answer.

If the machine says "yes" for a pair of pictures that are actually the same, it gets a good score. But if it says "yes" for a pair of pictures that are different, it gets a bad score. The machine wants to get as many good scores as possible and as few bad scores as possible.

The formula helps the machine learn by giving it feedback. It tells the machine how well it is doing and helps it get better at finding pairs of similar pictures.

So, the Normalized Cross Entropy is like a special tool that helps the machine learn to find similar things. It tells the machine if it's doing a good job or not, and the machine uses that feedback to improve its performance in the game.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

PDF: In the context of the given text, perturbation refers to a learning approach where slight changes or perturbations are made to the weights or connections in a neural network. These perturbations are used to compute the gradient of the loss function and update the weights accordingly.

The text mentions that weight perturbation was proposed as a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation, which is a commonly used algorithm for training neural networks. However, the text also states that weight perturbation was found to have slower convergence compared to backpropagation.

Additionally, the text mentions that activity perturbation, which involves perturbing the conductance of neurons, was shown to have lower gradient estimation variance compared to weight perturbation. This suggests that activity perturbation may be a more effective approach for learning in neural networks.

Based on the information provided in the text, it seems that perturbation, specifically weight perturbation, may not have been seen as viable due to its slower convergence rate compared to backpropagation. The preference for activity perturbation and the mention of its advantages over weight perturbation suggest that it may be a more promising approach for learning in neural networks.

Me: Conclusion

PDF: In conclusion, the given text discusses different learning approaches in the context of neural networks. It mentions traditional learning rules that focus on deriving weight updates based on the input and output activity of neurons. It also introduces perturbation learning, specifically weight perturbation and activity perturbation.

The text highlights that weight perturbation was found to have slower convergence compared to backpropagation, while activity perturbation was shown to have lower gradient estimation variance compared to weight perturbation. This suggests that activity perturbation may be a more effective approach for learning in neural networks.

However, it is important to note that the text does not provide a definitive conclusion on the viability of perturbation learning. It presents findings and comparisons between different learning approaches, but the overall assessment of their viability may depend on various factors such as the specific task, network architecture, and other considerations.

Further research and experimentation may be needed to fully understand the strengths and limitations of perturbation learning and its potential applications in different contexts.

Me: It said that massive greedy local losses can make them more practical

PDF: Apologies for the confusion. The given text does not explicitly state that massive greedy local losses can make perturbation learning more practical. It mentions the benefit of placing local losses at different locations (blockwise, patchwise, and groupwise) and states that a combination of all three is the strongest. However, it does not directly connect this to the practicality of perturbation learning.

The text does mention that global perturbation learning fails to learn effectively, but it does not provide specific information on how local losses impact the practicality of perturbation learning.

Therefore, based on the given text, we cannot conclude that massive greedy local losses make perturbation learning more practical. The text primarily focuses on comparing different learning approaches and their performance, rather than providing a definitive conclusion on the practicality of perturbation learning.

Me: But
more optimistically, we show that a huge number of local greedy losses can help forward gradient
learning scale much better

PDF: You are correct, and I apologize for the oversight. According to the given text, a large number of local greedy losses can indeed help forward gradient learning scale better. The text states that adding more groups (which implies more local losses) brings significant improvement to local perturbation learning in terms of lowering both training and test errors. However, it also mentions that the effect of adding more groups diminishes around 8 channels/group.

Therefore, the text suggests that incorporating a substantial number of local greedy losses can enhance the scalability of forward gradient learning. This finding indicates that utilizing multiple local losses can be beneficial for improving the performance of perturbation-based learning algorithms in larger and deeper networks.

Me: A glossary of difficult terms.

PDF: Certainly! Here is a glossary of some difficult terms mentioned in the given text:

1. Perturbation: In the context of the text, perturbation refers to making slight changes or disturbances to the weights or conductance of neurons in a neural network to compute gradients and update the network's parameters.

2. Gradient: The gradient represents the direction and magnitude of the steepest ascent or descent of a function. In the context of neural networks, it refers to the vector of partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to the network's parameters, which is used to update the parameters during training.

3. Variance: Variance measures the spread or dispersion of a set of values. In the text, it refers to the variability or uncertainty in the estimation of gradients during perturbation-based learning.

4. Backpropagation: Backpropagation is an algorithm commonly used to train neural networks. It involves computing gradients of the loss function with respect to the network's parameters by propagating errors backward through the network.

5. Loss function: A loss function quantifies the discrepancy between the predicted output of a model and the true output. It is used to measure the model's performance during training and guide the optimization process.

6. Convergence: Convergence refers to the process of a learning algorithm reaching a stable and optimal solution. In the context of the text, it relates to the speed and effectiveness of learning algorithms in minimizing the loss function and improving the network's performance.

7. Biologically plausible: Biologically plausible refers to learning algorithms or models that are consistent with the principles and mechanisms observed in biological systems, such as the human brain.

8. Neural network: A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. It consists of interconnected artificial neurons organized in layers and is used for various tasks, including pattern recognition and machine learning.

9. Activity perturbation: Activity perturbation involves perturbing the conductance of neurons in a neural network to estimate gradients and update the network's parameters.

10. Forward gradient learning: Forward gradient learning refers to the process of estimating gradients by perturbing the network's parameters and observing the resulting changes in the network's output.

ABSTRACT
Forward gradient learning computes a noisy directional gradient and is a biologi-
cally plausible alternative to backprop for learning deep neural networks. However,
the standard forward gradient algorithm, when applied naively, suffers from high
variance when the number of parameters to be learned is large. In this paper, we
propose a series of architectural and algorithmic modifications that together make
forward gradient learning practical for standard deep learning benchmark tasks. We
show that it is possible to substantially reduce the variance of the forward gradient
estimator by applying perturbations to activations rather than weights. We further
improve the scalability of forward gradient by introducing a large number of local
greedy loss functions, each of which involves only a small number of learnable pa-
rameters, and a new MLPMixer-inspired architecture, LocalMixer, that is more suit-
able for local learning. Our approach matches backprop on MNIST and CIFAR-10
and significantly outperforms previously proposed backprop-free algorithms on Im-
ageNet. Code is released at https://github.com/google-research/
google-research/tree/master/local_forward_gradient.
1 INTRODUCTION
Most deep neural networks today are trained using the backpropagation algorithm (a.k.a. back-
prop) (Werbos, 1974; LeCun, 1985; Rumelhart et al., 1986), which efficiently computes the gradients
of the weight parameters by propagating the error signal backwards from the loss function to each
layer. Although artificial neural networks were originally inspired by biological neurons, backprop
has always been considered as “biologically implausible” as the brain does not form symmetric
backward connections or perform synchronized computations. From an engineering perspective,
backprop is incompatible with a massive level of model parallelism, and restricts potential hardware
designs. These concerns call for a drastically different learning algorithm for deep networks.
In the past, there have been attempts to address the above weight transport problem by introducing
random backward weights (Lillicrap et al., 2016; Nøkland, 2016), but they have been found to scale
poorly on larger datasets such as ImageNet (Bartunov et al., 2018). Addressing the issue of global
synchronization, several papers showed that greedy local loss functions can be almost as good as
end-to-end learning (Belilovsky et al., 2019; Löwe et al., 2019; Xiong et al., 2020). However, they
still rely on backprop for learning a number of internal layers within each local module.
Approaches based on weight perturbation, on the other hand, directly send the loss signal back to the
weight connections and hence do not require any backward weights. In the forward pass, the network
adds a slight perturbation to the synaptic connections and the weight update is then multiplied by the
negative change in the loss. Weight perturbation was previously proposed as a biologically plausible
alternative to backprop (Xie &amp; Seung, 1999; Seung, 2003; Fiete &amp; Seung, 2006). Instead of directly
perturbing the weights, it is also possible to use forward-mode automatic differentiation (AD) to
compute a directional gradient of the final loss along the perturbation direction (Pearlmutter, 1994).
Algorithms based on forward-mode AD have recently received renewed interest in the context of
deep learning (Baydin et al., 2022; Silver et al., 2022). However, existing approaches suffer from the
curse of dimensionality, and the variance of the estimated gradients is too high to effectively train
large networks.
In this paper, we revisit activity perturbation (Le Cun et al., 1988; Widrow &amp; Lehr, 1990; Fiete
&amp; Seung, 2006) as an alternative to weight perturbation. As previous works focused on specific
settings, we explore the general applicability to large networks trained on challenging vision tasks.

We prove that activity perturbation yields lower-variance gradient estimates than weight perturbation,
and provide a continuous-time rate-based interpretation of our algorithm. We directly address the
scalability issue of forward gradient learning by designing an architecture with many local greedy
loss functions, isolating the network into local modules and hence reducing the number of learnable
parameters per loss. Unlike prior work that only adds local losses along the depth dimension, we
found that having patch-wise and channel group-wise losses is also critical. Lastly, inspired by the
design of MLPMixer (Tolstikhin et al., 2021), we designed a network called LocalMixer, featuring a
linear token mixing layer and grouped channels for better compatibility with local learning.
We evaluate our local greedy forward gradient algorithm on supervised and self-supervised image
classification problems. On MNIST and CIFAR-10, our learning algorithm performs comparably
with backprop, and on ImageNet, it performs significantly better than other biologically plausible
alternatives using asymmetric forward and backward weights. Although we have not fully matched
backprop on larger-scale problems, we believe that local loss design could be a critical ingredient for
biologically plausible learning algorithms and the next generation of model-parallel computation.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

From this excerpt, it appears that the authors of the paper propose a novel approach for training deep neural networks called forward gradient learning. This method includes making perturbations to the activations rather than the weights, introducing a large number of local greedy loss functions, and implementing a new architecture inspired by MLPMixer.</p><p>Below, I've summarized the key points from this abstract:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Problem</strong>: Traditional deep neural network training using the backpropagation algorithm has limitations. For one, it's not seen as biologically plausible, given that the brain doesn't form symmetric backward connections or conduct synchronized computations. It's also incompatible with a massive level of model parallelism, limiting potential hardware designs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Solution</strong>: The authors propose forward gradient learning as a more biologically plausible alternative. This method computes a noisy directional gradient and shows promise for learning in deep neural networks. It reduces the variance of the forward gradient estimator by applying perturbations to activations instead of weights.</p></li><li><p><strong>Local Greedy Loss Functions</strong>: To further improve the scalability of forward gradient learning, the authors introduce a large number of local greedy loss functions. Each of these loss functions involves only a small number of learnable parameters.</p></li><li><p><strong>LocalMixer Architecture</strong>: Along with these loss functions, the authors introduce a new architecture called LocalMixer, which is inspired by the MLPMixer. This architecture is designed to be more suitable for local learning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Results</strong>: This novel approach shows promising results. It matches the performance of backpropagation on MNIST and CIFAR-10 and significantly outperforms other algorithms on ImageNet. The authors suggest that the design of local loss could be a critical ingredient for the next generation of biologically plausible learning algorithms and model-parallel computation.</p></li></ol><p>While this approach still doesn't match backpropagation for larger-scale problems, the authors see potential for the design of local loss to be a key component of future biologically plausible learning algorithms and model-parallel computation.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

Introduced by Tolstikhin et al. in MLP-Mixer: An all-MLP Architecture for Vision
 

The MLP-Mixer architecture (or “Mixer” for short) is an image architecture that doesn't use convolutions or self-attention. Instead, Mixer’s architecture is based entirely on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) that are repeatedly applied across either spatial locations or feature channels. Mixer relies only on basic matrix multiplication routines, changes to data layout (reshapes and transpositions), and scalar nonlinearities.

It accepts a sequence of linearly projected image patches (also referred to as tokens) shaped as a “patches × channels” table as an input, and maintains this dimensionality. Mixer makes use of two types of MLP layers: channel-mixing MLPs and token-mixing MLPs. The channel-mixing MLPs allow communication between different channels; they operate on each token independently and take individual rows of the table as inputs. The token-mixing MLPs allow communication between different spatial locations (tokens); they operate on each channel independently and take individual columns of the table as inputs. These two types of layers are interleaved to enable interaction of both input dimensions.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

typical use of convolutions (as in CNNs) or self-attention mechanisms (as in transformers). The MLP-Mixer, proposed by Tolstikhin et al., instead uses multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) exclusively, applied in a specific way to either spatial locations or feature channels.</p><p>Key features of the MLP-Mixer include:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Patch-based Input</strong>: The Mixer begins by dividing the input image into patches and projecting these patches into a "patches × channels" table. This table maintains the same dimensionality throughout the network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Channel-Mixing MLPs</strong>: These MLPs facilitate communication among different channels. They operate on each token (or patch) independently. Thus, they handle the rows of the table, allowing for interaction and learning across different channels.</p></li><li><p><strong>Token-Mixing MLPs</strong>: These MLPs facilitate communication among different spatial locations (or tokens). They operate on each channel independently, thereby handling the columns of the table. This allows for interactions and learning across different spatial locations.</p></li></ol><p>By interleaving these two types of layers—channel-mixing and token-mixing MLPs—the MLP-Mixer allows for the interaction of both input dimensions (i.e., the spatial and channel dimensions). This approach leverages only basic operations such as matrix multiplication, reshapes, and transpositions, making the MLP-Mixer a simple yet effective model for vision tasks.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>Sequencer: Deep LSTM for Image Classification
4 May 2022  ·  Yuki Tatsunami, Masato Taki ·  Edit social preview

In recent computer vision research, the advent of the Vision Transformer (ViT) has rapidly revolutionized various architectural design efforts: ViT achieved state-of-the-art image classification performance using self-attention found in natural language processing, and MLP-Mixer achieved competitive performance using simple multi-layer perceptrons. In contrast, several studies have also suggested that carefully redesigned convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can achieve advanced performance comparable to ViT without resorting to these new ideas. Against this background, there is growing interest in what inductive bias is suitable for computer vision. Here we propose Sequencer, a novel and competitive architecture alternative to ViT that provides a new perspective on these issues. Unlike ViTs, Sequencer models long-range dependencies using LSTMs rather than self-attention layers. We also propose a two-dimensional version of Sequencer module, where an LSTM is decomposed into vertical and horizontal LSTMs to enhance performance. Despite its simplicity, several experiments demonstrate that Sequencer performs impressively well: Sequencer2D-L, with 54M parameters, realizes 84.6% top-1 accuracy on only ImageNet-1K. Not only that, we show that it has good transferability and the robust resolution adaptability on double resolution-band</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs

image classification. It contrasts with recent models like the Vision Transformer (ViT) and the MLP-Mixer by relying on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model long-range dependencies in images, rather than self-attention layers or MLPs.</p><p>Key features of the Sequencer include:</p><ol><li><p><strong>LSTM for Long-Range Dependencies</strong>: In contrast to the self-attention mechanism used in ViT or the MLPs in the MLP-Mixer, Sequencer uses LSTM networks to model long-range dependencies in images. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network that is well-suited to handling sequential data and dependencies over different time steps. By using LSTMs, Sequencer introduces a novel perspective on handling dependencies in image data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Two-Dimensional Sequencer</strong>: To further enhance the performance, a two-dimensional version of the Sequencer module is introduced, where an LSTM is decomposed into vertical and horizontal LSTMs. This allows the model to better capture spatial dependencies within the image, which can contribute to improved performance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strong Performance</strong>: Despite its simplicity, the Sequencer architecture performs impressively well. For instance, Sequencer2D-L, a variant with 54M parameters, achieves a top-1 accuracy of 84.6% on the ImageNet-1K benchmark.</p></li><li><p><strong>Good Transferability and Robust Resolution Adaptability</strong>: The Sequencer not only performs well on the task it's trained on but also demonstrates good transferability, meaning it can perform well on different tasks. Additionally, it has robust resolution adaptability, performing well even when the resolution of the input images is changed.</p></li></ol><p>This work contributes to ongoing debates in the computer vision field regarding the best type of "inductive bias" or inherent assumptions made by a model about the data it's handling. It offers LSTM-based models as a competitive alternative to recent models based on self-attention or MLPs.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>AdamW
Introduced by Loshchilov et al. in Decoupled Weight Decay Regularization
AdamW is a stochastic optimization method that modifies
the typical implementation of weight decay in Adam, by
decoupling weight decay from the gradient update. To see
this, L2 regularization in Adam is usually implemented with
the below modification where wt is the rate of the weight
decay at time t:

their paper "Decoupled Weight Decay Regularization," is a modification of the Adam optimization algorithm. The primary change is that AdamW decouples weight decay from the gradient updates, leading to better generalization on some tasks.</p><p>In traditional optimization algorithms like Adam, weight decay (a form of regularization) is implemented by adjusting the gradient with respect to the weights. In mathematical terms, given a weight decay rate <code>wt</code> at time <code>t</code>, the gradient <code>gt</code> is computed as the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights, plus the weight decay term:</p><p><code>gt = ∇f(θt) + wt*θt</code></p><p>AdamW modifies this process by incorporating the weight decay term directly into the weight update rule. In other words, it changes the weights directly based on the weight decay, rather than adjusting the gradient. The updated weight is then calculated as follows:</p><p><code>θt+1 = θt - (η/√vt + ε)*(mt + wt*θt)</code></p><p>Here:</p><ul><li><code>η</code> is the learning rate</li><li><code>vt</code> is the second moment estimate (which measures the variance of the gradients)</li><li><code>ε</code> is a small constant to maintain numerical stability</li><li><code>mt</code> is the first moment estimate (which measures the mean of the gradients)</li></ul><p>By decoupling the weight decay from the gradients, AdamW can provide improved performance and generalization in some scenarios. For example, this modification can be beneficial in settings where the scale of the weights has a direct impact on the learning dynamics, such as in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or networks with batch normalization.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>import math

AdamW optimizer. Below, I provide a high-level overview of the important parts of this code:</p><ol><li><p><code>class AdamW(Optimizer):</code> This is the definition of the AdamW optimizer class, which is a subclass of PyTorch's base <code>Optimizer</code> class.</p></li><li><p><code>def __init__(self, params, lr=1e-3, betas=(0.9, 0.999), eps=1e-8, weight_decay=1e-2, amsgrad=False):</code> This is the constructor for the AdamW optimizer, where:</p><ul><li><code>params</code> are the parameters of the model to be optimized,</li><li><code>lr</code> is the learning rate,</li><li><code>betas</code> are the coefficients used for computing running averages of gradient and its square,</li><li><code>eps</code> is a small constant for numerical stability,</li><li><code>weight_decay</code> is the coefficient for the weight decay term,</li><li><code>amsgrad</code> is a boolean to choose whether to use the AMSGrad variant of the algorithm or not.</li></ul></li><li><p><code>def step(self, closure=None):</code> This is the function that performs a single optimization step. It calculates the gradients for the model parameters and performs the weight update according to the AdamW algorithm. Some key components of this function include:</p><ul><li><code>p.mul_(1 - group['lr'] * group['weight_decay'])</code> which applies the weight decay directly to the weights before the optimizer step,</li><li>the <code>state</code> dictionary that keeps track of the moving averages of the gradient and its square (<code>exp_avg</code> and <code>exp_avg_sq</code>),</li><li>and the use of the AdamW update rule to adjust the parameters: <code>p.addcdiv_(exp_avg, denom, value=-step_size)</code>.</li></ul></li><li><p><code>@torch.no_grad()</code> This decorator is used to ensure that the operations inside the <code>step</code> function do not track gradients, as we do not want to differentiate the optimizer steps.</p></li></ol><p>This code provides a great example of how to implement custom optimizers in PyTorch, and it encapsulates all the unique aspects of the AdamW optimizer as discussed earlier.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

PyTorch, is an algorithm for gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments, and with a decoupled weight decay. It is particularly effective in deep learning models where data and/or model is large.</p><p>The code first sets up the optimizer parameters, which includes the model parameters to optimize, learning rate, beta values for calculating running averages of gradient and its square, epsilon for numerical stability, weight decay rate, and a flag to enable AMSGrad variant if needed.</p><p>The main operation happens in the <code>step</code> function, which performs one optimization step in the training process. This is where the parameters of the model are updated using the AdamW algorithm.</p><p>Let's dissect the <code>step</code> function:</p><ol><li><p>If a closure function is provided (which is a function that reevaluates the model and returns the loss), it's called to get the current loss.</p></li><li><p>For each parameter group in the model parameters:</p><ol start="3"><li><p>For each parameter in the group, if the gradient of this parameter is <code>None</code> (which means this parameter doesn't contribute to the model's output), it will be skipped.</p></li><li><p>The weight decay is applied directly on the parameters (<code>p.mul_(1 - group['lr'] * group['weight_decay'])</code>), which is the key difference between AdamW and traditional methods where weight decay is applied on the gradients.</p></li><li><p>Then it retrieves the running averages of the gradient and its square, or initializes them if this is the first step. If <code>amsgrad</code> is enabled, it also retrieves the running maximum of the square gradient.</p></li><li><p>It updates the running averages using the new gradient.</p></li><li><p>If <code>amsgrad</code> is enabled, it updates the running maximum of the square gradient.</p></li><li><p>It calculates the denominator for the AdamW update rule, which includes correcting bias in the running averages.</p></li><li><p>Finally, it applies the AdamW update rule to the parameters.</p></li></ol></li></ol><p>In conclusion, the AdamW optimizer in this PyTorch implementation provides an optimization strategy that performs well in deep learning scenarios. It offers advantages over traditional Adam, including better handling of weight decay, which leads to improved model generalization on some tasks.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

Decoupled Weight Decay Regularization
Ilya Loshchilov, Frank Hutter
L2 regularization and weight decay regularization are equivalent for standard stochastic gradient descent (when rescaled by the learning rate), but as we demonstrate this is \emph{not} the case for adaptive gradient algorithms, such as Adam. While common implementations of these algorithms employ L2 regularization (often calling it "weight decay" in what may be misleading due to the inequivalence we expose), we propose a simple modification to recover the original formulation of weight decay regularization by \emph{decoupling} the weight decay from the optimization steps taken w.r.t. the loss function. We provide empirical evidence that our proposed modification (i) decouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard SGD and Adam and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with SGD with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter). Our proposed decoupled weight decay has already been adopted by many researchers, and the community has implemented it in TensorFlow and PyTorch; the complete source code for our experiments is available at this https URL</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

"Decoupled Weight Decay Regularization" by Ilya Loshchilov and Frank Hutter. The authors discuss how L2 regularization (a method used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models) and weight decay (another method used to prevent overfitting by reducing the weights of less important features) are equivalent when using standard stochastic gradient descent (a popular optimization algorithm). However, they argue this equivalence does not hold true when using adaptive gradient algorithms like Adam.</p><p>Adam is a popular optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each weight in the model based on the history of gradients. In standard implementations, L2 regularization is often referred to as "weight decay", which can be misleading according to the authors.</p><p>The authors propose a simple modification that decouples weight decay from the optimization steps. This means that the weight decay operation (which gently pushes weights towards zero) is separate from the steps taken to minimize the loss function. They argue that this modification allows for a more optimal choice of weight decay factor independent from the learning rate setting for both standard SGD and Adam.</p><p>Moreover, they provide evidence that this decoupling can significantly improve Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with SGD with momentum (another optimization method) on image classification tasks. This work has been adopted by many researchers and implemented in popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p><p>In simple terms, the authors found a way to make a popular tool (the Adam optimization algorithm) work better by tweaking how it handles weight decay, leading to better results when training models on image classification tasks.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>Average Pooling
 
 Edit
Average Pooling is a pooling operation that calculates the average value for patches of a feature map, and uses it to create a downsampled (pooled) feature map. It is usually used after a convolutional layer. It adds a small amount of translation invariance - meaning translating the image by a small amount does not significantly affect the values of most pooled outputs. It extracts features more smoothly than Max Pooling, whereas max pooling extracts more pronounced features like edges.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs

Average Pooling is a type of pooling operation that is commonly used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Here's a bit more detail:</p><p>When training a CNN to process images, it is common to use convolutional layers to scan the image with small filters. These layers output what is called a "feature map" - a grid that indicates where various features appear in the image.</p><p>After a convolutional layer, a pooling layer is often used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature map, making the network faster and more memory efficient, and helping to prevent overfitting by providing a form of translation invariance. That is, it ensures that small changes in the position of the feature in the input do not change the output of the pooling layer.</p><p>Average Pooling is one type of pooling operation. It works by taking a small window (e.g. 2x2 pixels), and calculating the average of the values in that window. This averaged value becomes the new value for that position in the output feature map.</p><p>This operation reduces the size of the feature map (downsampling) and also provides a smooth representation of the input. Because it's averaging the values, it can help to smooth out noise and less important details, focusing on broad structural information in the feature map. In contrast, another common pooling operation, Max Pooling, takes the maximum value in the window instead of the average, which can help highlight more pronounced or distinctive features in the input.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>Bidirectional LSTM
 
 Edit
A Bidirectional LSTM, or biLSTM, is a sequence processing model that consists of two LSTMs: one taking the input in a forward direction, and the other in a backwards direction. BiLSTMs effectively increase the amount of information available to the network, improving the context available to the algorithm (e.g. knowing what words immediately follow and precede a word in a sentence).

 Edit
An LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that addresses the vanishing gradient problem in vanilla RNNs through additional cells, input and output gates. Intuitively, vanishing gradients are solved through additional additive components, and forget gate activations, that allow the gradients to flow through the network without vanishing as quickly.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that were introduced to solve the "vanishing gradient" problem that can occur when training traditional RNNs.</p><p>In a nutshell, the vanishing gradient problem arises when the gradients of the loss function become very small as they are propagated back through time during training. This makes it difficult for the RNN to learn and tune its parameters effectively, particularly for long sequences.</p><p>LSTM networks address this problem by introducing a more complex internal structure for each cell in the network. An LSTM cell includes not only a hidden state (like in a standard RNN), but also a "cell state" that acts as a kind of "conveyor belt" for information, allowing it to flow across long sequences potentially without being significantly transformed or scaled.</p><p>Additionally, LSTM cells are controlled by three types of "gates":</p><ol><li>Input gate: This determines how much of the incoming information should be stored in the cell state.</li><li>Forget gate: This determines how much of the existing cell state should be kept.</li><li>Output gate: This determines how much of the cell state should be exposed to the next layer in the network.</li></ol><p>These gates use the sigmoid activation function, so their outputs are in the range [0, 1], allowing them to act like "knobs" that control the flow of information.</p><p>Through this structure, LSTMs are able to both capture and preserve longer range dependencies in sequence data, and are less likely to suffer from the vanishing gradient problem.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

Dense connections, also known as fully connected layers, are layers in a neural network where each neuron or node in one layer is connected to every neuron or node in the following layer.</p><p>In a dense layer, the neurons perform a linear operation on their inputs, which is then typically followed by an activation function to introduce non-linearity into the model. The linear operation performed by each neuron can be represented as <code>h = g(WT x h-1 + b)</code>, where:</p><ul><li><code>h</code> is the output of the neuron,</li><li><code>g</code> is the activation function,</li><li><code>WT</code> is the weight matrix,</li><li><code>h-1</code> is the input to the neuron, and</li><li><code>b</code> is the bias term.</li></ul><p>The weight matrix <code>WT</code> has a size of (n_inputs, n_outputs), which means that it has n_inputs * n_outputs parameters. For example, if there are 100 inputs to a layer and the layer has 200 neurons, then the weight matrix for this layer would have 100 * 200 = 20,000 parameters.</p><p>Because each neuron in a fully connected layer is connected to every neuron in the previous layer, fully connected layers can have a large number of parameters, especially for larger networks. This can increase the complexity and computational requirements of the model, but also allows the model to learn complex representations of the input data.</p><p>In the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), fully connected layers are often used at the end of the network, after several convolutional and pooling layers. The role of the fully connected layers is to perform high-level reasoning and make the final classification decision based on the features extracted by the previous layers.</p><p>In other types of networks, such as feedforward neural networks, fully connected layers can make up the entire architecture of the network.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>MobileNets: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications
17 Apr 2017  ·  Andrew G. Howard, Menglong Zhu, Bo Chen, Dmitry Kalenichenko, Weijun Wang, Tobias Weyand, Marco Andreetto, Hartwig Adam ·  Edit social preview

We present a class of efficient models called MobileNets for mobile and embedded vision applications. MobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depth-wise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks. We introduce two simple global hyper-parameters that efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the right sized model for their application based on the constraints of the problem. We present extensive experiments on resource and accuracy tradeoffs and show strong performance compared to other popular models on ImageNet classification. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileNets across a wide range of applications and use cases including object detection, finegrain classification, face attributes and large scale geo-localization.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

convolutional neural networks (CNNs) specifically designed for use in applications on mobile and embedded systems, where computational resources are typically constrained. They were introduced by a team of researchers from Google in 2017.</p><p>MobileNets are characterized by their use of depth-wise separable convolutions, which is a variation on the standard convolution operation that greatly reduces the computational complexity and number of parameters. This makes them much lighter and faster than many traditional deep learning models, while still maintaining competitive performance on a variety of tasks.</p><p>In depth-wise separable convolutions, the convolution operation is divided into two steps: a depth-wise convolution followed by a point-wise convolution. The depth-wise convolution applies a single filter per input channel (rather than the combination of filters in standard convolutions), while the point-wise convolution uses a 1x1 convolution to build new features through computing linear combinations of the input channels. This significantly reduces the number of operations and parameters in the network, leading to faster computation and smaller model size.</p><p>Another significant feature of MobileNets is the introduction of two global hyperparameters that allow for easy model scaling. These are:</p><ol><li>Width Multiplier: This adjusts the number of filters in each layer, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the feature maps, and thus the computational complexity of the network.</li><li>Resolution Multiplier: This alters the input image resolution, which impacts the amount of computational resources required by the first layer of the network.</li></ol><p>By adjusting these hyperparameters, a balance can be struck between the model's performance (accuracy) and the computational resources it requires (latency). This makes MobileNets highly adaptable to different resource constraints, allowing them to be deployed in a wide range of applications, from high-end smartphones to low-resource Internet of Things (IoT) devices.</p><p>The original MobileNet paper showed that these models perform well on the ImageNet classification benchmark compared to other efficient models, and demonstrated their effectiveness across various tasks including object detection, fine-grained classification, face attribute detection, and large scale geo-localization.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

Introduced by Srivastava et al. in Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting
 
 Edit
Dropout is a regularization technique for neural networks that drops a unit (along with connections) at training time with a specified probability  (a common value is ). At test time, all units are present, but with weights scaled by  (i.e.  becomes ).

The idea is to prevent co-adaptation, where the neural network becomes too reliant on particular connections, as this could be symptomatic of overfitting. Intuitively, dropout can be thought of as creating an implicit ensemble of neural networks.

used in neural networks to prevent overfitting. It was introduced by Srivastava et al. in 2014. The main idea behind dropout is to randomly "drop out" or deactivate a portion of the neurons, along with their corresponding connections, during the training phase of the network.</p><p>During training, each neuron in the network is temporarily dropped with a specified probability, typically denoted as p (e.g., 0.5). When a neuron is dropped, it is effectively removed from the network for that particular training iteration. As a result, the information flow and computations of the network become more robust and less dependent on any specific neuron or subset of neurons.</p><p>At test time, all neurons are present, but their weights are scaled by (1 - p), which ensures that the expected output from the network remains the same as during training. This scaling is necessary to ensure that the overall output of the network is not affected by the dropout regularization.</p><p>The dropout technique helps prevent overfitting by forcing the network to learn more robust and generalized features. It acts as a form of regularization by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons, where neurons become too specialized to specific input patterns. By randomly dropping neurons during training, dropout encourages the network to learn more diverse representations and prevents it from relying too heavily on any single neuron or feature.</p><p>Intuitively, dropout can be thought of as training multiple neural networks in parallel, where each network is created by randomly dropping different subsets of neurons. This creates an implicit ensemble of networks, and during testing, the predictions from all these networks are combined to make the final prediction, effectively reducing the impact of any individual network.</p><p>Dropout has been widely used in various neural network architectures and has been shown to be effective in reducing overfitting and improving generalization performance. It has become a popular regularization technique in the field of deep learning.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center

Dropout is a technique used in neural networks to prevent them from becoming too specialized and overfitting to the training data.</p><p>Imagine you have a team of workers, each responsible for analyzing different aspects of a problem. In dropout, during training, you randomly "drop out" some of these workers with a certain probability, meaning they don't contribute to the analysis for that particular task. So, for each task, you have a different team of workers.</p><p>By doing this, dropout prevents the workers from relying too much on each other and forces them to become more independent and self-reliant. This helps them learn more general and robust skills instead of becoming too specialized in specific tasks.</p><p>During testing, all workers are present, but their contributions are scaled down based on the dropout probability used during training. This scaling ensures that the overall output of the team remains consistent.</p><p>The idea behind dropout is that by randomly dropping out workers, the network learns to be more resilient and adaptable. It avoids relying too heavily on any individual worker or combination of workers, which can lead to overfitting.</p><p>In simpler terms, dropout is like temporarily removing some members of a team during training, making the remaining members more self-reliant and preventing over-dependence. This helps the network generalize better to new situations and improves its ability to make accurate predictions.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>Gaussian Error Linear Units

Introduced by Hendrycks et al. in Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELUs)
The Gaussian Error Linear Unit, or GELU, is an activation
function. The GELU activation function is aø(x), where
D(x) the standard Gaussian cumulative distribution
function. The GELU nonlinearity weights inputs by their
percentile, rather than gates inputs by their sign as in
ReLUs (x1,&gt;0). Consequently the GELU can be thought of
as a smoother ReLU.
if The GELU (= 0,0 = 1), RcLU, and ELU
2[-+
GELU() aP(X&lt;&amp;) =&amp;ø(x)
ifX~N(O,1).
One can approximate the GELU with
0.52 (14 tanh |v2/a(2-4 0.041715a3)) or
+
xơ(1.702x), but PyTorch's exact implementation is
suffciently fast such that these approximations may be
unnecessary. (See also the SiLU xo(x) which was also
coined in the paper that introduced the GELU.)
GELUs are used in GPT-3, BERT, and most other
Transformers.

an activation function used in neural networks. It is defined as follows: GELU(x) = 0.5 * (1 + tanh(√(2/π) * (x + 0.044715 * x^3))), where tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function.</p><p>The GELU activation function is designed to introduce nonlinearity in the network. It differs from other activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) in that it weights the inputs based on their percentile rather than simply gating them by their sign. This means that the GELU function provides a smoother transition between positive and negative values.</p><p>The GELU function is particularly useful in deep learning models like GPT-3 and BERT, which are based on transformer architectures. It has been shown to improve the performance of these models by providing a more expressive nonlinearity.</p><p>It's worth noting that while there are approximations available for the GELU function, the exact implementation provided by PyTorch is fast enough that these approximations are often unnecessary. The GELU function has gained popularity and is widely used in various deep learning models.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>class GELU(Module):

Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELUs)
Dan Hendrycks, Kevin Gimpel
We propose the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU), a high-performing neural network activation function. The GELU activation function is xΦ(x), where Φ(x) the standard Gaussian cumulative distribution function. The GELU nonlinearity weights inputs by their value, rather than gates inputs by their sign as in ReLUs (x1x&gt;0). We perform an empirical evaluation of the GELU nonlinearity against the ReLU and ELU activations and find performance improvements across all considered computer vision, natural language processing, and speech tasks.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Introduced by Lin et al. in Network In Network
 
 Edit
Global Average Pooling is a pooling operation designed to replace fully connected layers in classical CNNs. The idea is to generate one feature map for each corresponding category of the classification task in the last mlpconv layer. Instead of adding fully connected layers on top of the feature maps, we take the average of each feature map, and the resulting vector is fed directly into the softmax layer.

One advantage of global average pooling over the fully connected layers is that it is more native to the convolution structure by enforcing correspondences between feature maps and categories. Thus the feature maps can be easily interpreted as categories confidence maps. Another advantage is that there is no parameter to optimize in the global average pooling thus overfitting is avoided at this layer. Furthermore, global average pooling sums out the spatial information, thus it is more robust to spatial translations of the input.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

It was proposed by Lin et al. in the paper "Network In Network."</p><p>The main idea behind Global Average Pooling is to replace the fully connected layers typically found at the end of CNNs with a simpler operation. Instead of adding fully connected layers on top of the feature maps, Global Average Pooling takes the average of each feature map to generate a single value for each category or class in the classification task. This resulting vector is then fed directly into the softmax layer for classification.</p><p>There are several advantages of using Global Average Pooling. Firstly, it is more aligned with the convolutional structure of the network. By enforcing correspondences between feature maps and categories, Global Average Pooling enables easier interpretation of the feature maps as confidence maps for each category.</p><p>Secondly, Global Average Pooling does not introduce any additional parameters to optimize, unlike fully connected layers. This helps in avoiding overfitting at this layer and simplifies the model.</p><p>Lastly, Global Average Pooling effectively sums out the spatial information from the feature maps. This makes it more robust to spatial translations or shifts in the input, as the pooling operation focuses on the average values rather than the specific spatial locations.</p><p>Overall, Global Average Pooling provides a simpler and more interpretable alternative to fully connected layers in CNNs, offering benefits such as improved alignment with the convolutional structure, avoidance of overfitting, and robustness to spatial translations.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

Network In Network
Min Lin, Qiang Chen, Shuicheng Yan
We propose a novel deep network structure called "Network In Network" (NIN) to enhance model discriminability for local patches within the receptive field. The conventional convolutional layer uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to scan the input. Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers. We demonstrated the state-of-the-art classification performances with NIN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and reasonable performances on SVHN and MNIST datasets.</div></div></div><div class="flex

deep network structure proposed by Lin et al. in their paper. The main objective of NIN is to improve the discriminability of local patches within the receptive field.</p><p>In conventional convolutional layers, linear filters are applied to the input data followed by a non-linear activation function. Instead, NIN introduces micro neural networks with more complex structures to capture the essential information within the receptive field. These micro neural networks are instantiated with multilayer perceptrons, which are powerful function approximators. By sliding these micro networks over the input data, feature maps are obtained and fed into the next layer.</p><p>One of the key advantages of NIN is the ability to utilize global average pooling over the feature maps in the classification layer. This pooling operation replaces traditional fully connected layers and provides a more interpretable and less prone to overfitting approach. Global average pooling aggregates the information within each feature map by taking their average values, which simplifies the model and avoids the risk of overfitting.</p><p>The authors demonstrated the effectiveness of NIN by achieving state-of-the-art classification performances on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, and reasonable performances on SVHN and MNIST datasets. The NIN architecture, with its micro neural networks and global average pooling, offers a promising approach to improving the discriminability and interpretability of deep neural networks.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>Layer Normalization
Introduced by Ba et al. in Layer Normalization
 
 Edit
Unlike batch normalization, Layer Normalization directly estimates the normalization statistics from the summed inputs to the neurons within a hidden layer so the normalization does not introduce any new dependencies between training cases. It works well for RNNs and improves both the training time and the generalization performance of several existing RNN models. More recently, it has been used with Transformer models.

We compute the layer normalization statistics over all the hidden units in the same layer as follows:

 

 

where  denotes the number of hidden units in a layer. Under layer normalization, all the hidden units in a layer share the same normalization terms  and , but different training cases have different normalization terms. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization does not impose any constraint on the size of the mini-batch and it can be used in the pure online regime with batch size 1.</div></div></div><div

al. in their paper, is a normalization technique used in neural networks. It differs from batch normalization by directly estimating the normalization statistics from the summed inputs to the neurons within a hidden layer. This means that layer normalization does not introduce any new dependencies between training cases.</p><p>Layer normalization is particularly effective for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and has been shown to improve both training time and generalization performance in various RNN models. It has also been successfully applied to Transformer models.</p><p>The computation of layer normalization statistics is done over all the hidden units in the same layer. The normalization terms are shared by all the hidden units in the layer, but different training cases have different normalization terms. This differs from batch normalization, where normalization is performed within each mini-batch.</p><p>One advantage of layer normalization is that it does not impose constraints on the size of the mini-batch. It can be used in scenarios where the batch size is 1, making it suitable for online learning or scenarios with limited memory resources.</p><p>Overall, layer normalization provides an effective way to normalize the inputs to hidden layers in neural networks, improving training efficiency and generalization performance, especially in RNNs and Transformer models.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>import torch

LayerNormalization module in PyTorch. LayerNormalization is a class that inherits from the nn.Module class in PyTorch, making it compatible with other PyTorch modules and functions.</p><p>The LayerNormalization class takes several parameters:</p><ul><li><code>normal_shape</code>: The shape of the input tensor or the last dimension of the input tensor. It can be an integer or a tuple of integers representing the shape.</li><li><code>gamma</code>: A boolean indicating whether to add a scale parameter. If set to True, a scale parameter will be added.</li><li><code>beta</code>: A boolean indicating whether to add an offset parameter. If set to True, an offset parameter will be added.</li><li><code>epsilon</code>: Epsilon value used for calculating the variance.</li></ul><p>In the <code>__init__</code> method, the parameters are initialized, and the <code>reset_parameters</code> method is called to initialize the gamma and beta parameters.</p><p>The <code>forward</code> method performs the forward pass of the layer normalization operation. It calculates the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the input tensor along the last dimension. Then, it normalizes the input tensor by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. If gamma and/or beta parameters are present, they are applied to the normalized tensor. The normalized and scaled tensor is returned as the output.</p><p>The <code>extra_repr</code> method provides a string representation of the LayerNormalization module, including information about its parameters.</p><p>Overall, this implementation allows you to use the LayerNormalization module as a building block in your neural network models. It provides a way to normalize the inputs within a hidden layer, enhancing the performance and stability of the network.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

Layer Normalization
Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, Geoffrey E. Hinton
Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces the training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

introduced to normalize the activities of neurons in deep neural networks, with the goal of reducing training time. It is similar to batch normalization, which computes mean and variance over a mini-batch of training cases to normalize the inputs. However, batch normalization's effectiveness depends on the mini-batch size and is not directly applicable to recurrent neural networks.</p><p>In this paper, the authors propose layer normalization as an alternative. Instead of using the mini-batch statistics, layer normalization computes the mean and variance for normalization from the summed inputs to neurons in a layer on a single training case. Each neuron has its own adaptive bias and gain, which are applied after normalization but before the non-linearity.</p><p>Layer normalization performs the same computation at both training and test times, making it more straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks. By computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step, it effectively stabilizes the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.</p><p>The authors empirically demonstrate that layer normalization significantly reduces training time compared to previous techniques. This approach has proven to be highly effective in deep neural networks, providing stability and improved training efficiency.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>Residual Connection
Introduced by He et al. in Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition
 
 Edit
Residual Connections are a type of skip-connection that learn residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions.

Formally, denoting the desired underlying mapping as , we let the stacked nonlinear layers fit another mapping of . The original mapping is recast into .

The intuition is that it is easier to optimize the residual mapping than to optimize the original, unreferenced mapping. To the extreme, if an identity mapping were optimal, it would be easier to push the residual to zero than to fit an identity mapping by a stack of nonlinear layers.</div></div></div><div class="flex

skip-connections, are a concept introduced in the paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" to improve the training of deep neural networks.</p><p>In traditional neural networks, each layer learns to transform the input data to a desired output representation. However, as the network gets deeper, it becomes harder to optimize the network and prevent degradation in performance. The authors propose using residual connections to address this issue.</p><p>Residual connections work by introducing a shortcut connection that directly connects earlier layers to later layers. Instead of trying to learn the complete transformation from input to output, the network learns to approximate the residual or the difference between the desired output and the current representation. This is represented as the difference between the desired mapping and the original input.</p><p>By introducing these residual connections, the network has the option to learn an identity mapping, where the output of a layer is simply the same as its input. This is beneficial because it is easier for the network to optimize the residual mapping than to optimize the entire mapping. If the identity mapping is the optimal solution, the network can simply push the residuals towards zero.</p><p>Overall, residual connections enable the network to better capture complex relationships and improve the training of deep neural networks by making it easier for the network to learn and optimize the desired underlying mapping.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>Submitted on 10 Dec 2015]
Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition
Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun
Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.
The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC &amp; COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button

Recognition, introduced by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun, addresses the challenge of training deeper neural networks. The paper presents a novel framework called residual learning, which allows for the training of significantly deeper networks compared to previous approaches.</p><p>In traditional neural networks, each layer is responsible for learning a specific transformation from the input to the output. However, as the network becomes deeper, it becomes harder to train and optimize the network's performance. The authors propose a different perspective: instead of directly learning the desired mapping, they focus on learning the residual functions with respect to the layer inputs.</p><p>By formulating the layers as learning residual functions, the network learns to approximate the difference between the desired output and the current representation. This is achieved through the use of skip connections, or residual connections, which directly connect earlier layers to later layers. These connections enable the network to learn an identity mapping if it is the optimal solution, where the output of a layer is the same as its input.</p><p>The authors provide extensive empirical evidence demonstrating the benefits of deep residual networks. By increasing the depth of the networks up to 152 layers, they achieve higher accuracy compared to previous models on the ImageNet dataset. The paper also highlights the success of deep residual networks in various visual recognition tasks, such as object detection and segmentation, where they outperform other approaches and achieve top rankings in competitions like ILSVRC and COCO.</p><p>Overall, the deep residual learning framework provides a solution to the challenge of training deeper neural networks. It allows for increased depth while improving optimization and performance, leading to state-of-the-art results in image recognition tasks.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>Sigmoid Activation
Sigmoid Activations are a type of activation function for
neural networks:
f(a) = 1 /
(1 + exp(-x))
Some drawbacks of this activation that have been noted in
the literature are: sharp damp gradients during
backpropagation from deeper hidden layers to inputs,
gradient saturation, and slow convergence.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button

used in neural networks. They squash the input values between 0 and 1, which makes them useful for models that require a binary output or probabilistic interpretation.</p><p>The sigmoid function is defined as f(a) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x)), where x is the input to the function. When the input is large, the sigmoid function approaches 1, and when the input is small, it approaches 0. This property allows the sigmoid function to introduce non-linearity to the network's computations.</p><p>However, sigmoid activations have some drawbacks. One of the main issues is the problem of vanishing gradients. When backpropagating the gradient through multiple layers, the gradient can become very small, leading to slow learning or even convergence problems. This is known as gradient saturation. Additionally, the sigmoid function has a relatively sharp gradient around the origin, which can cause abrupt changes during training and make optimization difficult.</p><p>Due to these drawbacks, alternative activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) have gained popularity, as they address some of the issues associated with sigmoid activations. ReLU avoids the vanishing gradient problem and speeds up convergence by keeping the gradients flowing for positive inputs. Nonetheless, sigmoid activations can still be useful in certain scenarios, such as binary classification problems or when a probabilistic interpretation is desired.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks
NeurIPS 2020  ·  Patrick Lewis, Ethan Perez, Aleksandra Piktus, Fabio Petroni, Vladimir Karpukhin, Naman Goyal, Heinrich Küttler, Mike Lewis, Wen-tau Yih, Tim Rocktäschel, Sebastian Riedel, Douwe Kiela ·  Edit social preview

Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.</div></div></div><div class="flex

for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks" presented at NeurIPS 2020 addresses the limitations of large pre-trained language models in accessing and manipulating knowledge for knowledge-intensive natural language processing (NLP) tasks. While these models excel in fine-tuning for downstream tasks, their performance on tasks requiring extensive knowledge is relatively lower compared to task-specific architectures. The paper introduces a fine-tuning approach called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that combines pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation.</p><p>In RAG models, the parametric memory is a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model, while the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia. The models utilize a pre-trained neural retriever to access the information from the non-parametric memory. The paper explores two formulations of RAG: one where the same retrieved passages are used for the entire generated sequence, and another where different passages can be used for each token.</p><p>The researchers conducted fine-tuning and evaluation on various knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. The results show that RAG models achieve state-of-the-art performance on three open domain question answering tasks, surpassing parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, RAG models generate language that is more specific, diverse, and factually accurate compared to a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.</p><p>The paper highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented generation models in accessing and manipulating knowledge for a wide range of NLP tasks, offering improved performance and more precise language generation. It also raises important research questions regarding provenance and updating of world knowledge in pre-trained models.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>Tanh Activation

Tanh Activation is an activation function used for neural
networks:
Tanh

f(a)

Historicaly, the tanh function became preferred over the
sigmoid function as it gave better performance for multi-
layer neural networks. But it did not solve the vanishing
gradient problem that sigmoids suffered, which was
tackled more effectively with the introduction of ReLU
activations.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its applications to computer vision remain limited. In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale" introduces the use of Transformer architecture for computer vision tasks. While Transformers have been widely used in natural language processing, their applications in computer vision have been limited. In computer vision, attention mechanisms have typically been used alongside convolutional networks or as replacements for certain components of convolutional networks while maintaining the overall structure.</p><p>This paper challenges the notion that convolutional networks are necessary for computer vision tasks and demonstrates that a pure Transformer architecture applied directly to sequences of image patches can achieve excellent performance in image classification. The proposed architecture, known as Vision Transformer (ViT), performs well when pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to various image recognition benchmarks such as ImageNet, CIFAR-100, and VTAB. ViT achieves state-of-the-art results compared to convolutional networks while requiring fewer computational resources for training.</p><p>By leveraging the self-attention mechanism of Transformers, ViT is able to capture meaningful relationships between image patches and effectively model the dependencies within the image. This allows the model to learn representations that are highly suited for image classification tasks. The paper highlights the potential of Transformers as a powerful alternative to convolutional networks in computer vision and opens up new avenues for research in this field.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtfE_9fVpMOqgyC7Lo43NLrKgIo-u2ToDOuYOa2T%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap break-words"><div>Vision Transformer
Introduced by Dosovitskiy et al. in An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale
 
 Edit
The Vision Transformer, or ViT, is a model for image classification that employs a Transformer-like architecture over patches of the image. An image is split into fixed-size patches, each of them are then linearly embedded, position embeddings are added, and the resulting sequence of vectors is fed to a standard Transformer encoder. In order to perform classification, the standard approach of adding an extra learnable “classification token” to the sequence is used.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

classification model introduced in the paper "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale." It utilizes a Transformer-like architecture to process images.</p><p>In ViT, an input image is divided into fixed-size patches. Each patch is then linearly transformed to create embeddings. Position embeddings, which encode the spatial information of the patches, are added to the embeddings. The resulting sequence of vectors is fed into a standard Transformer encoder.</p><p>To enable classification, an extra learnable "classification token" is added to the sequence. This token allows the model to consider the global context of the image while making predictions. The final output of the Transformer encoder, which incorporates both local and global information, is used for classification.</p><p>By leveraging the self-attention mechanism of Transformers, ViT captures relationships between patches and effectively models the dependencies within the image. This allows the model to learn representations suitable for image classification tasks. ViT has shown promising performance, achieving competitive results on various image classification benchmarks while offering advantages such as scalability and adaptability to different image sizes.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Architectures: Exploring Key Concepts and Techniques</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Deep learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, enabling remarkable achievements across various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and information retrieval. In recent years, researchers have made significant strides in developing novel architectures and techniques that enhance the performance and efficiency of deep learning models. This essay delves into a diverse range of topics in deep learning, highlighting key concepts and techniques that have shaped the landscape of modern machine learning.</p><p>The journey begins with a discussion on generative retrieval and synthetic queries, exploring the fascinating realm of information retrieval and its scalability to vast corpora. The study evaluates the effectiveness of generative retrieval techniques, shedding light on the importance of synthetic queries and the challenges associated with scaling model parameters. Through empirical investigations, intriguing findings are uncovered, contributing to the advancement of generative retrieval and expanding our understanding of information retrieval systems.</p><p>Continuing the exploration, the essay delves into cutting-edge architectural designs that have revolutionized various domains. The MLP-Mixer architecture, introduced as an all-MLP (multi-layer perceptron) solution for vision tasks, challenges traditional convolutional and attention-based models. We delve into its unique design, which relies solely on multi-layer perceptrons, paving the way for alternative approaches in computer vision.</p><p>Furthermore, we delve into the realm of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their advancements. The Sequencer architecture, leveraging long short-term memory (LSTM) units, presents a powerful solution for image classification. We examine its innovative design, which capitalizes on LSTMs to model long-range dependencies, leading to impressive performance in various vision tasks.</p><p>Optimization algorithms also play a crucial role in the success of deep learning models. We explore the AdamW algorithm, a variant of the Adam optimizer, which decouples weight decay regularization to enhance training efficiency. Understanding these optimization techniques is essential for improving convergence and preventing overfitting, empowering practitioners to develop more robust models.</p><p>Pooling operations are fundamental components in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We analyze average pooling, a technique that calculates the average value of patches in a feature map, and its advantages over max pooling. Additionally, we delve into the concept of dropout, a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by randomly dropping units during training, and its simplicity and effectiveness in preventing model co-adaptation.</p><p>The essay also examines the Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELUs) activation function and its impact on the performance of neural networks. We explore its unique characteristics, including its ability to mitigate gradient saturation and its potential to improve convergence rates. Additionally, we delve into layer normalization, a technique that normalizes the activities of neurons within hidden layers, enhancing stability and performance in deep neural networks.</p><p>Lastly, we explore advancements in image recognition with the introduction of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. This revolutionary architecture applies the Transformer framework directly to sequences of image patches, challenging the conventional reliance on convolutional networks. By leveraging attention mechanisms and the integration of image patches, ViT achieves exceptional performance on image classification tasks, even with substantially fewer computational resources.</p><p>Through this essay, we embark on a journey through the advancements in deep learning architectures, unraveling key concepts and techniques that have transformed the field. Each topic explored contributes to the rich tapestry of knowledge that propels the development of efficient, accurate, and scalable models. By understanding these advancements, researchers and practitioners can harness the power of deep learning to tackle complex real-world challenges with unprecedented precision and efficiency.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Aprendizaje Profundo: Explorando Conceptos y Técnicas Clave</p><p>Introducción:</p><p>El aprendizaje profundo ha revolucionado el campo de la inteligencia artificial, logrando logros notables en diversas áreas como la visión por computadora, el procesamiento del lenguaje natural y la recuperación de información. En los últimos años, los investigadores han realizado avances significativos en el desarrollo de arquitecturas y técnicas novedosas que mejoran el rendimiento y la eficiencia de los modelos de aprendizaje profundo. En este ensayo, exploraremos una amplia gama de temas en aprendizaje profundo, destacando conceptos y técnicas clave que han dado forma al panorama del aprendizaje automático moderno.</p><p>El viaje comienza con una discusión sobre la recuperación generativa y las consultas sintéticas, explorando el fascinante mundo de la recuperación de información y su escalabilidad a corpus extensos. Este estudio evalúa la efectividad de las técnicas de recuperación generativa, arrojando luz sobre la importancia de las consultas sintéticas y los desafíos asociados con la escalabilidad de los parámetros del modelo. A través de investigaciones empíricas, se descubren hallazgos intrigantes que contribuyen al avance de la recuperación generativa y amplían nuestra comprensión de los sistemas de recuperación de información.</p><p>Continuando con la exploración, adentrémonos en diseños arquitectónicos de vanguardia que han revolucionado diversos campos. La arquitectura MLP-Mixer, presentada como una solución basada en MLP (perceptrón multicapa) para tareas de visión, desafía los modelos convolucionales y basados en atención tradicionales. Nos sumergiremos en su diseño único, que se basa exclusivamente en perceptrones multicapa, abriendo el camino a enfoques alternativos en visión por computadora.</p><p>Además, nos adentraremos en el ámbito de las redes neuronales recurrentes (RNN) y sus avances. La arquitectura Sequencer, que utiliza unidades de memoria a corto y largo plazo (LSTM), se presenta como una solución potente para la clasificación de imágenes. Examinaremos su diseño innovador, que aprovecha las LSTM para modelar dependencias a largo plazo, logrando un rendimiento impresionante en diversas tareas de visión.</p><p>Los algoritmos de optimización también desempeñan un papel crucial en el éxito de los modelos de aprendizaje profundo. Exploraremos el algoritmo AdamW, una variante del optimizador Adam que desacopla la regularización de peso para mejorar la eficiencia del entrenamiento. Comprender estas técnicas de optimización es esencial para mejorar la convergencia y prevenir el sobreajuste, permitiendo a los profesionales desarrollar modelos más sólidos.</p><p>Las operaciones de pooling son componentes fundamentales en las redes neuronales convolucionales (CNN). Analizaremos el pooling promedio, una técnica que calcula el valor promedio de las áreas de una característica, y sus ventajas sobre el pooling máximo. Además, profundizaremos en el concepto de dropout, una técnica de regularización que mitiga el sobreajuste eliminando de forma aleatoria unidades durante el entrenamiento, y su simplicidad y eficacia para prevenir</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Tradicionalmente utilizadas en tareas de procesamiento del lenguaje natural, las redes transformadoras se han mostrado eficaces en la clasificación de imágenes cuando se aplican directamente a secuencias de parches de imagen. Analizaremos la arquitectura ViT (Vision Transformer) y su capacidad para lograr resultados sobresalientes en tareas de clasificación de imágenes, utilizando menos recursos computacionales en comparación con las redes convolucionales tradicionales.</p><p>En resumen, este ensayo nos llevará a través de un viaje emocionante por los avances más recientes en arquitecturas y técnicas de aprendizaje profundo. Desde la recuperación generativa y las consultas sintéticas hasta las conexiones residuales y las redes transformadoras, exploraremos cómo estos conceptos y técnicas están remodelando el campo de la inteligencia artificial y abriendo nuevas posibilidades en la visión por computadora y el procesamiento del lenguaje natural. Estos avances prometen mejorar el rendimiento, la eficiencia y la capacidad de generalización de los modelos de aprendizaje profundo, acercándonos cada vez más a una comprensión y aplicación más

diversos temas relacionados con el aprendizaje profundo y la inteligencia artificial. Comenzamos discutiendo la recuperación generativa y las consultas sintéticas, enfocándonos en cómo estas técnicas pueden mejorar la recuperación de información en grandes conjuntos de datos.</p><p>Luego, nos adentramos en el tema del sobreajuste en los modelos de aprendizaje profundo, analizando los desafíos asociados y las estrategias para mitigarlo, como el uso de conjuntos de entrenamiento más grandes y técnicas de regularización.</p><p>Continuamos hablando sobre la activación GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Units), una función de activación que proporciona un enfoque suave y no lineal para el procesamiento de datos en redes neuronales. Discutimos cómo esta función puede mejorar el rendimiento y la capacidad de generalización de los modelos.</p><p>Otro tema importante que exploramos fueron las conexiones residuales, introducidas en la arquitectura ResNet. Estas conexiones permiten aprender funciones residuales en referencia a las entradas de las capas, facilitando la optimización y superando los desafíos asociados con los gradientes desvanecientes.</p><p>Finalmente, nos sumergimos en el mundo de las redes transformadoras y su aplicación en la visión por computadora. Analizamos la arquitectura ViT (Vision Transformer) y cómo esta arquitectura puede lograr resultados sobresalientes en la clasificación de imágenes al aplicarse directamente a secuencias de parches de imagen.</p><p>En general, esta conversación ha abarcado una amplia gama de temas en el campo del aprendizaje profundo y la inteligencia artificial. Desde técnicas de recuperación generativa y control del sobreajuste hasta funciones de activación avanzadas y arquitecturas innovadoras como las redes transformadoras, hemos explorado cómo estos conceptos y técnicas están transformando la forma en que abordamos problemas en el procesamiento del lenguaje natural y la visión por computadora. Estos avances nos acercan cada vez más a la creación de modelos más eficientes, precisos y capaces de comprender y procesar información de manera más inteligente.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

sobre el Dropout, una técnica de regularización utilizada en redes neuronales para evitar el sobreajuste. Explicamos cómo el Dropout selecciona unidades al azar durante el entrenamiento y las elimina temporalmente, lo que ayuda a prevenir la dependencia excesiva de ciertas conexiones y promueve una generalización mejorada del modelo.</p><p>Además, hablamos sobre la activación Sigmoid, una función comúnmente utilizada en redes neuronales que mapea los valores de entrada a un rango de 0 a 1. Discutimos algunas limitaciones de esta función, como los problemas de gradientes que se desvanecen o saturan, y cómo su rendimiento fue superado por funciones de activación más eficientes, como ReLU y GELU.</p><p>En resumen, cubrimos una amplia variedad de temas relacionados con el aprendizaje profundo, desde técnicas de regularización y funciones de activación, hasta arquitecturas innovadoras como las conexiones residuales y las redes transformadoras. Estos temas representan avances significativos en el campo de la inteligencia artificial y demuestran cómo la investigación y el desarrollo continúan impulsando la capacidad de los modelos para comprender, procesar y generar información de manera más efectiva.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1
