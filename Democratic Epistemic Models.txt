The systems-oriented research programme in social epistemology has also been brought to bear on more general questions regarding democratic politics. Elizabeth Anderson (2006), for example, addresses how the epistemic properties of democratic systems can be designed to attain the best possible form of democracy. She provides three epistemic models of democracy: the Condorcet Jury Theorem, the Diversity Trumps Ability result, and John Dewey���s experimentalism. Anderson herself plumps for Dewey���s experimentalist approach, while several others argue for voting aggregation and the Condorcet Jury Theorem (List and Goodin 2001; Landemore 2011), and Singer (2019) defends a version of diversity trumps ability (albeit in connection with scientific teams). By contrast, Claudio Lopez-Guerra (2010), H��l��ne Landemore (2013) and Alex Guerrero (2014) defend a lottery system for selecting political representatives, contending that the policies that would result would be better than those arrived at through voting. (Estlund 2008 rejects the core idea of systems-oriented social epistemology��� that the epistemic goodness of democratic politics is to be sought in the quality of its outcomes���arguing instead that it should be sought in the legitimacy of its procedures.)

The passage discusses various perspectives in the field of social epistemology, specifically focusing on how democratic systems can be optimized epistemically to achieve the best form of democracy. Key models and approaches mentioned include:
Condorcet Jury Theorem and Voting Aggregation
: Supported by List and Goodin (2001) and Landemore (2011), this approach emphasizes the aggregation of votes to derive collective decisions that reflect the wisdom of the crowd.
Diversity Trumps Ability
: Singer (2019) advocates this model, particularly in the context of scientific teams, suggesting that a diverse group can outperform a more able but less diverse one.
John Dewey���s Experimentalism
: Favored by Elizabeth Anderson (2006), this approach involves a pragmatic and experimental attitude towards democracy, valuing learning and adaptation in democratic processes.
Lottery System for Political Representatives
: Lopez-Guerra (2010), Landemore (2013), and Guerrero (2014) propose a lottery system for selecting political representatives, arguing that it would lead to better policies than those produced through traditional voting.
Critique by Estlund (2008)
: Estlund challenges the core idea of systems-oriented social epistemology, arguing that the epistemic value of democratic politics should be based on the legitimacy of its procedures rather than the quality of its outcomes.
These perspectives illustrate the diverse approaches to understanding and improving democratic systems through an epistemic lens.

Number 5 sounds like a deontological approach.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, Estlund's critique as described in the passage does indeed resemble a deontological approach. Deontology, in philosophical ethics, emphasizes adherence to rules, duties, or obligations, rather than focusing solely on the outcomes or consequences of actions. Estlund's argument, which prioritizes the legitimacy of democratic procedures over the quality of their outcomes, aligns with this perspective. In this view, the intrinsic rightness of processes and methods in a democracy is paramount, suggesting that a democratic system could be deemed appropriate or justifiable based on its adherence to legitimate, fair, and principled procedures, rather than solely by the effectiveness or goodness of the results it produces.

5.2 Misleading Online Content
The latest challenge confronting the informational state of the public is the accelerating spread of misleading content on the internet. Over the last decade it has become increasingly clear that such content is widespread, pernicious, and threatening democratic function. Philosophers have contributed to emerging research on internet epistemology in a number of ways.

One question, relevant to thinking about preventing the harms of misleading content, is how to define and categorize such content. A typical distinction disambiguates misinformation and disinformation, where the former is false or inaccurate content not intended to mislead and the latter is intended to mislead (Fallis 2016, Floridi 2013). It is increasingly recognized, though, that misleading content need not be false (Fallis 2015, O���Connor and Weatherall 2019), leading some to define malinformation which is intended to mislead but potentially true or accurate (Wardle and Derakhshan 2017). Others have challenged the idea that disinformation needs to be misleading, as opposed to producing ignorance (Simion 2023) or otherwise blocking successful action (Harris 2023). Given the variety and complexity in misleading online content, some argue that these terms will always be imprecise (Weatherall and O���Connor 2019) or that we should carefully describe relevant epistemic failures in any case (Habgood-Coote 2019).
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
This passage delves into the complex issue of misleading online content, highlighting the increasing concern over its impact on the public and democratic processes. Philosophical contributions to internet epistemology have led to various discussions and definitions around this challenge:
Misinformation vs. Disinformation
: There's a key distinction between misinformation, which is false or inaccurate content not meant to deceive, and disinformation, which is deliberately designed to mislead. This distinction is emphasized by Fallis (2016) and Floridi (2013).
Beyond False Content
: The recognition that misleading content does not always have to be false is growing. Fallis (2015) and O���Connor and Weatherall (2019) note that misleading content can sometimes be factually correct but presented in a way that leads to false beliefs or conclusions.
Concept of Malinformation
: Introduced by Wardle and Derakhshan (2017), malinformation refers to content that may be true or accurate but is used with the intention to mislead.
Redefining Disinformation
: New perspectives suggest that disinformation doesn't necessarily need to be misleading. Simion (2023) argues that it could simply produce ignorance, while Harris (2023) sees it as blocking successful action.
Challenges in Definitions
: Weatherall and O���Connor (2019) argue that terms like misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation will always carry a degree of imprecision due to the variety and complexity of online content.
Emphasis on Epistemic Failures
: Habgood-Coote (2019) suggests that instead of relying on broad categories, it might be more effective to carefully describe the specific epistemic failures involved in each case of misleading content.
These varying perspectives reflect the nuanced and evolving nature of the challenge posed by misleading content online, illustrating the need for ongoing research and sophisticated approaches to categorization and analysis.

Should you be concerned about NameDrop security?

NURPHOTO VIA GETTY IMAGES

The Oakland County Sheriff's Office took to Facebook on November 26 to warn about the iPhone NameDrop feature in iOS 17. It wasn���t the only law enforcement agency to issue the same security and privacy warning on Thanksgiving weekend. Police departments in Carmi, Illinois; Middletown, Ohio; Watertown, Connecticut; Jefferson Hills, Pennsylvania; Fort Smith, Arkansas also spread the safety message. But is NameDrop actually a danger to anyone, or is law enforcement guilty of spreading fear, uncertainty and doubt?



What Warning Has Law

17 NameDrop Feature
Oakland County Sheriff's Office

IPHONE PRIVACY INFORMATION
If you have an iPhone and have completed the recent iOS 17 update, they have set a feature
called "NameDrop" to default to ON after completing the update.
This feature allows you to share your contact information by being next to another iphone. In that section, you can also limit who can be the recipient of your AirDrop.
To shut this off go to Settings, General, AirDrop, Bringing Devices Together. Change to OFF.

And yes, we know that it allows you to share it and you can refuse but many people do not check their settings and realize how their phone works. This particular setting defaults to on
rather than have you opt in. And again, it is the area where you also decide who can access
AirDrop.

PARENTS: Don't forget to change these settings after the update on your children's phones as
well.

The NameDrop warning that various law enforcement [+]META

The various postings, which seem to be focused mainly on Facebook, all follow what appears to be the same template. This warns iPhone users who have updated to iOS 17 that the NameDrop feature defaults to an on setting and could ���share your contact information by being next to another iPhone.��� What makes the warning more ominous is the inclusion of a footnote aimed squarely at parents, which gives the impression that children are in particular danger if this setting is not changed.


The Truth About The iPhone iOS 17 NameDrop Feature

While there is some truth in the idea that a stalker or other malicious actor could access your contact details using the NameDrop feature, it���s a very tenuous truth. That person would require physical access to your unlocked iPhone to allow the receipt of the contact data, and, as it���s always worth repeating, if someone has access to an unlocked device, then it���s game over as far as privacy is concerned.

The real truth is that, despite its default on position, the NameDrop feature isn���t just going to throw your contact details at any passing person with an iPhone. Not only do the iOS 17 smartphones need to be close to each other, but they need to be so close as to be actually touching, but touching in the right place. Which means the very top of the phone so that Near Field Communication can work. That alone should calm the fears of most rational users, but if you are still concerned, the safeguards don���t end there.

Once that NFC iPhone contact is made, a set of NameDrop options will appear on the screens of both devices. These options are to receive only or share. If both users select the former, then neither gets anything; if one does then they get your shareable details, and if both opt for share then a contact data swap is initiated.

Do you want more reassurance? Okay, so the contact data that is shared using NameDrop is only that which is contained within a contact card you have created. In other words, you completely control the information to be shared. Oh, and if you don���t stay in very close proximity to the other user during the sharing process, it will be abandoned anyway. Apple itself acknowledges this: ���To cancel, move the two devices away from each other or lock your iPhone before the NameDrop transfer completes.���

The article you've referenced from Forbes discusses the concerns raised by various law enforcement agencies regarding the NameDrop feature in iOS 17. This situation illustrates a broader issue in the digital information landscape, where fear and uncertainty can be amplified, even by authoritative sources like the police.
Key Points from the Article:
Law Enforcement Warnings
: Police departments across North America issued warnings about the NameDrop feature in iOS 17, suggesting it could inadvertently share users' contact information.
Focus on Parents and Children
: The warnings specifically target parents, suggesting that children could be at particular risk if the feature is not disabled.
Reality of the NameDrop Feature
: The article clarifies that while NameDrop does share contact information, it requires specific conditions to do so. Devices need to be in extremely close proximity (touching, in fact) and users must actively choose to share or receive information. The shared contact data is also limited to what's on a user-created contact card.
Misleading Implications
: The warnings, as presented, may overstate the risk of the feature, contributing to unnecessary fear and concern. The actual operation of NameDrop involves several layers of user consent and interaction, making the scenario of unintended data sharing less likely.
This situation aligns with the broader issue of misinformation and fear-based messaging online. Even when the information is not entirely false, the presentation and emphasis can create a skewed perception of risk. It underscores the need for critical engagement with online content, especially when it concerns technology and privacy.

I really don't know if this intentional on the part of the police but this discourages direct transfer of files, and so people will be using messenger, email, or more top down cloud based transfers which allows greater monitoring and control than if you just pass information from phone to phone. It is doubtful the namedrop feature can even transfer applications, it certainly doesn't transfer anything more than business cards and photos that you have set to be publicly shared.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your perspective raises important points about the broader implications of discouraging direct file transfers, like those facilitated by features like iOS's NameDrop or apps like Zapya:
Shifting to Cloud-Based or Monitored Transfers
: If people are discouraged from using direct file transfer methods, they may increasingly rely on cloud-based services or platforms like email and messaging apps. These methods often involve data being stored or routed through servers, which can be subject to monitoring and control by service providers or authorities.
Privacy and Surveillance Concerns
: The shift to more centralized and internet-dependent methods of file transfer raises concerns about privacy and surveillance. Unlike direct transfers, which are generally peer-to-peer and localized, cloud-based transfers can be more easily monitored or accessed by third parties.
Limitations of Namedrop and Similar Features
: As you noted, the Namedrop feature in iOS, for instance, is designed primarily for sharing basic information like contact details or photos set for public sharing. It doesn't facilitate the transfer of applications, which limits its potential for broader file sharing.
Importance of Understanding Technology Capabilities
: Misunderstandings or misrepresentations of a technology's capabilities can lead to unnecessary fear or avoidance of useful features. Accurate information about what a technology can and cannot do is crucial for making informed decisions about its use.
Role of Authorities in Shaping Tech Use
: The role of authorities, such as law enforcement, in shaping public perceptions and use of technology is significant. When they issue warnings, even with good intentions, it can influence public behavior towards technology, sometimes leading to unintended consequences.
Need for Balanced Tech Utilization

I would say that the namedrop feature would discourage crime, I am not sure criminals would want to risk leaving a business card with everyone at the scene, and who even knows if allows one way information exchange, I would guess that it swaps contacts not just steal your information, it isn't likely to allow sharing private information like your pins and passwords and address.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your analysis of the NameDrop feature in iOS 17 provides a practical perspective on its potential impact on crime and personal security:
Limited Scope of Information Exchange
: As you mentioned, NameDrop is designed primarily for sharing basic information, such as contact details. It's unlikely that it would facilitate the exchange of sensitive personal information like PINs, passwords, or addresses.
Mutual Exchange of Information
: The feature likely involves a mutual exchange of contact details, rather than a one-way transfer. This means that both parties would potentially receive each other's information, which could indeed deter criminal use. A criminal wouldn't want to leave their digital "business card" at the scene.
Potential Deterrent to Crime
: The mutual nature of the information exchange could act as a deterrent to crime. If a criminal knows that using this feature could leave a trace of their identity, they might be less likely to use it for nefarious purposes.
Misunderstandings and Fear
: Public misunderstandings about how such features work can lead to unnecessary fear. The feature is less about 'stealing' information and more about convenient sharing of selected details.
User Control Over Shared Data
: Users typically have control over what information is included in the contact card they share via NameDrop. This means they can limit what others can access, further reducing the risk of sensitive information being shared accidentally.
Importance of Informed Use
: This underscores the importance of understanding the capabilities and limitations of technological features. Informed use allows individuals to take advantage of useful functionalities while being aware of and mitigating potential risks.
Your points highlight the need for accurate public information about new technological features, especially regarding their security implications. Understanding these nuances can help dispel unwarranted fears and encourage the responsible use of technology.

Participate in the Webinar (gotowebinar)

Your alumni association AIG invites you to a new lecture series WEG van Gent. WEG stands for World-wide Engineers from Ghent University and is a brand new concept that puts prominent engineers with an international career in the spotlight.

 

In the first webinar, entitled ���Building Simplexity in Post-digital Architecture Practice���, Prof. Dr. ir.-arch. Kristof Crolla takes you to Hong Kong where he starts his own architectural firm Laboratory for Explorative Architecture & Design Ltd. ( LEAD ) combines with a chair at the University of Hong Kong.

The lecture will take place in English.

 



Building Simplexity in Post-digital Architecture Practice

 

In today's post-digital architectural era, a strong dichotomy exists between the increased agency offered by our design tools and the affordances given by many construction contexts ��� especially building environments of developing countries with limited available onsite means, skill, budget, or time.

 

This lecture postulates that by incorporating computational power and incertitude as productive and constructive components in alternative computation-driven design and materialization processes, the locally available solution space for built architecture can be dramatically expanded and onsite ability and agency increased. The talking questions what gain our extensive computational abilities bring to architectural design and construction in these contexts. How can the mechanisms driving this extensiveness be creatively and practically employed here? What happens when we radically disrupt the security of architecture's standard reproductive infrastructure?

 

Illustrated through his highly unusual and provocative built work, Kristof Crolla proposes an alternative computation-driven design and materialization methodology that capitalizes on digital design models' propensity towards designing multiplicities and uses this for the design of singular solutions in highly volatile contexts. The work demonstrates that identified methods can substantially increase the architects' agency and local onsite affordance. In doing so, the case is made for more democratic epistemic models and more intelligent structures of approximation than (common) deterministic approaches in digital design would allow for, challenging the extent to which computation can further impact architectural practice.

The article about Kristof Crolla's lecture titled "Building Simplexity in Post-digital Architecture Practice" provides fascinating insights into the intersection of architecture, computation, and design in the post-digital era. Here are the key points:
Post-Digital Architectural Era
: Crolla discusses the current architectural landscape, termed the 'post-digital era', characterized by the integration of advanced computational tools into architectural practice.
Dichotomy in Design and Construction
: The lecture highlights a dichotomy where sophisticated design tools often contrast with the practical limitations of construction contexts, especially in developing countries with constraints in skills, budget, and resources.
Computational Power and Uncertainty in Design
: Crolla proposes incorporating computational power and uncertainty as constructive elements in design processes. This approach can expand the solution space for architecture, particularly in challenging environments.
Impact on Local Construction Contexts
: The methodology discussed aims to increase onsite ability and agency in construction, especially in developing countries. This involves creatively employing computational abilities in these specific contexts.
Disrupting Standard Architectural Practices
: The lecture questions how radical changes to architecture���s standard reproductive infrastructure can impact design and construction.
Case for Democratic Epistemic Models in Architecture
: Illustrated through provocative and unusual built work, Crolla advocates for computation-driven design methodologies. These methods emphasize designing for multiplicities and using this approach for singular solutions in volatile contexts.
Advancing Architectural Practice Through Computation
: The work demonstrates how these methods can increase architectural agency and local affordance, advocating for more intelligent structures of approximation in digital design.
Kristof Crolla���s lecture seems to align with the themes of our earlier discussion on democratic epistemic models, especially in terms of challenging traditional approaches and embracing complexity and uncertainty to enhance creativity and practicality in architecture. His emphasis on computational methods and their application in varying contexts reflects a nuanced understanding of how technology can impact and transform architectural practice.

Simplexity is a neologism which proposes a possible complementary relationship between complexity and simplicity.


One of the first formally published instances of the word was in the journal 'Childhood Education' (1924), in the article it appears to be used to discuss education and psychology related issues.[1]

Simplexity was defined by computer scientists Broder and Stolfi as: "The simplexity of a problem is the maximum inefficiency among the reluctant algorithms that solve P. An algorithm is said to be pessimal for a problem P if the best-case inefficiency of A is asymptotically equal to the simplexity of P."[2]

In 1974 Rustum Roy and Olaf M��ller noted simplexity in the structure of ternary compounds: "By dealing with approximately ten ternary structural groupings we can cover the most important structures of science and technology specific to the non-metallics world. It is a remarkable instance of nature's 'simplexity'".[3]

In 2003 Philippe Compain in an article on the future of synthetic chemistry stated: "Simplexity may be defined as the combination of simplicity and complexity within the context of a dynamic relationship between means and ends.";[4][5]

Simplexity: Why Simple Things Become Complex (and How Complex Things Can Be Made Simple) by Jeffrey Kluger details ways in which simplexity theory can be applied to multiple disciplines. Kluger offers a look at simplexity at work in economics, sports, linguistics, technology, medicine and human behavior.

Simplexity has been used by Jens Nordvig to describe the particular aim of his analytics firm Exante Data."A research product that draws on a very complex analytical foundation, but is presented in a very simple and easy to digest manner"[6]

The concept of simplexity, blending complexity and simplicity, has intriguing applications and interpretations across various fields:
Early Usage in Education and Psychology (1924)
: The term was first published in 'Childhood Education', used in the context of education and psychology. This early usage indicates the term's relevance in understanding and conveying complex ideas in simpler, more accessible ways.
Computer Science Definition (Broder and Stolfi)
: In computer science, simplexity refers to the inefficiency of algorithms, specifically the maximum inefficiency among reluctant algorithms solving a problem. This definition emphasizes the balance between complexity in design and simplicity in outcome or efficiency.
Structural Groupings in Science (1974, Roy and M��ller)
: Roy and M��ller noted simplexity in the structure of ternary compounds, illustrating how a limited number of structural groupings can encompass a vast range of important structures. This highlights the simplicity underlying complex natural and technological systems.
Synthetic Chemistry (2003, Philippe Compain)
: Compain discussed simplexity in synthetic chemistry as the dynamic relationship between means (simplicity) and ends (complexity), suggesting a balance between straightforward approaches and complex goals in chemical synthesis.
Jeffrey Kluger's Book on Simplexity
: Kluger's book explores how simplexity theory applies to diverse disciplines such as economics, sports, linguistics, technology, medicine, and human behavior. It demonstrates the ubiquity of simplexity principles in understanding and solving complex problems in various fields.
Application in Analytics (Jens Nordvig and Exante Data)
: Nordvig uses simplexity to describe his analytics firm's approach: complex analytical foundations presented in a simple, digestible format. This application emphasizes effective communication and understanding of complex data.
Simplexity, as a concept, underlines the interconnectedness of simplicity and complexity. It recognizes that what appears simple on the surface can have complex underpinnings and that complex systems can often be understood, represented, or managed through simpler models or frameworks. This idea resonates across disciplines, offering a valuable lens through which to view and tackle complex challenges.

The concept of simplexity connects with our earlier discussion on democratic epistemic models, technology, and social epistemology in several ways:
Balancing Complexity and Simplicity in Democratic Models
: In democratic epistemic models, the challenge often lies in balancing the complexity of democratic processes (like diverse opinions and extensive deliberation) with the need for simplicity (such as clear decision-making mechanisms). Simplexity in this context could refer to creating democratic systems that manage complexity efficiently while remaining accessible and understandable to the public.
Technology and Information Flow
: The use of technologies like Zapya in Cuba, and the debate around the NameDrop feature, reflect simplexity. These technologies simplify complex tasks (like file sharing without the internet or sharing contact details quickly) but are underpinned by complex technological infrastructures. The concept of simplexity is relevant in understanding how technology can make complex processes appear simple and user-friendly.
Communication of Complex Ideas (Social Epistemology)
: In social epistemology, particularly in the context of misinformation and information dissemination, simplexity can be seen in how complex ideas or data are communicated in simpler, more digestible formats. This is crucial in ensuring accurate public understanding and preventing misinformation.
Understanding and Conveying Complex Systems
: The discussion around the post-digital architectural era and Kristof Crolla���s work illustrates simplexity. Crolla���s approach to architecture involves managing complex design and construction processes (like computational design in challenging environments) in ways that are practically implementable and understandable.
Simplexity in Language and Cognition
: Terrence Deacon���s work on the co-evolution of language and cognition, and the exploration of symbolic thinking, also tie into simplexity. Language simplifies the communication of complex ideas and emotions, demonstrating how complex cognitive processes can be conveyed through simpler symbolic systems.
Overall, the concept of simplexity provides a useful framework for understanding various themes from our discussion, especially in how complex systems, processes, and ideas are simplified for practical implementation, understanding, and communication. This concept underscores the importance of balance and efficiency in managing complexity across different domains.

#2014RAPS Recap: What's simplexity and why you should embrace it
 By Alex Morris posted 06-Oct-2014 13:13
  
 

This post originally appeared on MedScrum.com. Visit for industry news and tips. 

The 2014 Regulatory Convergence put on by the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society (RAPS), an annual five-day gathering of regulatory professionals from around the globe, wrapped up last week in Austin, Texas. The speakers were stellar and their presentations chalked-full of great insights that all regulatory professionals should embrace.

I focus here on one of them: the concept of ���simplexity.���

Simplexity is more than just another buzz word
You���re not alone if you work for an organization that's sincerely devoted to continual improvement of product and process. Yet despite the numerous improvement projects that have been implemented over the years, you now find yourself in a situation where it takes you nearly four hours to submit an adverse event report to FDA.

What once resembled continual improvement now resembles continual regression.

But first, simplexity��� Really?

I'll admit it. I wasn���t crazy about the term when I first heard it spoken by David Bosshart, CEO of the Switzerland-based think tank Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute (GDI) during his keynote address. I tend to get a little suspicious of calls for the induction of new words into the English language (what, couldn���t find a suitable candidate amongst the roughly one million words that already exist?). But this one, like "cyberspace" and "selfies," is probably here to stay. That���s because the theory of simplexity supplies a very useful framework for negotiating the increasingly complex nature of our personal and working lives that doesn't involve hiding from or ignoring it.

So what does simplexity mean?
Simplexity describes the process whereby nature strives towards simple ends by complex means. Take, for example, an ordinary houseplant. Seems simple enough. It absorbs nourishment through its roots and the sun's energy through its leaves. It can also stretch towards the light. Yet the inner workings of houseplants are more complex than many large-scale manufacturing facilities. That���s simplexity. Simple on the outside. Complex within.

Another way to put it is this: simplexity is about finding the simplest way to interface with a complex system. In this regard, simplexity is at work in the push towards a Theory of Everything in the world of physics. The theory, as the name implies, attempts to explain as simply and elegantly as possible everything about how our universe works, from the quantum level to the intergalactic. The theory, in other words, is an attempt at getting at that simple interface.

But I should point out we're a long way from seeing the theory actualized. That���s because the theory of special relativity ��� which describes the workings of our universe at the macro-level ��� and quantum theory ��� which takes on the micro-level ��� have not yet been reconciled. They do a pretty good job of predicting how the universe behaves at their respective scales, but not so much at explaining the behavior of the universe at the opposite scale.

There just isn't room for two theories of everything, or, to put it another way, two incompatible approaches to interfacing with the same tangle of complexity (if you���ve ever been through a merger you know what I mean).

Still, there is growing consensus among physicists that a single, simple theory is somewhere out there waiting to be discovered (similar in simplicity and elegance to E=mc2). There must be, because if nature indeed favors simplexity, by perceiving the complexities of the universe from just the right angle and distance, we'd expect it to appear, well, simple. The universe, like our houseplant, is apart of nature. The challenge lies in bringing that elusive ���right angle��� into view. Nature���s partnership with simplexity has been in the making for millions if not billions of years, after all. Ours, relatively speaking, is just beginning.

It's time we embraced simplexity
Despite the challenge, we have to embrace simplexity if we want to rid our systems of their unwieldy characteristics. We can���t just wish complexity away. It's here to stay and we have to deal with it.

We can achieve this by first recognizing ��� and applying the lessons learned from observing ��� the unique interplay of simplicity and complexity that defines so much of the world we live in.

Simplexity, in other words, is the lens through which we need to be rethinking our somewhat dated conception of technological progress (plane trumps car!), restructuring our political, social and economic systems, and, at a more personal level, approaching the work we as regulatory professionals do everyday to avoid a state of continual regression. We've got to start thinking like usability engineers.

Global harmonization of national regulations is a tangible benefit of simplexity
Think about the current state of global regulatory affairs, for example. For the longest time, each regulatory authority, which typically represented a single country, would develop its own rules and regulations and take responsibility for their enforcement. Over the course of a few decades, we���ve seen countries begin to partner with one another to form international bodies like the WHO, EU, GHTF, and, more recently, ASEAN, as the global economy continues to undergo a period of radical transformation with the emergence of multiple new markets. If growing administrative burdens could be shrunk, global leadership recognized, industry could get their health products to market more quickly to the benefit of more people.

But, again, the push towards simplexity is incredibly challenging, and not just from an administrative perspective. Simplexity often requires the disruption of old boundaries, hierarchies and loyalties. The biggest obstacle may be intergovernmental mistrust, as Murray Lumpkin, deputy director of regulatory affairs and lead for global regulatory systems initiatives at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, pointed out in the closing plenary at the 2014 Regulatory Convergence. Many issues with the EU, for example, come down to a lack of confidence in an EU member's counterpart to do its part to achieve a particular end that affects the union. In order to eventually get to that single interface to navigate global regulations, trust, that commodity that is so hard to generate yet so easy to lose, needs to be built up between global regulatory players. This is no easy task.

So, clearly, we're not there yet, as far as this example of simplexity-in-action goes. As is always the case, the old boundaries are resisting there own destruction. Growing pains come with the discomfort of change, after all --but so does growth itself, as Martha Brumfield, president ant CEO of Critical path Institute, who also sat on the closing plenary panel, reminded us. So I have faith we'll get there eventually. In the meantime, there are so many other ways simplexity can be put to use within the regulatory profession. I'll address some examples in my next post. Stay tuned.
