I would like to make a mathematical joke using calculus symbols deriving "ought" from "is"

Creating a mathematical joke that derives "ought" from "is" using calculus symbols can be clever and amusing, especially for those with a background in philosophy and mathematics. The challenge lies in playfully navigating the philosophical discourse that distinguishes "is" statements (descriptions of the world) from "ought" statements (prescriptions of how the world should be), famously highlighted by David Hume. Here's a humorous attempt that intertwines calculus with this philosophical debate:
"Let's prove that we can mathematically derive 'ought' from 'is' using calculus:
Let
f
(
x
)
f(x)
f
(
x
)
represent the state of the world as it 'is'.
Define the derivative of
f
(
x
)
f(x)
f
(
x
)
with respect to
x
x
x
as
f
���
(
x
)
f'(x)
f
���
(
x
)
, which represents the change in the world's state.
Now, here's where it gets philosophical:
Assume
x
x
x
represents our actions or decisions.
Therefore,
f
���
(
x
)
f'(x)
f
���
(
x
)
can be interpreted as the consequence of our actions, or how the world 'ought' to change due to our decisions.
By the power of calculus, we have derived 'ought' from 'is'���a bit of a logical leap, but in mathematics, we call that a 'creative interpretation'!"
Note: This joke takes a playful approach to the philosophical issue and uses mathematical terms loosely for humorous effect. It's a fun way to bridge two seemingly disparate fields!
