Abstract 
Inspired by the foundational works in [7] and [3], we introduce a cate- 
gorical framework to formalize Bayesian inference and learning. The two 
key ideas at play here are the notions of Bayesian inversions and the func- 
tor GL as constructed in [3, ��2.1]. We i nd that Bayesian learning is the 
simplest case of the learning paradigm described in [3]. We then obtain 
categorical formulations of batch and sequential Bayes updates while also 
verifying that the two coincide in a specif i c example.

The paper "A Category Theory Framework for Bayesian Learning" by Kotaro Kamiya and John Welliaveetil introduces a categorical framework to formalize Bayesian inference and learning. It builds upon previous foundational works and introduces the concept of Bayesian inversions and the functor GL. The paper shows that Bayesian learning is a special case of a broader learning paradigm and provides categorical formulations for both batch and sequential Bayes updates. It also addresses the problem in machine learning of estimating a function that relates two variables or random vectors. Overall, the paper aims to offer a more structured and formalized approach to Bayesian learning using the principles of category theory.

1Introduction 
A standard problem in Machine learning is to understand the relationship be- 
tween two variables or random vectors. Suppose x is a random vector and y 
is a random variable dependent on x. The additive model assumes that there 
exists a function f such that y = f(x) + �� 
where �� is a random variable with mean 0. Our goal then reduces to estimating 
the function f. To this end, we consider a parametrized family of functions 
{f��}�����Pwhere P is the parameter space and by means of a learning algorithm 
and a training data set, we traverse P to i nd a candidate that we believe will 
provide a reasonable approximation to the true function f. Several theoreti- 
cal results underpin the validity of this approach- for instance the Universal 
Approximation Theorem. 
A formulation of the above framework within Category theory was achieved 
in the foundational work of Fong, Spivak and Tuyeras [7]. In this paper, the 
authors introduce the category Learn whose objects are sets and a morphism 
from A to B in Learn consists of the following data.A parameter set M, 
an implementation I: M �� A ��� B, an update function u: M �� A �� B ��� M 
and a request function r: M �� A �� B ��� A. In related work, the authors of 
[3], develop a more general theory by introducing the notion of a Cartesian 
Reverse Dif f erential category (cf. [3, ��2.2]). Associated to a CRDC- C, they 
construct the analog of the category Learn as a composite of the Para and 
Lens constructions (cf. [3, ��2.1, 2.3]). In this setting, the learning algorithm 
will be a functor of type Para(C) ��� Para(Lens(C)). Our goal in this paper is 
to employ both these approaches to develop a categorical framework to discuss 
Bayesian learning. 
While the approach outlined above to model the relationship between two 
random variables is ef f ective, in real world situations, it is often the case that 
there is no such function f.Given the noisy nature of the data, it is more 
reasonable to model the conditional probability p(y|x) i.e. to ask the question - ���Given x, what is the probability that we have y ?���. 
As before, we model the conditional probability using a parametrized family 
of distributions- p(y|x;��). However in contrast to our approach from before, 
we assume that �� is a random variable and strive to obtain a distribution over 
�� that agrees with the given training data. More precisely, we choose a prior 
distribution q(��) on �� and update this prior to obtain the posterior distribution 
on ��. As opposed to gradient based approaches to learning, Bayesian machine 
learning updates the prior distribution on �� by exploiting Bayes Theorem. The 
posterior distribution is def i ned upto normalizing constant by the formula 
p(��|y,x) ��� p(y|x,��)q(��|x). 
There is considerable l exibility in this approach in that we can use the posterior 
to obtain point estimates of the parameter �� via the MAP estimate and perform 
inference by integrating over the entire distribution. We continue this discussion 
in greater detail in ��2.1 where we illustrate the essential features of Bayesian 
learning in the classical context using a simple example. 
Our goal in this paper is to introduce a framework within category theory 
that allows us to formalize this set up. We draw on the theory already developed 
2 
in [8], [9] and [2]. While we proceed as in [3] by associating to a parametrized 
function a morphism in a generalized lens category which allows for the back- 
ward transmission of information, an important observation is that the Bayes 
Learning framework simplif i es the situation drastically. This is essentially due 
to the fact that with the correct setup, Bayesian inversion is a well def i ned dag- 
ger functor and the functor Cop��� Cat responsible for def i ning the generalized 
lens breaks down. We interpret this to mean that Bayes Learning is the sim- 
plest form of learning that adheres to the framework discussed in [3]. See also 
Remark 3.10.

The authors then summarize previous work in the field that employed category theory to formalize learning algorithms. Specifically, they mention the foundational work of Fong, Spivak, and Tuyeras and another paper that introduces the notion of a Cartesian Reverse Differential category (CRDC). In this setting, learning algorithms are represented as functors.
The paper's primary goal is to integrate these approaches to create a category theory framework for Bayesian learning. The authors argue that Bayesian learning simplifies the framework in previous research, noting that in the right setup, Bayesian inversion is a well-defined dagger functor.
Overall, the paper aims to provide a theoretical foundation for Bayesian learning, drawing on the principles of category theory to create a structured and formalized framework.

The work of Cho and Jacobs in [2] and Fritz in [8] introduces the notion 
of Markov categories as a suitable framework within which one can discuss 
ideas from Probability theory such as Bayesian inversion, disintegration, join- 
tif i cation, conditionalization... Hence, let C be a Markov category. We use the 
categories FinStoch and Stoch (cf. Example 2.3) as guiding examples for the 
theory we develop. Roughly speaking, the category FinStoch has i nite sets as 
objects and Markov kernels as morphisms between them while the objects of 
Stoch are measurable spaces and morphisms f : X ��� Y imply for every x ��� X, 
a probability distribution p(��|x) on Y . Central to this paper is the notion of 
Bayesian inversion which in the context of FinStoch with reference to a mor- 
phism p: X ��� Y corresponds to calculating the conditional p(X|y) for y ��� Y 
using Bayes theorem to obtain a morphism p���: Y ��� X. Note that the inversion 
which is a map Y ��� X is not necessarily unique and in the case of FinStoch 
does not even always exist. To get around this issue, i rstly we restrict our 
attention to those Markov categories C which always admit Bayesian inversion. 
Secondly, we make use of the symmetric monoidal category ProbStoch(C) which 
was introduced i rst by Cho and Jacobs in [2, ��5] as the category of couplings or 
equivalently the category whose objects coincide with those of the slice category 
I ��� C and morphisms are obtained by quotienting with respect to the relation of 
almost sure equality. Henceforth, we write PS(C) in place of ProbStoch(C) for 
ease of notation. As a consequence of our assumption on C, Bayesian inversion 
is a well def i ned dagger functor on PS(C). A more detailed explanation can be 
found in ��2.2. 
We can interpret the set-up in ��2.1, as a parametrized function in a suitable 
Kleisli category. In general, we assume that the category C is equipped with 
the structure of an M-actegory where M is symmetric monoidal. We would 
like to make use of the ParaMconstruction from [1] which generalizes [7]. For 
reasons explained above, we work with the category PS(C) and in Lemma 3.3, 
we show that PS(C) has the structure of an PS(M)-actegory provided we impose 
certain technical assumptions on M and its action on C. We simplify notation 
henceforth and write PS in place of PS. 
Our def i nition of the functor BayesLearn in Section ��3 is inspired in large 
part by [3]. The key to the construction of a gradient based learner in [3] is a 
functor GL: Para(E) ��� Para(Lens(E)) 
where we require that E is a Cartesian reverse dif f erential category. To fully 
describe the learning mechanism, the authors introduce update and error end- 
ofunctors on Para(E). These three pieces when employed in unison and for 
appropriate choices of the update and displacement maps, can describe a wide 
range of optimization algorithms ([3, ��3.4]). 
3 
When adapting the framework of [3] to describe Bayes learning, we see im- 
mediately that we must work with a more general notion of Lens as in [9]. To 
this end, we proceed as in [9, Def i nition 3.1] by introducing a functor 
Stat: PS(C)op��� Cat 
with which we def i ne the associated Grothendieck lens LensStat. As Bayesian 
inversion is a well def i ned dagger functor, we deduce the existence of a well 
def i ned functor R: PS(C) ��� LensStat. 
It follows that we have a functor 
ParaPS(M)(R): ParaPS(M)(PS(C)) ��� ParaPS(M)(LensStat). 
We refer to the functor ParaPS(M)(R) as the BayesLearn functor.It cap- 
tures the essential features of the Bayes learning algorithm. Indeed, given a 
parametrized morphism X ��� Y with a state on X, after choosing a prior state 
on the parameter object P, we obtain a morphism in PS(C) i.e. a morphism 
f : (M,��M) ��� (X,��X) ��� (Y,��Y). 
By construction, the induced morphism 
BayesLearn(f): ((M ��� X,��M��� ��X),(M ��� X,��M��� ��X)) ��� ((Y,��Y),(Y,��Y)) 
is given by a pair of morphisms 
f : (M ��� X,��M��� ��X) ��� (Y,��Y) 
in the forward direction and 
f���: (Y,��Y) ��� (M ��� X,��M��� ��X)

The text provides a detailed look at the mathematical underpinnings of using category theory to formalize Bayesian learning. It covers several key points:
Markov Categories
: The text refers to the work by Cho and Jacobs, and Fritz, introducing the notion of Markov categories as a foundational framework to discuss Bayesian inversion and other probabilistic operations. In particular, the paper uses examples of FinStoch and Stoch as guiding categories.
Bayesian Inversion
: This is described as a morphism
p

Y
���
X
p^\dagger: Y \rightarrow X
p
���
:

derived using Bayes' theorem. However, this is not always unique or existent, so the paper restricts focus to Markov categories that admit Bayesian inversion.
ProbStoch(C)
: A symmetric monoidal category, introduced by Cho and Jacobs, allows for dealing with almost sure equality and is used to overcome issues with non-unique Bayesian inversion. It's denoted as
P

2Preliminaries 
2.1Bayesian Inference 
Our goal in this section is to give a high level overview of the approach Bayesian 
learning takes in modelling the relationship between random variables of inter- 
est. We use the lecture [11] as a reference to the material in this section. 
Let us illustrate the approach with an example. Let x = (x1,...,xn) be a 
random vector and y be a random variable. We assume that y is related to x 
via the equation y = f(x) + �� 
5 
where �� is normally distributed with mean 0 and variance ��2and f(x) := ��Tx 
where �� ��� Rn.For simplicity, we assume that the quantity �� is a known 
constant. 
Let us suppose we are given a training set T := {(x1,y1),...,(xN,yN)}. 
One can divide the Bayesian approach into two parts. As outlined in the intro- 
duction we treat �� as a random variable and choose a prior distribution which 
encodes our pre-conceived beliefs about ��. Then using the set T, we update the 
distribution on �� to get its posterior distribution by applying Bayes��� rule. The 
posterior distribution can then be used to obtain point estimates of ��. 
Let us assume an improper prior on �� i.e. q(��) = 1. Applying Bayes��� rule 
gives p(��|T) ��� p(T|��)q(��) 
Observe that our assumption on the nature of the underlying data implies that 
p(y|x) is normally distributed with mean ��Tx and variance ��2. Assuming that 
the training data is independent, we get 
p(T|��) ��� Y 
i 
p(yi|��,xi)q(��). 
We assumed above that the distribution on x is known and hence in ef f ect we 
condition every random variable with respect to x. Hence, 
p(T|��) = 
1 
(2��) 
N 
2��N 
exp(��� P 
i(yi��� �� Txi)2 
2��2 
) 
and p(��|T) = 
1 
(2��) 
N 
2��N 
exp(��� P 
i(yi��� �� Txi)2 
2��2 
) 
In this manner, we have updated the prior distribution on �� in accordance 
with the given data. We now sketch how one might perform inference. Let 
x���be a data point that does not necessarily belong to the training set T. We 
would like to i nd p(y���|x���,T). We outline two ways on how to proceed. 
1. Let ��MAP:= argmax��p(��|T) 
This is called the maximum a posteriori estimate of the parameter ��. It 
represents a single best guess for the parameter given the training data. 
We then set p(y���|x���,T) := p(y���|x���,��MAP). 
Observe that in the context of our ongoing example, ��MAPcoincides with 
��OLS- the ordinary least squares estimate. 
2. While the MAP estimate of �� represents a suitable guess for the parameter, 
when performing inference we can do better by leveraging our knowledge 
of the entire posterior distribution. The true Bayesian way is to integrate 
over the posterior distribution �� i.e. 
p(y���|x���,T) := Z 
p(y���|x���,��)p(��|T)d��.

, Bayesian inference is divided into two parts. First, treat

(a parameter in the model) as a random variable and choose a prior distribution for it. Then, update this distribution using Bayes' rule to obtain the posterior distribution after considering the training data.

2. To deal with distributions whose supports are not necessarily i nite, we 
introduce Stoch whose objects are measurable spaces i.e. tuples of the 
form (X,��X) where X is a set and ��Xis a well def i ned ��-algebra on X. 
Recall that the category of measurable spaces is endowed with a natural 
symmetric monoidal structure given by 
(X,��X) ��� (Y,��Y) := (X �� Y,��X��� ��Y) 
where ��X��� ��Ycorresponds to the ��-algebra generated by subsets of the 
form U �� V where U ��� ��Xand V ��� ��Y. 
A morphism (X,��X) ��� (Y,��Y) in Stoch is given by a map 
f : X �� ��Y��� [0,1] 
such that for every S ��� ��X, the map f(S, ): X ��� [0,1] is measurable. 
Furthermore, we ask that for every x, f( ,x): ��Y��� [0,1] is a well de- 
i ned probability measure. One checks that Stoch is a symmetric monoidal 
category whose monoidal structure is inherited from the category of mea- 
surable spaces. The unit object I is the pair ({���},{{���},���}). 
As before, we must def i ne copy and delete morphisms as well as specify 
how to compose morphisms in Stoch.We do not def i ne del as this is 
obvious from the def i nition of I. Given (X,��X) ��� Ob(Stoch), we def i ne 
copyX: (X �� X) �� ��X��X��� [0,1] 
as the map that sends a pair (S,x) to 1 if (x,x) ��� S and 0 otherwise. 
Lastly, given morphisms f : (X,��X) ��� (Y,��Y) and g: (Y,��Y) ��� (Z,��Z), 
we def i ne f;g to be the map X �� ��Z��� [0,1] to be given by 
(S,x) 7��� Z 
g(S,y)f(dy,x) 
where we abuse notation and write f(x) for the measure ��Y��� [0,1] given 
by T 7��� f(T,x). 
Def i nition 2.4. Let ��X���Y: I ��� X ��� Y be a joint state. A disintegration of 
��X���Ywill be a pair consisting of a channel f : X ��� Y and a state ��X: I ��� X 
8 
such that the following string diagrams are equal. 
XY 
��X���Y = 
X 
XX 
Y 
��X f 
(1) 
If every joint state admits a disintegration then we say that the category C 
admits conditional distributions. 
Likewise, given a pair f : X ��� Y and ��: I ��� X, we can easily def i ne a state 
on X �� Y via the following string diagram. 
X 
XX 
Y 
�� f 
We refer to this as the jointif i cation of f and ��. 
We will require a more general version of conditionalization which permits 
us to consider joint distributions parametrized by another object. 
Def i nition 2.5. Let C be a Markov category. We say that C has conditionals 
if for every morphism s: A ��� X ���Y , there is t: X ���A ��� Y such that we have 
the following equality of string diagrams.

s=

In this section, the text introduces the concept of a category named "Stoch" to deal with distributions whose supports might not be infinite.

3Bayes Learn 
In this section we outline the construction of the functor BayesLearn which 
aims to capture the essential features of Bayesian learning. However in order 
for us to discuss these results, we require certain preliminary ideas which allow 
us to better understand the actegory structure on PS(C) where C is a Markov 
category. 
3.1Inducing the M-actegory structure 
While we work with the l exibility provided by ParaM, we must be careful to 
ensure that the categories to which we apply ParaM( ) are endowed with the 
structure of an M-actegory. To this end, we must make certain modif i cations 
to the category M itself as we would i rstly like to ensure that parameter spaces 
have a well def i ned prior associated to them. 
12 
Remark 3.1.It follows directly from the def i nition of an actegory that if 
r: M ��� N in M and f : X ��� Y in C then the following diagram commutes. 
M ��� XM ��� Y 
N ��� XN ��� Y 
M���f 
r���Xr���Y 
N���f 
where the vertical morphisms are due to the natural transformation between 
the functors M ���and N ���induced by the morphism M ��� N. We write 
f ��� g to denote the composition M ��� X ��� M ��� Y ��� N ��� Y or equivalently 
M ��� X ��� N ��� X ��� N ��� Y . 
The following technical condition is required in the proof of Lemma 3.3. 
Def i nition 3.2. Let (M,J,���) and (C,I,���) be Markov categories and let C be 
a symmetric monoidal M-actegory (cf. Def i nition 2.13). We say that C is in 
agreement with M if for every P ��� M and X ��� C, the following diagram is 
commutative and natural in both P and X. 
P ��� X(P ��� P) ��� (X ��� X) 
P ��� X(P ��� X) ��� (P ��� X) 
copyP���copyX ��P,P,X,X 
copyP���X 
where ��P,P,X,Xis the mixed interchanger as introduced in 2.14. 
Recall from 2.1, that a categorical formulation of Bayesian learning must 
capture the notion of state on the parameter as well as a means to update it 
via Bayesian inversion. It is hence natural under these circumstances to utilize 
PS(M) as the category of parameters. A brief discussion of the PS construction 
was made in 2.2.1. 
Lemma 3.3. Let (M,J,���) be a causal Markov category and (C,I,���) be a 
Markov category that is in agreement with M. The category PS(C) is a PS(M)- 
actegory. 
Proof. Let (P,��P) ��� Ob(PS(C)). We def i ne an endofunctor 
(P,��P) ��� : PS(C) ��� PS(C) 
as follows. Firstly, let (X,��X) be an object in PS(C). We set (P,��P)���(X,��X) 
to be the pair I 
��� 
��� ��� J ��� I 
��P�����X 
��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� P ��� X 
where the i rst isomorphism is due to the M-actegory structure on C. Observe 
that the composition above coincides with 
I 
��� 
��� ��� J ��� I 
��P���id 
��� ��� ��� ��� ��� P ��� I 
id�����X 
��� ��� ��� ��� ��� P ��� X.(3)

PS(C)
PS
(

where

Inducing the M-actegory Structure
: To ensure that the categories used in the ParaM construction have the structure of an M-actegory, modifications are made to the category
M
M
M
. This modification is made to ensure well-defined priors for parameter spaces. The text refers to a commutative diagram that illustrates the relationship between certain morphisms in

M

PS
(

(as discussed in a previous section) is used. This choice naturally aligns with the requirements of Bayesian learning.

conditionalizing, we get a map XT�� YT��� P in BorelStoch which def i nes the 
posterior. 
In this case, the Bayes predictive density as described in ��3.3 is given by 
p(y���|x���,T) = Z P 
p(y���|P,x���,T)p(P|x���,T). 
This is a consequence of how compositions are def i ned in Stoch i.e. via the 
Chapman-Kolmogorov equation cf. ��2.3. 
4Bayes updates 
While Section 3.3 describes the Bayes Learning algorithm, we observe that it 
does not provide a mechanism by which we can update the prior on the pa- 
rameter space. Recall, via Bayesian inversion we obtain a channel (XT,��XT)��� 
(YT,��YT) ��� (M,��M). However, in practice, when working in a suitable sub- 
category of Stoch or in FinSet, we are given a training set 
T := {(x1,y1),...,(xn,yn)} 
which we use to obtain the posterior distribution on M. Our goal in this section 
is to translate this into the categorical framework we have developed so far. 
In the case of Stoch, we can represent a data point (x,y) ��� XT�� YTas 
the product of a pair of morphisms I ��� XTand I ��� YTmapping ��� to the 
probability measures that concentrate at the points x and y respectively. We 
use ��x,��yrespectively to denote these maps. Given a channel c: X ��Y ��� M in 
Stoch, we def i ne a state on M via the composition 
I ��� I �� I 
��x1����y1 
��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� X �� Y 
c 
��� M. 
This ef f ectively def i nes the posterior on M given the training set T1where T1:= 
{(x1,y1)}. The natural question to ask in this setting is how to sequentially 
update the posterior to achieve the required update over the entire training 
dataset and if one can also achieve such an update all at once. We outline a 
possible solution in what follows. 
For the remainder of this section we work with a Markov category (C,I,���) 
such that C = Kl(P) where P: D ��� D is a symmetric monoidal monad on 
the symmetric monoidal category (D,ID,���). Furthermore, we suppose that C 
admits conditionals. As before, let (M,J,���) be a symmetric monoidal category 
such that C is a symmetric monoidal M-actegory. 
We are given a model i.e. a morphism f : M ��� X ��� Y in C where we think 
of M ��� Ob(M) as the parameter space and f models a true morphism X ��� Y . 
We suppose as before that we are provided with a state ��X: I ��� X and a prior 
��M,0: J ��� M. Lastly, we abuse notation and write M in place of M ��� I when 
necessary. Note a prior ��M: J ��� M implies a prior ��M��� id: J ��� I ��� M ��� I 
which we also refer to as ��M. 
4.1Sequential updates 
Recall from Def i nition 2.4 that the state ��Xand the channel f give us a mor- 
phism fjoint: M ��� I ��� X ��� Y(5) 
21 
in C. Since C admits conditionals, it also admits Bayesian inversions. Hence, 
we get a morphism f��� 
joint: Z ��� M ��� I 
with respect to the prior state ��M,0on M where Z := X ��� Y . 
Note that f��� 
joint is not unique. In the previous section, we got around this 
issue by working in the category PS(C). However, if we want to update the 
state on M sequentially then this corresponds to sequentially updating objects

In this part of the text, it discusses how to perform updates in Bayesian learning using the categorical framework. It highlights sequential updates and batch updates, based on the data and parameters involved. Here are the main points:

The main focus here is on understanding how to perform updates to the prior distribution of parameters in a Bayesian learning scenario using the categorical framework. The methods discussed involve concepts such as Bayesian inversion, morphisms, and the relationships between different categorical constructs.

4.2Batch updates 
To obtain an update of the prior all at once, we work with an object built from 
X ��� Y but whose points correspond to datasets of a specif i ed cardinality. 
Let n ��� N and we set Zn:= ���n(X ��� Y ). 
The model f induces a morphism 
fn 
joint: M ��� Zn 
def i ned as the composition 
M 
���ncopyM 
��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ���nM 
���nfjoint 
��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� Zn. 
As before, let T := [x1��� y1,...,xn��� yn] be a list of n elementary points of 
X ��� Y . The list T def i nes an elementary point of Zn. Indeed, we set zTto be 
the composition ID 
���ncopyID 
��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ���nID 
z1���...���zn 
��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� Zn 
where as before zi= xi���yi. We suppose T is such that the Bayesian inversion 
of fn 
joint is uniquely def i ned at zT. The batch update of the prior ��M,0with 
respect to T is given by the composition 
I 
��zT 
��� ��� ��� Z 
(fn 
joint) 
��� 
��� ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� M 
where (fn 
joint)��� is a Bayesian inversion of fn 
joint with respect to the prior ��M,0. 
Let ��M,T: I ��� M denote this updated prior. 
We can ask the following question. Under what conditions, can we ensure 
that ��M,n= ��M,Twhere ��M,nis as def i ned at the end of ��4.1 for T. 
Example 4.5. Let us continue our discussion as in Example 4.4 using the 
category FinStoch. As in 4.4, we are given a model f : M ��X ��� Y where M,X 
and Y are i nite sets and f is a morphism in FinStoch, a training set 
T := {(x1,y1),(x2,y2)} 
and a prior state ��M,0on M. Let zi:= (xi,yi) and zT:= (z1,z2). We import 
notation from 4.4. 
It follows that Z2= (X �� Y )2 
and f2 
joint: M ��� Z2. 
Hence, we get that (f2 
joint) ���: Z2 ��� M. 
For m ��� M and w ��� Z2, 
(f2 
joint) ���(w)(m) ��� f2 
joint(m)(w)��M,0(m). 
We set ��M,T(m) := (f2 
joint) ���((z1,z2))(m) 
for m ��� M and hence 
��M,T(m) ��� fjoint(m)(z2)fjoint(m)(z1)��M,0(m) 
since by def i nition, f2 
joint(m)((a,b)) = fjoint(m)(a)fjoint(m)(b). 
24 
Remark 4.6. Observe from examples 4.4 and 4.5 that the sequential Bayes 
update and batch update coincide. This begs the following question. What 
conditions can we impose to relate the sequential and batch updates in the 
general setting of the category C used throughout this section.

Conditions for Coincidence
: The text raises the question of under what conditions the sequential Bayes update (discussed earlier) and the batch update coincide. The example provided (Example 4.5) demonstrates that in some cases, sequential and batch updates can yield the same result. The text prompts further exploration into the conditions that establish a relationship between these updates in the broader categorical framework.
Overall, this section delves into the concepts of batch updates, the construction of objects to represent datasets, and the relationship between sequential and batch updates in the context of Bayesian learning within the categorical framework.

A simpler explanation of fitting Bayesian theory into category theory
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Sure! Let's break down the idea of fitting Bayesian theory into category theory in simpler terms:
Bayesian Theory
: In Bayesian theory, we're interested in understanding the relationship between random variables. We often want to estimate the probability of one variable given another. For instance, given certain data, we want to find the likelihood of an event happening.
Category Theory
: Category theory is a way of organizing and studying different mathematical structures and their relationships. It provides a high-level framework to understand how different objects (like sets or spaces) relate to each other through morphisms (functions or mappings).
Fitting Bayesian Theory into Category Theory
: Imagine you have a system where you're trying to learn about the relationship between different variables. Instead of just using traditional probability calculations, you're using the principles of category theory to organize your understanding.
In this approach, you use category theory to represent things like random variables, their relationships, and the way you update your understanding with new data. You map the concepts from Bayesian theory into the structures provided by category theory.
For example, you can think of the different types of variables as objects in a category, and the relationships between them as morphisms. The process of updating your beliefs with new data can be represented using category theory concepts.
Overall, fitting Bayesian theory into category theory is about leveraging the organizational power of category theory to represent and reason about the probabilistic relationships between variables in a more structured and systematic way.

This dissertation is an investigation into the intersections between dif f erential geometry and 
Bayesian analysis. The former is the mathematical discipline that underlies our understand- 
ing of the spatial structure of the universe; the latter is the unif i ed framework for statistical 
inference built upon the language of probability and the elegant Bayes��� theorem. Here, the 
two disciplines are combined with the hope that a synergy might emerge and facilitate the 
useful application of Bayesian inference to real-world science. In particular, dynamic and 
high-dimensional neural data provides a challenging litmus test for the methods developed 
herein. 
A major component of this work is the development and application of probabilistic models 
def i ned over smooth manifolds: dependencies between time series are modeled using the 
manifold of Hermitian positive def i nite matrices; probability density functions are modeled 
using the inf i nite sphere; and high-dimensional data are modeled using the Stiefel manifold 
of orthonormal matrices. Whereas formulating a manifold-based model is not dif i cult���in a 
certain sense, the geometry occurs a priori in each of the cases considered���the non-trivial 
geometry presents computational challenges for model-based inference. Hence, this thesis 
contributes two new algorithms for Bayesian inference on Riemannian manifolds. The i rst is 
an algorithm for inference over general Riemannian manifolds and is applied to inference on 
xiv 
Hermitian positive def i nite matrices. The second is an algorithm for inference over manifolds 
that are embedded in Euclidean space and is applied to inference on the sphere and Stiefel 
manifolds. 
This dissertation is ordered as follows. In Chapter 1, the general setting is introduced along 
with the rudiments of Riemannian geometry. In Chapter 2, the geodesic Lagrangian Monte 
Carlo algorithm is presented and used for Bayesian inference over the space of Hermitian 
positive def i nite matrices to learn the spectral densities of multivariate time series arising 
from local i eld potentials in a rodent brain. In Chapter 4, an alternative, conceptually 
simpler version of the geodesic Monte Carlo is developed, but the new algorithm requires 
dif f erentiating the pseudo determinant, the derivative of which is derived in Chapter 3. 
In Chapter 5, the geometry of the inf i nite-dimensional sphere is leveraged for Bayesian 
nonparametric density estimation. In Chapter 6, high-dimensional spike trains and local 
i eld potentials in a rodent brain are used to predict environmental stimuli. This Bayesian 
���neural decoding��� is facilitated by both geometric and non-geometric models. Chapter 7 
charts the frontiers of Bayesian inference on inf i nite manifolds.

This dissertation explores the fascinating connections between differential geometry and Bayesian analysis. Differential geometry provides insights into the spatial structure of the universe, while Bayesian analysis is a powerful framework for statistical inference using probability and Bayes' theorem. The aim here is to combine these disciplines to enable practical applications of Bayesian inference in real-world science, with a specific focus on dynamic and high-dimensional neural data.
A significant part of this work involves developing and applying probabilistic models defined over smooth manifolds. These models capture dependencies in time series using the manifold of Hermitian positive definite matrices, represent probability density functions using the infinite sphere, and handle high-dimensional data using the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal matrices. While formulating manifold-based models is conceptually feasible, the complex geometry poses computational challenges for model-based inference.
To address these challenges, this thesis introduces two new algorithms for Bayesian inference on Riemannian manifolds. The first algorithm is designed for inference on general Riemannian manifolds, particularly applied to Hermitian positive definite matrices. The second algorithm focuses on inference over manifolds embedded in Euclidean space and is used for inference on the sphere and Stiefel manifolds.
The structure of the dissertation is as follows:
Chapter 1 introduces the general context and fundamental concepts of Riemannian geometry.
Chapter 2 presents the geodesic Lagrangian Monte Carlo algorithm and applies it to Bayesian inference on the space of Hermitian positive definite matrices. This application involves learning spectral densities of time series data from rodent brain local field potentials.
Chapter 4 introduces an alternative version of the geodesic Monte Carlo algorithm that is conceptually simpler but requires differentiation of the pseudo determinant. The derivative of the pseudo determinant is derived in Chapter 3.
Chapter 5 leverages the geometry of the infinite-dimensional sphere for Bayesian nonparametric density estimation.
Chapter 6 uses high-dimensional spike trains and local field potentials from rodent brains to predict environmental stimuli. This Bayesian "neural decoding" involves both geometric and non-geometric models.
Chapter 7 looks ahead to the potential frontiers of Bayesian inference on infinite manifolds.
The dissertation ultimately strives to merge differential geometry and Bayesian analysis to create powerful tools for analyzing complex data sets, especially in the realm of neural decoding and high-dimensional data analysis.

Introduction 
1.1Geometry in statistics 
It has somehow become the case that humans are capable of spatial reasoning. Our spa- 
tial faculties aid us as we explore and manipulate our environment. These faculties help 
us organize and dichotomize the phenomena we encounter and, somehow, deduce complex 
relationships between these objects. Human induction, however it is accomplished, aids us as 
we project power over nature and ourselves. Given this very primal usefulness, it is not sur- 
prising that geometry���the mathematical formalization of our spatial intuition���has played 
an important role in the development of statistics, the mathematical science of inference, 
whatever that may be. 
Statisticians often assume that the observed data lie in a certain space. A classic example 
is the use of Euclidean geometry in linear regression [151]. Here, the association between 
an outcome variable and explanatory variables is modelled by some line-of-best-f i t. When 
this line is found by minimizing the squared-error between the observed outcomes and i tted 
1 
values, the solution is equivalent to projecting the vector of outcomes onto the linear subspace 
spanned by the covariate vectors. 
Indeed, although data may be high-dimensional and complex in nature, it is often reason- 
able to assume that data points concentrate on some low-dimensional space: Euclidean 
geometry is also used in linear dimensionality reduction (e.g., factor analysis, principal com- 
ponent analysis [140, 103], canonical correlation analysis [98], etc.). Here, the observed, 
high-dimensional data is assumed to have low-dimensional structure that is projected onto 
higher dimensions by some linear transformation. More on linear dimensionality reduction 
and its Bayesian realizations may be found in Chapter 6. 
But there is no reason a priori to assume that the data belongs to a linear subspace of the 
observed support. Manifold learning [56, 172, 14] is a large and active body of research 
based on what is called the ���manifold hypothesis��� [133, 58], the idea that high-dimensional 
data concentrates on low-dimensional, smooth subspaces of the data space called manifolds. 
Spheres and tori are manifolds, but so are amoebae and gently rolled-up pieces of paper. 
Thus, manifold learning requires less stringent assumptions than linear dimensionality re- 
duction and is therefore more challenging. Spectral methods based on the weighted graph 
Laplacian are prime examples of this approach [13]. Although the methodology presented 
in this dissertation leverages manifold (i.e., non-Euclidean) structure, it does not belong to 
the broader class of manifold learning for reasons made explicit in the following paragraphs. 
One may distinguish between the data space and the model space.The previous para- 
graphs feature methods (linear dimensionality reduction, manifold learning) that make as- 
sumptions about the geometry of the data space (although the example of linear regression 
should suggest how this dichotomy might fall apart). On the other hand, likelihood based 
methodologies���be they frequentist or Bayesian���provide geometry further inroads to statis- 
tics. The Fisher information [60, 126] is the expected value of the negative log-likelihood 
Hessian with respect to the data generating distribution specif i ed by the likelihood itself.

Introduction:
1.1 Geometry in Statistics
Human beings possess a natural ability for spatial reasoning, allowing us to navigate and comprehend our surroundings. This innate skill assists us in organizing and understanding the world, enabling us to deduce intricate relationships among objects. This capacity for spatial reasoning plays a pivotal role in induction, empowering us to exert control over nature and our environment. Given its primal significance, it's unsurprising that geometry, which formalizes our spatial intuition mathematically, has found a significant place in statistics���a mathematical discipline concerned with inference.
In statistical analysis, researchers often assume that the data they observe resides within a specific space. A classic instance is the utilization of Euclidean geometry in linear regression. This involves modeling the relationship between an outcome variable and explanatory variables as a line of best fit. Minimizing the squared error between observed outcomes and the fitted values is equivalent to projecting the outcome vector onto the linear subspace spanned by the covariate vectors.
While data may often be complex and high-dimensional, it's reasonable to assume that data points tend to concentrate within a lower-dimensional space. This assumption underpins linear dimensionality reduction methods like factor analysis, principal component analysis, and canonical correlation analysis. These techniques project the observed high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space using linear transformations. More on this topic, along with its Bayesian interpretations, is explored in Chapter 6.
However, there's no inherent reason to assume a priori that data belongs exclusively to a linear subspace of the observed support. This insight has led to manifold learning, a vibrant field of research based on the "manifold hypothesis." This hypothesis posits that high-dimensional data tends to concentrate within smooth, lower-dimensional subspaces called manifolds. Manifolds can range from spheres and tori to more intricate shapes like amoebae or gently crumpled paper. Manifold learning, unlike linear dimensionality reduction, necessitates less restrictive assumptions, making it more intricate. Spectral methods involving weighted graph Laplacians exemplify this approach. Although the methodology presented in this dissertation leverages non-Euclidean manifold structures, it diverges from broader manifold learning due to specific reasons that will become evident in the subsequent discussion.
Differentiating between the data space and the model space is essential. The preceding paragraphs introduced methods that focus on assumptions about the geometry of the data space (although linear regression demonstrates how this distinction can blur). In contrast, likelihood-based methodologies���whether frequentist or Bayesian���extend the role of geometry in statistics. The Fisher information is a prime example, representing the expected value of the Hessian matrix of the negative log-likelihood with respect to the data-generating distribution specified by the likelihood function itself.

The resulting positive def i nite matrix has uses in many areas of statistics, but it may also 
be thought of as an inner product that induces a non-Euclidean geometry on the param- 
eter space and thus the model space. That is, although the parameter space may be the 
Euclidean upper-half plane (as is the case for the univariate Gaussian distribution), the ge- 
ometry induced by the Fisher information matrix is no longer Euclidean. In fact, for the 
Gaussian distribution, the Fisher geometry is equivalent to the hyperbolic half plane model. 
The study of the Fisher geometry is called information geometry [4] and has been studied 
extensively. Chapter 5 of this dissertation discusses the Fisher geometry in depth and relates 
this geometry to the problem of nonparametric density estimation. 
But this dissertation takes a dif f erent approach to model geometry. Whereas information 
geometry begins with Euclidean models and renders them non-Euclidean, I consider models 
for which the parameter space is a priori a non-Euclidean manifold. Covariance matrix mod- 
eling is performed over the manifold of positive def i nite matrices, nonparametric probability 
density functions are naturally identif i ed with points on the inf i nite sphere, and linear sub- 
spaces (over which data vary) are modeled on the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal matrices. 
I argue that, in each of these cases, the natural model geometry provides fresh perspective 
on the modeling task. 
The geometric approach brings computational challenges, so two new algorithms are de- 
veloped in this dissertation. The i rst, geodesic Lagrangian Monte Carlo (Chapter 2), is 
a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm for computing posterior distributions def i ned on in- 
trinsically def i ned Riemannian manifolds (see below). In Chapter 4, a new derivation for 
geodesic Monte Carlo on embedded manifolds is presented. This new algorithm extends 
its predecessor and is conceptually simpler. Embedding geodesic Monte Carlo is applied to 
density estimation (Chapter 5) and dimensionality reduction (Chapter 6). 
The chief contents of this dissertation are as follows. In Chapter 2, Bayesian inference is 
performed over the Riemannian manifold of positive def i nite matrices using geodesic La- 
3 
grangian Monte Carlo. The methodology is used for Bayesian spectral density estimation 
and is applied to the analysis of neural time series. In Chapter 3, the derivative of the pseudo 
determinant is derived and used to solve the maximum likelihood problem for the degen- 
erate normal distribution. This derivative is also used in Chapter 4. In this chapter, the 
embedding geodesic Monte Carlo algorithm of [25] is re-derived and extended. In Chapter 5, 
a model is proposed for Bayesian density estimation using the inf i nite-dimensional sphere as 
model space. Finally, in Chapter 6, Bayesian models for linear dimensionality reduction are 
developed for which the model space is the Stiefel manifold, i.e. the space of orthonormal 
matrices of a given dimension. These models are used to decode local i eld potentials and 
high-dimensional neural spike train data generated in a rat hippocampus. 
The proposed model geometric approach intersects with the data geometric and information 
geometric approaches discussed above.In Chapter 6, the orthonormal matrices selected 
by Bayesian inference actually correspond to low-dimensional linear subspaces of the data 
space. This chapter thus serves to undercut the data space, model space dichotomy. Both 
Chapters 2 and 5 touch on the Fisher geometry: the Riemannian structure over the manifold 
of positive def i nite matrices used in Chapter 2 is equivalent to the geometry induced by the 
Fisher metric on the same manifold; in Chapter 5, the geometry of the inf i nite dimensional

The resulting positive definite matrix finds application across various statistical domains. However, it also serves as an inner product, giving rise to a non-Euclidean geometry within the parameter and model spaces. While the parameter space could initially be a Euclidean upper-half plane (as in the case of the univariate Gaussian distribution), the Fisher information matrix induces a non-Euclidean geometry. Intriguingly, for the Gaussian distribution, this Fisher geometry aligns with the hyperbolic half-plane model. The study of this geometry is known as information geometry and is explored extensively.
Chapter 5 of this dissertation delves deeply into the Fisher geometry and its connection to the challenge of nonparametric density estimation. However, this dissertation takes a distinct approach to model geometry. Rather than starting with Euclidean models and transitioning them into non-Euclidean ones as in information geometry, I focus on models where the parameter space inherently exists as a non-Euclidean manifold. For instance, modeling covariance matrices occurs within the positive definite matrix manifold, while nonparametric probability density functions naturally map onto points on the infinite sphere. Furthermore, linear subspaces���where data exhibit variation���are modeled using the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal matrices. This approach, I argue, offers a unique perspective on the modeling task in each case.
The geometric approach introduces computational complexities, leading to the development of two novel algorithms within this dissertation. The first algorithm, geodesic Lagrangian Monte Carlo (Chapter 2), applies Hamiltonian Monte Carlo techniques to compute posterior distributions defined on intrinsically defined Riemannian manifolds. Chapter 4 presents a new derivation of geodesic Monte Carlo on embedded manifolds, expanding on its predecessor and simplifying its conceptual underpinnings. This embedding geodesic Monte Carlo is employed in density estimation (Chapter 5) and dimensionality reduction (Chapter 6).
The central contents of this dissertation are as follows: In Chapter 2, Bayesian inference is conducted on the Riemannian manifold of positive definite matrices through geodesic Lagrangian Monte Carlo. This methodology is employed for Bayesian spectral density estimation and applied to the analysis of neural time series. Chapter 3 derives the derivative of the pseudo-determinant, utilized in solving the maximum likelihood problem for the degenerate normal distribution (also relevant in Chapter 4). In Chapter 5, a model is proposed for Bayesian density estimation, leveraging the infinite-dimensional sphere as the model space. Finally, Chapter 6 introduces Bayesian models for linear dimensionality reduction, with the Stiefel manifold���the space of orthonormal matrices���serving as the model space. These models are employed in decoding local field potentials and high-dimensional neural spike train data in a rat hippocampus.
This novel model geometric approach intersects with the data geometric and information geometric approaches discussed earlier. In Chapter 6, the orthonormal matrices selected through Bayesian inference correspond to low-dimensional linear subspaces within the data space, breaking down the data space versus model space dichotomy. Both Chapters 2 and 5 touch on the Fisher geometry: the Riemannian structure over the positive definite matrix manifold (Chapter 2) aligns with the Fisher metric's geometry on the same manifold, and in Chapter 5, the infinite-dimensional sphere's geometry interacts with Fisher geometry.

Next, a very brief introduction to Riemannian geometry is given with the hopes that it might 
prove useful in the following chapters.

This section contains a cursory introduction to smooth manifolds and Riemannian geom-

introduction to Riemannian manifolds, see [115]. For advanced treatments of Riemannian 
geometry, see [84] and [45]. 
1.2.1Smooth manifolds 
A d-dimensional manifold Q is a collection of points satisfying, among other things, that for 
each point q ��� Q, there exists an open set U ��� Q and a smooth, invertible map �� : U ��� O ��� 
Rd, the inverse of which is also smooth. Taking directional derivatives of �����1with respect 
to the vectors 
��� 
���xi, i = 1,...,d in R d, one may construct a tangent space to Q at q, denoted 
TqQ, as the linear span of vectors 
��������1 
���xi . In the same way that a tangent line to a curve is a 
copy of R joined to the curve at a single point, the space TqQ is a copy of Rdjoining Q at 
point q. A point v ��� TqQ is called a tangent vector. Figure 1.1 illustrates the general setup. 
Example 1.1. Rdis a d-dimensional manifold. At any point x ��� Rd, 
the tangent space 
TxRd ��� 
= Rd, i.e., the tangent space is just another copy of Euclidean space. 
Example 1.2. Chapter 2 features the d2-dimensional manifold of d �� d Hermitian positive 
def i nite matrices S+ 
d (C). This manifold is a subspace of the vector space Sd(C) of Hermitian 
matrices.Any matrix V ��� Sd(C) satisf i es V 
H = V , where (��)Hdenotes 
the conjugate 
transpose. As a result, the eigenvalues of any Hermitian matrix are real-valued. S+ 
d (C) 
is the set of Hermitian matrices with positive eigenvalues. The tangent space T��S+ 
d (C) to 
the space of Hermitian positive def i nite matrices at any point �� ��� S+

The sphere's equivalence to a nonparametric Fisher geometry is briefly established. Moving forward, a concise introduction to Riemannian geometry is presented in order to provide a foundation for the subsequent chapters.
1.2 Riemannian Geometry
This section offers a brief overview of smooth manifolds and Riemannian geometry. For more comprehensive introductions, refer to [114], [159] for smooth manifolds, and [115] for a focused introduction to Riemannian manifolds. Advanced treatments are available in [84] and [45].
1.2.1 Smooth Manifolds
A d-dimensional manifold, denoted as Q, consists of points adhering to certain properties. For each point q ��� Q, there exists an open set U ��� Q, along with a smooth, invertible map �� : U ��� O ��� Rd, whose inverse is also smooth. By taking directional derivatives of ������� with respect to vectors ���/���xi, i = 1,...,d in Rd, a tangent space to Q at q is constructed. This tangent space, denoted as TqQ, is formed by the linear span of vectors ����������/���xi. Similar to a tangent line to a curve, TqQ represents a copy of Rd joined to Q at point q. A point v ��� TqQ is referred to as a tangent vector. This setup is illustrated in Figure 1.1.
Example 1.1:
Rd is a d-dimensional manifold. At any point x ��� Rd, the tangent space TxRd ��� Rd, indicating that the tangent space is another Rd.
Example 1.2:
Chapter 2 examines the d��-dimensional manifold of d �� d Hermitian positive definite matrices, denoted as S+d(C). This manifold is a subset of the vector space Sd(C) of Hermitian matrices. A matrix V ��� Sd(C) satisfies V��� = V, where (��)��� signifies the conjugate transpose. This ensures that the eigenvalues of any Hermitian matrix are real. S+d(C) comprises Hermitian matrices with positive eigenvalues. The tangent space T��S+d(C) to the space of Hermitian positive definite matrices at any point �� ��� S+d(C) is the space of Hermitian matrices Sd(C).

2.1Introduction 
In this chapter1, we introduce geodesic Lagrangian Monte Carlo (gLMC), a methodology 
for Bayesian inference on a broad class of Riemannian manifolds. We illustrate this general 
methodology using the space of positive def i nite (PD) matrices as a concrete example. The 
resulting algorithms allow for direct inference on the space of PD matrices and are thus the 
i rst of their kind. As a result, gLMC facilitates better prior elicitation of covariance matrices 
by negating the need for conjugate priors and avoiding dif i cult-to-interpret transformations 
on variables of interest. 
In statistics, positive def i nite matrices primarily appear as covariance matrices parameteriz- 
ing the multivariate Gaussian model. This model is the workhorse of modern statistics and 
machine learning: linear regression, probabilistic principal components analysis, Gaussian 
Markov random i elds, spectral density estimation, and Gaussian process models all rely on 
the multivariate Gaussian distribution. The d-dimensional Gaussian distribution is com- 
pletely specif i ed by a mean vector �� and a covariance matrix �� in S+ 
d , the space of d-by-d 
PD matrices. By imposing dif f erent structures on the covariance matrix, one can create 
dif f erent models. In some cases, it is possible to parameterize the covariance matrices in 
terms of a small number of parameters. However, learning of the unstructured covariance 
matrices, usually involved in inference on a large number of parameters, has remained as an 
issue. The conjugate Gaussian inverse-Wishart model has known def i ciencies [168]. Outside 
of non-linear parameterizations of the Cholesky decomposition or matrix logarithm, there

has not yet been a way to perform Bayesian inference directly on the space of PD matrices 
with l exible prior specif i cations using unstructured covariance matrices. 
In this most general context the dif i culty is in sampling from a posterior distribution on an 
abstract, high-dimensional manifold with boundary. It has not been clear how to propose 
moves from point to point within (and without leaving) this space.Our method takes 
advantage of the intrinsic, Riemannian geometry on the space of PD matrices. This space 
is incomplete under the Euclidean metric: following a straight trajectory will often result in 
matrices that are no longer positive def i nite. The space is, however, geodesically complete 
under the canonical metric: no matter how far the sampler travels along any geodesic, 
it never leaves the space of PD matrices. Intuitively, we redef i ne ���straight line��� in a way 
that precludes leaving the set of interest. Moreover, the metric-induced geodesics provide a 
natural way to traverse the space of PD matrices, and these geodesics i t nicely with recent 
advances in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on manifolds [66, 25, 112]. 
To this end, we use geodesic Lagrangian Monte Carlo (gLMC), which belongs to a growing 
class of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) provides 
an intelligent, partially deterministic method for moving around the parameter space while 
leaving the target distribution invariant. New Markov states are generated by numerically integrating a Hamiltonian system while Metropolis-Hastings steps account for the numerical 
error [137]. Riemannian manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RMHMC) adapts the proposal 
path by incorporating second-order information in the form of a Riemannian metric tensor 
[66]. Lagrangian Monte Carlo (LMC) builds on RMHMC by using a random velocity in 
place of RMHMC���s random momentum.LMC���s explicit integrator is no longer volume 
preserving; it therefore requires Jacobian corrections for each accept-reject step [111]. The 
embedding geodesic Monte Carlo (egMC) [25] is able to take the geometry of the parameter 
space into account while avoiding implicit integration by splitting the Hamiltonian [153] 
into a Euclidean and a geodesic component. Unfortunately, egMC is not applicable when a 
18 
manifold���s Riemannian embedding is unknown. gLMC, on the other hand, ef i ciently uses 
the same split Hamiltonian formulation as egMC but does not require an explicit Riemannian 
embedding [See 112, for example]. This last fact makes gLMC an ideal candidate for Bayesian 
inference on the space of PD matrices. 
gLMC allows us to treat the entire covariance matrix as one would treat any other model 
parameters. We are no longer restricted to use a conjugate prior distribution or to specify a 
low-rank structure. We illustrate applications of gLMC for PD matrices using both simulated 
and real-world data. First, we show that gLMC provides the same empirical results as the 
closed-form solution for the conjugate Gaussian inverse-Wishart model. After this, we focus 
on applying gLMC for Hermitian PD matrices to multivariate spectral density estimation 
and compare the results obtained from two dif f erent prior specif i cations: the inverse-Wishart 
prior and the complex reference prior. Then, we obtain credible intervals for the squared 
coherences (see Section 2.2) of simulated vector auto-regressive time series for which the 
spectral density matrix is known. Finally, we apply gLMC to learn the spectral density 
matrix associated with multivariate local i eld potentials (LFPs).

2.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we introduce geodesic Lagrangian Monte Carlo (gLMC), a methodology for Bayesian inference on a wide range of Riemannian manifolds. We employ the space of positive definite (PD) matrices as a concrete example to illustrate this approach. The resulting algorithms enable direct inference on the PD matrix space, marking a pioneering effort in this direction. gLMC facilitates more informative prior specification for covariance matrices, eliminating the need for conjugate priors and complex transformations on variables.
Positive definite matrices are frequently encountered in statistics as covariance matrices that parameterize the multivariate Gaussian model. This model forms the basis of modern statistics and machine learning, impacting various areas such as linear regression, probabilistic principal component analysis, Gaussian Markov random fields, spectral density estimation, and Gaussian process models. The d-dimensional Gaussian distribution is entirely defined by a mean vector �� and a covariance matrix �� within S+d, the space of d-by-d positive definite matrices. By introducing various structures to the covariance matrix, diverse models can be constructed. While some cases permit parameterizing covariance matrices using a few parameters, the learning of unstructured covariance matrices, crucial for inference with a large number of parameters, remains challenging. Conventional approaches like the conjugate Gaussian inverse-Wishart model have limitations. Other techniques involve non-linear parameterizations, but a means to perform direct Bayesian inference on the space of positive definite matrices using flexible prior specifications remains absent.
The central difficulty lies in sampling from a posterior distribution on a high-dimensional manifold with a boundary. To address this, our method capitalizes on the intrinsic Riemannian geometry of the PD matrix space. This space is incomplete under the Euclidean metric, where moving along a straight path may lead to non-positive definite matrices. However, the space is geodesically complete under the canonical metric. Regardless of how far the sampler traverses along any geodesic, it never departs from the PD matrix space. This redefined notion of a "straight line" ensures that sampling remains within the desired set. The metric-defined geodesics offer a natural way to navigate the PD matrix space, aligning well with recent advancements in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on manifolds.
Geodesic Lagrangian Monte Carlo (gLMC) is employed for Bayesian inference, belonging to the class of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms. This methodology integrates numerical integration of a Hamiltonian system with Metropolis-Hastings steps to maintain the invariance of the target distribution. It builds on Riemannian manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RMHMC), which utilizes second-order information through a Riemannian metric tensor. Lagrangian Monte Carlo (LMC) extends RMHMC by incorporating random velocity instead of random momentum, but requires Jacobian corrections. Embedding geodesic Monte Carlo (egMC) considers parameter space geometry but is inapplicable when the Riemannian embedding of a manifold is unknown. gLMC, however, uses the split Hamiltonian formulation without necessitating an explicit Riemannian embedding, making it ideal for Bayesian inference on the space of PD matrices.
gLMC enables the treatment of covariance matrices akin to other model parameters, eliminating the need for conjugate priors or low-rank structures. Its applications for PD matrices are demonstrated using simulated and real-world data. First, gLMC's empirical outcomes align with the closed-form solution of the conjugate Gaussian inverse-Wishart model. Then, the application of gLMC to Hermitian PD matrices for multivariate spectral density estimation is highlighted. We compare results from different prior specifications, including the inverse-Wishart prior and complex reference prior. Credible intervals for squared coherences are obtained for simulated vector auto-regressive time series with known spectral density matrices. Lastly, gLMC is used to learn spectral density matrices associated with multivariate local field potentials (LFPs).

The contributions of this chapter are as follows: 
��� gLMC, an MCMC methodology for Bayesian inference on general Riemannian mani- 
folds, is proposed; 
��� to illustrate the general methodology, we provide a detailed description of gLMC on 
the spaces of symmetric and Hermitian PD matrices; 
��� for classical statisticians, the chapter serves as a brief introduction to spectral density 
estimation and its Bayesian approach; 
��� the proposed algorithms are applied to Bayesian inference on (real and complex) covari- 
ance matrices based on simulated and real-world data and using a number of dif f erent 
prior specif i cations. 19 
It should be noted that the proposed method is useful for generating samples from the 
posterior distribution of interest and not just a point estimate. The proposed method is 
for full inference of a posterior distribution def i ned directly over the space of PD matrices 
without limiting ourselves to conjugate priors, as such, is the i rst of its kind. 
That said, it is sometimes suf i cient for the scientist to obtain a point estimate of the co- 
variance or spectral density matrix. In this context, regularization of the estimate is often 
advantageous. Regularization approaches may be interpreted as Bayesian and their corre- 
sponding point estimates are interpreted as maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates. See 
[144] for a statistically minded survey of covariance estimation and regularization, and see 
[1] for a state-of-science approach to point estimation in signal processing applications. 
The rest of the chapter is outlined thus: in Section 2.2, we provide motivation for our 
approach in the form of a brief introduction to spectral density estimation for multivariate 
time series; in Section 2.3, we def i ne PD matrices and show how the space of PD (symmetric 
or Hermitian) matrices comprises a Riemannian manifold; in Section 2.4, we present the 
gLMC methodology for Bayesian inference on general Riemannian manifolds; in Section 2.5, 
we detail gLMC on the spaces of symmetric and Hermitian PD matrices; in Section 2.6, 
we introduce the reader to common proper and improper priors for covariance matrices; in 
Section 2.7, we present empirical results based on simulated and real-world data.

2.4Bayesian inference on general Riemannian mani- 
folds using the geodesic Lagrangian Monte Carlo 
Given data y1,...,yN��� Rn, 
one may specify a generative model by a likelihood function, 
p(y|q). In the following we allow q ��� Mmto 
be an m-dimensional vector on a manifold that 
parameterizes the likelihood. Endowing q with a prior distribution p(q) renders the posterior 
distribution

p(y|q)p(q)dq 
.(2.14) 
The integral is often referred to as the evidence and may be interpreted as the probability 
of observing data y given the model. In most interesting models the evidence integral is 
intractable and high dimensional models do not lend themselves to easy numerical integra- 
tion. Non-quadrature sampling techniques such as importance sampling or even random 
walk MCMC also suf f er in high dimensions. HMC is an ef f ective sampling tool for higher 
dimensional models over continuous parameter spaces [49, 137]. Here we discuss HMC and 
its geometric variants (see Section 2.1) in detail. 
In HMC, a Hamiltonian system is constructed that consists of the parameter vector q and an 
auxiliary vector p of the same dimension. The negative-log transform turns the probability 
density functions into a potential energy function U(q) = ���log��(q) and corresponding 
kinetic function K(p). Thus q and p become the position and momentum of Hamiltonian 
function 
H(q,p) = U(q) + K(p) .(2.15)

when there exists a closed form linear projection of vectors in the ambient space onto the 
tangent space at any point. Although this embedding will always exist [134], it is rarely 
known. When equipped with the canonical metric, the space of PD matrices does not admit 
a known isometric embedding. Moreover, we are unaware of a closed-form projection onto

Geodesic Lagrangian Monte Carlo
The work [25] presents an extension of the RMHMC framework to manifolds that can be isometrically embedded into Euclidean space. This approach is particularly efficient when a known closed-form linear projection exists from the ambient space to the tangent space at any point. However, this kind of embedding is rarely known. For the space of Positive Definite (PD) matrices with the canonical metric, such an isometric embedding is not available. Hence, an intrinsic approach is preferred.

4.1Introduction 
Bayesian inference is hard. Bayesian inference on non-Euclidean manifolds is harder. Prior 
to the publication of [25], a statistician required great ingenuity to compute the posterior 
distribution for any model with non-Euclidean parameter space, and the algorithmic details 
might change signif i cantly depending on the prior, the likelihood, and the constraints implied 
by the non-Euclidean geometry. A good example of this approach is found in [88], where 
the posterior distribution over the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal matrices is computed by 
way of column-at-a-time Gibbs updates that rely on model specif i cations. 
It is preferable, rather, that the same algorithm work for many dif f erent kinds of models. 
This is one of the strengths of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo [49] and its Riemannian extension, 
RMHMC [66], which augments the posterior distribution ��(q) by the random Gaussian 
momentum p ��� N ?0,G(q)?, 
where G(q) is the metric tensor pertaining to the Riemannian 
manifold over which the model is def i ned. RMHMC simulates from the posterior distribution 
by simulating the augmented canonical distribution with Hamiltonian 
H(q,p) = U(q) + K(q,p) ��� ���log��(q) + 
1 
2 log|G(q)| + 
1 2p 
TG(q)���1p, (4.1) 
i.e., U(q) is the negative log-posterior and K(q,p) is the negative logarithm of the probability 
density function of Gaussian momentum p. Since the kinetic energy is not separable in q and 
p, the system is not integrable using Euler���s method, so, in most cases, implicit integration 
methods are required [66]. However, [25] point out that, for certain manifolds with known 
geodesics, it is benef i cial to split the Hamiltonian into two parts and simulate the two systems 
iteratively. Here, the i rst Hamiltonian H[1]= ���log��(q)+ 
1 
2 log|G(q)| renders the equations 
�� q = 0 
�� p = ���q?log��(q) 
��� 
1 
2 log|G(q)|?, 67 
and, crucially, the second Hamiltonian H[2]= 
1 2p TG(q)���1p renders the geodesic dynamics for 
the Riemannian metric���s Levi-Civita connection. Thus, the entire system may be simulated 
by iterating between (1) perturbing the momentum and (2) advancing along the manifold 
geodesics.

Introduction to Bayesian Inference on Non-Euclidean Manifolds
Bayesian inference is a challenging task, and it becomes even more complex when dealing with non-Euclidean manifolds. Prior to the publication of [25], performing posterior computations for models with non-Euclidean parameter spaces required significant ingenuity. The algorithmic approach often varied based on factors such as the prior, the likelihood, and the constraints imposed by the non-Euclidean geometry. An example of this complexity can be seen in [88], where posterior computations over the Stiefel manifold of orthonormal matrices are accomplished using model-specific Gibbs updates.
Ideally, a single algorithm should be versatile enough to work across various model types. This versatility is one of the strengths of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) [49] and its Riemannian extension, RMHMC [66]. RMHMC enhances the posterior distribution ��(q) with random Gaussian momentum

This is the same as Formula (4.2), but with ��(x) replacing ��H(x), the posterior with respect 
to the Hausdorf f measure. Hence, by working completely on the embedded manifold, we 
are able to derive a Hamiltonian that does not depend on any notion of intrinsic geometry 
72 
whatsoever and thus avoids the log-Jacobian calculation of the embedding. The resulting 
details are given by Algorithm 4.

4.4Discussion 
We have proposed an alternative derivation to the geodesic Monte Carlo for embedded 
manifolds [25]. This derivation is conceptually simpler, as it does not rely on a notion of 
intrinsic manifold geometry and thus clarif i es the algorithm. Specif i cally, it becomes clear 
that the inclusion of the log-Jacobian of the embedding in the Hamiltonian is unnecessary 
in any case where the target distribution is def i ned with respect to embedding coordinates. 
The resulting class of algorithms are symplectic and completely explicit (do not require 
implicit integration). The algorithm also allows for non-trivial mass matrix as an added 
73 
benef i t. Finally, the exposition hints how Metropolis adjustments may be incorporated into 
geometric Langevin algorithms such as [117].

Discussion on Embedding Geodesic Monte Carlo
An alternative derivation of the embedding geodesic Monte Carlo for embedded manifolds, as proposed in [25], has been introduced. This derivation is characterized by its conceptual simplicity, as it eliminates the reliance on intrinsic manifold geometry notions, making the algorithm's mechanics clearer. In this approach, it becomes evident that incorporating the log-Jacobian of the embedding into the Hamiltonian is unnecessary whenever the target distribution is defined in terms of embedding coordinates.
The resulting class of algorithms is both symplectic and entirely explicit, eliminating the need for implicit integration. Moreover, these algorithms permit the use of a non-trivial mass matrix, offering an additional advantage. This approach also suggests the possibility of integrating Metropolis adjustments into geometric Langevin algorithms, similar to the concepts presented in [117].

Chapter Summary 
It is well known that the Fisher information induces a Riemannian geometry on para- 
metric families of probability density functions. Following recent work, we consider 
the nonparametric generalization of the Fisher geometry. The resulting nonparametric 
Fisher geometry is shown to be equivalent to a familiar, albeit inf i nite-dimensional, ge- 
ometric object���the sphere. By shifting focus away from density functions and toward 
square-root density functions, one may calculate theoretical quantities of interest with 
ease. More importantly, the sphere of square-root densities is much more computation- 
ally tractable. This insight leads to a novel Bayesian nonparametric density estimation 
model. We construct the ��2-process density prior by modeling the square-root density 
with a restricted Gaussian process prior. Inference over square-root densities is fast, 
and the model retains the l exibility characteristic of Bayesian nonparametric mod- 
els. Finally, we formalize the relationship between embedding geodesic Monte Carlo 
(egMC) on the inf i nite-dimensional sphere and standard Riemannian HMC.

5.1Introduction 
The Fisher information���and the geometry it induces���has been one of the unequivocal suc- 
cess stories of geometry in statistics. Building on recent work, we extend the Fisher geometry 
beyond parametric statistical models and show that the resulting geometry is equivalent to 
that of the inf i nite-dimensional sphere. The purpose of this chapter is to bring attention to 
this new perspective and to demonstrate its theoretical and methodological consequences. 
As an application, we introduce the ��2-process density prior, a l exible nonparametric model 
for Bayesian density estimation that admits fast computation while requiring minimal as- 
sumptions. 
The Fisher information matrix is canonical in statistics: it is rooted in information theory 
[68]; it appears in Jef f rey���s prior of Bayesian analysis [101]; and it plays a central role 
in Bayesian and Frequentist asymptotics [113].Fisher advocated the importance of the 
information matrix in maximum likelihood estimation [60]. Fisher���s student, Rao, was the 
i rst to place the information matrix in a dif f erential geometric context [147]. Since then, the 
dif f erential geometric implications for parametric statistical models have been the subject 
of extensive inquiry [4]. Recently, a number of researchers have drawn connections between 
the Fisher geometry and the geometry of the inf i nite sphere [160, 30, 100, 109, 161, 142]. 
Much of this work has been in the area of shape analysis and has focused on using the 
Fisher geometry to measure distance between probability densities.

Chapter Summary
This chapter explores the extension of the Fisher information's Riemannian geometry beyond parametric statistical models to nonparametric cases. The resulting nonparametric Fisher geometry is found to be equivalent to the geometry of the inf i nite-dimensional sphere. This perspective shift offers computational advantages and leads to the development of a novel Bayesian nonparametric density estimation model called the ��2-process density prior. This prior enables efficient computation while maintaining the flexibility typical of Bayesian nonparametric models. Additionally, the chapter formalizes the relationship between embedding geodesic Monte Carlo (egMC) on the inf i nite-dimensional sphere and standard Riemannian Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. The chapter showcases the theoretical and methodological implications of this new perspective on geometry in statistics.

Future directions: Bayesian inference 
on inf i nite manifolds 
One of the most immediate extensions of the methodology presented in this dissertation is the 
extension from i nite dimensional manifolds to Hilbert manifolds. Many problems in statistics 
and applied mathematics require a solution that belongs to a set of constrained functions. 
Although these functional constraints (e.g. non-negativity, orthogonality, normality, etc.) 
often complicate problems, structure and symmetries on the solution space can be leveraged 
to simplify statistical models and speed-up computations. On the one hand, manifolds are 
a large class of spaces that are useful in many of the mathematical sciences [65, 84]. On the 
other hand, functions are the objects of interest, but spaces of functions are (in most cases) 
inf i nite-dimensional. Future research may demonstrate that manifold structure can provide 
order to a statistical problem, even when the solution space is an inf i nite-dimensional space 
of functions. 
Bayesian inference on functional manifolds necessitates new computational and modelling 
techniques that rely upon the foundations of dif f erential geometry, inverse-problems, and 
130 
Bayesian nonparametrics. Such techniques would allow for scalable applications of Bayesian 
methods to multiple complex spatial and temporal problems. 
In Chapter 5, I used a reinterpretation of information geometry [4] to inspire a new approach 
to Bayesian nonparametric density estimation [92]. Whereas density estimation has tradi- 
tionally focused on functions that are non-negative and integrate to unity, I focused on the 
square-root of this function and thus identif i ed the problem with Bayesian inference on the 
L2sphere 
Q := ? q : D ��� R | Z D 
q(x)2dx = 1 ? 
,(7.1) 
for given domain D. I modeled the square-root density with a GP prior [148, 9] (or a Gaussian 
measure in L2) multiplied by the Dirac measure restricting the function to the unit sphere: 
q ��� GP �� ��q(Q).(7.2) 
Computationally, it is much easier to enforce the constraint to the L2sphere���given by Dirac 
measure ��q(Q)���than it is to constrain a function to integrate to 1. This is accomplished by 
using the Karhunen-Lo` eve decomposition [173] of the random function q(��) and truncating for 
suf i ciently high frequencies. Note that this basis truncation may also be learned adaptively 
in a Bayesian fashion [37]. The left of Figure 7.1 shows samples drawn from the posterior 
distribution of density function p(��) = q(��)2using 
geodesic Monte Carlo on the i nite sphere

Chapter 7: Future Directions: Bayesian Inference on Infinite Manifolds
This chapter discusses potential future directions for extending the methodology presented in the dissertation. One immediate extension is moving from finite-dimensional manifolds to Hilbert manifolds, which would be particularly useful when dealing with constrained functions, such as those with non-negativity, orthogonality, or other properties. Functional constraints often complicate problems, but utilizing the structure and symmetries of the solution space could simplify statistical models and computational efforts. This involves delving into the realm of dif f erential geometry, inverse problems, and Bayesian nonparametrics to develop techniques for Bayesian inference on infinite-dimensional functional manifolds.
The dissertation's approach to Bayesian nonparametric density estimation focused on using the square root of the density function and treating it as a point on the L2 sphere. This led to a Gaussian process (GP) prior multiplied by a Dirac measure, enforcing the constraint on the L2 sphere. This approach eased computational constraints compared to the traditional method of ensuring a function integrates to 1. The chapter emphasizes the potential for utilizing similar techniques to solve problems on infinite manifolds and suggests that this exploration could open up new opportunities for scalable applications of Bayesian methods to complex spatial and temporal problems.

That is, ��t(��) = ��(��,t) is the square-root of the density function describing the probability 
of the particle being in position x at time t. Thus, ��tplays the exact same role as function 
q(��) in Equation (7.2), with the additional constraint that for times s and t, ��sand

equation also enforce that �� be complex valued. In the notation of Equations (7.2) and (7.4),

��t��� GP �� ����(CP���),(7.7) 
where CP���is 
the inf i nite-dimensional projective Hilbert space [72] (and each ���ray��� is iden- 
tif i ed with its member that integrates to unity). The details are surprisingly similar to the 
manifold nonparametric density estimation of Chapter 6, and extensions to multi-particle 
fermionic systems can be made using the Slater determinant [157]. Through manifold non- 
parametrics, this project would serve to introduce quantum physics to Bayesian inverse 
problems and vice-versa. The existence of less l exible Bayesian methods [119, 107, 69] for 
quantum data integration combined with interest within the statistics community [7] sug- 
gests that the proposed research would have substantial impact and help extend the scientif i c 
domain of statistics. 134 
7.3Computing on inf i nite manifolds 
HMC has facilitated ef i cient computing for state spaces that were formerly dif i cult to 
perform Bayesian inference on: embedding geodesic Monte Carlo [25] (Chapters 4-6) and 
geodesic Lagrangian Monte Carlo (Chapter 2) ef i ciently perform Bayesian inference on many 
i nite dimensional manifolds. In parallel to the development of HMC algorithms for i nite 
manifolds, the HMC class has been extended to compute probability measures on Hilbert 
spaces [19, 37]. This inf i nite-dimensional extension has been helpful for the growth of the 
i eld of Bayesian inverse problems. 
As of today, HMC has not been extended to manifolds of functions. One reason is that such 
an extension has been mostly unmotivated outside the density estimation model of Chapter 
5. Work is needed that builds on i nite manifold HMC algorithms so that it provably and 
ef i ciently scales in the inf i nite-dimensional limit.

The provided text discusses the potential application of the proposed methodology to the field of quantum physics and Bayesian inverse problems. It suggests extending the approach to the context of quantum physics, where the state function �� plays a role similar to the previously discussed function q. The Schr��dinger equation is introduced as a constraint that governs the dynamics of �� over time and position. The proposed Bayesian manifold nonparametric model aims to combine Bayesian methodology with quantum physics concepts, utilizing inf i nite-dimensional projective Hilbert space. This extension could provide new insights into quantum physics through the lens of Bayesian inverse problems, contributing to both fields.
Additionally, the text highlights the need for computational methods on infinite-dimensional manifolds. While existing methodologies like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) have enabled efficient Bayesian inference on various manifolds, including infinite-dimensional ones, the extension to manifolds of functions has been less explored. The extension of HMC to function manifolds would require further research to ensure scalability and efficiency, particularly in the context of infinite-dimensional spaces.

Visualizing Uncertainty:

Geometric Bayesianism offers an intuitive means to visualize uncertainty. Probability distributions cease to be abstract curves on graphs; they become arrows in space, pointing to possibilities and uncertainties.
Comparing and Contrasting Distributions:

Geometric measures enable the quantitative evaluation of how prior beliefs align with observed data, how likelihood functions influence inferences, and how posterior distributions evolve.
This approach facilitates rigorous comparisons between different prior distributions, shedding light on which beliefs best resonate with data.
Applications Across Fields:

The realm of Geometric Bayesianism isn't confined to a single domain. It extends across fields like machine learning, statistics, and even philosophy.
Its capacity to unravel relationships and unveil shifts in belief systems has implications for diverse disciplines.
In Summation:

Of course! Here are some examples to illustrate the various topics we discussed:
Category Theory for Bayesian Learning:
Imagine you have a category where objects represent different types of probability distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Poisson) and arrows represent transformations or relationships between these distributions. Category Theory provides a way to analyze how these transformations interact and compose, offering a more abstract and structured view of Bayesian learning processes.
Geometric Bayesianism:

The Curry-Howard isomorphism establishes a deep connection between logic and computation. It links logical proofs with computer programs and types with propositions. In the context of Bayesian learning, this isomorphism can manifest as the correspondence between Bayesian inference processes and the construction of proofs or programs. Just as different logical systems can lead to equivalent proofs, different probabilistic models can lead to equivalent Bayesian inferences.
Church-Turing Thesis:
The Church-Turing thesis asserts the equivalence of different computational models in terms of their expressive power. In the context of Bayesian learning, this thesis suggests that different ways of specifying prior beliefs, likelihood functions, and posterior distributions can ultimately lead to the same results. Whether you express Bayesian inference using category theory, geometry, or other formalisms, the outcomes should be equivalent if the models are equivalent.
Functional Equivalence of Programming Paradigms:
The functional equivalence of programming paradigms, such as imperative and declarative styles, mirrors the idea that different mathematical formalisms or conceptual frameworks can lead to the same results in Bayesian learning. Just as different programming languages can achieve the same computation using distinct approaches, different mathematical approaches can yield equivalent Bayesian inference outcomes.
These connections highlight the overarching principle that different representations or formalisms can capture the same underlying concepts and relationships. Whether in logic, computation, or Bayesian learning, the central ideas remain constant, even as the ways of expressing them may vary. This resonates with the idea that mathematics, computation, and Bayesian reasoning are fundamentally interrelated, and insights from one domain can illuminate the others.

Ok an example of that you could guess that everyone is 6 feet tall or 4 feet tall in a room and then update it when you compare to your predictions however both sets of priors would lead to the same result (it happens to be 5 foot average in this room). This is similar to how in a painting you can start with light colors and work to dark colors or vice versa
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Absolutely, your example illustrates the concept of how different prior beliefs can lead to the same inference outcomes in Bayesian reasoning. Let's break down your example and connect it to the topics we discussed:
Example: Estimating Average Height in a Room
Bayesian Inference:
You're using Bayesian inference to estimate the average height of individuals in a room based on observed data. In this case, the data you're collecting are the actual heights of people in the room.
Priors:
You start with two different prior beliefs: one where you guess everyone is 6 feet tall, and another where you guess everyone is 4 feet tall. These priors represent your initial assumptions about the distribution of heights in the room.
Updating with Data:
As you observe the actual heights of people in the room, you update your prior beliefs using the likelihood function. This step involves comparing your prior assumptions with the actual data you collect.
Equivalent Results:
Interestingly, despite starting with very different priors (6 feet vs. 4 feet), Bayesian updating ensures that your posterior distribution converges to the same or similar estimates. In your case, the actual average height is around 5 feet. This demonstrates that Bayesian inference takes into account both prior beliefs and observed evidence to refine your estimate, ultimately converging to a more accurate result.
Connection to Concepts:
Equivalence of Priors:
The example showcases that different prior beliefs can lead to equivalent results after updating with data. This relates to the idea of functional equivalence in programming paradigms, where different paths can lead to the same computation or outcome.
Bayesian Framework:
Your example aligns with the Bayesian framework we discussed, where prior beliefs are combined with likelihood functions to yield posterior distributions. The principles of updating based on evidence hold true regardless of the initial assumptions.
Prior-Data Conflict:
The example also highlights that while priors can influence initial beliefs, strong evidence in the data can override those priors. This is akin to the way Bayesian reasoning balances the tension between prior beliefs and observed evidence.
Flexibility of Bayesian Inference:
Just as your example shows that you can start with either light colors and work to dark colors or vice versa in a painting, Bayesian inference allows you to begin with different assumptions (priors) and refine your estimates based on evidence. The methodology remains flexible while aiming to converge to accurate results.
Overall, your example beautifully illustrates the core principles of Bayesian inference, the influence of priors, and how distinct priors can lead to equivalent results through the process of updating with data.

How can you tell when you are using category theory?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Recognizing when you are using category theory can be a bit subtle, especially if you're not explicitly formalizing your thoughts in categorical language. Here are a few indicators that you might be using category theory concepts:
Abstract Objects and Morphisms:
Category theory deals with abstract objects and their relationships (morphisms) rather than specific instances. If you find yourself focusing on relationships between abstract structures more than concrete details, you might be using category theory.
Emphasis on Composition:
Category theory places a strong emphasis on composition of morphisms. If you're thinking about how different processes or transformations can be composed to yield new structures or relationships, you're in the realm of category theory.
Universal Properties:
Categories often involve universal properties, which describe how objects interact in a specific way. If you're trying to describe objects based on how they relate to other objects in a general and abstract manner, you're touching upon universal properties, a hallmark of category theory.
Structural Abstraction:
Category theory aims to find common structures and patterns that exist across different mathematical domains. If you're abstracting away specific details to focus on overarching structures, you're engaging in categorical thinking.
Transcending Specific Domains:
Category theory is a framework that transcends specific mathematical domains. If you find yourself thinking about principles that could apply in multiple areas of mathematics (and potentially beyond), you're likely engaging with categorical ideas.
Hierarchy of Concepts:
Categories can be organized hierarchically, with larger categories containing smaller ones. If you're thinking about how concepts can be organized into a hierarchy and how they relate within this hierarchy, you're thinking categorically.
Functors and Natural Transformations:
Functors and natural transformations are fundamental concepts in category theory. If you're trying to map relationships between different categories or transform one structure into another while preserving certain properties, you're working with these categorical constructs.
Generalization of Concepts:
Category theory often seeks to generalize concepts from one area of mathematics to another. If you're looking for ways to generalize ideas, relationships, or structures across diverse contexts, you're touching on the spirit of category theory.
Remember that category theory provides a powerful and abstract way of thinking about mathematics and various other fields. While not all applications of these indicators mean you're explicitly using category theory, they suggest a categorical mindset and a focus on abstract relationships and structures.

Aren't some forms of object oriented programming like a category theory with types?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, there is a connection between certain forms of object-oriented programming (OOP) and category theory, particularly when it comes to type systems and the relationships between types. Category theory provides a mathematical framework for understanding abstract relationships and structures, and this can be seen in the way some aspects of OOP are designed.
In OOP, types can be thought of as analogous to objects in a category, and functions or methods that operate on those types can be analogous to morphisms in a category. Here's how some concepts in OOP relate to category theory:
Objects (Types):
In OOP, objects are instances of classes or types. Each type can be thought of as an object in a category. Category theory abstracts over specific objects and focuses on their relationships, which aligns with OOP's focus on interactions between types.
Morphisms (Methods/Functions):
The methods or functions that operate on objects (instances of types) in OOP can be seen as morphisms between objects. These morphisms describe how data is transformed and manipulated, similar to how morphisms in category theory describe relationships between objects.
Composition:
In category theory, morphisms are often composed to create new relationships. Similarly, in OOP, methods/functions can be composed to achieve more complex behaviors.
Identity Morphisms and Identity Functions:
In category theory, each object has an identity morphism. Similarly, in OOP, each type usually has identity functions that preserve the data in its original form.
Associativity:
Category theory emphasizes the associativity of morphism composition. In OOP, associativity is seen in the chaining of method calls or function compositions.
Inheritance and Subtypes:
In OOP, inheritance represents a relationship between types, where a subtype inherits properties and behaviors from a supertype. This is analogous to relationships between objects and categories in category theory.
Polymorphism:
Polymorphism in OOP allows different types to share common behavior. In category theory, the concept of universal properties captures similar ideas of shared behavior across different objects.
It's important to note that while there are parallels between certain OOP concepts and category theory, not all aspects of OOP align perfectly with category theory principles. Additionally, category theory is a highly abstract mathematical framework, whereas OOP is primarily a programming paradigm focused on practical software development.
Overall, the connection between OOP and category theory highlights how mathematical concepts can influence and inspire programming paradigms and language design.

This often happens because the abstract ideas from category theory have found their way into various fields and disciplines, influencing the way problems are solved, structures are designed, and relationships are understood. Here are a few examples:
Database Design:
Relational databases and their query languages have a connection to category theory. The concept of a category can be seen in the schema of a database, with tables representing objects and relationships between tables representing morphisms. The relational algebra operations correspond to category-theoretical concepts like products, coproducts, and natural transformations.
Functional Programming:
Many functional programming languages and paradigms are influenced by category theory. Concepts like functors, monads, and arrows have their roots in category theory. Functional programming languages often encourage composing functions and avoiding mutable state, aligning with category-theoretical ideas.
Type Theory:
Type theory, used in programming languages and formal logic, has deep connections to category theory. Type systems can be seen as categories, and various type-related operations correspond to category-theoretical concepts. The Curry-Howard correspondence, which relates types to propositions and programs to proofs, is an example of this connection.
Mathematics:
Category theory was initially developed within mathematics to provide a unified framework for various mathematical structures. Many areas of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry and homotopy theory, benefit from the categorical perspective even if practitioners aren't explicitly using category theory terminology.
Machine Learning:
Certain machine learning techniques involve thinking in terms of transformations between data representations, which align with category-theoretical ideas. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be thought of as applying functors to images.
Physics:
Category theory has found applications in theoretical physics, particularly in understanding symmetries, transformations, and relationships between different physical theories.
Philosophy:
Philosophers have explored category theory concepts to understand relationships between concepts, formalize philosophical arguments, and analyze language structure.
In all these cases, individuals may be applying category theory concepts without explicitly realizing it, as the ideas have become integrated into various fields and practices. This shows the broad applicability and cross-disciplinary impact of category theory as a foundational framework for understanding structure and relationships.

Can't mathematical simplices be seen as a kind of category theory?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, mathematical simplices can indeed be related to category theory in certain ways. A simplex is a fundamental geometric shape used in various mathematical contexts, including algebraic topology and convex geometry. While simplices themselves are not categories, there are connections between simplices and category theory concepts, especially when considering their use in algebraic topology.
In algebraic topology, simplices are used to construct simplicial complexes, which are collections of simplices glued together in a specific manner. These complexes provide a way to study topological spaces by approximating them using discrete structures. The concept of a simplicial complex can be related to category theory concepts as follows:
Simplicial Complex as a Simplicial Set:
A simplicial complex can be thought of as a simplicial set, where each simplex is considered as an object, and the faces and degeneracies of the simplices correspond to morphisms in a category. This connection highlights the way simplices are related and how they can be composed to form higher-dimensional structures.
Simplicial Homology and Functors:
Simplicial homology is a method in algebraic topology to assign algebraic objects (such as groups) to simplicial complexes, capturing topological properties. This process involves constructing functors that map simplicial complexes to algebraic objects, showing a relationship between topological spaces and algebraic structures that aligns with category theory's emphasis on morphisms between objects.
Simplicial Categories:
In a broader sense, one can think of a simplicial complex as defining a simplicial category, where the objects are the simplices and the morphisms are the inclusions of faces. This connects the geometric aspects of simplices with the categorical notion of morphisms between objects.
While simplices themselves are not categories, they can be used to construct structures that align with category theory concepts. This connection between simplicial complexes and category theory illustrates the interdisciplinary nature of mathematics, where ideas from different areas can interact and enrich each other's understanding.

Reverse mathematics is a program in mathematical logic that seeks to determine which axioms are required to prove theorems of mathematics. Its defining method can briefly be described as "going backwards from the theorems to the axioms", in contrast to the ordinary mathematical practice of deriving theorems from axioms. It can be conceptualized as sculpting out necessary conditions from sufficient ones.

The reverse mathematics program was foreshadowed by results in set theory such as the classical theorem that the axiom of choice and Zorn's lemma are equivalent over ZF set theory. The goal of reverse mathematics, however, is to study possible axioms of ordinary theorems of mathematics rather than possible axioms for set theory.

In reverse mathematics, one starts with a framework language and a base theory���a core axiom system���that is too weak to prove most of the theorems one might be interested in, but still powerful enough to develop the definitions necessary to state these theorems. For example, to study the theorem ���Every bounded sequence of real numbers has a supremum��� it is necessary to use a base system that can speak of real numbers and sequences of real numbers.

For each theorem that can be stated in the base system but is not provable in the base system, the goal is to determine the particular axiom system (stronger than the base system) that is necessary to prove that theorem. To show that a system S is required to prove a theorem T, two proofs are required. The first proof shows T is provable from S; this is an ordinary mathematical proof along with a justification that it can be carried out in the system S. The second proof, known as a reversal, shows that T itself implies S; this proof is carried out in the base system.[1] The reversal establishes that no axiom system S��� that extends the base system can be weaker than S while still proving T.

Ever since Newton created dynamics, there has been controversy about its foundations. Are space and time absolute? Do they form a rigid but invisible framework and container of the universe? Or are space, time, and motion relative? If so, does Newton's 'framework' arise through the influence of the universe at large, as Ernst Mach suggested? Einstein's aim when creating his general theory of relativity was to demonstrate this and thereby implement 'Mach's Principle'. However, it is widely believed that he achieved only partial success. This question of whether motion is absolute or relative has been a central issues in philosophy; the nature of time has perennial interest. Current attempts to create a quantum description of the whole universe keep these issues at the cutting edge of modern research. Written by the world's leading expert on Mach's Principle, The Discovery of Dynamics is a highly original account of the development of notions about space, time, and motion. Widely praised in its hardback version, it is one of the fullest and most readable accounts of the astronomical studies that culminated in Kepler's laws of planetary motion and of the creation of dynamics by Galileo, Descartes, Huygens, and Newton. Originally published as Absolute or Relative Motion?, Vol. 1: The Discovery of Dynamics (Cambridge), The Discovery of Dynamics provides the technical background to Barbour's recently published The End of Time, in which he argues that time disappears from the description of the quantum universe.

"Diachronic Reverse Mathematics: Tracing Axiomatic Evolution through Time"
The study of mathematics and the sciences is an ever-evolving pursuit, where ideas and axioms develop over time, intertwining to form the foundation of our understanding. Just as reverse mathematics seeks to uncover the necessary axioms from theorems, the concept of "diachronic reverse mathematics" delves into the historical evolution of these axioms, tracing their development through the annals of time. This unique approach parallels the process of sculpting out necessary conditions from sufficient ones, shedding light on the intricate interplay between philosophy, mathematics, and scientific discovery.
At the heart of diachronic reverse mathematics lies the recognition that as our comprehension deepens, so does the refinement of the axioms that underpin our understanding. The journey through history reveals the ebb and flow of ideas, the shifting paradigms, and the intricate dance between foundational concepts. In this exploration, we draw parallels to Julian B. Barbour's pioneering work, "The Discovery of Dynamics: A Study from a Machian Point of View of the Discovery and the Structure of Dynamical Theories."
Barbour's work traverses the philosophical terrain of dynamics, space, time, and motion, capturing the essence of diachronic reverse mathematics in action. As Barbour unveils the debates surrounding the nature of space and time, he embarks on a journey akin to diachronic reverse mathematics���tracing the evolution of ideas from absolute to relative concepts. The progression of concepts from the absoluteness of Newtonian dynamics to the relativity of Einstein's general theory reflects the diachronic nature of mathematical and scientific exploration.
This connection extends to the essence of diachronic reverse mathematics���starting with a framework language and a core axiom system that may be insufficient to prove theorems of interest. Just as Barbour starts with notions of space and time that evolve, the foundational concepts evolve over time as new insights are gleaned. Diachronic reverse mathematics seeks to unravel the intricate web of ideas, revealing how new axioms emerge, shaping our understanding and leading to new theorems.
Furthermore, the link between diachronic reverse mathematics and "The Discovery of Dynamics" extends to the notion of tracing the evolution of axioms across different disciplines. Just as Barbour's work touches on the influence of philosophy on dynamics, diachronic reverse mathematics illuminates how axioms evolve not only within mathematics but also across fields such as probability theory, category theory, and vector calculus.
In sum, diachronic reverse mathematics encapsulates the essence of tracing the evolution of axioms over time, uncovering the progression of ideas and the refinement of foundational concepts. Just as Barbour's work provides insights into the evolution of dynamics and its connection to modern research, diachronic reverse mathematics unveils the threads that bind our understanding of mathematics and science through the ages. As we traverse the landscape of axiomatic evolution, we engage in a profound exploration of the intellectual tapestry that underpins our comprehension of the universe.

Bayesian inference is based on the fact that we often don���t know the underlying distribution of data, so we need to build a model and then iteratively adjust it as we get more data. In parametric Bayesian inference you start with picking a general form of the probability distribution f(x;��) defined by parameters ��. A good example of the distribution could be a Normal distribution with two parameters �� and ��^2. The probability of the data under a hypothetical distribution, assuming independent data examples, is:

This function is called likelihood function. The parameter �� is itself a random variable, and its probability distribution can be found using Bayes��� theorem:

Here p(��) is called posterior distribution, ��(��) is prior distribution and expresses our beliefs about parameter �� before we see any data. The term in the denominator is called evidence and represents probability of data. It is easier to think of it as a normalizing constant, to make sure p(��) is a valid distribution.

Bayesian Geometry
The idea behind Bayes Geometry is simple: what if we represent any function in the parameter space as a vector in a certain vector space. Examples of these functions could be prior and posterior distributions and likelihood functions. Then we can define an inner product on that space that will help us to calculate an angle between two distributions and interpret the angle as a measure of how much the distributions are different from each other. In my discussion on this subject I will follow a paper by de Carvalho et al[1] as well as this slide deck.

The inner product between two functions in the parameter space is defined as:

Source https://sheffieldmlnet.github.io/downloads/decarvalho-geometric-aspects-bayesian-inference-slides.pdf
and the norm of the function is:

We restrict our choice of functions to the one where the norm exists. This condition is generally not guaranteed as there are some probability distributions for which the norm diverges.

One thing we can immediately see that the evidence, defined above, is inner product between prior distribution and likelihood. Below is a schematic diagram for interaction between prior distribution, likelihood and posterior distribution. A large angle between the prior distribution and the likelihood indicates that the prior distribution has poor data alignment.

Source: https://sheffieldmlnet.github.io/downloads/decarvalho-geometric-aspects-bayesian-inference-slides.pdf
The main contribution in [1] is called compatibility, which can be interpreted as cosine of the angle between two functions in the parameter space:

Source: https://sheffieldmlnet.github.io/downloads/decarvalho-geometric-aspects-bayesian-inference-slides.pdf
Compatibility is a value between zero and one, and can be used to judge how well aligned are prior distribution to likelihood, two prior distributions, two likelihoods, etc. It can be calculated in closed form for some cases, for more complicated distributions it can be computed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm.

Discussion
There are several areas which I would like to discuss regarding this approach:

The paper defines a Hilbert space on the functions in the parameter space. This means that a linear combination of two functions also belongs to the Hilbert space. Such linear combination is interpreted as a mixture of two probability distributions. However, to become a proper distribution it must be normalized so that the integral over all values of the parameter is one:
Does unnormalized mixture have any meaning? By the way, the likelihood function does not need to be normalized.

2. A bit of confusion can arise regarding the concept of normalization for probability distributions. To be proper it needs to be normalized using the equation above. However Hilbert space adds additional norm, which is integral not of the PDF, but of its square. It is hard for me to understand any meaning of the second norm other than to support the constructions related to the Hilbert space.

3. Likelihood is not an additive, but multiplicative value. If I have a batch of data that has likelihood L1 and another (independent) batch of data with likelihood L2, the4 combined likelihood is a product of L1 and L2, not their sum. Which makes me believe that maybe a better approach is to introduce a vector space in the logarithmic domain or use an algebraic construct more complex than Hilbert space.

"Tracing the Evolution of Geometric Bayesianism: Unveiling Axiomatic Development Over Time"
The landscape of Bayesian inference is a realm of ever-shifting paradigms and evolving axioms. As our understanding of probability, data analysis, and mathematical frameworks deepens, so too does the need to unravel the journey of foundational ideas. The concept of "diachronic reverse mathematics" emerges as a beacon, guiding us through the historical tapestry of axiomatic development, just as it does with the unfolding of scientific theories and mathematical concepts.
At the heart of this exploration lies the realization that the path of discovery is not linear but rather a dynamic interplay between philosophy, mathematics, and the unfolding universe. Much like the reverse mathematics method, which extracts axioms from theorems, diachronic reverse mathematics unearths the evolution of necessary axioms over time, sculpting out the underlying conditions that enable our evolving understanding.
Julian B. Barbour's seminal work, "The Discovery of Dynamics: A Study from a Machian Point of View of the Discovery and the Structure of Dynamical Theories," serves as a testament to the diachronic nature of mathematical and scientific exploration. Barbour's exploration of dynamics, space, time, and motion parallels the process of diachronic reverse mathematics, as he navigates from the absoluteness of Newtonian dynamics to the relativity of Einstein's theories. This evolution mirrors the shifting axiomatic landscape that diachronic reverse mathematics seeks to unveil.
Geometric Bayesianism, a recent innovation in Bayesian inference, provides a compelling example of diachronic reverse mathematics in action. The approach seeks to bridge the gap between statistics and geometry, presenting probability distributions as vectors in a vector space. This geometric interpretation allows for the calculation of angles between distributions, unveiling the degrees of difference or alignment between them. Just as Barbour's work traced the progression from absolute to relative concepts, Geometric Bayesianism traces the evolution from abstract distributions to tangible geometric entities.
The essence of diachronic reverse mathematics and Geometric Bayesianism converge as we consider the emergence of new axioms over time. Much like Barbour's journey through the dynamics of space and time, the exploration of probability, category theory, vector calculus, and other mathematical disciplines leads to the evolution of axioms that better capture the complexities of the universe.
In conclusion, the journey of diachronic reverse mathematics unfolds as a profound exploration of intellectual evolution. This approach, paralleled in the works of Barbour and the emergence of Geometric Bayesianism, emphasizes the dynamic nature of axiomatic development and the transformation of ideas over time. As we trace the threads of history and traverse the intricate tapestry of mathematics and science, we gain insights into the profound interplay between our evolving comprehension and the foundations of our universe.

Needham's "Visual Complex Analysis" offers a unique perspective on complex numbers, functions, and their interactions. The use of diagrams and geometric representations helps demystify complex concepts and allows for intuitive comprehension. This mirrors the essence of Geometric Bayesianism, where probability distributions are transformed into tangible entities through geometric interpretations.

Visual Complex Analysis
Front Cover
Tristan Needham
Clarendon Press, 1997 - Complexes - 592 pages
This radical first course on complex analysis brings a beautiful and powerful subject to life by consistently using geometry (not calculation) as the means of explanation. Aimed at undergraduate students in mathematics, physics, and engineering, the book's intuitive explanations, lack of
advanced prerequisites, and consciously user-friendly prose style will help students to master the subject more readily than was previously possible. The key to this is the book's use of new geometric arguments in place of the standard calculational ones. These geometric arguments are communicated
with the aid of hundreds of diagrams of a standard seldom encountered in mathematical works. A new approach to a classical topic, this work will be of interest to students in mathematics, physics, and engineering, as well as to professionals in these fields.
