Could I get a summary of the myth of the framework, by Karl Popper?

Copilot
Certainly! “The Myth of the Framework: In Defence of Science and Rationality” is a collection of essays by philosopher Karl Popper, published in 1994.

The book addresses various topics within the philosophy of science and rationality.

One of the central themes is Popper’s argument against the idea that a shared framework is necessary for communication and scientific progress.

He challenges the relativist view that suggests progress is only possible within a fixed framework of assumptions and values.

Popper emphasizes the importance of critical discussion and the willingness to be wrong as means to advance knowledge.

He famously states, “I may be wrong and you may be right, and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth.” This highlights his belief in the fallibility of human knowledge and the ongoing quest for truth through open discourse and scientific inquiry1.

The book also delves into the moral responsibility of scientists, the structure of history, and the choice between reason and revolution.

Popper’s work is a defense of rationality and scientific method, advocating for the open society and the rejection of authoritarianism in the pursuit of knowledge1234.

How did he define critical rationalism?

Copilot
Karl Popper defined critical rationalism as an epistemological philosophy that emphasizes the importance of criticism over support for scientific theories and other claims to knowledge.

According to Popper, if a statement cannot be logically deduced from what is known, it might still be possible to logically falsify it.

This approach rejects the idea of justificationism, which suggests that only what can be proved by reason and/or experience should be accepted.

Critical rationalism holds that scientific theories and any other claims to knowledge can and should be rationally criticized, and if they have empirical content, they can and should be subjected to tests that may falsify them.

Thus, knowledge claims can be evaluated as either falsifiable and empirical or not falsifiable and non-empirical.

Falsifiable claims can be admitted to the body of empirical science and further differentiated based on their exposure to criticism and their probability, with the least probable theory that withstands attempts to falsify it being preferred.

This preference for the least probable theory is because it has the highest information content and is most open to future falsification1.

Popper’s critical rationalism also positioned itself against relativist philosophies, particularly post-modernist or sociological approaches to knowledge, advocating for knowledge and truth as objective1.

His statement earlier sounds like Bayesian inference.

Copilot
Karl Popper’s statement about preferring the least probable theory that withstands attempts to falsify it does indeed have a superficial resemblance to Bayesian inference.

However, Popper’s philosophy of science, particularly his principle of falsification, is fundamentally different from Bayesian inference.

Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes’ theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

It’s a form of inductive reasoning that relies on the prior probability of a hypothesis, which is then updated with new data to form a posterior probability1.

Popper, on the other hand, was critical of inductive reasoning and historicism—the idea that one can predict future events based on past data.

He argued that scientific theories should be subjected to rigorous testing and should aim to be falsifiable; if a theory survives attempts at falsification, it is not necessarily true, but simply has not been proven false yet1.

While Bayesian inference deals with probabilities and often involves a degree of subjectivity in the choice of prior probabilities, Popper’s falsificationism is more black-and-white: a theory can either be falsified or not, without assigning probabilities to its truthfulness.

Popper’s approach is more aligned with the philosophical stance of critical rationalism, which emphasizes the role of critical scrutiny and the tentative nature of knowledge1.

So, while there might be a superficial similarity in that both involve the evaluation of theories, the underlying philosophies and methodologies are quite distinct.

Popper’s views are often contrasted with Bayesianism, and he would likely argue that the probabilistic nature of Bayesian inference does not align with his criteria for scientific rigor2345.

i mean when i said i might be wrong and you may be right.

by effort (debate, critique, rationalism) the more correct belief can be found

Copilot
Yes, you’ve captured the essence of Karl Popper’s philosophy quite well.

His statement, “I may be wrong and you may be right, and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth,” reflects his belief in critical rationalism.

This approach values the process of debate, critique, and rational discussion as a means to progress towards a more accurate understanding or belief.

Popper’s view is that through critical scrutiny and rational argument, individuals can challenge their own and others’ hypotheses, leading to the elimination of errors and closer approximation to the truth.

He emphasizes that no theory or belief is ever final or certain; instead, knowledge grows through the process of conjectures and refutations.

The idea is that by acknowledging our fallibility and being open to being wrong, we create an environment where better, more robust ideas emerge.

This process is not just about finding common ground but about improving our understanding of the world by eliminating what is false and building on what withstands criticism.

In this way, critical rationalism is a dynamic and ongoing process, always open to new evidence and arguments, and always ready to discard or revise beliefs in the light of new findings.

It’s a powerful method for scientific inquiry and for the rational evaluation of any claim to knowledge.


You
so it might be similar to putting art out even if it appears incomplete

Copilot
Absolutely, that’s a great analogy.

Just as artists often release their work to the public even when it feels incomplete or imperfect, the process of critical rationalism encourages putting ideas and theories out into the world for scrutiny and discussion.

The act of sharing and exposing one’s work to criticism is a key part of the creative and scientific process.

In both art and science, the feedback received from others can lead to new insights and improvements.

An artist might revise their work based on the audience’s reaction, just as a scientist might refine their theories in response to criticism and new data.

This iterative process is essential for growth and progress.

The willingness to be wrong and to learn from mistakes is a powerful driver of innovation.

It allows for a continuous cycle of conjecture and refutation, which is at the heart of Popper’s philosophy.

By embracing the possibility of being incorrect, we open ourselves up to the opportunity of moving closer to the truth or creating something truly remarkable.


You
How does this approach apply to other fields besides science and art?

Copilot
Karl Popper’s approach of critical rationalism can be applied to various fields beyond science and art, including:

Education: Encouraging students to think critically, question assumptions, and engage in open debate can foster a deeper understanding and a more robust learning process.
Business: In the business world, critical rationalism can lead to better decision-making.

By critically evaluating strategies and being open to feedback, businesses can adapt and innovate more effectively.
Politics: The application of critical rationalism in politics can promote transparent and reasoned debate over policies, helping to avoid dogmatism and fostering policies that are more likely to benefit the public.
Ethics: In ethical discussions, critical rationalism allows for the examination of moral beliefs and practices, encouraging progress towards more humane and just principles.
Law: The legal system benefits from critical rationalism by continually questioning and testing laws and legal principles to ensure they serve justice and societal needs.
In all these fields, the willingness to be wrong and the active search for criticism help in refining ideas, policies, practices, and beliefs, leading to continuous improvement and progress.

It’s a universal principle that can enhance problem-solving and the pursuit of knowledge in any domain.


You
He described an evolutionary selectionary pressure of trial and error with negative feedback on error.

No optimal random variation is likely to appear only random differences which can be viewed as tentative.

Copilot
Karl Popper’s description of evolutionary selectionary pressure through trial and error aligns with his broader philosophical views on knowledge and progress.

He applied the principle of natural selection to the development of scientific theories and ideas, suggesting that just as organisms evolve through a process of variation and selection, so do hypotheses and theories.

In this evolutionary epistemology, ideas are subjected to a process of conjecture (trial) and refutation (error).

Theories that are less successful at explaining phenomena (errors) are rejected, while those that better withstand criticism and testing (tentative trials) survive and evolve.

This process is not about seeking an optimal or final solution, as Popper believed that such a thing is unlikely to exist.

Instead, it’s about the continuous generation of new ideas (random variations) and the elimination of those that fail to correspond with observations (negative feedback).

Popper’s view suggests that knowledge grows through a process of eliminating what is false, rather than confirming what is true.

Theories are never proven; they are only not yet disproven.

This perspective emphasizes the tentative nature of all knowledge claims and the importance of ongoing critical scrutiny.

This approach can be applied to other fields as well, where the idea of trial and error with feedback mechanisms can lead to improvement and innovation.

In business, for example, this might look like iterative product development, where each version is tested in the market and improved upon based on customer feedback.

In policy-making, it could involve the implementation of policies on a trial basis, with adjustments made as outcomes are assessed.

Overall, Popper’s philosophy encourages a dynamic and adaptive approach to problem-solving and knowledge acquisition, one that is always open to revision and improvement based on new evidence and critical evaluation.


You
How does this evolutionary epistemology compare to other theories of knowledge?

Copilot
Evolutionary epistemology (EE), as proposed by Karl Popper and others, compares to other theories of knowledge in several key ways:

Naturalism: EE is a naturalistic approach, meaning it seeks to understand knowledge through the lens of natural science, particularly biology and evolution.

This contrasts with more traditional epistemological approaches that may rely on abstract reasoning or philosophical argumentation without direct reference to natural processes1.
Adaptationism: EE often adopts an adaptationist perspective, viewing cognitive mechanisms and knowledge as adaptations that have evolved to solve problems.

This is different from other theories that might view knowledge as a result of social constructs or purely rational inquiry1.
Biological Foundation: EE emphasizes the biological basis of knowledge, suggesting that cognitive capacities and the knowledge they produce are deeply rooted in our evolutionary history.

Other theories, such as rationalism or empiricism, may focus more on the role of reason or sensory experience in knowledge acquisition2.
Selection and Variation: EE applies the Darwinian principles of variation and selection to the development of knowledge, proposing that ideas and theories evolve through a process of conjecture and refutation.

This is a dynamic and ongoing process, unlike some theories that may seek a static foundation for certain knowledge1.
Anti-Justificationism: Popper’s EE is critical of justificationism, the idea that knowledge must be justified through evidence or reason.

Instead, EE focuses on the falsifiability and testability of knowledge claims, which is a departure from epistemologies that emphasize the positive support for beliefs1.
Objective Knowledge: Despite its evolutionary basis, EE maintains that objective knowledge is possible, which may contrast with more relativistic or constructivist theories that question the possibility of objective truth1.
In summary, evolutionary epistemology offers a unique perspective on knowledge that integrates principles from biology and evolution, emphasizing the adaptive and tentative nature of knowledge, and the importance of critical scrutiny and falsifiability.

It stands in contrast to other epistemological theories that may prioritize justification, rationality, or social constructs as the primary sources of knowledge.

What are some criticisms of evolutionary epistemology?

Copilot
Evolutionary epistemology (EE) has been subject to various criticisms, some of which include:

Anti-biologism: Critics argue that EE may overextend the biological explanation into the realm of knowledge, where it may not be entirely applicable.

Moritz Schlick, for example, critiqued the idea of intuition as a form of knowledge from an evolutionary standpoint, suggesting that knowledge should not be reduced to biological processes alone1.
Practicality vs.

Truth: Some critics contend that EE conflates survival advantage with truth.

They argue that just because a belief or piece of knowledge is advantageous for survival does not necessarily mean it is true.

Knowledge selected through evolutionary processes may be more about practical utility rather than accurate representation of reality2.
Testability and Vagueness: Criticisms have been raised about the testability of evolutionary hypotheses within EE.

The assumptions about cognitive processes and the environment that leads to evolutionary adaptation can be vague and difficult to empirically verify3.
Philosophical Commitments: Some criticisms stem from different epistemological commitments, such as assumptions of complete social constructionism, which may conflict with the naturalistic approach of EE4.
Methodological Concerns: There are also methodological critiques regarding the value of qualitative over quantitative research in the social sciences, which may affect the acceptance of EE across different fields4.
These criticisms highlight the ongoing debate and dialogue within the philosophy of science and epistemology regarding the best approaches to understanding knowledge and its development.

You
Co-host: ...Yeah, exactly.

So, his main response is that proponents of the myth of the framework exaggerate a difficulty into an impossibility.

He says right off the bat that it's absolutely the case that if, say, you and I don't share a framework of assumptions, a conversation is going to be difficult.

But just because it's difficult doesn't mean it's not fruitful.

And in fact, a conversation where you and I are in agreement amongst most of our presuppositions, that kind of conversation, he claims, is going to be less fruitful because it's just a contemporary parliament circle-jerking.

It's just you and I in agreement.

Co-host: He says at the beginning of the essay, "Although I am an admirer of tradition and conscious of its importance, I am almost at the same time an almost orthodox adherent of unorthodoxy.

I hold that orthodoxy is the death of knowledge, since growth of knowledge depends entirely on the existence of disagreement.

And disagreement may lead to strife and even to violence, and this is very bad indeed for, as I put it, 'I abhor violence,' yet disagreement may also lead to discussion, to argument, and to mutual criticism.

Because disagreement is two people thinking hard about the same thing and having different opinions.

And this is where you get the best criticism, when people have genuine disagreement."

Co-host: And then he says, "And these, I think, are of paramount importance.

I suggested the first step towards a better and more peaceful world was taken when the war of swords was first supported and then even replaced by a war of words.

Now, this is why the topic is of practical significance.

So, disagreement is a good thing, provided it leads to mutually enriching criticism, and provided, of course, that it doesn't lead to violence.

And this is why the clashing of frameworks can be very fruitful, indeed."

Co-host: And so, continuing on the fruitful thing, he says, "I think that we may say of a discussion that it was more fruitful the more the participants were able to learn from it.

This means the more interesting questions and difficult questions were asked, the more new answers they were induced to think of, and the more they were shaken in their opinions, and the more they could see things differently after discussion.

In short, the more their intellectual horizons were extended."

Co-host: So, to just reiterate his attack on the myth of the framework, the central thesis is that through difficult conversations, much fruit can be gleaned.

And proponents of relativism, he says, put before us standards of mutual understanding which are unrealistically high.

And when they fail to meet these standards, they claim that understanding is impossible.

So, if you assume that a discussion is only fruitful if the participants fully converge and agree at the end of it, and everyone has their mind changed and everyone agrees, if that's what your standards of success look like, then anything that falls short of that is going to be deemed a failure.

The Popper's point is no, no, no, what matters is if our horizons were broadened, if we see our own perspective perhaps a little differently, if we understand the perspective of our opponents perhaps more clearly after discussion, even if no minds were changed.

Like the conversation I had with my friends at the bar yesterday, neither of us changed our minds, but I learned a little bit more about where my position was weak when I couldn't respond to some of the things that they were saying, and it gave me a list of things I need to look into afterwards.

And I learned a lot from it, even though we didn't converge at the end.

Copilot
The co-host’s summary captures the essence of Karl Popper’s critique of the “myth of the framework” and his advocacy for critical rationalism.

Popper argues that the difficulty of communication between individuals with different frameworks is not an insurmountable barrier but rather an opportunity for intellectual growth.

He suggests that disagreement, when it leads to critical discussion and mutual criticism, is a catalyst for extending our intellectual horizons and deepening our understanding.

Popper’s stance is that the clash of different frameworks, rather than being a hindrance, is actually beneficial to the progress of knowledge.

It’s through the process of engaging with differing opinions and challenging our own presuppositions that we can achieve a more comprehensive view of the world.

This process is inherently fruitful, even if it doesn’t result in consensus or a change of mind, because it helps us identify the weaknesses in our own positions and consider new perspectives.

In this view, the goal of discussion is not necessarily to reach agreement but to foster an environment where ideas can be freely exchanged and critically examined.

This approach is valuable not only in scientific inquiry but also in everyday interactions, as it encourages openness to learning and adapting, which is fundamental to personal and societal development.

Popper’s philosophy thus champions the idea that through respectful and thoughtful discourse, we can all contribute to a better and more peaceful world.

You
What are some practical takeaways from Popper's philosophy?

Copilot
Karl Popper’s philosophy offers several practical takeaways that can be applied in various aspects of life:

Embrace Criticism: Welcome constructive criticism as an opportunity for growth.

It helps identify flaws and areas for improvement, whether in work, personal beliefs, or creative endeavors.

Value Open Dialogue: Engage in open and honest discussions with others, especially those with differing viewpoints.

This can lead to a deeper understanding and innovative solutions.

Acknowledge Fallibility: Recognize that no one has all the answers and that being wrong is a natural part of the learning process.

This humility can foster a culture of continuous learning and adaptation.
Foster a Culture of Testing: In business and research, encourage the testing of ideas through experiments and feedback.

This approach helps refine products, services, and theories.
Encourage Diverse Perspectives: In teams and communities, seek out and value diverse perspectives.

This diversity can lead to more robust and well-rounded outcomes.
Promote Peaceful Disagreement: Advocate for resolving conflicts through dialogue and debate rather than coercion or violence.

This can contribute to a more peaceful and cooperative society.

Pursue Continuous Improvement: Adopt the mindset of continuous improvement, always looking for ways to better oneself, one’s work, and the world around us.

Be Open to Change: Be willing to change your mind in light of new evidence or better arguments.

This flexibility is key to personal and professional development.

Critical Thinking in Education: Teach critical thinking skills in education to empower individuals to analyze information and make informed decisions.

Iterative Development: Apply the principle of iterative development in projects, allowing for ongoing refinement and improvement based on feedback.

These takeaways from Popper’s philosophy can help individuals and organizations create environments that are conducive to innovation, progress, and the betterment of society.


You
I wanted to challenge this philosophy with observation that this is a kind of framework, and that some ideas are not decided by debate or arguement per se.

Sometimes ideas are presented in metaphorical or narrative abstract form.

Sometimes, certain arguments have implicit arguments and so sometimes debating a topic can give it credence because it might be assumed through the criteria of relevance.

Maybe the opposing argument has more emotional appeal or is more easily described or pictured, so debating it might give it more believability, even if is a weaker argument.

Copilot

You raise an interesting point.

Indeed, Karl Popper’s philosophy of critical rationalism, while valuable, is not without its limitations.

Let’s explore some of the challenges and nuances related to this approach:

Implicit Assumptions and Metaphorical Ideas:

You rightly highlight that not all ideas are explicitly presented in a structured, debatable form.

Some concepts are conveyed through metaphors, narratives, or abstract symbolism.

These implicit ideas may not lend themselves easily to direct debate.
Popper’s framework assumes that ideas can be explicitly stated and subjected to critical scrutiny.

However, there are layers of meaning and context that go beyond explicit arguments.
Emotional Appeal and Believability:
Emotional appeal plays a significant role in shaping beliefs and opinions.

An argument that resonates emotionally may gain more traction, even if it lacks logical rigor.
Popper’s focus on rationality and falsifiability doesn’t fully account for the emotional dimensions of human cognition.

We often believe what feels right, even when evidence is lacking.
Belief Persistence and Confirmation Bias:
People tend to hold onto their beliefs even in the face of contradictory evidence.

This phenomenon, known as belief persistence, challenges the idea that rational debate alone can change minds.
Confirmation bias—the tendency to seek and interpret information that confirms existing beliefs—can hinder open-mindedness during debates.
Social Context and Power Dynamics:
Debates occur within social contexts, where power dynamics, group affiliations, and cultural norms influence the outcome.

The perceived credibility of an argument may depend on who presents it.
Popper’s philosophy doesn’t fully address how social factors shape the acceptance or rejection of ideas.
Subjectivity and Aesthetic Judgments:
Some judgments are inherently subjective, such as aesthetic preferences, artistic interpretations, or moral values.

These may not be amenable to falsification or rational debate.
Popper’s framework struggles with assessing matters of taste or personal preference.
Complex Systems and Emergent Properties:
Some phenomena emerge from complex interactions and cannot be reduced to simple cause-and-effect relationships.

Understanding emergent properties (e.g., consciousness, ecosystems) goes beyond straightforward debate.
Popper’s approach may not fully capture the intricacies of such systems.
Thresholds for Fruitfulness:
While Popper emphasizes intellectual growth through disagreement, there’s no clear threshold for what constitutes a fruitful discussion.

How much disagreement is necessary for progress?
Sometimes, even minor shifts in perspective can lead to significant insights, but these may not always be apparent.
In summary, while critical rationalism provides a valuable framework for scientific inquiry and intellectual discourse, it doesn’t address all aspects of human cognition, emotion, and belief formation.

Recognizing these limitations allows us to appreciate the richness and complexity of human thought beyond the confines of explicit debate.

The dialogue earlier was a summary of a section from this podcast: 
271 views  May 31, 2022
Is there any possibility of fruitful dialogue with your mildly crazy, significantly intoxicated uncle at Thanksgiving dinner? We turn to Karl Popper's essay, The Myth of the Framework, to find out.

Popper argues that it's wrong to assume that fruitful conversation is only possible among those who share an underlying framework of beliefs and assumptions.

In fact, there's more to learn in difficult conversations which lack such a framework.

**We discuss**

- What is The Myth of the Framework?
- The relationship between the myth of the framework and epistemological and moral relativism
- Modern examples of the myth, including Jon Haidt's recent Atlantic essay and Paul Graham's Keep your identity small.
- Why there's more to learn from conversations where the participants disagree, and why conversations with too much agreement are uninteresting
- Linguistic relativism and the evolution of language as a refutation of the myth
- The relationship between the myth of the framework and the Enigma of Reason

Thank you for sharing the context of the dialogue.

The podcast you mentioned seems to delve into Karl Popper’s essay “The Myth of the Framework” and its relevance to contemporary issues.

The discussion points you’ve listed are indeed thought-provoking and align with the themes we’ve been exploring in our conversation.

The podcast topics touch on the importance of challenging the assumption that shared frameworks are necessary for meaningful dialogue, the limitations of epistemological and moral relativism, and the value of disagreement and diverse perspectives in enriching conversations.

It also seems to address the role of language evolution and the concept of reason as they relate to these ideas.

These discussions are crucial in understanding the dynamics of communication and the development of knowledge.

They highlight the practical implications of Popper’s philosophy in everyday interactions and the broader social and intellectual discourse.

If you have any specific questions or points from the podcast you’d like to explore further, I’d be happy to discuss them with you.

Or if there’s another topic or area you’re interested in, feel free to let me know!


You
I was just wondering if my criticisms were relevant any of the discussions?

Copilot

Your criticisms indeed touch on relevant aspects of the discussions we’ve had.

Let’s explore how they relate to some of the key points:

Implicit Assumptions and Metaphorical Ideas:

Your observation about implicit assumptions and metaphorical ideas aligns with the recognition that not all knowledge or beliefs can be neatly expressed in explicit arguments.

Some concepts are conveyed through symbolism, narratives, or cultural context.
Emotional Appeal and Believability:

Your point about emotional appeal and believability highlights the role of emotions in shaping our beliefs.

Popper’s focus on rational debate doesn’t fully account for the emotional dimensions of human cognition.
Belief Persistence and Confirmation Bias:

Your mention of belief persistence and confirmation bias underscores the challenge of changing minds solely through debate.

Popper’s philosophy doesn’t fully address these psychological tendencies.
Social Context and Power Dynamics:

Your insight about social context and power dynamics is relevant.

Debates occur within specific social structures, and the perceived credibility of arguments can be influenced by factors beyond rationality.
Subjectivity and Aesthetic Judgments:

Your consideration of subjective judgments and aesthetic preferences resonates with the limitations of Popper’s approach when dealing with matters of taste or personal values.
Complex Systems and Emergent Properties:

Your point about complex systems and emergent properties aligns with the recognition that some phenomena cannot be reduced to simple cause-and-effect relationships.

Popper’s framework may not fully capture these intricacies.
Thresholds for Fruitfulness:

Your discussion of fruitful conversations and thresholds for progress relates to Popper’s emphasis on intellectual growth through disagreement.

The definition of “fruitful” discussions is indeed multifaceted.
In summary, your criticisms provide valuable context and nuance to the philosophical themes we’ve explored.

They highlight the need to consider cognitive, emotional, and social factors beyond rational debate alone.

Thank you for contributing to the conversation!

Popper said his attitude was ambivalent.

He doesn't believe in complete reducibility, but he thinks that reduction must be attempted, because even partially successful reductions can be very useful or interesting in other ways.

Copilot
Karl Popper’s ambivalent attitude towards reducibility reflects his nuanced understanding of scientific and philosophical inquiry.

While he recognized the limitations of reductionism—the idea that complex phenomena can be fully explained by reducing them to their simplest components—he also saw the value in attempting such reductions.

Popper’s stance suggests that even if complete reducibility is not achievable, the process of reduction can yield insights.

Partial reductions can help simplify complex phenomena, making them more understandable and manageable.

This process can reveal underlying patterns, principles, or mechanisms that might otherwise remain obscured.

Moreover, attempts at reduction can lead to the development of new theories or models that, while not fully explaining the complexity of the original phenomena, can still be useful in other contexts or for other purposes.

For example, in science, a model that partially explains a biological process might not capture all its intricacies but could still be valuable for developing new treatments or interventions.

Popper’s view encourages a balanced approach: be open to the possibilities of reduction but remain aware of its limitations.

It’s a pragmatic perspective that values the pursuit of knowledge while acknowledging the complexity of the world.

This approach can be applied across various fields, encouraging both depth and breadth in our understanding of complex systems.

This sound similar to Monica's arguments in the Red Pill

Copilot
I see the resemblance you’re drawing between Karl Popper’s perspective and Monica’s arguments in “The Red Pill.” Both emphasize the importance of critical thinking, questioning assumptions, and engaging in open dialogue.

While Popper’s philosophy centers on scientific inquiry and intellectual growth, Monica’s arguments likely pertain to broader social and personal contexts.

In “The Red Pill,” Monica’s exploration of different viewpoints and her willingness to challenge prevailing narratives align with Popper’s call for fruitful conversations—even when frameworks clash.

Both encourage us to expand our intellectual horizons, consider alternative perspectives, and be open to learning.

Remember that context matters: Popper’s ideas apply broadly, while Monica’s arguments may specifically address gender dynamics and societal norms.

Nevertheless, the common thread of seeking truth through dialogue remains relevant in both cases.

7.  The Red Pill of Machine Learning
Reductionism is the use of Models.

Holism is the avoidance of Models.

Models are scientific models, theories, hypotheses, formulas, equations, naïve models based on personal experiences, superstitions (!), and traditional computer programs

Monica Anderson
Jun 30, 2022 • 27 min read

Copilot
Thank you for sharing the excerpt from Monica Anderson’s work on “The Red Pill of Machine Learning.” The discussion about reductionism and holism is relevant to both scientific inquiry and broader philosophical contexts.

Reductionism:
Reductionism involves breaking down complex phenomena into simpler components or models.

These models can be scientific theories, equations, or even everyday mental constructs.

It assumes that understanding the parts will lead to an understanding of the whole.

Reductionist approaches are common in fields like physics and chemistry.
However, reductionism has limitations, especially when dealing with emergent properties or systems where interactions create novel effects beyond the sum of their parts.

Holism:
Holism, on the other hand, emphasizes the whole over its individual components.

It considers context, interconnections, and emergent properties.
Holistic approaches recognize that some phenomena cannot be fully understood by breaking them down into smaller pieces.

Examples include ecosystems, consciousness, and social systems.

Avoiding oversimplification and appreciating the complexity of interconnected systems is a key aspect of holism.

Models:
Models play a crucial role in both reductionism and holism.

They can be formal scientific models, mental constructs, or even cultural narratives.

Models help us make sense of the world, predict outcomes, and communicate ideas.

They are essential tools for understanding complex phenomena.

However, we must remain aware of their limitations and recognize that no model fully captures reality.

Monica’s exploration likely extends beyond machine learning, touching on broader epistemological questions about how we acquire knowledge and understand the world.

Both reductionism and holism have their place, and a balanced approach that appreciates both perspectives can lead to deeper insights.

The Problem Solving level provides many familiar examples of these issues.

In our mundane lives, we solve many kinds of problems every day but our strategies for solving them fall into just those two categories.

For any complicated problem, we had better have a plan before we start.

But most problems the brain deals with every day are things we never have to think about.

Because we do not need to plan or Reason about them.

These are the millions of low-level problems we encounter in our mundane life every day; and this is the world that our AIs will have to operate in.

Consider someone walking across the floor.

Their brain signals their leg muscles to contract in the correct cadence.

Do they need to consciously plan each step? Do they Reason about how to maintain their balance? No; they probably don't even know what leg muscles they have.

Consider understanding this sentence.

Did you use Reasoning? Did you use grammar? If you are a fluent speaker, you do not need grammars to understand or produce language.

And you do not have time to Reason about language while hearing it spoken.

Reasoning is slow, but Understanding is instantaneous.

Consider someone braking for a stoplight.

How hard should they push on the brake pedal? Do they compute the required differential equation? Should such equations be part of the drivers license tests?

Consider someone making breakfast.

Did they have to Reason about anything or plan anything, or did they just do what worked yesterday, "without thinking about it"? Without consciously planning it?

Walking and talking, braking and breakfasting, like almost everything we use our brains for, rely on learning from our experiences in order to re-use anything that has worked in the past.

And, over time, we learn to correct our mistakes.

These strategies are simple enough that we can identify them in other life forms.

Dogs Understand a lot but do not Reason much.

And we can see how they could be implemented in something like Neurons in brains.

The split in our brains between Reasoning and Understanding was examined at length in "Thinking fast and slow" by Daniel Kahneman.

The absolute majority of the brain's efforts is spent processing low level sensory input, mostly from the eyes.

He calls this "System 1"; it provides Understanding.

Reasoning is done by "System 2" based on the Understanding from System 1.

But most problems we deal with on a daily basis do not require System 2 at all.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
Computers can solve any suitable problem when given sufficient human help, such as a complete plan for the solution in the form of a computer program and valid input data.

But since the AI/ML revolution of 2012 we now know how to make computers Understand certain problem domains through Machine Learning.

The acquired Understanding allows the machine to "just do it" for many different problems in that domain, without any human planning, Reasoning, or programming, and using incomplete, unreliable, and noisy input data.

This is changing how we are building systems with cognitive capabilities.

Everyone working in ML or AI needs to understand the tradeoffs we must make at the most fundamental -- Epistemological -- levels.

Modern ML requires examining and seriously re-thinking many things we were taught to vigilantly strive for in our Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) educations.

Things like "Correlation is bad, but causality is good" and "Do not jump to conclusions on scant evidence" are still solid advice everywhere inside science.

But when building Understanding systems, these established strategies and modes of thinking no longer work, because correlation discovery and handling

The excerpt you’ve shared from Monica Anderson’s “The Red Pill of Machine Learning” provides a compelling perspective on the dichotomy between reductionism and holism, especially as it applies to problem-solving and artificial intelligence.

Here are some practical takeaways from the text:

Epistemology:
Reductionism is about breaking down complex problems into simpler parts to understand and solve them.

Holism suggests looking at the entire system, considering the interdependencies and interactions within it.

Brains:
Reasoning involves conscious, deliberate thought processes to solve problems.
Understanding is more intuitive, often instantaneous, and doesn’t require conscious thought.

Problem Solving:
Plan it, then do it: This approach is methodical and works well for complex problems.

Just do it: This approach is more instinctive and is used for routine, everyday tasks.

Artificial Intelligence:
20th Century GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence): Relies on explicit programming and rules.

Machine Learning, Deep Neural Networks: Learn from data, creating systems that can “understand” and adapt without explicit programming.

Natural Language:
NLP (Natural Language Processing): Focuses on the structure and rules of language.

NLU (Natural Language Understanding): Aims to comprehend the meaning and intent behind language.

The text also highlights the importance of learning from experience and the ability to adapt based on that learning, both in humans and AI systems.

It points out the shift in AI from rule-based systems to those capable of learning and understanding, which mirrors the human ability to perform many tasks “without thinking about it.”

The reference to Daniel Kahneman’s “Thinking, Fast and Slow” further emphasizes the distinction between the fast, intuitive “System 1” and the slower, more deliberate “System 2” in our cognitive processes.

In the context of AI and ML, the text suggests a re-evaluation of traditional STEM principles, recognizing that in building systems capable of understanding, we must embrace strategies that differ from those used in pure scientific inquiry.

This includes acknowledging the role of correlation in machine learning, even when causality cannot be established.

Overall, the text encourages a nuanced understanding of how we approach problem-solving and the development of AI systems, recognizing the value of both reductionist and holistic perspectives.


You
Do you see similarities with Popper's philosophy?

Copilot
Yes, there are indeed similarities between Monica Anderson’s perspective on machine learning and Karl Popper’s philosophy:

Learning from Experience:
Both emphasize the importance of learning from experience.

Popper’s philosophy of science revolves around the idea of conjecture and refutation, where theories evolve through trial and error.

Similarly, Anderson discusses how machine learning systems “understand” through exposure to data and experience.
Problem-Solving Approaches:
Popper’s critical rationalism encourages the questioning of assumptions and the testing of hypotheses, akin to the “Plan it, then do it” approach.

Meanwhile, Anderson’s “Just do it” reflects Popper’s idea that not all knowledge comes from deliberate planning; some come from spontaneous problem-solving.
Reductionism vs.

Holism:
Popper acknowledged the value of reductionism in scientific inquiry but also recognized its limitations, advocating for a balance between reductionist and holistic approaches.

Anderson’s discussion on reductionism and holism in AI mirrors this balance, highlighting the need for both detailed models and an understanding of complex systems.

Understanding and Reasoning:
Popper’s distinction between the growth of knowledge through critical discussion (understanding) and the logical structure of scientific theories (reasoning) can be paralleled with Anderson’s distinction between understanding and reasoning in the context of AI.

The Role of Models:
Popper saw scientific models as necessary for the advancement of knowledge, even if they are never perfect or complete.

Anderson’s view on models in AI as tools for simplification and understanding aligns with this perspective.

System 1 and System 2:
The reference to Daniel Kahneman’s “System 1” and “System 2” in Anderson’s text resonates with Popper’s views on the two different modes of thinking—intuitive and rational—which are essential for different kinds of problem-solving.

In both Popper’s philosophy and Anderson’s view on AI, there is an appreciation for the complexity of knowledge and the recognition that different approaches are needed for different types of problems.

They both advocate for a dynamic, adaptable approach to understanding the world, whether it be through scientific inquiry or artificial intelligence.


You
There has been some investigation into prerational intelligence, such as animal cognition, and preliterate or prephonic infants.

The example I give is how a squirrel might hide nuts and seeds without having to retain a map of the territory or map, if it has searching and foraging behaviours.

It can follow wind or water or other animals or natural gradients in the environment, and so when it is hungry, it can look for places it would like to hide nuts now, by following the same natural environment.

Likewise a beaver might build a dam by chewing down trees for the sap and insects, and then floods and natural barriers in the environment might form a dam, similar to how q-tips or tooth-picks might clog up a sink or toilet.

The might make their dens watertight because the find the sound of rushing water annoying rather than because they are planning for the winter.

Copilot
Indeed, the behaviors you describe in animals—such as squirrels hiding nuts and beavers constructing dams—demonstrate a form of intelligence that predates complex reasoning or conscious planning.

Let’s explore these examples further:

Squirrel Foraging Behavior:
Squirrels exhibit remarkable foraging behaviors.

They don’t need explicit maps or conscious planning to hide nuts.

Instead, they rely on environmental cues and instincts.
Following natural gradients (wind, water, other animals) allows them to locate suitable hiding spots.

Their behavior is adaptive and efficient, even without explicit reasoning.
Beaver Dam Construction:
Beavers build dams using a combination of innate behaviors and environmental cues.

They don’t consciously plan the entire structure.
By chewing down trees and arranging them strategically, they create barriers that modify their environment.

The resulting dam helps them regulate water levels and create a suitable habitat.

Prerational Intelligence:
These examples illustrate what we might call “prerational intelligence.” It’s a form of problem-solving that relies on instincts, sensory input, and simple rules of thumb.

Prerational behaviors are efficient because they don’t require conscious deliberation.

Instead, they emerge from the interaction between an organism and its environment.

Holistic Understanding:
Both squirrels and beavers understand their environment holistically.

They respond to cues such as sound, smell, and water flow.
Their actions align with holistic understanding rather than explicit reasoning.

They “just do it” based on what works in their context.

Adaptation and Efficiency:
These behaviors demonstrate adaptation to specific ecological niches.

Squirrels and beavers have evolved to thrive in their environments.
Their actions are efficient because they don’t waste cognitive resources on unnecessary planning.

Human Analogies:
Analogously, humans also exhibit prerational behaviors.

Think of reflexes, automatic responses, and intuitive judgments.

While conscious reasoning is essential for complex tasks, many everyday actions rely on learned patterns and environmental cues.
In summary, the examples you’ve provided highlight the elegance of natural intelligence—whether in animals or humans—when it comes to solving practical problems.

Prerational behaviors are a testament to the efficiency of evolution and the power of adaptation.


You
Can you give a dialogue between Socrates and Parmenides discussing these issues?

Copilot
Certainly! Here’s an imaginative dialogue between Socrates and Parmenides discussing the nature of intelligence and understanding in animals:

Socrates: Greetings, Parmenides.

I have been pondering upon the intelligence of creatures other than man.

Tell me, do you believe that animals such as squirrels and beavers possess a form of knowledge?

Parmenides: It is an interesting question, Socrates.

Indeed, I observe that animals act with purpose and adaptability.

They seem to understand their environment in a way that is not reliant on reason as we know it.

Socrates: Precisely, my friend.

The squirrel hides its nuts not by the art of memory or explicit mapping, but by an innate understanding of its world.

It follows the wind, the water, and the natural gradients, as a navigator reads the stars, not by chart but by sight.

Parmenides: And what of the beaver, Socrates? Does it not construct its dam as if it were an engineer, yet without the calculations and plans that a man would use?

Socrates: Indeed, the beaver chews down trees and the dam arises not from planning but from action in harmony with nature.

It seems to me that these creatures act according to a different kind of intelligence, one that is immediate and direct.

Parmenides: You speak of what some might call ‘prerational intelligence’, Socrates.

It is the intelligence that precedes the rational mind.

It is the intelligence of life itself, acting through these creatures.

Socrates: A profound insight, Parmenides.

It appears that this prerational intelligence is guided by a form of understanding that is holistic.

The squirrel and the beaver do not dissect their world into parts as we do with our reason.

They see it whole and act within it as a part of it.

Parmenides: So it seems, Socrates.

Their actions are efficient because they are not burdened by the weight of conscious deliberation.

They act in accordance with the patterns of nature, which guide them unerringly.

Socrates: Then, my wise friend, could it be that we have much to learn from these humble creatures? Perhaps in our pursuit of knowledge, we have overlooked the wisdom that lies in the simple act of being in the world.

Parmenides: It is a thought worth contemplating, Socrates.

For in the simplicity of the squirrel’s foraging and the beaver’s building, there lies a harmony with the cosmos that we, with all our philosophy, can only aspire to understand.

This fictional dialogue captures the essence of the discussion on prerational intelligence and the intuitive understanding of animals, reflecting the philosophical perspectives of both Socrates and Parmenides.


You
Give the dialogue in the form of natural setting.

Perhaps they are walking and they pass a Stoa, where the meet Cleanthes.

Parmenides gives his argument, but Cleanthes gives the argument that the perfect machinery of nature and the heredity of traits such as wisdom, beauty, and temper being inherited from parent to child.

Copilot
In the cool of the Athenian morning, Socrates and Parmenides stroll through the groves, deep in philosophical discourse.

As they approach a Stoa, they encounter Cleanthes, who is contemplating the nature of existence.

Socrates: Ah, Cleanthes, we find you in thought as deep as the roots of these ancient trees.

Join us, for we discuss the intelligence of creatures and the workings of nature.

Cleanthes: I would be honored, Socrates.

What wisdom do you seek to unravel today?

Parmenides: We ponder upon the intelligence that guides the squirrel to hide its nuts and the beaver to build its dam.

I argue that they possess an understanding that is immediate and unreasoned, a form of intelligence that is one with nature itself.

Cleanthes: A fascinating observation, Parmenides.

Yet, consider the possibility that this intelligence is not separate from reason but is instead the perfect machinery of nature.

The traits you speak of—wisdom, beauty, temper—are inherited, passed from parent to child, as are the instincts of these creatures.

Socrates: So you suggest, Cleanthes, that the actions of these animals are not merely instinct but a form of inherited wisdom?

Cleanthes: Precisely, Socrates.

The squirrel does not deliberate where to hide its bounty; it acts according to the wisdom of its ancestors, encoded within its very being.

The beaver’s dam is not a product of conscious engineering but the result of generations of inherited knowledge.

Parmenides: But how does this hereditary wisdom arise? Is it not through the trial and error of countless generations, each adapting to the harmony of the cosmos?

Cleanthes: Indeed, it is the natural selection of traits beneficial for survival.

Yet, this process is not random; it is the divine craftsmanship of nature, molding each creature to fit its purpose.

Socrates: Then, we might say that what appears to us as prerational is, in fact, the culmination of nature’s rationality—a wisdom beyond our own, manifest in the simplicity of a squirrel’s foraging or a beaver’s construction.

Cleanthes: Well said, Socrates.

It is the unseen hand of nature that guides these creatures, and in their actions, we witness the legacy of the cosmos.

Parmenides: A legacy that we, too, share, though perhaps we have grown distant from it in our pursuit of explicit knowledge.

Socrates: Let us then learn from these creatures, to appreciate the wisdom that flows through all of nature, and to understand our place within this divine order.

With a nod of agreement, the philosophers continue their walk, each lost in thought, contemplating the intricate tapestry of life woven by the threads of wisdom passed down through the ages.


You
So I think that perceptual control theory shows that intelligent behaviour such as swarms and hives can act as an intelligent whole.

For example a flock might detect features of the environment that are not detectible by any individual alone

Copilot

You’re touching on a fascinating aspect of collective behavior, where groups of individuals, like swarms of bees or flocks of birds, exhibit intelligent behavior that transcends the capabilities of any single member.

This phenomenon is indeed in line with perceptual control theory, which suggests that behavior is a means of controlling perceptions to meet certain goals or needs.

In the case of a flock or swarm, each individual is responding to its own perception of the environment, but the collective behavior that emerges can solve complex problems or detect environmental features that are beyond the perception of any single individual.

This is often referred to as “emergent behavior” or “swarm intelligence.”

For example, a flock of birds might collectively adjust its flying pattern based on subtle environmental cues, such as changes in wind patterns or the presence of a predator, which might not be apparent to a single bird.

Similarly, a hive of bees can regulate the temperature of the hive through collective fanning behavior, something an individual bee cannot achieve alone.

This type of intelligence is a powerful example of how simple rules and interactions at the individual level can lead to complex and adaptive behavior at the group level.

It’s a principle that can be observed across many species and has inspired algorithms and approaches in robotics and artificial intelligence, such as particle swarm optimization and distributed problem-solving systems.

These systems aim to mimic the efficiency and adaptability of natural swarms, demonstrating the potential of collective intelligence in both natural and artificial systems.


You
So I think that polycomputation implies that various calculations are happening on different scales and timeframes, so that prerational intelligence might be like lot of different programs running on these different "substrates"

Copilot

Your concept of polycomputation aligns with the idea that intelligence, particularly prerational intelligence, operates across various scales and substrates.

In this view, intelligence is not a singular, monolithic process but rather a complex interplay of numerous “computations” or processes happening concurrently within an organism or system.

Here’s how this concept might apply to prerational intelligence:

Different Scales: Intelligence can manifest at different levels, from the cellular and neurological to the behavioral and social.

Each level has its own set of processes and “calculations” that contribute to the overall intelligent behavior of the organism.

Different Timeframes: Some processes are immediate, such as reflex actions, while others are more prolonged, like seasonal migration patterns in animals.

These processes operate on different temporal scales but are all part of the organism’s intelligence.

Various Substrates: Intelligence is not confined to the brain; it can be distributed throughout the body or even within a group.

For example, the immune system’s ability to identify and remember pathogens involves a form of intelligence, as does the collective decision-making of a swarm.

Programs Running on Substrates: If we think of these processes as “programs,” then prerational intelligence can be seen as a multitude of programs running on biological substrates.

These programs are honed by evolution and are specialized for the organism’s survival and reproduction.

This perspective on intelligence as polycomputational helps us appreciate the complexity and diversity of intelligent behaviors in nature.

It also provides a framework for understanding how simple rules and interactions can give rise to sophisticated and adaptive behaviors, both in natural organisms and artificial systems.

It’s a rich area of study that spans biology, psychology, computer science, and artificial intelligence.
