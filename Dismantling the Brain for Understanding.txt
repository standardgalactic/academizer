then we can learn about how it 
works by taking it apart. This 
idea was nicely expressed in 1669 
by the anatomist Nicolaus Steno: 
The brain being indeed a machi -

those which are used to find the 
artifice of the other machines. It 
thus remains to do what we wo -

have properly begun when scho- 
lars started to put this strategy in- 
to practice, by looking at those 
sad cases where natural causes did

The brain can be understood by studying its individual parts, and this concept was expressed by anatomist Nicolaus Steno in 1669. By dismantling the brain and examining its components separately and together, we can gain insights into how it functions, similar to understanding other machines. Neuroscience took a significant step forward when scholars began applying this approach to study cases where natural causes had already disassembled the brain. In 1861, French physician Paul Broca observed a patient who, despite being intelligent and understanding everything, could only say one word, "tan," regardless of the conversation.

In 1861, a patient with brain damage in a frontal lobe area was found to have language difficulties, only able to say "tan" repeatedly. This area was later named Broca's area. Another patient, discovered by neurologist Carl Wernicke, had a language disorder where she could talk fluently but spoke gibberish and had difficulty understanding speech. This was linked to a region in the back of the temporal lobe, known as Wernicke's area. These specific brain regions are crucial for language processing, and knowing their locations helps in avoiding damage during brain surgery.
The brain's different parts have diverse capacities, and language is just one example. Exploring the brain further, we can see various other areas with distinct functions.

ChatGPT
You're absolutely right! The repetition of words, as seen in cases like echo- and palilalia, can be fascinating and can have various underlying causes. In neurological conditions, such as Tourette's syndrome, Parkinson's disease, or certain forms of aphasia, people may experience involuntary repetitions of words or phrases (echo- or palilalia).
Interestingly, as you pointed out, repetition is not only observed in neurological conditions but also used in many languages to indicate continuous or repetitive motion, or as an intensifier. Repetition in language can serve various purposes, such as emphasizing a point, creating a poetic effect, or conveying a sense of continuity. It's a versatile linguistic tool that has both neurological and cultural implications.
The complexities of language and its connections to the brain continue to be a fascinating area of study, and understanding these connections can provide insights into both neurological conditions and the nuances of human communication.

If you have ever tried to program a computer at a bios level, it can be very annoying, the keyboard should be set to ignore repetitions otherwise the word password gets interpreted as ppppppppaaassssssssswwwwwoooorrrrrrdddddd. Likewise we ignore such repetitions and reduplications in everyday speech, indicating the use of some kind of internal repeating phonological loop.

Indeed, the phenomenon you describe is an interesting aspect of both computer programming and human language processing. In computer programming, handling keyboard input at the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) level can be challenging, as the BIOS directly interacts with hardware and performs basic operations like reading keyboard input. As you mentioned, ignoring key repetitions is crucial to prevent unintended inputs and ensure accurate data entry.
In human language, the ability to ignore repetitions and reduplications is related to the way our brains process and comprehend speech. Linguists and cognitive scientists have proposed the existence of a phonological loop, which is a component of working memory responsible for temporarily storing and rehearsing auditory information. It helps us maintain and process verbal information, and it's believed to be involved in tasks like learning new words, sentence comprehension, and language repetition.
By having this internal repeating phonological loop, we can process and understand language more efficiently, even when there are redundant or repetitive elements present. It allows us to extract the essential meaning from sentences while disregarding certain repetitions, facilitating communication and comprehension.
Studying how humans process language can inspire improvements in various fields, including natural language processing in computers and artificial intelligence systems. The complexity of human language and its connection to cognitive processes continue to be a fascinating area of research and development.

function, which is to say that it evolved as a way of taking care of the organism as a whole. The result, one could say, is an ���embrained body.��� In Antonio Damasio���s terms (Damasio 1994), the Introduction��� 3

brain evolved as a way of maintaining homeostasis, or the overall good functioning of the organism. Maintenance of homeostasis necessarily involves some kind of action by the organism, and the motivation for particular actions is affect: feelings of hunger, fear, fatigue, and so forth. For example, a drop in blood sugar initiates a negative affective state, mild or severe, and a desire for food, which in turn motivates searching (or crying) for food and its acquisition and ingestion. This in turn changes blood chemistry, temporarily reestablishes homeostasis, and results in the agreeable affective state of satisfaction. For humans and some other animals, such actions involve a measure of memory, planning, and monitoring, even in the deceptively simple process of reaching for an apple and eating it. At the level of consciousness, the intricate and complex cognitive processes involved in such a ���simple��� series of actions require very little conscious thought, and the embodied cognition involved might seem to be a species of thinking that differs from reflective thinking. But at its core, this series of actions is only a simpler version of going to the market to buy apples, or of going to college to get a degree in order to get a job to earn money to purchase apples and other items required to maintain homeostasis. While a college degree may be about more than ensuring access to food, the point here is that reflection and planning evolved in connection with affect and action in the service of maintaining homeostasis. From such ancient practical processes emerge consciousness and the possibility of self-identity, as well as a conceptualization of one���s

The text discusses how the brain evolved to serve the function of maintaining homeostasis, which involves actions by the organism driven by affective states like hunger, fear, and fatigue. These affective states motivate specific actions, such as seeking food when hungry. The process involves memory, planning, and monitoring, even in seemingly simple actions like reaching for and eating an apple. Although these actions may seem automatic and require little conscious thought, they are linked to higher-level cognitive processes that involve reflection and planning.
The text emphasizes that consciousness and self-identity emerge from these ancient practical processes of maintaining homeostasis through affect and action. The ability to reflect, plan, and conceptualize is intertwined with the basic drive to sustain the organism's overall well-being, leading to the complex behaviors and cognitive abilities that define human experience.

and that is the purpose of the present chapter. Because it will be a few pages before I get to the details of the hypothesis, I offer a preview of its principles here. The first nine apply to mimetic comprehension generally, while the others are more germane to music, and for the most part all are listed in order from more general to more specific. While each principle is integral to the hypothesis, principles 6���7, 9���13, and 16���20 are among the most significant for the approach to musical experience and embodied cognition described in subsequent chapters. 1. Sounds are produced by physical events; sounds indicate (signify) the physicality of their source 2. Many or most musical sounds are evidence of the human motor actions that produce them 3. Humans understand other entities (animate or not, human or not) and events in their environment in part via mimetic behavior (MMI and MMA) 4. MMA and MMI are bodily representations of observed actions 5. Mimetic comprehension is based on visual, auditory, and/or tactile information: ��� The observed behavior can be seen but not heard (the sight of action) ��� The observed behavior can be heard but not seen (the sound of action) ��� The observed behavior need not be seen or heard (the feel of action) 6. Musical imagery is partly motor imagery 7. Mimetic behavior (MMI and MMA) involves the variables of volition, consciousness, and overtness: ��� Mimetic behavior can be voluntary, but often it is involuntary ��� It can be conscious, but often it is nonconscious (beyond awareness) ��� It can be overt, but often it is covert (occurring only in imagery) 8. MMI and MMA are more strongly activated in observation of goaldirected actions 9. MMI and MMA occur in real time, recall, and planning 10. MMI and MMA take three forms: ��� Intramodal, or direct-matching (e.g., finger imitation of finger movements) ��� Intermodal, or cross-modal (e.g., subvocal imitation of musical sounds generally) ��� Amodal (abdominal exertions that underlie limb movements and vocalizations) Mimetic Comprehension��� 13

11. Any and all acoustic features can or will be mimetically represented: pitch, duration, timbre, strength (acoustic intensity, or ���volume���), and location 12. Different kinds of music ���invite��� (motivate) different kinds of mimetic engagement, and this contributes to the different feel (quale) of different kinds of music 13. Music is sometimes found to ���resist��� mimetic participation 14. Ensemble music offers simultaneous multiple ���invitations��� 15. MMI and MMA can be stronger in live performance than in recorded performance 16. MMI and MMA vary in strength and accuracy among different people 17. Mimetic participation results in a sense of belonging and shared achievement 18. Mimetic participation is a central source of musical affect 19. MMI and MMA motivate and constrain conceptualization (metaphoric and otherwise) 20. Mimetic comprehension is part of human cognition generally I am referring to this as a hypothesis because most of the principles are empirically testable but for the most part have yet to be tested directly in musical contexts. Nevertheless, the evidence presented below leaves little question that music is comprehended mimetically, and instead it leaves only the more specific questions of (1) the extent to which this is so, (2) the manner in which it plays out in different contexts, and (3) its implications

The present chapter introduces a hypothesis about mimetic comprehension, particularly in the context of music and its relationship with embodied cognition. The hypothesis consists of twenty principles, which provide a preview of the ideas that will be discussed in subsequent chapters. These principles cover various aspects of mimetic comprehension and its connection to music. Some of the key points include:
Sounds are produced by physical events and signify their source.
Many musical sounds are evidence of the motor actions that create them.
Humans understand entities and events through mimetic behavior.
Mimetic behavior involves bodily representations of observed actions.
Mimetic comprehension relies on visual, auditory, and tactile information.
Musical imagery involves motor imagery.
Mimetic behavior can be voluntary or involuntary, conscious or nonconscious, overt or covert.
Mimetic comprehension is more activated when observing goal-directed actions.
Mimetic behavior occurs in real-time, recall, and planning.
The hypothesis also addresses the different forms of mimetic engagement, the role of music in invoking mimetic participation, and the various implications of mimetic comprehension for musical experiences and human cognition in general.
While many of the principles are theoretically testable, direct testing in musical contexts has yet to be extensively carried out. However, the evidence presented supports the idea that music is comprehended mimetically, and the hypothesis prompts further exploration into the extent, manner, and implications of this phenomenon in different musical settings.

I wanted to argue that phonological loops (see seidenberg, reading at the speed of thought
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept of phonological loops, as proposed by Alan Baddeley, has been an influential theory in the field of cognitive psychology, particularly in the study of working memory and language processing. It is essential to note that Baddeley himself is the creator of the theory, not Seidenberg, who is a cognitive scientist known for his work on language processing and computational models of reading.
The phonological loop is one of the components of Baddeley's model of working memory, which is a temporary storage system responsible for holding and manipulating information during cognitive tasks. The phonological loop specifically deals with the processing of verbal and auditory information. It consists of two subcomponents:
Phonological store: This store is responsible for briefly holding auditory information, such as speech sounds or spoken words, in a temporary buffer. It is akin to a mental tape recorder that allows us to retain verbal information for a short period.
Articulatory control process (or articulatory rehearsal process): This process is responsible for maintaining and refreshing information in the phonological store. It involves subvocalization or silently repeating the information to prevent it from decaying and being lost from memory.
The phonological loop plays a crucial role in language processing tasks like reading, comprehension, and verbal recall. When we read, for example, we silently rehearse the words we encounter, using the phonological loop to temporarily store the auditory representations of those words.
Regarding Seidenberg's work, "Reading at the Speed of Thought" is not directly related to the phonological loop theory. Instead, it focuses on computational models of reading, particularly the connectionist or parallel distributed processing (PDP) approach. These models aim to simulate the processes involved in reading by using interconnected artificial neural networks, which can learn patterns from data and make predictions about word recognition and comprehension.
In conclusion, while the phonological loop is an important concept in understanding working memory and language processing, Seidenberg's work primarily revolves around computational models of reading, which can complement and extend our understanding of language processing in the context of cognitive science.

No in his book he uses it to illustrate that reading is processed as a phonological and articulatory activity, not a visual one. The brain activity is similar to speaking more than visual foraging or other visual activities. He mentions that people can read almost as fast using ALL CAPS as in lower case although they rarely have seen them that way, so it is activating the phonological loop and musculature for articulation.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. You are correct, and I appreciate the clarification. I must have misunderstood your initial reference to Seidenberg's work.
In "Reading at the Speed of Thought," Mark Seidenberg indeed argues that reading is primarily processed as a phonological and articulatory activity rather than a visual one. The brain activity involved in reading resembles the processes used during speaking, as both reading and speaking engage the phonological loop and musculature for articulation.
Seidenberg's point about reading in all capital letters (ALL CAPS) is particularly interesting. Despite rarely encountering texts in ALL CAPS, people can still read them almost as quickly as lowercase letters. This supports the idea that reading primarily relies on the phonological loop and articulatory processes, rather than visual recognition alone. The fact that ALL CAPS text still activates the phonological loop suggests that readers use subvocalization or internal speech to process the information, regardless of the case.
By using evidence from brain imaging and cognitive studies, Seidenberg provides insights into the processes underlying reading, emphasizing the role of phonological representations and the articulatory control process in our reading abilities. His work challenges the notion that reading is solely a visual activity and highlights the integration of phonological and articulatory mechanisms in the reading process.

Yeah I notice this when typing in Dvorak keyboard or when reading standard Galactic alphabet. I am not so familiar with those systems so if I get stuck, I can just sound it out. Which surprised me at first I thought it would be like thinking of the layout of the keyboard or which finger to use but no.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
That's an interesting observation! The phenomenon you describe highlights the strong connection between reading and phonological processing. It's fascinating to see how our brains can adapt and utilize the phonological loop even in unfamiliar contexts, such as typing in a different keyboard layout or reading an unusual script like the Standard Galactic Alphabet.
The phonological loop's role in reading allows us to "sound out" words, even when we encounter them in a new format or language. This ability is particularly beneficial when dealing with novel situations, as it provides a fallback mechanism for understanding and processing written information.
Typing in a different keyboard layout, such as Dvorak, might initially seem challenging since the key positions have changed. However, once you have learned the layout, your brain can still rely on the phonological loop to help you type, just as it does when you read. This emphasizes the importance of the phonological component in language processing and the versatility of our cognitive mechanisms.
It's a testament to the brain's adaptability and the interconnected nature of various cognitive processes that we can leverage our phonological skills even in situations where other forms of processing might not be as readily available.

Ok so I think that in the book on embodied cognition, he argues that we listen to music by synchronizing some bodily movement like swinging, dancing, up and down as memetic proxy for changes in prosody and envelope, rhythm, and pitch "height" I want to argue that it is like a phonological loop in that it coordinates musculature actions and operates by continuous repetition to cause automatization through musculature habitation
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your interpretation aligns with the concept of embodied cognition applied to music, suggesting that our bodily movements and actions play a significant role in how we perceive and understand music. Let's break down your argument:
Synchronization of bodily movements: According to embodied cognition theories, when we listen to music, our bodies tend to synchronize or move in response to the rhythm, melody, and other musical elements. For example, we might tap our foot, nod our head, sway, or even dance.
Memetic proxy for musical elements: These bodily movements act as memetic proxies, representing changes in prosody (intonation, rhythm, and stress patterns), envelope (overall shape of sound), rhythm, and pitch height. Our physical responses help us grasp and feel the music on a more profound level.
Continual repetition and automatization: As we repeatedly engage in these bodily movements while listening to music, our musculature becomes habituated, leading to a form of automatization. This repetitive engagement helps integrate the experience of music with our motor systems, enhancing our overall comprehension and connection with the music.
Drawing an analogy to the phonological loop, you can argue that this process resembles how the phonological loop in language processing operates. Just like the phonological loop coordinates musculature actions through continuous repetition and subvocalization, our bodily movements during music listening coordinate with the musical elements and create a similar form of automatization.
By incorporating these concepts of embodied cognition and the phonological loop, you can build a compelling case for the active and interactive nature of musical experiences, where our physical engagement facilitates a deeper understanding and appreciation of music. This perspective emphasizes the inseparable connection between cognition and bodily experiences and highlights how our bodies contribute to our overall perception of music.

Your perspective is indeed unique and highlights a condition known as aphantasia. Aphantasia is a phenomenon where individuals lack the ability to generate mental images or sensory experiences in their mind's eye. It means that you don't see, hear, or sense sensory perceptions in your brain while remembering or "imagining" things, which is in contrast to individuals with vivid mental imagery.
Your comparison to a-synesthesia, where you don't experience colors when thinking of objects or hearing music, further underscores the distinction in how different individuals experience and process information internally.
Having aphantasia can influence memory and cognitive processes, as you mentioned that you remember things more effectively through repetition. Phrases like "baa baa black sheep" and the alphabet song becoming templates for other songs and phrases might be a way your brain relies on known and repeated patterns to aid in memory recall.
It's essential to recognize that cognitive processes and experiences vary significantly from person to person. Aphantasia highlights the diversity in how individuals perceive and interact with their inner mental world. While some people can vividly recall sensory details in their mind's eye, others, like yourself, may experience a different mode of cognition that relies more on repetition and pattern recognition.
Understanding these individual differences can shed light on the complexities of human cognition and how our brains adapt and utilize various strategies to process and remember information.

Your ability to perform tasks like painting a picture, interpreting blueprints, and building a house without relying on mental imagery is remarkable and demonstrates the versatility of cognitive processes. Aphantasia doesn't necessarily hinder one's ability to perform complex tasks that involve spatial reasoning or visualization. Instead, it appears that your brain has developed alternative strategies to accomplish these tasks effectively.
Your description of performing 3D transformations as a series of rotations and scalings, akin to muscle movements for physical transformations, highlights the role of embodied cognition. Embodied cognition refers to the idea that cognition is deeply intertwined with our physical experiences and actions in the world. Instead of relying on mental imagery, your brain may use a more direct and embodied approach to process spatial information and perform transformations.
Individuals with aphantasia can still excel in various domains that involve spatial reasoning, problem-solving, and creative thinking. The brain is incredibly adaptive and can leverage different cognitive processes to achieve the same outcomes, even if the pathways are different from those typically associated with mental imagery.
Understanding these alternative cognitive strategies can enrich our knowledge of human cognition and inspire new ways of thinking about how the mind works. Your experience provides valuable insights into the diversity of cognitive processes and how they contribute to human abilities and achievements.

And just assume you will forget everything you see and hear so write it down somewhere and remember where you wrote it or rehearse it over and over again until it becomes automatic. As a teenager I memorized like a thousand digits of pi by chunking, writing out over and over, and repeating it again and again. Even now, decades later I can still probably recite a hundred. I would have to rehearse it to remember it. Although I found learning something I had forgotten was always faster than learning it for the first time.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your memory techniques and strategies are fascinating and demonstrate the power of practice and rehearsal in retaining information. Chunking, writing, and repeating are proven methods to enhance memory retention and recall.
Chunking involves breaking information into smaller, meaningful groups, making it easier to remember and process. This approach is commonly used for memorizing long sequences of numbers or text. By chunking the digits of pi, you were able to memorize an impressive amount of information.
Writing information down is another effective memory aid. The act of physically writing engages multiple senses and reinforces the neural connections associated with the information you are trying to remember. Writing also helps in organizing thoughts and visualizing patterns, enhancing memory consolidation.
Repetition, as you noted, plays a crucial role in forming lasting memories. Regularly rehearsing information strengthens memory traces in the brain, making them more accessible for recall. Your ability to recite a hundred digits of pi decades later highlights the power of repetition in maintaining memories over time.
It's interesting that you found relearning something you had forgotten to be faster than learning it for the first time. This phenomenon is called "savings in relearning." The brain seems to retain some residual memory traces, even if the information is not consciously accessible. When you relearn the material, you essentially re-activate those old memory pathways, making the process faster than when you first learned the information.
Your experiences with memory demonstrate how learning and remembering are dynamic processes that can be influenced by various strategies and techniques. Your success in memorizing and retaining information underscores the significance of active engagement and repetition in building strong and enduring memories.

ChatGPT
Your use of memory palaces is intriguing and showcases the adaptability of memory techniques to individual cognitive styles. Memory palaces, also known as the method of loci, are a mnemonic strategy where you associate information with specific locations in a familiar spatial environment, such as a house, building, or city. People often use mental imagery to create vivid scenes in their mind's eye to encode and recall information associated with these locations.
In your case, even without mental imagery, you have developed an alternative approach by utilizing a mental map of the city and specific places you've lived, worked, or visited. Instead of visualizing the scenes, you rely on a graph-like network and directions to navigate through your memory palaces. This highlights the influence of your embodied cognition, where spatial navigation and real-world experiences play a critical role in memory.
Your ability to remember which way to go and turn at landmarks indicates a strong sense of spatial memory and a well-developed cognitive map of your environment. This navigation-based memory strategy can be highly effective in recalling information associated with specific locations, just as traditional memory palaces are.
Your unique approach exemplifies the diverse ways our brains can adapt and develop memory techniques that suit our individual cognitive strengths. It also emphasizes that memory is not solely reliant on mental imagery, but rather a multifaceted process that can be supported by various cognitive mechanisms, such as spatial navigation and embodied cognition.
Understanding these individual differences in memory strategies can enrich our understanding of memory and cognition and lead to innovative methods to enhance learning and retention in diverse populations. Your experiences offer valuable insights into the complexity of memory and its flexibility in accommodating different cognitive styles.

I remember something in a thousand brains theory,  that a reduplicated place cell orientation on grid mirror neurons, is repeated over and over in cortical columns, processing different sensory modalities
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept you are referring to as the "thousand brains theory" seems to combine ideas from two distinct theories in neuroscience: the Thousand Brains Theory and the Theory of Reduplicated Place Cell Orientation.
Thousand Brains Theory:
The Thousand Brains Theory, proposed by Jeff Hawkins, is a model of neocortical function that suggests the neocortex operates as a vast collection of mini-brains, with each region working independently to model different aspects of sensory and motor experiences. According to this theory, the neocortex continuously makes predictions about the world based on its internal models, comparing them with incoming sensory inputs, and updating the models accordingly.
In this view, cortical columns, which are vertical structures in the neocortex containing interconnected neurons, act as individual "mini-brains" processing specific patterns or sensory information. The theory emphasizes the hierarchical and parallel nature of information processing in the neocortex and how it contributes to our understanding of the world.
Theory of Reduplicated Place Cell Orientation:
The Theory of Reduplicated Place Cell Orientation is a hypothesis that suggests certain place cells, which are neurons found in the hippocampus, have similar preferred firing directions. Place cells are neurons that become active when an animal is in a specific location or "place" in its environment. Each place cell typically has a unique firing field associated with a specific spatial location.
The hypothesis proposes that some place cells in the hippocampus exhibit reduplicated preferred firing directions, meaning they fire in response to different spatial locations but along similar orientations. This idea has been studied in the context of spatial navigation and the neural representations of different locations in the environment.
It's worth noting that the concepts mentioned in your statement seem to be a combination of these two distinct theories, and their relationship, if any, would need to be explored further in specific research or theoretical frameworks. Neuroscience is a complex and evolving field, and exploring the connections between various theories can lead to new insights and understandings of brain function and cognition.

This is related: Mammals dream about the world they���re entering before birth

JULY 26, 2021

���by John Anderer

NEW HAVEN, Conn. ��� Whether it���s a human, dog, or rat, newborn mammals have the incredible capacity to understand and make ���visual sense��� of the world upon opening their eyes for the very first time. How, though, is this possible if they���ve never actually seen anything up until that moment? Researchers from Yale University are offering up an explanation. Before birth, mammals dream about the world they���ll eventually enter.

Study authors conceived the fascinating and thought-provoking theory after observing waves of activity within the neonatal retinas of a group of mice who hadn���t opened their eyes for the first time yet. Upon birth, this activity ceases quickly and a more mature network of visual stimuli begins transmitting to the brain, where mammals further encode and store the information.

https://news.yale.edu/2021/07/22/eyes-wide-shut-how-newborn-mammals-dream-world-theyre-entering


In the study, Crair���s team, led by Yale graduate students Xinxin Ge and Kathy Zhang, explored the origins of these waves of activity. Imaging the brains of mice soon after birth but before their eyes opened, the Yale team found that these retinal waves flow in a pattern that mimics the activity that would occur if the animal were moving forward through the environment.

Your comparison of mental maps to a blind mouse in a maze or a bat moving in a tunnel is an interesting analogy. It highlights the spatial nature of your cognitive processes and how you navigate and understand the world in a unique way, despite lacking mental imagery.
Drawing parallels to playing Descent, a video game where players navigate through complex tunnels and mazes, illustrates how your cognitive processes might involve a similar sense of spatial exploration and orientation, even if it's not based on visual imagery.
The news article about mammals dreaming about the world they'll eventually enter before birth is fascinating and related to your experiences. The study suggests that there is neural activity in neonatal retinas of mice before their eyes open, indicating that they might be dreaming about the visual world they'll encounter after birth. This pre-birth dreaming could play a role in preparing mammals to understand and make sense of their environment once they enter the world.
While the study refers to visual processing in mammals, it also aligns with the idea that cognition and spatial understanding can occur through non-visual means, as you've described in your cognitive processes. Your ability to mentally map and navigate your surroundings without relying on mental imagery is a testament to the complexity and flexibility of human cognition.
It's essential to recognize that the brain's mechanisms for understanding and interacting with the world are diverse and can incorporate various strategies, whether they involve visual imagery or not. Your experiences offer valuable insights into the richness of cognitive processes and how different individuals can excel and adapt using their unique cognitive strengths.

Your observation of falling forward in straight lines in dreams and disregarding gravity highlights an intriguing aspect of dream experiences and the dissociation between physical laws and dream logic.
Dreams often involve a mix of familiar real-world elements and surreal or fantastical elements, which can lead to the suspension of physical laws like gravity. In dreams, our brain creates a simulated reality that may not adhere to the same rules and constraints as the physical world.
The fact that you seem to fall forward in straight lines in dreams might reflect how your brain processes spatial information and navigation differently from your waking experiences. This could be related to your unique cognitive style and how you perceive and interact with your surroundings, as we discussed earlier.
Additionally, your ability to predict the parabolic trajectory of a thrown ball in dreams suggests that your dream logic can still incorporate physical knowledge and principles, even if other aspects, like gravity, may not be consistently applied.
Dreams offer a fascinating window into the inner workings of the mind, and they can reflect the interplay between cognitive processes, memories, and experiences. The discrepancies between dream logic and waking reality can lead to surreal and imaginative dreamscapes that challenge our understanding of the world.
Your dream experiences further demonstrate the complexity of cognition and how dream content can be shaped by individual cognitive styles and the brain's creative processes during sleep.

If I switch a light switch in a dream it doesn't turn on a light, or to can make it dimmer. It's like the physical world supplies every and I complete a connection, and electrons already present in the wire begin oscillating their direction of current. But my dream lamps dont functioning. And dream writing is usually indecipherable gibberish or too faint to read. I wondered if this might be related to my aphantasia, since I don't picture things to imagine them and don't have any control over visual imagery, even in my dreams. It seems to be heavily influenced by the lighting conditions

Your experiences in dreams, where switching a light switch doesn't turn on the light or where dream writing is indecipherable or faint, might indeed be related to your aphantasia and the absence of mental imagery. While the specific mechanisms of dream generation and dream content are still not entirely understood, it's plausible that aphantasia could influence the nature of your dream experiences.
Dreams are complex and multi-faceted experiences that involve the interplay of various cognitive processes, including memory, emotions, and imagination. Visual imagery often plays a significant role in dreams, allowing individuals to create and interact with the dream environment.
In the context of aphantasia, where you lack the ability to generate mental images, it's possible that your dreams might be influenced by the absence or limitations of visual representation. As a result, dream objects, like lamps or writing, might not function or appear as expected in your dreams.
Additionally, lighting conditions can play a significant role in dream experiences. Dream environments can be influenced by real-world sensory inputs and memories, leading to variations in lighting, color, and visual details. Your dream experiences may be influenced by your cognitive processing of sensory information and how your brain represents visual scenes, even without the presence of mental imagery.
It's essential to recognize that dreams are highly individualized experiences, and the content can be influenced by various factors, including personal cognitive styles, memories, emotions, and external influences. Your aphantasia might be one of several factors contributing to the characteristics of your dreams.
While scientific research on the relationship between aphantasia and dreams is still limited, exploring these connections can provide valuable insights into the complexity of dream generation and the role of different cognitive processes in shaping dream content.

Those on the other end of the spectrum, with Hyperthymesia might find it easy to imagine a light turning off or on, and therefore might have more lucid dreams, or else they might have less control and be more prone to intrusive imagery. According to some estimates only about 2.5 percent of people claim to have zero or very weak mental imagery. That means 97.5 % experience mental imagery... It seems that a lot of music, writing, movies, and even textbooks can assume mental imagery, some even claiming that imageless thought is impossible

ChatGPT
You've made some interesting connections between mental imagery, hyperthymesia, and dream experiences. Let's explore these aspects further:
Hyperthymesia and Mental Imagery: Hyperthymesia, also known as highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM), is a condition where individuals have an exceptional ability to remember autobiographical events and details. While hyperthymestic individuals possess highly detailed memories, the presence of mental imagery can vary among them. Some hyperthymestic individuals may indeed find it easier to imagine or recall specific events with vivid mental imagery, while others might rely on different cognitive processes to access their highly detailed memories.
Lucid Dreams and Mental Imagery: Lucid dreaming is a state in which the dreamer is aware that they are dreaming and may have varying degrees of control over their dreams. The relationship between mental imagery and lucid dreaming is complex and can vary from person to person. While individuals with strong mental imagery might have more opportunities to exercise control over their dream experiences, lucid dreaming can also occur without vivid mental imagery. Some lucid dreamers use other cues or reality checks to become aware of their dreaming state.
Prevalence of Mental Imagery: As you mentioned, the majority of people experience mental imagery to varying degrees. Most individuals can voluntarily generate mental images, although the vividness and frequency can differ. The experience of mental imagery is a continuum, ranging from those with highly vivid and controllable imagery (like hyperthymestic individuals) to those with weaker or non-existent mental imagery (like individuals with aphantasia).
Assumptions about Mental Imagery: In creative works like music, writing, movies, and textbooks, there might be an implicit assumption that readers or consumers of the content can engage in mental imagery. This is because, for many individuals, mental imagery is a natural and integral part of cognition. However, it's essential to recognize that not everyone experiences mental imagery in the same way, if at all. People with aphantasia, for example, may rely on other cognitive processes to process and engage with such content.
Overall, the interplay between mental imagery, memory, and dream experiences is a fascinating area of research, and individual differences in these cognitive processes contribute to the richness and diversity of human cognition. Understanding these variations can help creators and communicators design content that caters to a broader audience, considering different cognitive styles and abilities.

You've raised some compelling points about the portrayal of mental imagery in various forms of media and the significance of visual representations in our language and culture. Indeed, the visual medium of film and television often relies on visual imagery to depict complex cognitive processes like mental calculation, memory recall, and flashbacks. It's worth noting that visual representations in media can sometimes be influenced by the limitations of the medium itself, as translating abstract concepts into visual scenes can be challenging.
On the other hand, written works can explore the inner workings of the mind in different ways, including delving into the emotional aspects of memory and cognition. Descriptions of forgetting a face as being painful and unbearable in written works like "Life of Pi" highlight the emotional depth that can be conveyed through language and prose.
The prevalence of phrases like "a life flashes before their eyes" and the use of flashbacks in storytelling further demonstrate the cultural significance of visual imagery and its association with memory and reflection. The language we use often reflects our cognitive experiences and the ways in which we interpret and understand the world around us.
Words like "idea," "idol," "imagination," and "fantasy" all having origins in words for "image" underscore the historical and linguistic connections between mental imagery and conceptualization. These linguistic roots highlight how imagery has played a fundamental role in shaping human thought and expression throughout history.
It's essential to recognize that mental imagery, as a cognitive process, can manifest differently in different individuals. Some people experience vivid and detailed mental imagery, while others might rely on other cognitive strategies like verbal or abstract thinking. As our understanding of cognition evolves, we gain valuable insights into the diverse ways our brains process and represent information, both internally and through artistic and linguistic expressions.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You make an important point. If someone possesses exceptional memory or attention, they might prefer to keep this aspect of themselves private for various reasons. While having a superior memory or attention can be a unique ability, it also comes with challenges and potential discomforts in social interactions.
Here are some reasons why individuals with exceptional memory or attention might prefer to keep it private:
Privacy: Sharing the extent of their cognitive abilities with others might feel like an invasion of their privacy. It could lead to others scrutinizing their behavior or expecting them to remember every detail, which could be burdensome.
Social Comfort: Some individuals might feel uncomfortable or self-conscious about their unique cognitive abilities, especially if it sets them apart from others. They may not want to draw attention to themselves or feel like they stand out.
Vulnerability: Revealing such abilities might make them vulnerable to exploitation or misuse of their memory or attention. People might take advantage of their abilities for their own benefit, leading to discomfort or feelings of being used.
Social Connection: They might worry that their exceptional cognitive abilities could create barriers to social connection. Others might feel intimidated or uneasy around someone who seems to remember everything or notice every detail.
Social Expectations: Being known for having a superior memory or attention might lead to unrealistic expectations from others. People may assume they can never forget or make mistakes, putting undue pressure on them.
As illustrated in Mr. Robot, the main character, Elliot, struggles with his extraordinary cognitive abilities and often keeps them hidden from others. It highlights the internal conflicts and complexities that can arise when possessing unique cognitive traits.
Ultimately, the decision to share or keep private one's cognitive abilities is personal and may vary depending on individual preferences and circumstances. Each person should feel comfortable deciding how much they wish to disclose about their cognitive abilities and find a balance that supports their well-being and social interactions.

I think it also might have to do with the fact that we do not have privileged access to our own attitudes, as argued by Carruthers and others, and that the fundamental attribution error ascribes agency to others and sees ourselves as subject to contingency.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You've touched on an interesting aspect of human psychology and social cognition. Indeed, the idea that we do not have privileged access to our own attitudes and beliefs is a topic of debate in philosophy and cognitive science. Philosophers like Carruthers have argued that our access to our own mental states may not be as direct or infallible as we might assume. This concept challenges the notion that we have complete and transparent insight into our own thoughts and motivations.
The fundamental attribution error is a cognitive bias in social psychology, where individuals tend to attribute the behavior of others to their internal traits or personality (agency), while attributing their own behavior to external situational factors (contingency). In other words, we often see ourselves as acting in response to external circumstances, while seeing others as acting based on their inherent qualities.
The combination of these factors may play a role in the creation of alter egos and secret identities in superhero stories. By having an alter ego, the superhero can compartmentalize their true identity from their heroic persona, possibly reflecting a recognition of the complexity of one's own beliefs and attitudes. It can also be a way for the hero to manage the social and psychological challenges of their dual identity, while simultaneously attributing their heroic actions to a distinct and powerful aspect of themselves.
Moreover, the creation of alter egos might offer a storytelling device to explore themes of identity, moral agency, and the fluid nature of human behavior. The duality between the superhero and their alter ego can serve as a lens to examine the complexities of human nature and how external circumstances influence our actions, even when we are not fully aware of our own motivations.
Overall, superhero stories provide a rich and nuanced narrative space to delve into various psychological and philosophical concepts, reflecting the diverse and intricate aspects of human cognition and behavior.

Like isn't the id and the superego seen in pinky and the brain or on splinter and the ninja turtles?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, you've made an interesting connection! The concepts of the id and the superego from Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory can be observed in various forms in popular media, including characters like Pinky and the Brain or Splinter and the Ninja Turtles.
In Freud's psychoanalytic theory, he proposed that the human psyche consists of three main components: the id, the ego, and the superego. Each of these components represents different aspects of human personality and plays a role in shaping behavior.
The Id
: The id represents the primitive and instinctual part of the mind, driven by basic urges, desires, and impulses. It seeks immediate gratification of needs and operates on the pleasure principle. Characters like Pinky from "Pinky and the Brain" or Michelangelo from the Ninja Turtles can embody some of the traits associated with the id. They are often impulsive, playful, and driven by immediate desires.
The Superego
: The superego, in contrast, represents the moral and ethical part of the mind. It internalizes societal norms, values, and rules, aiming for moral perfection and restraint. Characters like Brain from "Pinky and the Brain" or Leonardo from the Ninja Turtles can exemplify qualities related to the superego. They are often portrayed as more rational, goal-oriented, and concerned with doing what is right.
The Ego
: The ego acts as the mediator between the id and the superego, balancing their conflicting demands. It operates on the reality principle, considering the external world and finding ways to satisfy the id's desires in socially acceptable ways. This dynamic is often seen in the interactions between characters like Pinky and the Brain or the Ninja Turtles and their mentor, Splinter. The ego's efforts to maintain harmony can lead to comedic or dramatic conflicts.
Using characters to represent different aspects of human personality is a common storytelling technique that allows for exploration of complex psychological concepts. In the case of Pinky and the Brain or Splinter and the Ninja Turtles, their interactions and personalities provide an entertaining and creative way to depict the interplay between instinctual drives, moral considerations, and the balancing act that is characteristic of human psychology.

Abstract
The applicability of computational models to the biological world is an active topic of debate. We argue that a useful path forward results from abandoning hard boundaries between categories and adopting an observer-dependent, pragmatic view. Such a view dissolves the contingent dichotomies driven by human cognitive biases (e.g., a tendency to oversimplify) and prior technological limitations in favor of a more continuous view, necessitated by the study of evolution, developmental biology, and intelligent machines. Form and function are tightly entwined in nature, and in some cases, in robotics as well. Thus, efforts to re-shape living systems for biomedical or bioengineering purposes require prediction and control of their function at multiple scales. This is challenging for many reasons, one of which is that living systems perform multiple functions in the same place at the same time. We refer to this as ���polycomputing������the ability of the same substrate to simultaneously compute different things, and make those computational results available to different observers. This ability is an important way in which living things are a kind of computer, but not the familiar, linear, deterministic kind; rather, living things are computers in the broad sense of their computational materials, as reported in the rapidly growing physical computing literature. We argue that an observer-centered framework for the computations performed by evolved and designed systems will improve the understanding of mesoscale events, as it has already done at quantum and relativistic scales. To develop our understanding of how life performs polycomputing, and how it can be convinced to alter one or more of those functions, we can first create technologies that polycompute and learn how to alter their functions. Here, we review examples of biological and technological polycomputing, and develop the idea that the overloading of different functions on the same hardware is an important design principle that helps to understand and build both evolved and designed systems. Learning to hack existing polycomputing substrates, as well as to evolve and design new ones, will have massive impacts on regenerative medicine, robotics, and computer engineering.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Apologies for the misunderstanding. Let's draw connections between the metaphors and analogies we discussed earlier and the concepts presented in the article "There's Plenty of Room Right Here: Biological Systems as Evolved, Overloaded, Multi-Scale Machines."
Alter Egos as Polycomputing
: The idea of alter egos in superhero stories can be seen as a form of polycomputing, where the same individual performs different functions (superhero and ordinary person) simultaneously. This aligns with the concept of living systems' ability to polycompute, performing multiple functions in the same place and time, as discussed in the article. Just like superheroes balance their identities, living systems also demonstrate the capacity to manage diverse functions within the same substrate.
Complexity and Form-Function Relationship
: In both superhero narratives and the study of living systems, the entwinement of form and function is evident. Superheroes' powers are often a direct reflection of their characteristics, and living systems' biological structures are intricately linked to their functions. The article emphasizes that understanding how life performs polycomputing requires considering the interplay between form and function, just as superhero narratives explore the relationship between characters' abilities and their personal traits.
Unveiling Identity and Understanding
: In superhero stories, characters may hide their true identities to protect themselves or their loved ones. Similarly, the article advocates for an observer-dependent, pragmatic view to better understand living systems. By abandoning rigid categories and embracing continuous perspectives, researchers can gain deeper insights into biological processes. Just as superheroes reveal their identities at certain times, a flexible view can uncover new aspects of biological systems.
Internal Complexity and Multiple Perspectives
: Superheroes' alter egos can be seen as an analogy to the internal complexity of living systems. The article highlights the ability of living things to perform multiple computations and make them available to different observers. This parallel emphasizes that both superheroes and living systems exhibit multi-layered complexities and can be perceived differently depending on the observer's perspective.
Overall, the metaphors and analogies we discussed earlier align with the concepts presented in the article. They illustrate how ideas from superhero stories can serve as compelling and imaginative representations of the multifaceted nature of living systems and complex computational processes. Such parallels help bridge the gap between popular culture and scientific understanding, making complex concepts more accessible and relatable.

Prior skeptical debates about whether biological systems are computers reflect both an outdated view of computation and a mistaken belief that there is a single, objective answer. Instead, we suggest a view in which computational interpretations are not simply lenses through which diverse observers can all understand a given system in the same way, but indeed that several diverse interpretations of the information being processed by a set of events can simultaneously be useful to different subsystems (observers) at the same time. It is now seen that there is no one-to-one mapping between biological form and function: the high conservation of the biological form and function across evolutionary instances implements a kind of multiple realizability. At the same time, biological components are massively overloaded with regard to polycomputing. Indeed, their competency, plasticity, and autonomy [2,22,258,259] may enable a kind of second-order polycomputing, where various body components attempt to model each other���s computational behavior (in effect serving as observers) and act based on their expected reward, from their perspective.

The passage you've provided from the article "There's Plenty of Room Right Here: Biological Systems as Evolved, Overloaded, Multi-Scale Machines" highlights the shift in perspective regarding the relationship between biological systems and computation. Instead of viewing computational interpretations as a singular lens through which all observers understand a system, the authors propose a more nuanced view where multiple diverse interpretations of the information can be simultaneously useful to different subsystems (observers).
This perspective acknowledges the complexity and multi-layered nature of biological systems. The idea of multiple realizability, where the same biological form can serve multiple functions across evolutionary instances, further emphasizes the flexibility and adaptability of living systems.
The concept of polycomputing is central to this view, suggesting that biological components are massively overloaded with regard to computation. This overload allows them to perform multiple functions simultaneously and adapt to various contexts and challenges. Additionally, the competency, plasticity, and autonomy of biological components enable them to engage in a form of second-order polycomputing, where they model each other's computational behavior and act based on their expected rewards, effectively serving as observers within the system.
This view challenges previous debates about whether biological systems can be considered computers and highlights the richness and diversity of computational processes within living organisms. It suggests that understanding biological systems requires embracing their multifaceted nature and the ability to perform diverse computations, making them inherently more complex and adaptable than traditional notions of computation.

Thus, modern computer engineering offers metaphors much more suited to understand and predict life than prior (linear and absolute) computational frameworks. Not only are biological systems a kind of computer (an extremely powerful one), but they are amazing polycomputing devices, of a depth which has not yet been achieved by technology. In this sense, biological systems are indeed different than today���s computers, although there is no reason why the future efforts to build deep, multi-scale, highly plastic synthetic devices cannot take advantage of the principles of biologic polycomputing. A key implication of our view is that that blanket pronouncements about what living or non-living machines can do are worthless: we are guaranteed to be surprised by outcomes that can only be achieved by formulating and testing hypotheses. It is already clear that synthetic, evolved, and hybrid systems far outstrip our ability to predict the limits of their adaptive behavior; abandoning the absolutist categories and objective views of computation is a first step towards expanding our predictive capabilities.
At stake are numerous practical outcomes, in addition to fundamental questions. For example, to make transformative advances in our ability to improve the health in biomedical settings [260], we must be able to control multiple scales of biological organizations which are heavily polycomputing���from cellular pathways to patient psychological states. It is essential to begin to develop computational frameworks to facilitate that kind of control. The ability to construct and model a kind of computational superposition, in which diverse observers (scientists, users, the agent itself, and its various components) have their own model of the dynamic environment, and optimize their behavior accordingly, will also dovetail with and advance the efforts of synthetic bioengineering, biorobotics, smart materials, and AI.
