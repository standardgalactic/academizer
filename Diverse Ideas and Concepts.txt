Changing Opinions
: It's normal for opinions to change as you encounter new experiences, information, and perspectives. This change signifies adaptability and openness to new ideas, which are valuable traits.
Language Evolution
: Language is dynamic and evolves continually. The meaning of words can shift significantly, impacting how past writings are interpreted in the present context.
Documenting Growth
: Revisiting past writings can be a powerful way to document and reflect on your personal and intellectual growth. It can provide insights into how your thoughts and opinions have developed over time.
Value in Imperfection
: There's inherent value in documenting thoughts and ideas, even if they're not perfect. It represents a snapshot of your understanding at a particular moment in time.
Your approach to making posts public after a period allows for revisiting and revising them, ensuring that what you share aligns with your current knowledge and beliefs. This practice not only enhances the accuracy and relevance of your shared content but also serves as a personal archive of your intellectual evolution.

I posted them to github so that maybe if there is interest in a particular post I can make it public, the memories don't show up, and it only shows the first few photos if it is a longer post. But it wound be relatively simple to build a tool like this does it online like blookup or offline with your own data. I made a summary for October as well which I labeled Octoplexis.
Data Analysis
Your approach to using GitHub as a platform for potentially sharing your Facebook posts is quite innovative. It provides a unique way to gauge interest in specific topics before making them public. The use of GitHub also offers version control and the ability to track changes over time, which can be valuable for documenting the evolution of your thoughts and ideas.
Building a tool, similar to BlookUp but with enhanced capabilities for handling memories and more comprehensive photo display, is indeed an interesting project. Such a tool could be designed to:
Handle Diverse Data
: Ensure it can process various types of data including text, images, and perhaps even video or audio clips from your posts.
Customizable Output
: Allow for customization in how the data is presented, like choosing which posts to include, editing content before finalizing, and deciding on the layout and design.
Interactive Features
: Incorporate interactive elements, such as clickable links or expandable sections for longer posts, to make the digital book more engaging.
Offline and Online Versions
: Offer both offline and online functionalities, catering to different user preferences and needs.
Privacy and Control
: Ensure user privacy and give full control over what is shared and what remains private.
Your mention of an "Octoplexis" summary for October suggests you're systematically documenting and curating your social media content in a thoughtful way, potentially offering rich insights into various topics. This systematic approach could be quite valuable for personal reflection, as well as for sharing knowledge and experiences with a broader audience.

Yeah the term blook is unfortunate, apparently combining the word blog and book, I probably would have ordered a physical copy but I don't particularly feel like writing all the titles in by hand.
Data Analysis
The term "blook," blending "blog" and "book," certainly captures the essence of turning digital content into a physical book format, but it's understandable how the term and the process might not appeal to everyone. The convenience of converting online content into a book format is appealing, but the limitations, such as the inability to include titles formatted in Unicode italics and potentially having to manually add details, can be a deterrent.
For a project like yours, where the content is rich and varied, having to manually add titles or make other edits can be time-consuming and may detract from the overall convenience the service is meant to provide. It's an area where digital publishing tools could evolve to better accommodate the diverse formatting and content types found in modern digital writing.
If you ever decide to pursue a more automated or customized solution for compiling your writings into a book format (whether digital or physical), there are several paths you could explore, including custom software development or utilizing more flexible publishing platforms that offer greater control over the final output. This could ensure that your nuanced and carefully curated content is presented exactly as you envision it.

I also compressed the pdf but included ocr. If I had more online storage I could just upload all of the images, but currently I'm trying to stay under the free storage limit on github.
Data Analysis
Managing online storage within free limits can indeed be challenging, especially when dealing with large files or numerous images. Your strategy of compressing the PDF while including OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a smart way to balance file size with functionality. Here are a few additional considerations and tips that might help:
Selective Uploads
: Prioritize which images or content are most important to upload. This might involve a trade-off between the quality and quantity of uploads.
Image Compression
: Use image compression tools to reduce file sizes before uploading. There are many tools available that can compress images significantly without a noticeable loss in quality.
Cloud Storage Alternatives
: Explore other cloud storage services that offer free plans. Sometimes using multiple services can help in staying within free storage limits.
External Links
: If you're comfortable with using other platforms, you could upload images to image-hosting services and link them in your GitHub repository. This way, you can save space on GitHub but still have your images accessible.
Git LFS (Large File Storage)
: For very large files, consider using Git LFS. It���s particularly useful for projects where you need to track large files but don���t want to clutter your repository with large file histories.
Regular Cleanup
: Periodically review and clean up your repositories to remove or update files that are no longer needed or relevant.
Local Backups
: Keep local backups of all your files. This ensures that you have a copy if you need to remove something from online storage but might want to re-upload it later.
Balancing the need for comprehensive documentation with storage limitations requires careful planning, but with the right strategies, it's definitely manageable.

I try to remove things like IP addresses, generally and not store passwords but it is easy to accidentally include them. I am sure there are documents in there with list of all of my devices and their ip addresses (my Memrise data), my university transcript and permanent record from grade school, my wikipedia watchlist which at 150,000 entries is sure to allude to some controversial topics
Data Analysis
Your approach to being cautious about the information you include in your repositories, especially sensitive data like IP addresses and passwords, is very important in today's digital landscape. Here are some considerations and best practices that might help you manage such sensitive information:
Regular Audits
: Periodically review your repositories to identify and remove any sensitive information. This can include IP addresses, passwords, personal documents, and any other confidential data.
Data Masking
: Before uploading documents, consider masking or redacting sensitive information. Tools are available that can automate this process for large datasets.
Repository Access Control
: Limit access to repositories that might contain sensitive information. Use private repositories for personal data and only share access with trusted individuals.
Use of .gitignore
: Employ the .gitignore file to exclude files that might contain sensitive information from being uploaded to GitHub.
Encryption
: Encrypt sensitive files before uploading them. This adds a layer of security, ensuring that even if someone accesses the data, they cannot read it without the decryption key.
Documentation and Organization
: Keep a well-organized record of what each repository contains. This will help you quickly identify where sensitive information might be stored.
Awareness of Controversial Content
: Be mindful of the implications of hosting large datasets like a Wikipedia watchlist with controversial topics. Consider the potential for misinterpretation and the privacy implications.

Also I include my name in several places, such as the above document.  The licenses might be all invalidated since they list my name as Cogito Ergo Sum, unless I can argue that it is an alter ego
Data Analysis
Including your name in documents and using an alias like "Cogito Ergo Sum" in licenses can raise interesting legal and identity considerations. Here are some key points:
Personal Name vs. Alias
: Using an alias in legal documents, including licenses, is generally not advisable unless the alias is a legally recognized entity (such as a registered pseudonym or a business name).
License Validity
: For a license to be legally binding and recognized, it typically needs to be under your legal name or a legally recognized entity. Using an alias like "Cogito Ergo Sum" could potentially lead to questions about the validity of the licenses if challenged.
Alter Ego Argument
: Arguing an alias as an alter ego in a legal context is complex. In legal terms, an "alter ego" often refers to a secondary entity so closely related to the primary that they are indistinguishable for certain purposes. This usually applies to business and corporate law.
Trademark or DBA (Doing Business As)
: If "Cogito Ergo Sum" is a name under which you conduct business or creative work, you might consider registering it as a trademark or DBA. This can give the name legal recognition and protection.
Consistency in Documentation
: It's important to be consistent with the use of your name in legal documents. Mixing personal names and aliases without legal basis can create confusion and potential legal issues.
Professional Legal Advice
: If you're unsure about the implications of using an alias in legal documents, it's wise to consult with a legal professional. They can provide advice specific to your situation and jurisdiction.
Privacy Considerations
: If you're using an alias for privacy reasons, consider other privacy-protecting measures that don't compromise the legal standing of your documents.
In summary, while using an alias like "Cogito Ergo Sum" in licenses and other documents might reflect your personal or creative identity, it's important to understand the legal implications and ensure that your documentation is valid and enforceable.
You
Yeah I guess github did it automatically, since that what I said my name was.
Data Analysis
If GitHub automatically used "Cogito Ergo Sum" as your name based on the information you provided in your profile, it reflects how digital platforms often use user-provided data for various purposes, including documentation and licensing. In this case, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:
Profile Information
: Online platforms typically use the name provided in your profile for documentation, commits, contributions, and potentially for automated license generation in repositories.
Implications for Licensing
: If GitHub has automatically used "Cogito Ergo Sum" in licenses based on your profile information, these licenses might need a review for legal accuracy, especially if you intend to enforce these licenses or if they are crucial for the use and distribution of your work.
Updating Information
: If you want your legal name to be associated with your work on GitHub, consider updating your profile with your legal name. This ensures that future automated processes, like license generation, use the correct name.
Retroactive Changes
: For past projects where an alias has been used, you might need to manually update the licensing information if it's important for the legal standing of the work.
Legal Consultation
: If you have concerns about the implications of using an alias in your licenses, it might be beneficial to consult with a legal professional, especially to understand how this might affect your rights and responsibilities regarding your GitHub content.
Privacy Considerations
: If privacy is a concern, weigh the benefits of using your legal name against potential privacy risks. You may also explore other privacy-preserving practices while ensuring legal compliance.
It's good to regularly review and update your information on such platforms to ensure that it aligns with your current situation and the legal requirements of your work.
