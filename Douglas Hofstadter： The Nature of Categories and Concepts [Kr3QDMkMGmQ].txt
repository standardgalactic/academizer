Well it is an honor to be invited here and to have so many people turn up at
this this auditorium filling it up and this is where I grew up this is my old
stomping grounds so it's it's fun comes a little bittersweet but but anyway it's
fun to to be back in general to at Stanford and it's also by the way where
GÃ¼rtelescher Bach was not totally written because I wrote some two drafts of
it in in Oregon when I was a graduate student but then when I came down here
I I spent another two years working extremely hard at Pat Supe's Institute
for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences in Ventura Hall which was then
moved physically about a quarter of a mile somewhere else and it still exists
anyway so I like to improvise to some extent I'm today I have a bunch of notes
which is a little different from how I often do but I think the notes will
help me organize myself my title was the nature of categories and concepts and I
do want to try to broaden your notion of what these things are and not that I
know what your notion is but I have a general sense as to how they're used and
and I think that they're used in ways that don't represent enough flexibility
and because of to me the action of categorization is is at the core of
cognition in an interesting way that I hope to convey to you today I think that
cognitive science has been very influenced over the decades not only
cognitive science but philosophy of mind linguistics perhaps psychology cognitive
psychology as well by ideas that were inherited from mathematical logic even
mathematical logic of the late 19th century and I think that that mathematical
logic puts truth and reasoning and such things in the driver's seat or first
place and I think that that's very inappropriate for thinking about the
nature of thinking but it leaves it has it leaves and say it exactly it there
residues everywhere throughout it throughout cognitive science you'll
find people for example using the predicate calculus to represent ideas and
that's one example people talk about people use words that come from
mathematical logic even that those words have somewhat changed in their in
their connotations or in there so I'm hoping to show you that there are lots
of things that you may not have considered to be categories that I think
merit that title I would say first of all that categories as we know people
like Wittgenstein and also Eleanor Roche are things that do not admit of yes and
no membership exact yes and no answers to questions is this a member of that
category or not but there are things that can be considered very strong central
members things that can be considered peripheral members things that can be
considered maybe marginally outside a category and so forth and I think that's
this set it the sense of gradation or rated membership is terribly important
another thing that I want to get across in the lecture is that I will probably
say I may use a term like member of a category because it's very tempting and
so forth but you have to kind of you know take it with a grain of salt that
if I say that I mean probably a very strong member of a category something
like that because it's clear that things can be very dubious members of
categories as well so categories often are labeled by words and I think that
everybody is obviously familiar with sort of the most obvious ones that pop to
mind things like book or chair or table bird or something like that or as
things that that seem to be out there in the world that seem to be physical
objects and we sell this thing a member of the category book and like this out
of member of the category book is this a member of the category book and so
forth so but there are I would like to say that there are categories that are
linguistically named but that are not just single words they are phrases or
they are even longer things than phrases whole whole sentences or long very long
phrases and I will give a number of examples of those okay another thing
that I'm going to say I'm just giving you a kind of a prelude or a foretaste of
what I'm going to jump into a moment is that categorization categories
themselves are very intimately related to analogy making and this is one of my
theme songs that in fact I gave a lecture here at Stanford in 2006
presidential lecture called analogy as the core of cognition and what I'm
saying today will be very similar to what I said then but it will have a
number of different examples and perhaps some some different points of
emphasis so categories usually begin as a sort of a singleton and then they
blur or spread outwards by a process of analogy sometimes I can refer to it as
pluralization when something that's a singular becomes a plural and another
another thing which maybe is more obvious with categorization than it is
with analogy making is that it happens all the time many times per second when
I talk about analogy I often begin by saying analogy happens many times per
second as opposed to being something that happens for that is sort of analogies
are not just tools for sophisticated reasoners that are reeled out in special
circumstances once every week or once every month or something like that that
analogy making is happening many many times per second by the way this phrase
many many times per second it's clear that if you ask me how many times I
would not say exactly 10 or exactly 11 times per second and even if you said in
the last second in just this last second how many analogies did you make I would
instantly say that's a meaningless question and it's tied in with a sort of
a thesis that I have that I that I state humorously but that I state seriously
at the same time which is you can't count anything and what do I mean by that I
mean that well-meaning people often ask questions that sound very sensible but
that when you look at them carefully make no or very little sense I mean they
clearly have an idea in their mind their idea is not completely vacuous but but
at trying to attach numbers often doesn't make any sense people say to me for
example how many languages do you speak and I'm always caught off guard and a
long time ago I came up with a humorous answer to answer it I say I'm pie
lingual where pie is three point one four blah blah blah and what I mean by
that is I mean I don't really firstly I'll be rather humorous if I'd met it
literally if I meant you know I have a transcendental number you know it's an
irrational number of languages and I could tell you the millions decimal
place obviously I don't mean that I mean perhaps something like well if you were
to add them all up and they all come in different sort of blurry fractions you
might get something around three and so you know various languages that I've
studied at different levels that I've achieved at different times that mastery
and high at one time very low at another time it's all very very hard to
quantify and it's kind of meaningless and and the question is well meant but I
always kind of don't know how to answer it whatsoever because I've always loved
languages and I've studied lots of them and you know I studied a language like
Tamil and you know about 50 years ago and I probably learned about five words
how do you count how do you count that how much of a native speaker of Tamil am I
at that point you know point oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh one you know something like
that it's so how do you how do you add up these fractions anyway it's it's it's
very meaningless so another thing is is that what is a language you can't say
what a language is even if even if you thought well you agreed that counting
and how many of them I speak is blurry what even counts as a language is
extremely blurry I mean Dutch if it weren't for political history could be
considered a dialect of German that many languages spoken in China wouldn't be
called dialects it's just the historical thing that they're called dialects and
one could go on and on saying things like that so it's very important to to
realize that that these questions about categories are extremely graded and
blurry okay I want I'm going to I probably I should talk about some nouns I did
already that is a language is an example of a noun that is a what one might
normally consider a category and I've already tried to show that that's a very
blurry thing but I'd like to to extend the notion of category membership to
talk about categories that are attached that have linguistic labels but the
labels are are not nouns I don't know how many people think of categories in
that way but over the past 20 30 years I've certainly come to thinking of
categories in that way myself and so I'd like to to evoke some examples for you
to suggest let's begin with verbs so I've in in this book by the way which has
two authors not one although how you can't count anything a manuel
that is my co-author equal co-author I just wanted to mention that it's very
important to me that we both be counted there we give lots of examples of
children's use of verbs very young children's use of verbs and how they
label situations in interesting ways which are very understandable but which
might sound like mistakes but which we argue are not really mistakes so let's
let me take an example little girl said I undress the banana now that's a
wonderful example of a situation that evokes the word for the verb to undress
it evoked it spontaneously you know if if she had known the verb feel perhaps
that would have been you could say that undress is is perhaps an accident although
of course once again you can't count anything and to say whether she knows
or doesn't know the word peel is is a very blurry thing in itself she might
have heard it once or twice or some indeterminate number
she might have she might have used it once or twice but but but what does it
mean to know a word I mean she might know the word undress far better than she
knows the word to peel my point is simply that when there is a label that's
very available in her vocabulary and that seems to match the situation in a
very reasonable way it's not I don't think it's reasonable to call it an
error even if in her vocabulary there is sort of on the fringes another word
that might might be considered by native speakers adult native speakers to be a
little bit more or more appropriate or my son at age five his first sentence at
school in Italian was I want to eat some water in English he wouldn't have said
that but he didn't know enough Italian to say better he said manjare and so I
want to eat some water it was in a certain sense it was an error in another
sense he blurted it out very spontaneously he may not have even thought
about whether he was groving for a word that he didn't know he just it blurred
he probably just blurted it out and children ask things like do buses eat
gas my my co-author and then your other's daughter once asked her mother
after there was a party in their in their apartment building upstairs and they
had made a lot of noise and mother was very annoyed at the neighbors
Talia woke up and she said are you going to scold the neighbors today and it's
it's a blurry sort of fringe usage of scold and on and on I have lots of other
examples but I don't want to get too bogged down in examples my point is that
each of these cases of evocation of a verb was to my mind showing that the
situation that which is a very large say of a party that takes place in the
evening involving a bunch of people who live in the same apartment building who
are seen to be doing something that's somewhat annoying to a parent figure and
all of that gets perceived as one situation and it evokes the word
scold and so it's a member for for Talia it was a member of the category to
scold so I'm only trying to suggest that verbs are the names of categories and
that's not just nouns they're very hard to define though and anybody who has
tried to learn a foreign language knows how often not only with verbs with all
words but but in this case just talking about verb how hard it is to select the
right verb for a certain circumstance my wife who is Chinese has the hardest
time figuring out what verb to use to apply to movies and it's interesting
because I I've never I had well maybe I thought about it but I it really became
very apparent that that she was struggling have you seen this movie have
you looked at this movie have you watched this movie and and I had a hard
time figuring out which was the right one I still do occasionally I know that
I'll come out saying things spontaneously without thinking about them and
I'll choose a native speaker verb I know you can say I've seen that movie I'm not
sure if I would say I've looked at that movie and I don't think I would I made my
might have watched that movie let's watch a movie tonight I think we could say
that so it shows it shows that there that the the kinds of circumstances that
evoke the choice of a particular category are extremely extremely subtle and
of course in Chinese when I try to speak Chinese I have a rough time figuring
out what verb to use to say to see or what verb to use to say to read or what
verb to use to say almost anything very very difficult let's take the verb to
fall I can give you about I wrote down about seven different verbs that mean
to fall in Chinese I can name them quickly for people who are interested
Luo, Jiang, Jia, Xia, Shuai, Die, Tao, all of those are different different ways of
saying to fall some of them might apply to leaves falling off of a tree some
some might apply to prices or things in the stock market falling some might apply
to somebody falling something falling off of a surface onto a lower surface some
might apply to toppling over like a building some might apply to a person
falling down and on and on and learning exactly which of these verbs to use in
which circumstance is extremely difficult so that it seems to me to fall
is a very obvious notion but when I try to say it in Chinese it's not obvious at
all and and it's because the categories that that language provides to its
speakers are carved up in a very subtle way now don't make don't get me wrong
I'm not going to say that there are precise boundaries and you're either
right or wrong that's not what I'm trying to say but I am trying to say that
native speakers will on occasion say no you can't say that or this would be a
good way to use in this situation or that one would be a good way to use in that
situation I'm not trying to say that the boundaries are are precise I'm just
trying to say that they're elusive the nature of these blurry halos is very
subtle so now let's let's move on to some some other categories a category the
set of categories that I think is interesting is conjunctions you might
never think of the conjunction as being the name of a category but in order to
get us into the right frame of mind I'd like to suggest a category or a
conjunction that is a fairly recent one I believe it probably didn't exist 50
years ago or maybe 60 years ago I don't know that is the category slash say
something slash something so I have a few examples here some of which by the
way I just made up today one of which I heard today when Adam Katzaf who is in
this audience used it so I quickly copied it down and I'll begin with that
example he said how do these compare with your files slash prints and these
images how do these images compare with your files slash prints and and so I
asked him why he said slash and what did he mean what does this this thing mean
and he thought about it he said well it's kind of like and but it's a little
bit there they're really this it's I don't want to separate and say that
they're they're two different things they're really sort of the same thing
they're one thing they're combined together and so I thought okay that's
that's possibly part of the answer I mean a native speaker doesn't always know
why they choose what they say it comes out spontaneously where does it come from
well from analogy making it comes from this situation is like other situations
that I've heard people use the word slash in that's where it comes from and we
don't know how how our analogy making facility works unconsciously so I wrote
some others down say an electron is a wave slash particle
now why is that so funny another one she's a bimbo slash self-marketing
genius now here's one I really heard those I made up but here's one I heard
here's one I made I heard the other day inside you know just some random
conversation woman said I make a really good avocado dip slash salsa
and you know so I can read you some others downtown Abbey is a period piece
slash soap opera he's an athlete slash entrepreneur only maybe I don't know I
mean on those ones I made up so I don't know I mean I'm a native speaker but I
didn't blurt them out I was consciously trying to make them up so I can't
claim that these are really good at usages but but my point is that you
if you'll if you open your ears you'll hear slash a lot and you know you've
already heard it but I mean open your ears and send emails if you hear a
slash I may be overwhelmed but I'd love to get I'd love to get a collection of
slash usages because it's interesting it's a new conjunction and it defines a
certain set of situations of those situations are recognized by analogy to
other situations that a native speakers use that I've evoked that word in the
in this native speech of native speakers and it's a very it's a very subtle
thing now not only new conjunctions but old conjunctions are are the names of
categories so one of my favorites is the word but and I will say that this is
one of those cases where mathematical logic had a bad effect on me I remember
maybe 50 years ago maybe more maybe 55 well not quite but anyway 53 54 years
ago I was a big aficionado of mathematical logic and I was buying math
logic books all the time trying to learn from them and of course one of the first
things you learn is there are things that they call they call them and or
logical connectives I guess is what they call them and and or if then not and
these are operators in symbolic logic and so the word and was front and center
and then they had to figure out something to say about the word but and a
couple of the books that I had said oh but is a synonym of and it's just got a
little flavor but it's some kind of you know smoky flavor to it and barbecue
flavored and so I believe that I fell for that I thought okay but is a synonym of
and it's just kind of this funny funny quality version of and and it took me
decades to overcome that prejudice because I was so influenced by the idea
that all that mattered in languages things like truth and falsity and later I
came to realize that that's not what language is about and and and and at that
point the word but became extremely interesting to me and I have a file at
home in which I write down unfortunately I don't have enough examples again I
love examples but I have certain examples in which I see the word and or but
used in a way that I think is unquestionable or interesting and I write
them down often I'm writing an email or something like that and I write and and
then I look at it as I look back and I and I say oh that doesn't flow very well
this situation is not an and situation this is a but situation this is a member
of the category but not a member of the category and and what am I referring to
I'm not referring to some object in the world or some action where somebody is
moving their arms in some way I'm referring to a situation in what I would
call discourse space an act of communication an attempt to communicate
ideas from my mind to somebody else's mind and this attempt often takes place
or usually takes place but not completely through language and and so this
chain of this stream of symbols that is coming out of my mouth or my fingers or
whatever this it's it's a it's an event that's taking place in discourse space
and and so it this in this space there are situations and some situations evoke
this the word but more more appropriately or more the word but is more
appropriate than the word and in those situations I'm going to give you an
example let's say here's one that I read in a bio of a speaker who was coming to
give electron translation Indiana University and it was a translator from
Japanese and that may not seem relevant but you'll see that I think it is it was
the first sentence in his little bio and it's a Charles Fox was born in Arizona
but grew up in Texas and I thought what is this but what is why but I mean it's
dime a dozen to be born in one place and grow up in a different place I mean if
it had said Charles Fox was born in Arizona but grew up in Japan I would
completely understand the reason that this situation was a member of the
but category but when it was just saying it was born in Arizona I mean we like
saying he was born on Dolores Street and grew up on Marata I mean there was
something I don't what but you know born in born in Minneapolis but grew up in
St. Paul it's not a but situation and I think you recognize that I mean your
laughter indicates it and and I think that we understand that that these
things are shaded and I'm not again trying to say that some things are
exactly members 100% and others are zero there are grades and shades of
membership in the but category in the and category which is why when I'm
writing I often write the word and and then go back and say this isn't as good
a member of the and category as it is of the but category and I replace the word
these are judgment calls these are not yes or no truth statements or truth
assignments here's one that I wrote in an email to somebody it said my friend
Cyril was supposed to come to my birthday but ducked out at the last moment I
didn't write but I'm sorry I wrote and and ducked out at the last moment and then
when I went back and reread it I thought this would be better to say but and so I
was changing the membership of the category that I was assigning this full
thought to another example I did these pieces over 40 years ago and I'm still
very fond of them and I changed it to but after a while and and so on I have
many many examples of this kind of a thing the only idea that I'm really
trying to get across to you is that conjunctions are names of categories too
so let's let's look at some other conjunctions that are related to but I
have an example that I think you will find amusing I find it amusing light
waves are transverse nonetheless sound waves are longitudinal does that sound
sort of just does not compute but could you put your do you have have you ever
really tried to figure out what situations evoke are evoked by nonetheless
what is the difference between nonetheless however but whereas on the
other hand by contrast nevertheless and so forth have you ever really tried to
analyze it no did anyone ever teach you no you picked it up by by osmosis and so
we could go through a substitute we could substitute for nonetheless and get
some other sentences let's try this one like waves are transverse however sound
waves are longitudinal maybe here's one that I think works just fine at least
see me light waves of our transverse but sound waves are longitudinal sounds
good light waves are transverse that being said sound waves are good line
remember it you know tell that cocktail parties it is interesting so a lot of
categories that one acquires or that one encounters in life are very hard to pin
down I will always remember I'm sorry this is a foreign language example but
I'll relate it to maybe some others in English momentarily when I was working
with an annual on this book I would go to Paris every summer for a month or so
and I watched his little daughter Talia grow up and she's now about 11 and I
remember when she was about five she was very proud new owner of a new word and
this word was now it's actually not one word it's actually two words it's par
contre par and contre but for Talia who had only heard it spoken rapidly mostly
by her brothers and maybe her parents and of course maybe some other little kids
but little kids her age weren't saying I mean for me four-year-olds five-year-olds
don't go around saying par contre very much but you know maybe she was six I
don't remember but the point is that all kids hear words in their environment
and they they when the word what they're just beginning to pick up the flavor of
it they use it with enthusiasm with ardor with with pizzazz I know that's the
right word and I'm off this is a member of the pizzazz category but but let me
just say what it means par contre means something like on the other hand so she
would say something like my brother Mika is going to do this but I'm gonna do
something you know this other thing but she wouldn't say par contre because she
didn't know that there was a final RE in it because when you speak quickly you
say par contre par contre et moi par contre je vais voir par contre and it just has
this chunk feel to it it's just this chunk and and she was delightedly using
this word and I really noticed it it just was in her speech all the time
because she was savoring it and I I think you could make an analogy to for
example an English speaker of English and a kid who's learning English maybe at
about age five saying using word a word like definitely something like that you
know and using a peppering their speech with the word definitely I think you
would find it would sound a little bit funny because it would sound like they
were trying to be a little sophisticated and they would be trying to be
sophisticated they would be reaching just a little bit beyond the limits of
their understanding and they would misuse it in the sense that that is
adults they would misuse it maybe in their own sense of what it means it
would be dead on anyway but gradually over time everybody sort of comes to an
agreement more or less as to how what the situations are that properly evoke
this word I remember a long time ago there were a couple of words in French
that I was I think I used with the same amount of enthusiasm as Talia if there
are native speakers or non-native speakers of French people who love the
French language you'll probably you'll know what I'm talking about if I say
adding the comma quoi at the end of the sentence
quoi at the end of the sentence what the hell does that mean it's hard to say
but you pick it up by analogy you sort of sense when it makes sense to put this
quah at the end if you look in if you read catcher in the rye I know that's
an old novel but it's still it's one of my butt and one of my favorite novels I
mean there's not a butt situation it's an old novel but it's one of why am I
saying but I mean does it mean that old novels are unlikely to be good novels
you see this very tricky anyway you'll see Holden saying and I don't have any
examples here so I can't quote you money but he'll say and all all over the place
and what does it mean I don't know what it means but I know that it's right I
can hear it and I don't have any sense as to what it means exactly but in
discourse space it is really he puts it in JD Salinger puts it in at the right
spots it really works and it means it conveys something but what it conveys I
don't know another phrase in French that I loved acquiring many many years ago
was is it's just an adverb normal now you might think that just means normal
but it doesn't it means something different from normally so I have a few
examples here I don't want to go into French too much because that would throw
us off but I mean if you say somebody is going home and you say normal non
sur la maison non it means sort of like hopefully he's gotten home by now so
normally in that sense means hopefully or normally on va courier ce soir
a set of and that means it sounds like it means normally we're gonna run this
evening at seven we wouldn't say that in English what it means is something like
unless we change our plans or normally we'll do they pass a dozen men in
Bretagne that sounds like it means normally we were supposed to spend two
weeks in Bretagne but it doesn't mean normally it means if there hadn't been a
hitch and and and so when you catch on to this kind of a usage which no
dictionary will tell you no native speaker will tell you no course will
tell you nothing will tell you you catch on to it because you hear it in the
speech of people around you and you hear the circumstances that evoke it and the
way it is used it's in that by analogy you start finding your you yourself are
feeling it come to your mind at just the right times and it feels very exciting
it's a marvelous moment when this phrase that you can't even define its meaning
is coming to you automatically unbidden magically and and that's a very exciting
thing is what was happening to Talia with park on she was all excited I mean
she wasn't aware perhaps that that was that she was excited about it but she
was so these are kinds of examples now I want to say that every word choice is
is is represents it is a category and represents analogy making of the sort
that I'm making so you might get skeptical and say well what about you
know the most functional words I mean I understand the book is a category and
that you know even but but what about the and so I want to argue that the is the
name of a category as well and I wrote up a bunch of sentences today and I won't
spend too much time on them but just a little bit because I thought I was trying
to show how subtle it is to know when to use the and when not to and I I hope
this set of examples at least provokes you it may not be totally convinced by
what I say here but I was having some fun with it and so again if you want to
email me with variations on this thing that'll be fine so it has to do with the
two phrases go to school and go to the school and what what circumstances evoke
go to school and what circumstances in evoke go to the school in the mind of a
native speaker of American English and I tried to find a bunch of examples and
to show how incredibly subtle it is and how it's again shaded and graded I'm
not saying there's an exactly right answer in every case but I think we
would all say it's wrong to say to a kid you have to go to school go to the
school today that what I think you would say it's wrong if you meant the
ordinary meaning go to school you have to go to school today so if a kid says I
have to go to school to pick up my backpack that's a little different
because that is more the place where the school where the backpack is and it's
not exactly going to school like to attend classes but I think it would still
still be okay now what if I as the father of a child were saying something
like this would I say I think I would say the in this case I have to go to the
school to meet with the PTA members I think I would say the there what if it
were I was talking to my kid and who was going to meet friends after school I
think I would say you have to go to school to meet your friends this afternoon
you have to go to school to meet your friend I think I could say of course you
have to go to the school but I think it wouldn't be as spontaneous you have to
go to school to pick up your gym suit if I were talking to some other parent I
though I think I would say you have to go to this school to pick up your kids
tickets if I were talking to my kid I would say you have to go I think I
would say you have to go to the school to buy the tickets for the musical and
then here are some more you have to go to the school and then oh this one I
think everybody would agree that the verse needed because you're giving
somebody directions you have to go to the school and then turn left you wouldn't
say you have to go to school and then turn so here's another one you again
blurry you you have to go to the school to get the parking permit I thought you
had to go to the county courthouse anyway my point is is not to concentrate on
exactly these examples obviously my point is that the the word the is selected
by some subtle cognitive set of cognitive actions that are allowing you to
understand the degree to which the word is needed in that situation for clear
communication and and how it would its choice would if you made the sort of
speak the wrong choice that is the non-native speaker choice it might
confuse a native a native speaker it would be pretty hard for a non-native
speaker especially my wife Chinese is very very distant from English it would
be very hard for her to pick up this kind of this kind of subtle usage but we
all pick it up as native speakers when we're rather young and we polish our
mastery of it as we go on through life so I'm not going to try to convince you
any longer about the or articles like and so forth I mean I've sort of gotten the
idea across now what I'd like to do is is to talk also about things that are
kind of like interjections so for example there are lots of phrases that come
up in let's say television comedy things I or advertising that becomes sort of
memes and they spread throughout the culture so one that may not be all that
current but one that I picked up some years ago and that I think you all know
is hello and I you know what it means right it means something like you're
talking about you're off your rocker how can you say such a dumb thing hello but
you have to say it with the right intonation and sort of the same the
right sound of doubt in your voice and when you do it it gets across very
clearly a certain kind of meaning and there are you know I keep on coming back
to this idea that I want to drill into your head which is there are hello
situations there are situations that evoke that those situations belong to a
category again it's not got you know God-given boundaries that are precise
I'm not saying that I'm simply saying that there are certain categories there
are certain moments certain situations where I could very it just pops to my
mind automatically without even thinking and those are really strong members of
the category and and I and my friend David Moser pointed out another example
of this kind of thing which I always like it's again an intonation one
probably what kinds of situations evoke that probably kind of thing with that
tone attached to the word again it's a category it's a it's maybe a subcategory
I don't know if it is but it might be a subcategory of situations that would
evoke the word probably I suspect it's not exactly but but in any case it's
it's an interesting thing I've never been able to put my finger on it but I
every once in a while I hear somebody saying it or I myself say it and then I
try to write it down and and and to to figure out why is it why was that
particular circumstances circumstance one that evoked that word okay now I've
I've covered lots of linguistic examples that involve essentially choices of one
word or perhaps two words I may have used some others I don't remember but I
want to now go on to situations that whose name or categories whose names
they still have linguistic names but the linguistic names are considerably
longer phrases so we'll we have phrases we have situations that are very
naturally labeled by the label kill two birds with one stone and I use that
phrase all the time I mean for example in coming out here I could say I was
going to Google and I was coming to Stanford on this trip I'm killing two
birds with one stone okay I had two visits to two different institutions out
here in the Bay Area killing two birds with one stone so there are I mean you
probably use it all the time yourself and so you know how that comes to mind
spontaneously and so that's a name of a category that you all have and it's a
very standard category proverbs sometimes are well all proverbs are names of
categories but some proverbs are are very very interesting subtle subtle they
name some categories so there are lots of cases were in the last few years I
found myself saying well you're shutting the barn door after the horses out you
know that phrase I mean I don't know if everybody knows that phrase but it is a
standard phrase and it's evoked by certain kinds of situations those
situations are members of the shut the horse after the barn is at the door
that situations and once burned twice shy but I say that quite often and so we
have me see if I have some others some of the other examples of this kind of
thing yeah put the cart in front of the horse or a couple that I like are that's
the tail is wagging the dog you know case of the tail wagging the dog and again
these are situations that you recognize where something that seems very small
seems to be taking an inordinately large controlling role in a situation it
shouldn't be the controller but it somehow is and I you know I I had to
explain this pretty many times and in use lots of examples to Emmanuel because in
French that exact idiom or that notion doesn't exist there isn't an idiom that
corresponds to the tail wagging the dog and so I had to give him bunches of
examples before he caught on another example that also was similar was the
left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing which is something that
comes about situations in organizations where they have parts and one division
of the organization doesn't isn't under isn't aware of or is doing something
contradictory to another part of the organization and so we see these
situations the sprays comes to mind it's clearly a category and how do we what
are we doing when we assign that situation to that category well we're
obviously making an analogy now are we making an analogy to actually right
hands and left hands knowing things no or not their right hands don't know
anything left hands don't know anything so we can't be literally making an
analogy to situations where the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is
doing we're making analogies to other instances where we've heard the phrase
used where there may have been some canonical instance when we were 14
years old when we heard it and it struck us and we might have savored it or
delighted in it and it registered in our mind maybe unconsciously but it
registered in our mind and that that moment planted the seed then for a whole
host of analogies that would be made later in life and they would grow the
concept would grow and grow and become more and more flexible until it was this
concept this label could be applied to situations of many many sorts but it's
not handed to you on a silver platter so to speak and so you have to acquire
it over time and Emmanuel was the perfect example of this I had to give him
many examples of left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing until he
sort of caught on now as a last category of sorry category of categories I
guess it is the last category but I want to talk about ones that don't really
have linguistic labels because up until now I've just been talking about
categories that are that either or not are they labeled by nouns by verbs by
conjunctions by adverbs or by phrases or by well idioms idiomatic phrases but
I'd like to come to categories that are that have no linguistic label I mean you
can always describe them using words but they don't have a standard linguistic
label either in either in general in the society or even for yourself as a
private individual they don't have labels so in this book and by the way many of
the ideas that I'm talking about today are in this book in this book we talked
a lot about a particular category which I now have a label for but we have to
you have to understand that for years there was no label for it now it has
become a labeled category and I'll give you the label right now but it was not
labeled when it first happened of course and that is the label is Danny at the
Grand Canyon and and this was when my son Danny was one year old and three
months and we were driving across the country to come out to California from
Indiana and we were making a tour of my wife Carol and I were or making a tour
of certain national parks and which was the Grand Canyon and so when we were at
the edge of the Grand Canyon one afternoon Danny was sitting cross legged on
the ground looking at ants and I found this somewhat ironic because here we
were at the edge of this incredibly large chasm by the way I'll interrupt I
want to tell you something amusing Danny is now 20 whatever he is 25 26 and he
loves wilderness and he recently had a job in Arizona where he was working and
he was very close to the Grand Canyon made sure that his friend Charles took a
photograph of him sitting at the edge of the Grand Canyon looking at some ants so
I have that up in my study but but anyway so Danny at the Grand Canyon was
this this odd situation of a child so young that he wasn't able he wouldn't
have been able I mean if I had said Danny look at the Grand Canyon it would
have meant it would have just been colors on his retina he wasn't old enough to
have the concept of even any distance at all we had like a mile even if it were
you know inside in a town but let alone out in space and vertical mile and 15
miles across and 200 miles long I mean that those concepts were not available
to him and his visual system was not built to recognize things I mean I was
going to acquire the ability to recognize things that were very far away
and to estimate distances but but you know at one age one nothing like that
existed and so it was perfectly sensible for him but as his father I you know I
I found it amusing nonetheless I mean it was probably inappropriate of me to
find it in music but I did well it registered in my mind but I didn't
give it a name it was just a memory was just a fact something that had once
happened but then about see about I guess it was 2005 so this was 16 years
later group of us were in Egypt and we were taking a boat down the Nile or up
the Nile whichever it might be and we we came to the Temple of Karnak and which
is you know huge pillars and I don't know what they're made of but anyway
lots of lots of huge impressive pillars with you know thousands of years of
history behind them and at one point our friend Dick who was an adult reached
down to the ground and picked up a bottle cap and he was making a bottle cap
collection of bottle caps only in Egypt just Egyptian bottle caps and he picked
it up and all of a sudden out of nowhere spontaneously my memory came of Danny at
the Grand Canyon now obviously this was a reminding by analogy I mean I don't need
to spell it out but I will a little bit you know Karnak the big towers was the
Grand Canyon the big hole dick was Danny the bottle cap or it was the ants and I
probably could spell out some other things as well but but I mean it's
self-evident the basic idea of this analogy and so all at once these two
events were sort of superimposed on each other by my unconscious mind which
made it now conscious and I wasn't aware at the time that I was creating a
category that I had begun with a singleton which was Danny at the Grand
Canyon and had to spread it out I was just saying oh it's reminds me Danny at
the Grand Canyon that's all I said but the moment I said that then my my
conscious mind started saying oh yes that means this is an analogy which means
the two are superimposed which means I'm beginning to make a category which
means actually I already had a category when I had only one member it was just a
category that had one member and now it's starting to blur out and at this
point now this category has become an explicit category in my mind now it has
a name and it includes all sorts of things it includes a mosquito biting
Albert Einstein it includes me and Emmanuel in Paris working on our book
instead of going to the Louvre you know or doing all the standard tourist things
that you would do in Paris it's sort of like what are we doing we're paying
attention to only this tiny little teeny thing instead of enjoying the
magnificent city of Paris and and on and on and and eventually it has come to
mean to me to mean just the idea that you focus on what you are interested in
and what you're capable of focusing on and you ignore a huge amount of stuff
that other people would think of as gems and and so it's kind of become a very
very broad category now which has the name Danny at the Grand Canyon and so
this is sort of how categories grow and how they are retrieved by analogy and
that sort of theme of this book that categorization and analogy making are
the our flip sides of the very same mental process there really two ways of
talking about the same thing and I'd like to finish up with just one kind of
memory of myself at when I was I don't know in my early 20s I remember we drove
around we drove around Italy and I love the typefaces I will always remember my
extreme love of the variety of typefaces and for each letter of the alphabet
they were so many incredibly new inventive ways of realizing let's say the
letter a or the letter b or the letter q or whatever letter you want and I was I
was in love with all the different well not the members themselves but the vast
the very vast variety of members of the categories a through z they were I was
really thrilled by that and it's it's something that I still do love and as a
matter of fact it's evidenced by the cover of this book where you can see
several a's superimposed some of which are really very wild most wild one is the
pink one which is belongs to a typeface called Magnificat but my point is that
since then I have always been fascinated by categories but I would say that that
today my fascination of categories is a little bit different from my
fascination back then now I'm fascinated by the amazing variety of categories
that exist the strange kinds of categories that we use so unconsciously so
spontaneously many of which have labels many of which do not Danny the Grand
Canyon started out unlabeled and and has now acquired a label many of our
concepts each person has their own memories that they have stocked over
their lifetime and that are capable of being evoked by situations but which
don't have any labels so I just you know now every culture but I think American
culture very strongly has a tendency to just like Talia was very excited by the
new concept parkour parkour she she was very excited by that our culture as a
whole is excited by the creation of new categories it lives by the creation of
new categories and we have a long list of recent categories in the book and I
just read you a handful of them and I think you'll see why it's fun to collect
these things and to see how rich they are here positive and negative feedback

mother first lady worst-case scenario these are all categories and it's it's
I rejoice in it and I find it absolutely astounding and and it is what
makes us different from all other animals because other animals although they
can acquire and extend their repertoire of categories they cannot do it the way
we do it snowballing and snowballing and building and building and building and
building that is what makes us so unique it is the way in which we continue to
accrete categories to our set of categories from the moment we're born
to the moment we die and I rejoice in that and I find it fantastic thank you
now I know some people want to leave and that is we should let them leave give
them a minute or so but I was told to ask people who wish to pose questions to
use one of the two microphones in the aisles so that we can get your
questions recorded so I'll just I guess people can leave while we're taking the
questions yeah thank you for a very stimulating talk I have a lot of
questions but yeah so you've mentioned you mentioned the word discourse space
discourse space yeah because that kind of strikes me as a mathematician you
know in the more logical world you have these sentences and they're supposed to
be about say models and so I was wondering you know you may be expand on
this idea of what you know the discourse space is and how these these
categories you're talking about sort of more applied to the discourse space
rather than just let's see if I can say it very I don't know if I can say it
terribly well did you hear the question was the question here ago it was really
trying to define the notion of discourse space I I guess things that take
place in ordinary three-dimensional space are very complex I mean if I said to
you sashay the verb sashay what is it what is a sashay you know it would be I
could try to show you you know I don't know if I would do a good job of it but
I could recognize sashaying if I saw it reasonably well now what about segue let's
see if I can segue into this into this into this thing segue is something that
takes place in discourse space it's a sort of a logical follow-on it's like
there but it's but it's it's maybe there are two things that seem separate but
you're trying to connect them by buy some you're trying to establish a link
between them that that maybe ordinarily there wouldn't be one but I'm trying to
segue from one idea into another idea if I can do it gracefully okay so that's
an element of that's a thing that happens in discourse space I would say as I
said earlier discourse space is the space in which of the space of abstract
events in which that are that are communicative events where we're trying
to communicate to transmit some idea from ourself to somebody else and it
might even be you don't even know who you're talking to that it could be
discourse when I'm writing a book I'm not actually speaking to anyone but I
have an sort of an imaginary person that I'm talking to and so the discourse is
the attempt at communicating an idea and there is this sense that I have in my
head that there is a kind of flow there is flow that makes things stick
together that you might call it logic but it's not logic in the sense of you
know truth preserving it's logic in the sense that it seems to make a seamless
link between certain kinds of ideas that is a segue does but flow in general is
trying to do that and and discourse space is the space in which those things
take place I don't know how to define it other than it's it's the space of
linguistic communication my my point was there that I think that very often
people don't what I was trying to wake people people up to is just the idea
that of the word but is a perfect example of an event in discourse space
music cho choosing the word but and inserting it in is an event in discourse
space which it's the label of a situation and it's a choice of a
category and and so that's that's what I was trying to say I think I haven't said
anything that I didn't already say but I don't know how to say it any other way
that's as good a job as I can do you've said as a mathematician and I can't
connect it to mathematics because I don't think it's a mathematical space I
might also mention since you are a mathematician that that mathematicians
there is a theory of categories I mean that's an official branch of mathematics
and but I don't think it has anything at all to do with what I'm talking about
yeah hi there's a catchphrase that mostly military officials military
government officials and conservatives seem to throw into their discourse that
I've been trying to figure out what category it is it annoys me but I'm not
really sure why it annoys me so much but it's at the end of the day would you
like to comment on that well I didn't connect it with any particular set of
people I have heard the phrase and I do I do remember hearing it and probably
I've heard it spoken undoubtedly by by political people but I didn't I didn't
realize that it was that it had any you know of sort of association with a
particular political set of people and I haven't thought about that category but
I do appreciate the example I think it's a it's a it's a very good example of one
of these linguistic phrases that sounds so simple but that what you're saying is
that it actually has a lot of depth associated with it and in this case part
of the depth is that it contains a kind of a political undertone or subtone or
I don't want to use which I think is is part of what you're saying and I think
that shows the subtlety of the phrase and the subtlety of the acts of
analogy making that are going on in the minds of people both who use it and who
hear it so but I don't I can't comment on that phrase particularly because I
never really thought about it yeah over there hey I would like to hear your
thoughts on highly contentious categories slash what do you think about the
category of consciousness and intelligence and for example whether like
binding of consciousness has any to do anything to do with how you make
analogies and identify consciousness well is that what you're asking about
consciousness and you mentioned intelligence also well in my book in
2007 called I'm a strange loop I have a whole dialogue called I don't remember
what it's called exactly but something like consciousness equals thinking and
and there I try to argue for that idea that that thinking and consciousness are
are the same thing and and intelligence not all thinking is highly
intelligent but I I like to think that if you want me to try to define
intelligence if that's what you're looking for I have a definition which
which and I put into this book my definition for intelligence is it's
closely related to what I said today in a certain sense that is it is the ability
to put one's finger on the essence of a situation rapidly and that means to
categorize rapidly to make analogies rapidly to find compelling or strong
analogies rapidly and that's that's my notion of intelligence and that's let's
say high-quality thinking but thinking in general might be the same thing it's
just maybe the the retrieval of the categories isn't quite as efficient
or isn't quite as on target but it is still the same mechanism and I claim
that that is indistinguishable from consciousness thank you yeah I've
started to know notice recently that new technological media have enabled sort
of like it seems to me a faster rate of like creation of new concepts the good
example is the internet on which should I say internet on which I'm just
internet versus internet never mind internet it's up the tea is often
I see internet yes anyway on the internet people have started saying things such
as I skipped class today because Douglas Hofstadter lecture so I was wondering
like what do you think it is about these media in which maybe it has something to
do with like the fact that we're writing things down that are not intended to be
spoken but then they become spoken at some point okay another example which I'll
give you this is interesting I mean you know the what do they call them the
emoticons and at first I really thought they were dumb and I didn't use them but
by God I use them no I only use one two types I well maybe even more but I use
the colon followed by the right parent I use the semi-colon followed by the
right but they're not names of the same category they are definitely not names
of the same category and I use a colon followed by a left parenthesis and maybe
I use one or two others I don't know and and so these are these are examples of
modern means that the web or the you know various kinds of media have
brought into existence and the one that you mentioned I guess because used as a
shortened form of because of sort of is that it yeah I mean I can see that this
is evolving this is happening I I'm not a party to that I don't I actually go the
other way whenever I do you know when I type a thing I don't use two thumbs I
use one finger and I and I never use any abbreviations I I make a point of not
using abbreviations and so except that dot the two dots and the thing that's
sort of an abbreviation but it's become its own thing and but I see it happening
all the time I agree with you I you're probably right but there is pressure
there's lots of pressure to create new categories and to to sort of make
communication more efficient absolutely I mean that's the nature of
communication these days it'll probably always was but it's certainly very
intense you point out how new categories in rich language but language also is
being corrupted at least formal English is being corrupted for instance it is I
sounds bizarre these days so what does one do does one go with the flow or does
one try and fight well your question is a very good one because I mean I I happen
to be a member of the usage panel the American Heritage Dictionary I get
questionnaires from them about once a year they ask me about 50 questions and
they say which do you approve of this fully you know formal writing or its
colloquial or disapprove or highly disapprove and and it's interesting I I
have very strong opinions and I fully agree with you I'm not one of those
people who think that that we should just be descriptive I I believe in
prescriptive the idea that there is a correct way to spell something and I
think most of us do fundamentally I mean if you look at the New York Times you
will find that all the words are spelled correctly and the words spelled incorrectly
they'll might they might catch and put a neurotom in you know some other time I
mean there is a sense that it's not just anything goes however to my chagrin in
school as far as I can tell no grammar is taught I mean when I was a kid we
learned subject and object and direct object and indirect object and and
present perfect and past perfect and so forth and so on we learned the names of
all sorts of things and I don't think that my kids who are now out of high
school or out of college but I don't think that they ever learned what a
subject or an object was or even well maybe maybe a verb maybe they know what
now in the verb is I mean probably they do but that's because I told them you know
and I it is it is very disturbing to me and I fully agree with you I'm in your
camp but I don't know how to do it other than to be a try to be an example and
write books that sound fairly literate and to use to use language well and to
encourage the use of good language I'm teaching a course next semester called
writing structured verse and I'm gonna you know be very strict with my students
about how they use language and I'm gonna talk about their word choices very
carefully but that's you know a handful of people how do you affect the entire
world I don't know inspired by your terrific lecture today we've had a
discourse just recently at a fairly high level of sophistication you think
computer systems will ever be able of capable of having that kind of discourse
there might be a little robot over the corner who's listening to your lecture
lumbers up to this microphone like me and ask you a coherent question and it's
capable of responding to your answer is that ever gonna happen I don't claim to
know the answer to that question I have thought about it a great deal and I you
know the idea that it might happen quickly within the next 50 years or
something like that as advocated by people like Ray Kurzweil and others first
of all I think it's not likely it's implausible but secondly it was it
disturbs me it bothers me I on the other hand I can see no reason that it is
impossible and I even at one time even in a certain sense kind of bought into the
line of Hans Morovac who is a very similar to Ray Kurzweil when he wrote a
book I don't remember whether it was his book mine children or another book but
it doesn't matter he has this idea that we collectively are going to give rise
to machines that will be more intelligent and more creative and more
empathetic hopefully than we are and he says what could be nobler what could be
what what role could we play that would be more noble than that you know to give
rise to what he calls mind children and as long as it's way off in the future
beyond my horizon it's okay with me but if it starts to seem like you know my
own kids are gonna be sort of outmoded obsolete it frightens me and it really
disturbs me but I don't see why it wouldn't be possible for that to happen
along those lines have you seen the movie her no I've heard about it I have
not seen now I must admit that I was told that we're supposed to stop at 6 30 I
will take let me be nice if I can and take two more questions okay just one
here and one there all right I'm gonna try to I have kind of a category of
questions but can you talk about the sort of semantic drift of categories over
time slash the other part of that is the difference between if there is
such thing platonic categories versus the category that any particular person
or set of people has in their mind at any time yeah each of us is you know we
house in our minds many many categories like I you know name dropping and
brainstorming and then vicious circle and stuff that that that our our culture
gives us and all these other things you know bait and switch and tailway in the
dog not to mention our cool and so forth we all have lots of those they're
given those but then we all have their own private repertoire of categories like
I had the category without even knowing that it was a category of Danny at the
Grand Canyon which then became sort of more recognized when dick reached down
to pick up the bottle cap and it became started to read become very clear but I
have you know millions of memories in my mind that are evocable or retreat to
say let me find a different word triggerable retrievable excitable I don't
know what the word is but you know where a new event happens and it reminds me of
that old event and those two are then sort of superimposed so I have my own
personal set of categories that is unique to me I mean I remember here's an
example I remember I was in some airport probably Charlotte and I was waiting in
for a plane and I was sitting around in the waiting area and a mouse started
running around and people saw it and some guy got up with cowboy boots and
started running around trying to stomp on the mouse and it was an unforgettable
scene of this guy running around the other thing you know that's a personal
memory that I have now you don't have it but I've just conveyed it to you but
but I mean each of us has memories of weird events that are unique and that
you know they're our own private category repertoire and and that's we're
made of of that combination of social or public categories and private
categories is that answering that's my second question yeah what that's the
second question okay all right all right thank you yeah last so in speaking of
proverbs as categories I thought of two movies that show what I can only think
must also be a category in real life which is that good people know proverbs
or people who don't know proverbs are somehow untrustworthy so there's the
movie Amelie where Amelie's friend goes on a walk with her new boyfriend and
starts asking him all these proverbs in French and he's able to explain or say
I did really remember that I saw the movie a few months ago it was very funny
and I sort of remember that yes so that's that's one and she says it for her
it's a proverb that you trust somebody who knows their proverbs or don't trust
somebody who doesn't the other I can think of is the thin blue line which is
some Errol Morris film somebody who is wrongfully in prison for murder and the
rural county sheriff is asking the the innocent man all these proverbs and
asking him and the guy understands what they were and seemed to me never
explicitly said that this county sheriff had a rule of thumb which is well if he
can understand these proverbs he can't be the you know the crazy person who
committed this murder that was depicted in the movie and that along with the two
questions ago about computers and conversation there's a certain type of
thinking that you have described artificial intelligence is going in today
which doesn't seem to be the same as the type of creativity by analogy learning
or thinking that that you've been well I agree that artificial intelligence today
is not very close to anything like that but but it's interesting it's an
interesting notion that knowing proverbs makes you into a I don't know what it
doesn't seem a moral person but I don't know it makes you more reliable or
trustworthy or something I wouldn't think that's the case but I would I would
think that knowing how to apply proverbs that is understanding proverbs and
using them fluently it is true that I'm impressed when people do that I think
it's charming and it shows a certain kind of conceptual depth that I that
pleases me if you know if somebody says in a situation where they're avoiding
something that once caused them some trouble they say once burned twice shy
I there's something I like about it it makes me feel good so I can relate to
that and I like these these ability to go back to the history of the language
and kind of draw on wisdom from the past and use it in current situations I
think that's that's very good and it shows that you're not just a person of
the moment but you're a person that is a little bit more rooted in the past and I
think that's good but I don't think it makes you more moral have you met a
person who does not understand a proverb other than a non-native speaker well
I've been I've read that often very autistic people may not I don't know
if that's true but I've read that you know if I heard a complaint out there so
I don't know I just just just heard that yeah even though the questions are
yes yeah for sure yeah if people are like me I guess the more they're like me
the more I tend to trust them yeah that's 22 years from now be I'll be
getting up there
