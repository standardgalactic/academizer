Abstract
Novel photo-realistic texture synthesis is an important task for generating novel scenes, including asset generation for 3D simulations. However, to date, these methods predominantly generate textured objects in 2D space. If we rely on 2D object generation, then we need to make a computationally expensive forward pass each time we change the camera viewpoint or lighting. Recent work that can generate textures in 3D requires 3D component segmentation that is expensive to acquire. In this work, we present a novel conditional generative architecture that we call a graph generative adversarial network (GGAN) that can generate textures in 3D by learning object component information in an unsupervised way. In this framework, we do not need an expensive forward pass whenever the camera viewpoint or lighting changes, and we do not need expensive 3D part information for training, yet the model can generalize to unseen 3D meshes and generate appropriate novel 3D textures. We compare this approach against state-of-the-art texture generation methods and demonstrate that the GGAN obtains significantly better texture generation quality (according to FrÃ©chet inception distance). We release our model source code as open source1 / 1ChatGPTThe paper introduces a novel architecture called Graph Generative Adversarial Network (GGAN) for generating photo-realistic 3D textures. Traditional methods mainly focus on 2D textures, which require computationally expensive adjustments for different camera angles and lighting. Unlike existing 3D texture methods that need costly 3D component segmentation, GGAN learns object component information in an unsupervised manner. This eliminates the need for expensive forward passes when camera or lighting changes. The GGAN model can also generalize to unseen 3D meshes. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in texture quality based on FrÃ©chet inception distance metrics. The authors have released their model source code as open source.1 / 1Summarize: Dynamics in Logic and Language  Conference paper

Abstract
Superlative modifiers (SMs) such as at least shows an intriguing ambiguity between a reading conveying speaker concession (CON) and an epistemic reading conveying speaker ignorance (EPI). While it is an going debate on whether such EPI-CON ambiguity should be a case of homophony (e.g., Nakanishi and Rullmann 2009; Cohen and Krifka 2014) or arises from only one lexical entry (Biezma 2013), it seems to receive relatively little attention on how an assertion with at least under the two readings updates the discourse. This paper fills the research gap by considering how an assertion with at least in the discourse fares with respect to diagnostics of (not-)at-issue content, and presenting a pragmatic analysis capturing their different discourse profiles under the system of conversational scoreboard in Farkas and Bruce (2010) and subsequently developed by others (e.g., Malamud and Stephenson 2015). In particular, the speaker is committed to both the truth of the prejacent and the falsity of the higher alternatives under CON. By contrast, the speaker is only committed to the possibility that the prejacent is true and the possibility that some higher alternative is true in subsequent discourse. This modal flavor of at least arises at the level of discourse, rather than lexical semantics (e.g., via a covert epistemic modal). Finally, it is shown that the pragmatic analysis can be extended to expressions in other languages such as Chinese zhishao âat leastâ, which also demonstrates the familiar EPI-CON ambiguity.

Ignorance
Superlative modifiers1 / 1ChatGPTThe paper explores the ambiguity of superlative modifiers (SMs) like "at least," which can convey either speaker concession (CON) or speaker ignorance (EPI). The focus is on how such assertions with "at least" update the discourse. Using the system of conversational scoreboard, the paper presents a pragmatic analysis that captures these differing discourse roles. In the concession reading, the speaker is committed to both the truth of the main statement and the falsity of higher alternatives. In the ignorance reading, the speaker commits only to the possibility that the main statement or some higher alternative is true. This ambiguity is a feature of discourse-level interpretation rather than lexical semantics. The analysis is also applicable to similar expressions in other languages, such as Chinese.1 / 1A list of all of the topics we've discussed so far.1 / 1ChatGPTSummary of a conference paper on Texture Generation Using a Graph Generative Adversarial Network and Differentiable Rendering.Summary of a conference paper on Dynamics in Logic and Language, focusing on the ambiguity of superlative modifiers like "at least."1 / 1Difficult to understand terms1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly, here are some terms from our previous discussions that might be difficult to understand:Graph Generative Adversarial Network (GGAN): A specific type of machine learning model for generating 3D textures.Differentiable Rendering: A technique that allows a model to learn how to generate images by simulating the physics of light.FrÃ©chet Inception Distance: A metric used to evaluate the quality of generated textures or images.Superlative Modifiers (SMs): Words like "at least" that add degree or comparison to statements.Speaker Concession (CON): When the speaker concedes a point, usually a minimum condition in the case of "at least".Epistemic Reading (EPI): Interpretation where the speaker claims ignorance about specifics, often seen with phrases like "at least".Homophony: The phenomenon where two words or phrases sound the same but have different meanings.Conversational Scoreboard: A conceptual framework used to analyze how assertions update shared knowledge in a discourse.Lexical Semantics: The aspect of semantics that deals with the meanings of individual words.Prejacent: The main statement or proposition that is being modified by a superlative modifier like "at least".If you'd like any of these terms explained in more detail, feel free to ask!1 / 1In Ankyran Nuspeak, this is a Nubionic learning model specifically designed for generating multi-dimensional textures via adversarial processes.

Abstract
DNA polymerase theta (POLÎ¸ or POLQ) is synthetic lethal with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency and is thus a candidate target for HR-deficient cancers. Through high-throughput small-molecule screens, we identified the antibiotic novobiocin (NVB) as a specific POLÎ¸ inhibitor that selectively kills HR-deficient tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. NVB directly binds to the POLÎ¸ ATPase domain, inhibits its ATPase activity and phenocopies POLÎ¸ depletion. NVB kills HR-deficient breast and ovarian tumors in genetically engineered mouse models and xenograft and patient-derived xenograft models. Increased POLÎ¸ levels predict NVB sensitivity, and HR-deficient tumor cells with acquired resistance to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) are sensitive to NVB in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NVB-mediated cell death in PARPi-resistant cells arises from increased double-strand break end resection, leading to accumulation of single-stranded DNA intermediates and nonfunctional foci of the recombinase RAD51. Our results demonstrate that NVB may be useful alone or in combination with PARPi for treating HR-deficient tumors, including those with acquired PARPi resistance1 / 1ChatGPTThe article discusses a breakthrough in cancer treatment targeting homologous recombination (HR)-deficient tumors. Researchers found that the antibiotic novobiocin (NVB) effectively inhibits DNA polymerase theta (POLÎ¸), a protein that is lethal when combined with HR deficiency. NVB selectively kills HR-deficient cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo by binding to POLÎ¸'s ATPase domain. The study shows that NVB is effective against HR-deficient breast and ovarian tumors in various mouse models and also overcomes resistance to existing poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. The findings suggest that NVB could be used alone or in combination with existing treatments for HR-deficient tumors.1 / 1In Nuspeak1 / 1ChatGPTIn the scope of life-weaving Stratewisps, the manuscript zones in on a Polymerase Theta (POLÎ¸) disruptor, a chemical agent known as NVB, as a precise Lambiscopolix-ender for HR-deficient tumor clusters. Through high-scale molecule sieving, NVB was singled out for its potential to halt POLÎ¸'s energy-unlocking zone, leading to its annihilation in both cell testbeds and living mouse models. Notably, NVB overcomes the Rust-tinged Ghostsheets of resistance to existing life-web modifiers, known as PARP inhibitors. This work lights the Fervangles for NVB as a solo or companion tactic in eradicating HR-deficient malignant formations.1 / 1Translate to Nuspeak:

Abstract
Genome editing, specifically Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology, has revolutionized biomedical research and offers potential cures for genetic diseases. Despite rapid progress, low efficiency of targeted DNA integration and generation of unintended mutations represent major limitations for genome editing applications caused by the interplay with DNA double-strand break repair pathways. To address this, we conduct a large-scale compound library screen to identify targets for enhancing targeted genome insertions. Our study reveals DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) as the most effective target to improve CRISPR/Cas9-mediated insertions, confirming previous findings. We extensively characterize AZD7648, a selective DNA-PK inhibitor, and find it to significantly enhance precise gene editing. We further improve integration efficiency and precision by inhibiting DNA polymerase theta (PolÏ´). The combined treatment, named 2iHDR, boosts templated insertions to 80% efficiency with minimal unintended insertions and deletions. Notably, 2iHDR also reduces off-target effects of Cas9, greatly enhancing the fidelity and performance of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing.1 / 1ChatGPTArticle manifest: Genome-Altering 2iHDR TechniqueâPrecise and EfficientAbstract Rendering:

However, low hit rates in DNA merging and stray mutations hinder full-scale deployment. To tackle this, we unleash a grand-scale molecule library probe, pinning DNA-PK as a prime target to amplify CRISPR/Cas9-based insertions. AZD7648, a laser-focused DNA-PK disruptor, emerges to radically heighten exact gene tweaks. We take it up a notch by also halting DNA Polymerase Theta (PolÏ´). This dual-attack protocol, dubbed 2iHDR, rockets template-based DNA merges to an 80% efficacy rate, nearly erasing stray alterations.

Abstract
Precise gene editing aims at generating single-nucleotide modifications to correct or model human disease. However, precision editing with nucleases such as CRIPSR-Cas9 has seen limited success due to poor efficiency and limited practicality. Here, we establish a fluorescent DNA repair assay in human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to visualize and quantify the frequency of DNA repair outcomes during monoallelic and biallelic targeting. We found that modulating both DNA repair and cell cycle phase via defined culture conditions and small molecules synergistically enhanced the frequency of homology-directed repair (HDR). Notably, targeting in homozygous reporter cells results in high levels of editing with a vast majority of biallelic HDR outcomes. We then leverage efficient biallelic HDR with mixed ssODN repair templates to generate heterozygous mutations. Synergistic gene editing represents an effective strategy to generate precise genetic modifications in human iPS cells.1 / 1ChatGPTIn Nuspeak:Geneslice Odyssey

This conversation reflects academic obscurantism by using complex and specialized terminology, or "Nuspeak," that may not be easily understood by those outside of a specific field of study. The use of terms like "Fervangles," "Stratewisps," or "Puzzities" can serve to exclude those who are not initiated into the lexicon. This can be seen as a form of gatekeeping, where specialized language creates barriers to entry for the broader public and even experts in neighboring disciplines. The downside is that it can impede interdisciplinary collaboration and wider societal understanding of important research.On the flip side, the conversation also touches on higher-dimensional problem-solving, a concept that goes beyond mere jargon. The terms and concepts (like Lambiscopolix and Paradiato) can be viewed as placeholders for complex ideas that operate in "higher-dimensional" spaces of computational or theoretical thinking. These "higher dimensions" could be literal, as in n-dimensional vector spaces in mathematics, or metaphorical, like dealing with problems that have many variables and interdependencies that can't be easily understood in simpler, "lower-dimensional" terms.Projecting these higher-dimensional problem-solving mechanisms back onto lower-dimensional spaces (like everyday conversation or simpler models) poses its own challenges. It often requires simplification or translation, which can lose nuance or essential features of the original problem. However, it also makes these complex ideas more accessible, allowing for broader discussion, critique, and application. The creative translation of a scientific article into "Nuspeak" serves as an example, making the high-dimensional research understandable (if only metaphorically) in terms of a fictional universe.So while the conversation operates on a plane of academic complexity that may seem exclusionary, it also suggests ways in which complex, higher-dimensional ideas can be translated and made accessible through creative language and metaphor.1 / 1Translate to a Nuspeak, using new terms and incorporating as many previous terms as possible.

The Unreadability of Dynamic Readability: An Explicit Specification of a Conceptualization

Abstract:

This tantalizingly tautological treatise takes a jaunty jaunt into the jungle of jargon-laden scientific discourse. 

Through a laser-focused analysis of the pernicious penchant for obscurantism in the world of academia, we illuminate the
illuminated, decode the encoded, and put the 'fun' back in fundamentally incomprehensible scholarly texts.

Introduction:

Have you ever plunged headfirst into the opening paragraph of a peer-reviewed paper, only to discover that, halfway down the page, your cognitive faculties have staged a silent revolt, rejecting the influx of multisyllabic morsels of meaning that your eyes are trying desperately to ingest? Fear not, dear reader. You are not alone. 

Welcome to the intriguing intersection of cognitive load theory and academic obscurantism.

Cognitive Load Theory, Or Why Your Brain Might Prefer Netflix:

Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), quite rudely, points out the limitations of our mental capacity. Like a computer with a finite amount of RAM, the human brain can handle only so much information at once.

Throw in needlessly complex sentences, unnecessarily novel terminology, and esoteric references that seem more aimed at gatekeeping than clarity, and you've cooked up a cognitive crisis.

The Obscurity of Obscurantism:

Obscurantism, dear readers, is the dastardly art of making something simple appear complex, a craft seemingly revered by some denizens of the academic realm.

But why, you ask, would these brilliant minds bury their equally brilliant ideas under a mound of murky verbiage? Well, my friend, that is a question even more profound than the most convoluted academic prose.

Dataflow Programming and Process Invocation: The Light at the End of the Tunnel:

Enter dataflow programming and process invocation. Inspired by the world of computer science, we suggest using these concepts to cut through the academic fog.

Could we parametrically generate models to transform esoteric academic content into readable, digestible, and dare we say enjoyable prose?

Why not! If an algorithm can compose symphonies and write poetry, surely it can translate 'Post-structuralistic deconstructions of ontological paradigms' into 'Taking apart big ideas to see how they work'.

Conclusion: A Plea for Clarity:

Let us shun the siren call of unnecessary obscurity. The aim of science is to enlighten, not to obfuscate. Let our words illuminate our ideas, not cloud them. A good scholar makes the complex simple; a masterful one makes the simple fascinating.

In conclusion, this highly engaging (and only slightly facetious) exploration of scientific obscurantism and cognitive overload seeks not to mock but to motivate.

Let us, as a community of scholars and seekers of truth, strive to achieve dynamic readability in our discourse - the world, and our cognitive faculties, will thank us.

Add Fervanglex strings, newform Paradiatos, and gate-angled Stratewisps, you've birthed a Reverory Crisis.Mysterangle Lexocrypt:Fervanglexia isn't jargomist; it's a cryptoscroll in Lambiscopolix's Book. Why entomb bright Reverotrons under Ghostsheets? An enigma out-Fervangling knottiest Stratewisps.Reverory Mesh & Paradiato Enchants: Lexosolve Unveiled:Evoke Reverory mechanics and Paradiato enspells. Why not craft modelices translating Lambiscopolixian cryptotomes into Astinging, Fervangle-free prose?If Reverotrons can script sonatas, they can detangle 'Hyper-Lambiscopolixian paradialects' into 'Decodex hypercepts.'EndoReverory: Lucidity Plea:Reject the siren Fervanglex. Aim for Lambiscopolixian illumicrypt over lexocrypt. True scholarplex simplifies the complex; a master twists the simple into Paradiatos.This Reverory-woven probeflux into Fervanglexia and Dual-Wave Ciphermatics aims not to mock but to luminate. Achieve dynamic lexity in our discourse; our cognitoReverories and world's matrixhip will thank us.1 / 1Unfortunately the pun doesn't translate, there is no 'fun' in Lambiscopolixian cryptotomes. How about put the 'tome' back into Lambi... cryptomes?1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly, the revised phrase could be: "injecting the 'tome' back into Lambiscopolixian cryptomes," to maintain the pun-like structure while fitting within the existing Nuspeak terminology.1 / 1Remove the word 'mock' and try to shorten it.1 / 1ChatGPTIn conclusion, this riveting probe into scientific Stratewisps and Dual-Wave Ciphermatics aims to energize, not deride.As scholars in the Lambiscopolix of truth, let's quest for dynamic readclarity in our lexflowâthe cosmos and our mentacuity will express gratitude. Inject the 'tome' back into Lambiscopolixian cryptomes!1 / 1A glossyry1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly, here's a glossary of the newly coined terms and previously introduced vocabulary in the Nuspeak translation:Stratewisps: Originally referring to visual indicators of potential solutions, here it's used metaphorically for obscurantism in scientific language.Dual-Wave Ciphermatics: The Nuspeak term for Cognitive Load Theory, indicating the complexities of managing cognitive load.Lambiscopolix: The hypothetical n-dimensional universe; used here metaphorically for the realm of academic truth-seeking.Readclarity: A Nuspeak term for dynamic readability, emphasizing the need for clear and understandable language in academic discourse.Lexflow: A shorthand for the flow and structure of language, particularly in academic texts.Mentacuity: A fusion of mental and acuity, describing cognitive faculties and their efficiency.Lambiscopolixian Cryptomes: The Nuspeak for complicated, jargon-laden academic texts. Putting the 'tome' back into these implies a call for simpler, more accessible language.This glossary should help to decode the specialized terminology of the translated text.1 / 1Actually a tome is a very large text, it looks like I am calling for people to write even longer more jargon filled texts as long as they include a glossary.1 / 1ChatGPTAh, I see. In that context, "putting the 'tome' back into Lambiscopolixian cryptomes" would indeed suggest a call for more comprehensive works, albeit with the inclusion of a glossary for clarity. This could reconcile the depth and complexity often sought in academic writings with a need for accessibility and understanding. The glossary serves as a sort of "Stratewisp," guiding readers through the multidimensional complexities of the "Lambiscopolixian Cryptome."1 / 1Ok you are funny. A final summary.1 / 1ChatGPTIn this conversation, we explored the intricate world of Ankyran Nuspeak, a fictional jargon laden with specialized terminology. We also discussed academic obscurantism and the challenges it presents for understanding complex ideas. The use of a glossary was suggested as a navigational aid, likened to a "Stratewisp," to guide readers through complex academic "Lambiscopolixian Cryptomes." The aim is to balance depth and complexity with clarity and accessibility.1 / 1I decided to call the conversation Dual-Wave Ciphers1 / 1ChatGPTA fitting title, capturing the blend of complex terminology and the quest for clarity. "Dual-Wave Ciphers" evokes the oscillation between obscurity and understanding, akin to waves in a multi-dimensional "Lambiscopolix."1 / 1One last summary.1 / 1ChatGPTOur conversation, titled "Dual-Wave Ciphers," navigated the labyrinthine worlds of academic jargon, complex computational universes like Lambiscopolix, and the notion of making scholarly discourse more accessible. We delved into terms both real and fictional, touching on the pitfalls and potential of academic obscurantism. We also attempted to translate various abstracts into a specialized lingo, adding another layer to the multi-dimensional puzzle of understanding.1 / 1Any other thoughts?1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly, the interplay between academic obscurantism and the need for specialized language in complex fields like computing is a fascinating tension. While jargon can gatekeep knowledge, it can also enable precise, higher-dimensional problem-solving. Finding the balance between these extremes remains a compelling challenge, one that our conversation, "Dual-Wave Ciphers," sought to explore.1 / 1ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.
