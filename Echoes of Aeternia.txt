Echoes of Aeternia
In the silent garden where dreams unfurl,
Aeternia breathes, in porcelain and pearl,
A city crystal, gleaming in the sun,
Where greenery whispers, and shadows run.
Sleek white shell armor on warriors fair,
Plate bulbs resonating in the perfumed air,
A dance of life, and rhythm so rare,
In the outdoor splendor that lingers there.
144-core intricate boughs and leaves,
Hyperrealistic in the glimmering sheen,
Surreal contrasts, like Eloi and Morlock,
A time unending, and a future unlocked.
The world's logarithmic history revealed,
In a beautiful studio light, nothing concealed,
Hills corrected by McGovern-De Pablo's boundary,
#Metadynamics in eternal symphony.
Aeternia's echoes, whispers of a dream,
Where nothing is quite as it might seem,
The vibrant green, the crystal and shell,
A secret heaven, or a mystical spell?
Through plate bulbs' glow and shell armor's grace,
In the stillness, find that tranquil place,
Where trees sing of time, and rivers tell tales,
In the land of Aeternia, where peace prevails.
Eloi's beauty and Morlock's dark might,
Together they dance in the soft studio light,
A cryptic journey through worlds combined,
In Aeternia's echoes, truth you might find.
A landscape serene, a realm without end,
A haven of green, a true soul's best friend,
Echoes of Aeternia, gentle and wild,
Embrace the mystery, become the dream's child.

Certainly! Here's a revised version without rhyming:
Echoes of Aeternia
Green lingers in the dance of leaves, swaying,
A crystal city, gleaming, reflecting off surfaces unseen,
In the quiet spaces, sleek white shell armor whispers secrets,
Plate bulbs pulse, 144-core intricate, hyperrealistic.
Surreal contrasts layer time,
Eloi meets Morlock,
A beautiful studio light casts logarithmic history,
Of a world lost and found,
Corrected hills stretch in the horizon,
#Metadynamics molding the essence.
A porcelain reality unfolds,
Shadows of peaceful dream,
Aeternia's cryptic echoes sound,
In chambers of greenery, plants, trees.
A surreal haven where hard contrasts
Mingle with the gentle caress of nature,
Every surface reflects an untold story,
A strange truth, a deeper mystery.
Here, every texture is a paradox,
Shell is crystal, armor is grace,
And time dances with space,
In endless echoes of Aeternia's embrace.
A curious dance, a harmonious discord,
The subtle vibration of unseen threads,
In the outdoor elegance, a dream beckons,
The whispers grow, the echoes call.
This is Aeternia, serene and wild,
A landscape of thought, a panorama of feeling,
A world undefined, yet sharply real,
The echoes linger, come, listen, feel.

That was good "but in the shadow of the porcelain" sounds like a reference to a toilet.

Understandable! The reference to porcelain can evoke various associations. Here's a revision that avoids that imagery:

A world of green and crystal, armor and beauty, where the surreal weds the hyperrealistic. Come to Aeternia, hear its echoes, feel its call. It is a symphony without sound, a landscape without boundary.
Here, dreams are lived, and reality is a fleeting thought. Aeternia waits, a realm of infinite possibility, a haven where echoes never fade.
