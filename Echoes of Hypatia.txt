Gilgamesh,[1] the son of Lugalbanda, was the king of Uruk in the Third Dynasty of Ur around 2600 BC. The story, like an epic, the most famous work of ancient fiction, narrates the events of his life. According to one version, Gilgamesh built the walls of the city of Uruk.
A hero, perhaps Gilgamesh, in Assyrian sculpture.
Notes
Edit
The Latin name is derived from the Greek name once written as ���������������� or Gilgamos, in Aelian's "History of Animals" 12.21: ������� ����������������� ����������������, ������� ������������������ �������������������� ('and he is called Gilgamos, and he rules the Babylonians'). In this story, an oracle is given to the Babylonian king which says that Gilgamesh, his grandson, will kill his grandfather. For this reason, the king throws Gilgamesh from a high tower, but as he falls, he is saved by an eagle. However, this story is entirely different from the Babylonian tale about Gilgamesh.

Here's the translation to English:
But nothing is known about the year of his birth except that, in the year he was made a suffect consul of Rome, he must have been born about 42 years earlier: therefore, perhaps in the year 86, certainly between 82 and 90,[1] he was born in Nicomedia. He was educated there: he boasted that his homeland was Bithynia and wrote a history of the region.[3] He came from a family of Roman citizens. In his native city, he earned the priesthood of Demeter and Kore. He was a student in the city of Nicopolis, around the year 108,[4] of the philosopher Epictetus, whose Discourses he transcribed: he did not see to their publication before the reign of Antoninus Pius.[5] Around the same years, it seems he was initiated into the mysteries of Demeter Eleusinia.[6]
Around the year 110, he served as a knight in Noricum and Pannonia;[4] after two years, he is thought to have been among the advisors of C. Avidius Nigrinus, the legate of Achaia, who soon died by the order of Emperor Hadrian.[7]
He was made a Roman senator around the year 120, perhaps "among the praetorians"[4] and at the urging of Hadrian,[8] who held Epictetus "in the highest regard... and knew him"[9] and was acquainted with Arrian.[10] He may have served as the Proconsul of the province of Baetica around 125 if he is the same "Arrianus" who inscribed a Greek poem in Corduba during those years.[11] Arrian, around the year 129, was made a suffect consul, and then until about the year 137, he was the legate of Augustus pro praetor of Cappadocia.[12] In the year 131/132, he visited the Black Sea coast and described it in the Periplus of the Euxine Sea.[13] In the year 135, he campaigned against the Alans and wrote a short work about the expedition.[14] Around the year 137, he composed the Tactica.[15] He is proposed to have served as the legate of Syria between the years 137 and 141, but this remains uncertain.[16]
Afterwards, he lived in Athens and became a citizen of Athens. He died after 146 (for in the year 145/146 he was the eponymous archon of Athens) but before 180.[17]

On Studies and Writings
Edit
The author of the new Anabasis, a lover of horses, dogs, and hunting, occasionally adopted the nickname "Xenophon" for himself.[18][13]
Brian Bosworth believes that Arrian wrote the Anabasis of Alexander when he was relatively young, at a time when he had earned the magistracy and priesthood in Nicomedia, had already written some works in Greek, but had not yet been made a Roman consul or senator and had not visited Rome. The historian Appianus (who died around 165) is known to have extracted various things from the Anabasis of Alexander for his Civil Wars (without citing the author's name).[19] He wrote the lives of Timoleon and Dion when he was young. Around the same time, he began preparing the Bithyniaca, but wrote it after the Anabasis, a provincial history that is now lost, to which he prefixed an introduction about his studies and duties: Photius included an epitome of this introduction in his Bibliotheca.[20] It is unknown in which years he wrote other historical works.
On Fortune
Edit
He was celebrated in the Roman era both as a Roman military leader and especially as a Greek philosopher: the historian Dio Cassius, who also hailed from Bithynia, wrote a biography of Arrian the philosopher.[21] In Lucian, Arrian is described as "Arrian, a disciple of Epictetus, a foremost Roman man, engaged in studies all his life".[22] In the 4th century, Themistius praised Arrian as a writer who had campaigned against the Alans.[23]

Vita Dionis Syracusani (Life of Dion of Syracuse)
Setting:
Ancient Syracuse, 4th century BC
Main Characters:
Dion of Syracuse
Dionysius the Elder (Tyrant of Syracuse)
Dionysius the Younger (Son of Dionysius the Elder and successor)
Plato (The Athenian philosopher)
Plot:
Act 1: Rise to Power
The story begins with Dion as a young nobleman in the court of Dionysius the Elder, the tyrant of Syracuse. Dion quickly gains favor and becomes one of the most trusted advisors.
Dionysius the Elder dies, and his son, Dionysius the Younger, takes the throne. Dion hopes to influence the young ruler and guide him towards just governance.
Dion introduces Dionysius the Younger to the teachings of Plato, hoping that the philosopher's wisdom will inspire the young tyrant to rule justly.
Act 2: Disillusionment and Exile
Despite Dion's efforts, Dionysius the Younger becomes increasingly paranoid and tyrannical. He begins to see Dion, with his popularity and connection to Plato, as a threat.
Dionysius the Younger banishes Dion from Syracuse. During his exile, Dion gathers support from other Greek city-states, fueled by his desire to free Syracuse from tyranny.
While in exile, Dion's wife is forced into marriage with another man by Dionysius, further igniting Dion's resolve.
Act 3: The Return and Rebellion
With a formidable army and support from various allies, Dion returns to Syracuse. The city, tired of Dionysius's rule, welcomes him as a liberator.
Dion successfully overthrows Dionysius the Younger and becomes the new leader of Syracuse.
However, power dynamics shift, and Dion faces challenges from former allies and new enemies within the city. His rule, initially celebrated, becomes contentious.
Act 4: Tragic Downfall
Dion's leadership is challenged by internal strife and external threats. He becomes increasingly isolated and paranoid, mirroring the behavior of Dionysius the Younger.
A conspiracy forms against Dion, and he is betrayed by a close friend or family member.
Dion is assassinated, and Syracuse plunges into further chaos, highlighting the cyclical nature of power and tyranny.
Epilogue: Legacy of Dion
The story concludes with reflections from various characters, including a retrospective from Plato, lamenting the tragic fate of his student and the impermanence of power.
The narrative emphasizes the complexities of leadership, the challenges of maintaining integrity in the face of power, and the tragic consequences of ambition.
This plot is a fictional representation based on the historical context of Dion of Syracuse and the limited information available about his life.

Epilogus: Dionis Hereditas
Plato, Atheniensis philosophus, in solitudine sedens, Dionis memoriam revocat. "O Dion," inquit, "quis te sciret tam magnas res gesturum? Tu, qui sapientiae studium praeferre potuisti, in tyrannidis gurgite absorptus es."
"Virtus et potentia," Plato continuat, "saepe inter se pugnant. Dion, amice meus, bonitatem tuam novi, sed potentia te mutavit. Sic, saepe, evenit in vita."
"Nos, qui vivimus," Plato suspirat, "debemus meminisse: non solum pro nobis, sed pro posteritate agimus. Dionis exemplum nos monet: virtutem sine sapientia esse periculosam."
Civitas Syracusana, post Dionis mortem, in tumultu est. Sed inter tumultus, aliqui Dionem laudant, alii vituperant. Tamen omnes consentiunt: Dion, sive bonus sive malus, Syracusas mutavit in aeternum.
Finis.

English Translation:
Epilogue: The Legacy of Dion
Plato, the Athenian philosopher, sitting in solitude, recalls the memory of Dion. "O Dion," he says, "who would have known you were to achieve such great deeds? You, who could prioritize the pursuit of wisdom, were consumed by the whirlpool of tyranny."
"Virtue and power," Plato continues, "often battle against each other. Dion, my friend, I knew your goodness, but power changed you. Thus, often, it happens in life."
"We, who are alive," Plato sighs, "must remember: we act not only for ourselves but for posterity. The example of Dion warns us: virtue without wisdom is dangerous."
The city of Syracuse, after the death of Dion, is in turmoil. But amidst the chaos, some praise Dion, others criticize him. However, all agree: Dion, whether for good or ill, changed Syracuse forever.
The end.

Life
Edit
Her father was Theon of Alexandria[2], a famous mathematician and astronomer, who apparently taught in the Library of Alexandria and educated his daughter in the sciences there. Hypatia herself learned the history of religions, rhetoric, philosophy, and the art of teaching, and she traveled to Athens and Rome. Scholars flocked to Hypatia's home from the most distant places. One of her students was Synesius of Cyrene, the bishop of Ptolemais, who wrote about Hypatia and her works. Hesychius the Hebrew, another student, also wrote about her, and reported that officials sought her out and consulted her on various administrative matters.
Ancient pottery (Hypatia was killed with pottery shards)
In the year 412, Bishop Cyril of Alexandria became patriarch. As he was a very Catholic man, abhorring paganism and heresy, he accused Hypatia of witchcraft. In 415, she was killed by a mob of monks who impaled her and tore her apart with sharp shells[3] and then burned her body.
The asteroid 238 Hypatia was named in honor of Hypatia of Alexandria.

Hypatia[a] (born c. 350���370; died 415 AD)[1][4] was a neoplatonist philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician who lived in Alexandria, Egypt, then part of the Eastern Roman Empire. She was a prominent thinker in Alexandria where she taught philosophy and astronomy.[5] Although preceded by Pandrosion, another Alexandrine female mathematician,[6] she is the first female mathematician whose life is reasonably well recorded.[7] Hypatia was renowned in her own lifetime as a great teacher and a wise counselor. She wrote a commentary on Diophantus's thirteen-volume Arithmetica, which may survive in part, having been interpolated into Diophantus's original text, and another commentary on Apollonius of Perga's treatise on conic sections, which has not survived. Many modern scholars also believe that Hypatia may have edited the surviving text of Ptolemy's Almagest, based on the title of her father Theon's commentary on Book III of the Almagest.

Hypatia constructed astrolabes and hydrometers, but did not invent either of these, which were both in use long before she was born. She was tolerant towards Christians and taught many Christian students, including Synesius, the future bishop of Ptolemais. Ancient sources record that Hypatia was widely beloved by pagans and Christians alike and that she established great influence with the political elite in Alexandria. Towards the end of her life, Hypatia advised Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria, who was in the midst of a political feud with Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria. Rumors spread accusing her of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril and, in March 415 AD, she was murdered by a mob of Christians led by a lector named Peter.[8][9]

Hypatia's murder shocked the empire and transformed her into a "martyr for philosophy", leading future Neoplatonists such as the historian Damascius (c.���458 ��� c.���538) to become increasingly fervent in their opposition to Christianity. During the Middle Ages, Hypatia was co-opted as a symbol of Christian virtue and scholars believe she was part of the basis for the legend of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. During the Age of Enlightenment, she became a symbol of opposition to Catholicism. In the nineteenth century, European literature, especially Charles Kingsley's 1853 novel Hypatia, romanticized her as "the last of the Hellenes". In the twentieth century, Hypatia became seen as an icon for women's rights and a precursor to the feminist movement. Since the late twentieth century, some portrayals have associated Hypatia's death with the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, despite the historical fact that the library no longer existed during Hypatia's lifetime.[10]

What were the effects of the Arithmetica and the Almagest on science?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Both the "Arithmetica" by Diophantus and the "Almagest" by Ptolemy are foundational texts in the history of mathematics and astronomy, respectively. Their impacts on science are profound and long-lasting:
1. Arithmetica by Diophantus:
Introduction of Algebraic Notation
: Diophantus is often referred to as the "father of algebra" because of his work in this text. He introduced symbols for unknowns and their powers, which was a significant step towards the development of modern algebraic notation.
Diophantine Equations
: The "Arithmetica" is best known for its presentation of solutions to determinate and indeterminate equations, which are now known as Diophantine equations. These equations seek integer solutions, and their study has become a significant branch of number theory.
Influence on Later Mathematicians
: The "Arithmetica" influenced many later mathematicians, including Pierre de Fermat, who famously scribbled his "Last Theorem" in the margin of his copy of the "Arithmetica".
2. Almagest by Ptolemy:
Comprehensive Astronomical Model
: The "Almagest" is one of the most influential books on astronomy. It presented a geocentric model of the universe, where the Earth is at the center, and all celestial bodies move in epicycles around it. This model was the dominant view of the universe for over a thousand years.
Star Catalog
: Ptolemy included a catalog of over 1,000 stars, with their positions, magnitudes, and other attributes. This was one of the most comprehensive star catalogs of its time.
Mathematical Tools
: The "Almagest" introduced and utilized trigonometry as a tool for astronomical calculations. Ptolemy's work on trigonometry, including the half-chord version of the sine function, laid the groundwork for modern trigonometry.
Influence on Islamic Astronomy
: During the Islamic Golden Age, the "Almagest" was translated into Arabic and was a foundational text for Islamic astronomers. They made further observations, corrections, and additions to Ptolemy's work.
Renaissance Impact
: The "Almagest" was translated into Latin in the 12th century and played a crucial role in the European Renaissance's astronomical revolution. It was only with the works of Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler that the geocentric model was eventually replaced by the heliocentric model.
In summary, both the "Arithmetica" and the "Almagest" have had profound impacts on the development of mathematics and astronomy. They provided foundational knowledge, tools, and frameworks that shaped scientific thought for centuries.

So how long before Giordano Bruno did Hypatia live?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Hypatia lived from around 350-370 AD to 415 AD. Giordano Bruno lived from 1548 to 1600 AD.
To calculate the time between their lives:
Start with the year of Hypatia's death: 415 AD.
Subtract this from the year of Giordano Bruno's birth: 1548 AD.
1548 - 415 = 1133 years
So, Hypatia lived approximately 1,133 years before Giordano Bruno.

It seems that there are certain parallels.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Indeed, there are several parallels between Hypatia and Giordano Bruno, especially when considering their lives, teachings, and the circumstances of their deaths:
Champions of Free Thought
: Both Hypatia and Giordano Bruno were known for their independent thinking and their challenges to the prevailing orthodoxies of their times. Hypatia was a Neoplatonist philosopher in a Christianizing Alexandria, while Bruno was a Renaissance philosopher who challenged the Catholic Church's doctrines.
Conflict with Religious Authorities
: Both faced opposition from religious authorities. Hypatia was caught in the political-religious turmoil of Alexandria, with tensions between pagans, Jews, and Christians. Bruno, on the other hand, faced the Inquisition due to his pantheistic views and his belief in an infinite universe.
Tragic Deaths
: Both were killed because of their beliefs. Hypatia was murdered by a mob of Christian zealots, while Bruno was burned at the stake for heresy by the Roman Catholic Church.
Posthumous Influence
: Both Hypatia and Bruno became symbols after their deaths. Hypatia was seen as a "martyr for philosophy" and represented the loss of classical learning. Bruno, meanwhile, became a symbol for free thought and was seen by many as a martyr for science, although his contributions to science were more philosophical than empirical.
Association with Astronomy
: Both had connections to the field of astronomy. Hypatia's teachings and works included astronomy, and she was known to have commented on the works of great astronomers like Ptolemy. Bruno, on the other hand, supported the Copernican heliocentric model and proposed the idea of an infinite universe with many worlds.
Legacy in Modern Times
: Both figures have been reclaimed in modern times as symbols of intellectual freedom and resistance to dogma. Hypatia is often cited in discussions about women in science and the clash between science and religion. Bruno is frequently referenced in the context of the freedom of thought and the early scientific revolution.
While they lived in vastly different times and cultural contexts, the parallels between Hypatia and Giordano Bruno highlight the recurring themes of intellectual freedom, the tension between free thought and religious orthodoxy, and the personal risks that thinkers have faced throughout history when challenging established beliefs.
