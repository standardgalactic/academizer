Mathematics, computing and the scientific method as a guide to high-performance software development decisions.
Contextualization
Let's say I have to find the greatest distance, given that these distances are relative to a central point, and several other points.

In other words, given {P0, P1, P2, ���, Pn}, and considering the distances {P0P1, P0P2, ���, P0Pn}, what is the greatest distance in this set of distances?

Methods
Using the exhaustion method, we can make a combination of n.(n-1)/2 comparisons. Hey, P0P1 and P0P2, P0P1 and P0P3 etc.

However, we could order the set of distances, and then choose the last (or first). Which will be the biggest. This is in the order of n.log(n) comparisons.

Consequences
Stupid things like that can be the difference between a customer spending 10 minutes, or 1 minute on your website; in addition to satisfaction and willingness to return vary correspondingly.

But��� Nobody creates a service to calculate distance between points!

No, no... it could be that the best investment for the citizen's profile is being ordered. Or, the bank credit note. Or even part of an algorithm to calculate the best route for a vehicle. Etc.

The study of algorithms is fundamental, accompanied by data structure.

Codes which have algorithms using brute force, which are repetitive and, consequently, inelegant - in addition to becoming a huge technical debt - reduce customer satisfaction.

The article on "DARK CYBER CORNER" by buddhilw discusses the importance of utilizing mathematics, computing, and the scientific method as a guide for making high-performance software development decisions. In the context of finding the greatest distance among a set of points relative to a central point, the author illustrates different methods. One approach is the exhaustion method, involving

comparisons. Such decisions in algorithm design and method selection significantly influence customer experience on a website, affecting their time spent, satisfaction, and likelihood to return. For instance, efficient algorithms can be crucial for services like investment recommendations, bank credit ratings, or vehicle routing, among others. Therefore, a thorough understanding of algorithms, paired with the appropriate data structures, is essential to avoid using brute force or repetitive methods, preventing customer dissatisfaction and accumulating technical debt.

Syria ��������

Dam massacre 2017
The U.S. military bombed a massive Euphrates River dam in Syria in 2017 despite a military report warning such an attack could lead to a flood that would kill tens of thousands of civilians. That���s according to The New York Times, which reports the attack on the 18-story Tabqa Dam led to critical equipment failure, causing a reservoir to rise and prompting panicked evacuations downstream. At the time, the commander of the U.S. offensive dismissed reports that the U.S. was responsible as ���crazy reporting.��� In fact, the U.S. was responsible, and even selected at least one concrete-penetrating bunker-buster bomb for the attack. A follow-up U.S. airstrike reportedly killed three workers who rushed to the dam to prevent a disaster.

Burkina Faso ��������
Coup 2022, Jan -- Actor: Damiba. President Roch Kabor�� is deposed.
According to U.S. Africa Command, or AFRICOM, Damiba received training on multiple occasions from the U.S. military. Since 2008, African military officers trained at American so-called peacekeeping programs have successfully led or attempted at least nine coups across West Africa.

Currently, 29 January 2022, President Roch Kabor�� is on a military camp, captive.

The text you have shared is the source code of a LaTeX document, which is typically used for typesetting complex documents such as resumes, scientific papers, and books. LaTeX code is not meant to be "cleaned up" in the traditional sense because it is a markup language rather than prose.
If you have specific requirements or areas you want to improve or change, I can certainly help with that. For instance:
If you need to add or remove sections, you'd adjust the corresponding LaTeX commands in the text.
If you want to improve the layout or styling, you'd modify or add new LaTeX packages or formatting commands.
If you want to update or edit the content of the resume, you'd locate the relevant sections of LaTeX code and edit the text within them.
Here are general steps you can consider:
Content Update:
Make sure to review and update all content to ensure it's current and accurate.
Formatting:
Adjust the formatting commands to achieve the visual style and layout you desire.
Compiling:
After making changes, you would compile the LaTeX code into a PDF or another format to see the final document.
If you need help with specific LaTeX commands or formatting issues, feel free to ask! Without specific instructions, it's challenging to provide further assistance since LaTeX code is highly customizable and depends on your particular needs and preferences.

Ensure you have the appropriate document class and packages installed.
Content Insertion:
Insert your content into the right sections.
Follow the syntax of each section.
Compilation:
Use a LaTeX editor or an online compiler to convert the .tex file into a PDF.
Rectify any errors or warnings that appear during compilation.
Quick Tips:
Consistency:
Maintain consistent formatting (fonts, sizes, and styles).
Sectioning:
Properly section and subsection your content.
Proofreading:
Go through the content for grammatical errors and proper sentence structuring.
If you have a specific section or formatting issue, could you please pinpoint where exactly you���re facing difficulty? For example, if there���s a section not aligning properly, or if a particular piece of content isn���t displaying as you want it to, let me know so I can offer more targeted assistance.
Would you like help with a particular section, or are you looking for general improvements? If you need a starting point, there are various LaTeX CV templates available online that you might use as a reference or starting point. You might need to install additional LaTeX packages or fonts on your system to compile some templates, depending on their requirements.

So he mentioned multiple cursors in emacs, could you give some examples of this and ways to do similar things in vim?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Multiple cursors allow you to have more than one active cursor in your text editor at once, which can be very useful for editing multiple lines simultaneously. Below are some examples of how to achieve this in Emacs and Vim:
In Emacs:
Emacs has a package called
multiple-cursors
that you can use for this purpose.
Installation:
You need to have the package installed. You can add it via MELPA or ELPA.
Once installed, you need to require it in your Emacs config file:
emacs
Copy code
(require 'multiple-cursors)
Usage Examples:
mc/mark-next-like-this
: Add another cursor to the next line that matches the current line.
mc/mark-previous-like-this
: Add another cursor to the previous line that matches the current line.
mc/mark-all-like-this
: Add a cursor to all lines in the buffer that match the current line.
In Vim:
Vim doesn't have built-in support for multiple cursors, but you can achieve similar functionality with visual block mode and plugins.
Visual Block Mode:
Press
Ctrl + V
to enter visual block mode.
Move the cursor to select multiple lines.
Press
Shift + I
to insert text, type the text you want to insert, and then press
Esc
.
To replace or append text, you can use the
c
or
A
commands respectively after selecting lines in visual block mode.
Using Plugins:
Plugin like
vim-multiple-cursors
can be used to get behavior similar to Emacs��� multiple cursors.
Installation can be done with your favorite plugin manager, like Vundle, Plug, or Pathogen.
Once installed, you can use
Ctrl + N
to create new cursors at each occurrence of the word under the cursor.
Example Workflow:
In Emacs, you might use
mc/mark-all-like-this
to select all occurrences of a word and then type to replace them all at once.
In Vim, you might use visual block mode to select a column of text and then insert, replace, or append text to all lines in the column simultaneously. Alternatively, you might use the
vim-multiple-cursors
plugin to select and edit multiple occurrences of a word.
Consideration:
Remember to consult the documentation for each package or plugin, as there are often additional features and commands available.
Vim purists often use native features like visual mode, search and replace, or macros to achieve similar results without plugins.
Before relying heavily on these features, it���s worth considering the different philosophies and workflows encouraged by Emacs and Vim, as well as your personal preferences and the specific requirements of your editing tasks.

You know you can just use byobu and send a message to all panes or all windows, let's say you were editing ten or twenty different documents...
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Indeed,
byobu
is a powerful tool that provides text-based window management and terminal multiplexing. It allows users to have multiple terminal sessions within a single terminal window or remote terminal session, and it supports both
tmux
and
screen
as backend.
You can broadcast your keystrokes to all panes or windows which is useful when you need to edit or execute similar commands on multiple sessions at once.
Here���s a general guide on how to use
byobu
to send messages to all panes or windows:
Sending Message to All Panes in Byobu:
Open
byobu
terminal.
Split into multiple panes as needed using
F2
to create new windows,
Shift+F2
to create horizontal panes, and
Ctrl+F2
to create vertical panes.
Navigate between panes using
Shift+Arrow Keys
or
Ctrl+Arrow Keys
.
Press
Alt+Shift+F9
to enable input to all panes. Once this mode is activated, whatever you type in one pane will be sent to all panes.
When you���re done, press
Alt+Shift+F9
again to disable input to all panes.
Sending Message to All Windows:
Press
Alt+F9
to enable input to all windows. This will broadcast your input to all windows in the
byobu
session.
Type your command or text.
Press
Alt+F9
again to disable input to all windows.
Considerations:
Be careful while using broadcast input, especially when executing commands, as it might lead to unexpected behaviors if you are not aware of the context in each pane or window.
The keybindings mentioned might vary depending on your
byobu
configuration and the backend (
screen
or
tmux
) that you are using. Refer to
byobu
's documentation or use
byobu-keybindings
command to view the current keybindings on your system.
It���s important to understand that while
byobu
and similar tools provide great convenience, the way they handle multiple cursors across different panes or windows is quite different from the multiple cursors feature within a single file in editors like Emacs or Vim. These are different tools designed for different tasks, and your choice will depend on your specific needs and workflow.

I think I sent a command to a dozen computers and about 20 different versions of Linux, I had to set up different aliases on some computers for examine on a windows computer I had to alias ls to dir
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Broadcasting commands to multiple machines or sessions simultaneously can indeed be powerful but also risky, as environments, configurations, and states of the different systems can vary greatly.
Here are a few general precautions and tips for managing such situations:
Precautions:
Understand Each Environment:
Ensure you understand the differences and peculiarities of each environment you���re working with to avoid issuing commands that may be inappropriate or destructive in some of them.
Test Commands First:
Before broadcasting, test each command in each unique environment to ensure it behaves as expected.
Use Aliases Carefully:
While aliases can help normalize commands across environments, they can also create confusion or unexpected behavior if not set up and used carefully.
Implement Safety Checks:
If you���re issuing potentially destructive commands, implement checks to confirm that the action should proceed.
Avoid Simultaneous Editing:
Unless necessary, avoid editing configuration files on multiple systems at once to prevent synchronization issues or mistakes.
Limit Broadcast Scope:
Only include the systems or sessions that need to receive the command to minimize the risk.
Tips for Alias Management:
Consistency Across Systems:
Try to maintain consistent alias names across different systems for the same or similar functionalities.
Document Aliases:
Have documentation available for your aliases so that you or others can quickly understand what each alias does.
Use Descriptive Names:
Choose alias names that are descriptive and not easily confused with other commands.
Session-Specific Aliases:
You can set aliases for the duration of a session, which might be safer than setting them system-wide.
Example of Session-Specific Alias:
For a session-specific alias, you can simply use the
alias
command in the terminal:
shell
Copy code
alias ls='dir'
This alias will only last for the duration of the session. Once you close the terminal, the alias is gone, and you would need to set it again the next time if needed.
Conclusion:
While powerful, broadcasting commands require a careful approach and understanding of the environments you���re working with. Always double-check and test commands in each environment, use aliases judiciously, and consider implementing safety measures to prevent mistakes or data loss.

Ok well I set up my alias in Autohotkey so I would do something like
::importmy::alias pls = sudo !!

And so on
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Using AutoHotKey (AHK) to create shortcuts or aliases can be a great approach, especially when working across multiple operating systems. AHK allows you to define hotstrings that expand abbreviations as you type them, which is useful for creating shortcuts for commonly used commands or strings of text. Here���s a simplified example based on your input:
Sample AHK Script:
autohotkey
Copy code
::pls::sudo !!
::ll::ls -la
::gedit::vim
Steps to Use AHK for Alias:
Install AutoHotKey:
Ensure that AutoHotKey is installed on your system.
Create Script:
Write your aliases in a new script file with the
.ahk
extension.
Run Script:
Double-click on the script to run it.
Use Aliases:
Once the script is running, you can type your abbreviations, and they will be automatically replaced with the full command.
Important Notes:
Scope:
AHK works at the level of the Windows OS, so the aliases you set up will be active in all applications, not just your terminal. Ensure your aliases are unique enough that they won���t interfere with normal typing in other applications.
Limited to Windows:
AutoHotKey is a Windows application, so these aliases won���t work on Linux or macOS terminals.
For Terminal Commands:
Ensure that the terminal or SSH client you use on Windows can understand and correctly interpret the commands and aliases you set up.
Conclusion:
AutoHotKey can be a valuable tool for creating command aliases on Windows, but remember to use unique aliases to avoid conflicts and consider the limitations of using this approach across different operating systems. Ensure that any command you alias via AHK is tested and behaves as expected in your terminal or command-line environment.

Ok so I would put my Linux aliases in autohotkey, then I can just type the shortcut to pull them in, rather than change the dot files in the Linux distribution
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Using AutoHotKey for your Linux command aliases while on a Windows system can indeed be a useful approach, especially if you are working with multiple Linux distributions or machines and don't want to configure aliases on each of them. However, there are a few caveats and considerations:
Considerations:
Compatibility:
Ensure the terminal emulator or SSH client you are using on Windows properly understands and interprets the AutoHotKey expansions. Some terminal emulators might not support this seamlessly.
Consistency Across Environments:
If you switch between Windows and Linux frequently, you might find some inconsistency in using aliases, as AHK scripts only run on Windows. You would need a similar solution on Linux for a consistent experience, which usually involves editing shell profile files like
.bashrc
or
.zshrc
.
OS-Level Aliases:
Remember that AHK operates on the OS level. If you use aliases common to command names, it might interfere with other applications or text fields where you don't intend to use them.
Suggested Workflow:
Use AHK for Windows-Centric Aliases:
Create AHK aliases for commands you mainly use on Windows or in your terminal emulator.
Use Shell Profile Files for Linux Aliases:
For a consistent experience across different terminals and distributions, still consider adding your most crucial aliases to the
.bashrc
,
.zshrc
, or similar shell profile files on your Linux systems. This approach ensures that your aliases are always available, regardless of the terminal emulator or SSH client you are using.
Sync Dotfiles:
Consider using a dotfile manager or a Git repository to synchronize and manage your configuration files across multiple systems. This approach allows you to maintain a consistent environment on all your Linux machines without manually configuring each one.
Example Workflow:
On Windows: Use AHK for aliases that help with your Windows workflow or commands you often type into your terminal emulator.
On Linux: Use
.bashrc
or similar files to set up aliases that you want available on every Linux system you work on, providing a consistent experience.
Conclusion:
While AHK can be useful for creating quick aliases on Windows, using the native aliasing system on Linux provides a more consistent and reliable experience when working directly on Linux systems. Combining both methods judiciously allows for an efficient and streamlined workflow across different operating systems.

I see all your problems but clearly I am using it fine, there is wsl for Windows, gitbash ming64 command powershell docker. I have a mac and other Linux computers but I usually only ever access them from window. The Autohotkey shortcuts work across the applications although there are a few terminal emulators that don't read them. I use alt-p to bring up my shortcuts and to  F8 run the script, so I test each function right away and can revert it. Of course I have to use alt-a , to rename a window in byobu because I don't have the f8 key
1 / 1
ChatGPT
It sounds like you have a well-established workflow that's working effectively for you. Using AutoHotKey in the manner you described, especially with careful testing and the ability to revert changes quickly, is indeed a valid and efficient approach for managing command shortcuts across various terminals and systems from a Windows environment.
The process of setting up and fine-tuning such a system to cater to one's specific needs is often a journey of trial, error, and continuous improvement. If you find that this setup increases your productivity and doesn���t hinder your work on different terminals and systems, then it���s a good solution for you.
If you have any specific questions, need assistance, or want advice on refining your setup further, feel free to ask. For users with similar requirements, your approach provides an example of an alternative workflow that might suit their needs as well.

This AutoHotKey script seems to be a prototype for a keyboard layout where each English lowercase letter is replaced with a symbol from the Standard Galactic Alphabet in Unicode when typed. Here���s a brief overview:
Environment Setup:
#NoEnv
improves performance and ensures compatibility with future AutoHotKey releases.
SendMode Input
is set for its superior speed and reliability.
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%
sets the working directory to the script's directory.
Key Replacement Setup (Standard Galactic Alphabet):
Each lowercase English letter from ���a��� to ���z��� is replaced with a corresponding Unicode character from the Standard Galactic Alphabet when typed.
This is done using the
:*:key::replacement
syntax in AutoHotKey, which replaces
key
with
replacement
when
key
is typed.
Script Suspension Toggle:
The script can be suspended and resumed by pressing
Alt + Home
.
This is done using the
!Home::Suspend
syntax in AutoHotKey.
How to Use:
Save this script in a file with an
.ahk
extension (e.g.,
tosga.ahk
).
Run the script using the AutoHotKey program.
Once the script is running, typing any lowercase letter from ���a��� to ���z��� will output the corresponding Standard Galactic Alphabet character.
To temporarily disable the script, press
Alt + Home
. Press
Alt + Home
again to re-enable it.
Points to Note:
Ensure that the device or application where you're typing supports the Unicode characters for the Standard Galactic Alphabet, as not all devices, applications, or fonts may support these specific Unicode characters.
You might want to consider adding a mechanism for toggling between uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and other symbols as needed.
Always run scripts from trusted sources to avoid security risks.
Remember to have AutoHotKey installed on your system to use this script.

1 / 1
Hmm I do have a few issues but mostly I mapped them to their closest Latin equivalent and used upper case to use the emphatic or pharanealized version where possible. There are still a lot of capital letters available for additional diacritics and ligatures.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your approach to mapping phonetically similar Latin characters to Arabic ones is a reasonable starting point for creating an intuitive and user-friendly keyboard layout. Using uppercase letters for emphatic or pharyngealized versions is a logical extension of this idea.
For further refining your keyboard layout, you might want to consider the following suggestions:
1.
Consider Diacritics:
Arabic script has various diacritics (like Fatha, Damma, Kasra, etc.) that play a crucial role in pronunciation. You might want to assign specific keys or combinations for these diacritics.
2.
Handle Ligatures:
Arabic script often forms ligatures when characters are combined. If there are common ligatures that aren���t naturally formed when typing individual characters, consider creating specific key combinations for these as well.
3.
User Feedback:
Get feedback from potential users who are fluent in Arabic and familiar with the Latin script. They might provide valuable insights into which mappings feel most intuitive and which might need adjustment.
4.
Diacritic Handling:
Since you have remaining uppercase letters, you might use them to represent various diacritics or other Arabic script features, providing a broader and more accurate representation of the script.
5.
Documentation:
Ensure to create thorough documentation for users, as the mappings won���t be immediately obvious to new users. Consider developing an interactive guide or tutorial to assist users in learning the new layout.
6.
Iterative Refinement:
Your keyboard layout will likely need adjustments and refinements over time. Be open to making changes based on user feedback and your own experiences using the layout.
Final Thought:
Developing a keyboard layout is an iterative process, and the best layout will ultimately depend on the preferences and needs of its users. The most successful layouts often undergo multiple rounds of refinement and user testing to ensure they���re as intuitive and user-friendly as possible.

You're right Maybe I could use w to represent sheen, and x for weapon tsade
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Choosing intuitive mappings that are easy to remember for users is crucial for a successful custom keyboard layout. The idea of using 'w' for 'sheen' (����) since it somewhat visually resembles a double 'u' or 'w', and 'x' for 'tsade' (����), associating with 'weapon', seems reasonable. These mnemonic aids can facilitate users in learning and remembering the layout more efficiently.
When implementing these changes, remember to update both the script and any documentation or user guides you create to reflect the revised mappings. Consistency across all materials is key to avoiding confusion.
If you proceed with creating a typing tutor, consider incorporating exercises or lessons that specifically practice these and other potentially confusing or non-intuitive mappings, helping users to internalize them more quickly.
Remember to always gather feedback from users after making changes to understand if the new mappings are indeed more intuitive or if further adjustments are needed. The user experience should guide the iterative development and refinement of your keyboard layouts. Good luck with your project!
