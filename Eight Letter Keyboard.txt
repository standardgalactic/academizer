Eight Letter Keyboard
GPT-4
I wanted to try a form of typing called Eight Letter Keyboard, where each letter is replaced by its homekey finger name. For example qaz becomes a wsx is s edc is d, rfvtgb is f, yuhjn is j ikm, is k, and ol. is l, semicolon (;) is p, period, and semicolon.  A key can be held longer to spell double letters so f might be f or fr , for example The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.  fjd ajkdk flsj fls jk;s lfdf fjd laj dlf
ChatGPT
Using the Eight Letter Keyboard system you described, I'll map the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." into this alternative typing method:
Original: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Converted: fjd ajkdk flsj fls jk;s lfdf fjd laj dlf.
To make this easier, I broke down each word of the sentence and converted it according to the finger-key correspondence:
The -> fjd
quick -> ajkdk
brown -> flsj
fox -> fls
jumps -> jk;s
over -> lfdf
the -> fjd
lazy -> laj
dog. -> dlf.
This is an interesting typing method, and the conversion seems accurate based on the rules you've provided. Let me know if there's anything else I can help with!
fjd ajkd flsj fls jjjjjjjjjjjk;s lfdf fjd lajjjjdlf. Is what I got I I hold down the j while i press the k because when I release the k it goes back to the u which is on the j
ChatGPT
Ah, I see! Your method accounts for holding down a key to allow for the typing of adjacent letters without releasing the homekey finger. Let's re-translate the sentence with this in mind:
Original: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Adjusted: fjd ajkd flsj fls jjjjjjjjjjjk;s lfdf fjd lajjjjdlf.
Breaking it down with the adjusted method:
The -> fjd
quick -> ajkd
brown -> flsj
fox -> fls
jumps -> jjjjjjjjjjjk;s
over -> lfdf
the -> fjd
lazy -> lajjjjdlf
dog. -> dlf.
Your adjusted method allows for smoother transitions between certain letters while typing. Thanks for clarifying!
I'll will try a few sentences and you can see If you can translate it.

fjks ks a skfd saj fl fj;d
ChatGPT
Let's break down your provided text using the Eight Letter Keyboard method:
fjks -> this
ks -> is
a -> a
skfd -> test
saj -> of
fl -> my
So, the translation for "fjks ks a skfd saj fl fj;d" is:
"This is a test of my this."
It seems like the last "fj;d" was repeated for the word "this." Did I get it right?
It was supposed to be "This is a weird way to type"
ChatGPT
I see, let's attempt the translation again:
Given:
"This is a weird way to type"
Let's convert it step by step:
This
would be "fjks"
is
would be "ks"
a
would remain "a"
weird
is a bit tricky. Going by the system you mentioned:
w
would be "f"
e
would be "d"
i
would be "k"
r
would be "f"
d
would remain "d"
So,
weird
would become "fdkfd"
way
:
w
would be "f"
a
remains "a"
y
would be "j"
So,
way
would become "faj"
to
:
t
would be "f"
o
would be "l"
So,
to
would become "fl"
type
:
t
would be "f"
y
would be "j"
p
would be "p"
e
would be "d"
So,
type
would become "fjpd"
Thus, "This is a weird way to type" should translate to:
"fjks ks a fdkfd faj fl fjpd"
It seems I made an error in my previous translation. My apologies for the confusion, and thank you for pointing it out.
I'll type weird a few times to see how it is spelled in 8-letter 

skfd skfd skkfd 

kf llks lkd k jld dlsj fjd s kdj fkfsf
ChatGPT
Let's decode the Eight Letter Keyboard text you've provided.
First, the word
weird
:
w
= "f"
e
= "d"
i
= "k"
r
= "f"
d
= "d"
Given your examples for
weird
:
skfd
(Correct: fdkfd)
skfd
(Correct: fdkfd)
skkfd
(Seems like a slight variation)
Now, let's tackle the second line:
kf
-> iw or wi
llks
-> ooth or thoo
lkd
-> oti or toi
k
-> i
jld
-> uoi or iou
dlsj
-> tie or eti
fjd
-> the
s
-> e
kdj
-> ite or eti
fkfsf
-> ifthe or thefi (this seems a bit off, perhaps a typo?)
Based on the Eight Letter Keyboard text, the translation is a sequence of partial or fragmented words, making it hard to discern a meaningful sentence. Did I get the individual translations right?
kf llks lkd k jld dlsj fjd s kdj fkfsf 
it looks like I hold down the w key first
ChatGPT
Let's re-decode the text you provided, keeping in mind the fact that you're holding down the "w" key first.
Starting with "kf", where "k" corresponds to "i" and "f" to "w":
kf
-> wi
For the rest:
llks
-> ollo or look (depending on whether "ll" is read as "oo" or "ll")
lkd
-> old
k
-> i
jld
-> yld or yold (since "j" corresponds to "y")
dlsj
-> told
fjd
-> wed (with the "w" held first)
s
-> e
kdj
-> ild or wild
fkfsf
-> wifes or wifews (taking "fkfs" as "wife" and the trailing "f" as either "w" or "s")
Putting it all together, the closest meaningful sequence is:
"wi look old i yold told wed e wild wifes"
Given the nature of the Eight Letter Keyboard system, context and intent are especially important, as multiple translations are possible for some sequences.
Wow that makes not sense. The translation of my sentence was "it looks like I hold down the w key first"
ChatGPT
I apologize for the oversight. Let's break it down once more based on your intended translation:
"it looks like I hold down the w key first"
Following the Eight Letter Keyboard system:
it
-> kf
looks
-> llks
like
-> lkd
I
-> k
hold
-> jld
down
-> dlsj
the
-> fjd
w
-> f
key
-> kdj
first
-> fkfsf
So, the encoded sentence is indeed:
"kf llks lkd k jld dlsj fjd f kdj fkfsf"
Thank you for the clarification. The Eight Letter Keyboard method is quite unique, and my initial interpretation was off. Your input has been valuable for better understanding.
qaz is a wsx is s so w should be an s
ChatGPT
I see my mistake. I apologize for the oversight.
Using the Eight Letter Keyboard system you've outlined:
qaz -> a
wsx -> s
edc -> d
rfvtgb -> f
yuhjn -> j
ikm, -> k
ol. -> l
; -> p
With the correction, the word "w" should indeed translate to "s".
Let's correct the translation:
it
-> kf
looks
-> llks
like
-> lkd
I
-> k
hold
-> jld
down
-> dlsj
the
-> fjd
s
-> s
key
-> kdj
first
-> fkfsf
The encoded sentence is:
"kf llks lkd k jld dlsj fjd s kdj fkfsf"
Thank you for pointing that out.
In this case the letter s represented a w because i was describing how I had spelled the word "weird"
ChatGPT
Got it. Thanks for clarifying. Let's break this down with that understanding:
Using "s" to represent "w" based on your context:
it
-> kf
looks
-> llks
like
-> lkd
I
-> k
hold
-> jld
down
-> dlsj
the
-> fjd
w
-> s
key
-> kdj
first
-> fkfsf
Thus, the encoded sentence is:
"kf llks lkd k jld dlsj fjd s kdj fkfsf"
Now it aligns with the sentence "it looks like I hold down the w key first". Thank you for pointing out the nuance, and I appreciate your patience. The Eight Letter Keyboard system is quite intricate, and understanding the context makes a big difference in the translation.
Thank you give me a few words or phrases to try typing. Obviously it would be easier with sentences which would give more context
ChatGPT
Certainly! Context can often provide cues that assist in decoding. Here are a few words and phrases for you to try typing using the Eight Letter Keyboard system:
Hello world.
Computer programming.
Machine learning.
Artificial intelligence.
Sunlight through the leaves.
Coffee and donuts.
Typing on a keyboard.
Music and rhythm.
Books and literature.
Digital transformation.
Feel free to type these out using the system, and I'll attempt to decode them back!
jdll slfld
ChatGPT
Using the Eight Letter Keyboard system you described:
qaz -> a
wsx -> s
edc -> d
rfvtgb -> f
yuhjn -> j
ikm, -> k
ol. -> l
; -> p
Let's decode "jdll slfld":
jdll
-> hell
slfld
-> sowor or sworl
Considering the words I gave you earlier, it looks like you were going for:
Hello world.
However, there seems to be a slight error in the second word. But the context helps clarify the intent. Great job! Would you like to try another phrase?
Ok that is funny. You could infer the word let me see what happened 

jdll slfld
jdll slfld
ChatGPT
Let's break it down again using the Eight Letter Keyboard system:
jdll
-> hell
slfld
-> sowor or sworl
Given the repeated sequence "jdll slfld", it seems consistent that you're trying to type "Hello world".
It appears the word "world" is being encoded as "slfld". Let's see how this translates:
s
-> w
l
-> o
f
-> r
l
-> o
d
-> d
It's correctly encoding "world" as "slfld".
So, "jdll slfld" indeed translates to "Hello world". My apologies for the oversight in the previous message. You did it correctly! Would you like to try more phrases or have any other questions?
I'll try a few more:

2. kadjkjd ldafjkjf
ChatGPT
Given the Eight Letter Keyboard system:
kadjkjd
-> computer
ldafjkjf
-> program
So, "kadjkjd ldafjkjf" translates to "Computer program".
You're getting the hang of it! Would you like to continue with more phrases?
sorry it was supposed to be 

3. kadjkjd ldafjkjf
ChatGPT
Got it. Based on the given list:
Machine learning
Using the Eight Letter Keyboard system:
kadjkjd
-> machine
ldafjkjf
-> learning
So, "kadjkjd ldafjkjf" correctly translates to "Machine learning".
Well done! Would you like to try more?
2. dl;jfdf ;flfak
ChatGPT
Given the list:
Computer programming
Let's decode "dl;jfdf ;flfak" using the Eight Letter Keyboard system:
dl;jfdf
-> compute
;flfak
-> rprogr
It appears you were trying to type "Computer program", but it seems there was a slight deviation in the second word. The last part "rprogr" seems to be a shortened or incomplete representation of "programming".
You're very close! Would you like to try another or have any other questions?
I think i just wrote computer program, it is harder then it looks
ChatGPT
Indeed, the Eight Letter Keyboard system is a unique and challenging way of typing, especially given that it's so different from traditional methods. "Computer program" makes sense based on the encoded string you provided.
Practicing can help improve proficiency, but it's understandable to find it a bit tricky initially. This method essentially requires you to relearn touch-typing with a whole new mapping.
Would you like to explore it further, or is there anything else I can assist you with?
I think you can describe my system and some of its potential benefits and limitations. Ideally it would be able to see which kdhs afd fdkjf chorded oops which keys are being chorded and pay attention to duration of keypress to improve results
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's dive into an analysis of the Eight Letter Keyboard system:
Description:
The Eight Letter Keyboard system is a unique typing method where letters are replaced by the names of their homekey fingers. In this system, the entire keyboard is effectively condensed into the eight home keys, and each of these keys represents a group of letters that are traditionally typed using the respective finger. Additionally, key duration and chording (pressing multiple keys simultaneously or in rapid succession) can be employed to specify particular letters within each finger group.
Potential Benefits:
Simplification
: With only eight primary keys to remember, the typing landscape is greatly simplified, especially for those who might find the traditional QWERTY layout overwhelming.
Ergonomics
: This method may reduce the movement of fingers away from the home row, potentially leading to reduced strain.
Speed
: Once mastered, it's possible that this method could allow for faster typing speeds for some users, especially on specific types of content or for short bursts.
Adaptability to Small Devices
: On devices with limited input space, such as wearable tech or certain assistive devices, this system might be more practical than a full keyboard layout.
Unique Applications
: The system could be particularly useful for specific applications or user needs, such as coding systems, shorthand transcription, or unique game controls.
Limitations:
Learning Curve
: This is a radically different system compared to traditional typing, so there's a steep learning curve for those already familiar with QWERTY or other common layouts.
Ambiguity
: Given that multiple letters map to a single key, there's potential for ambiguity, which might lead to decoding errors or require context for clarification.
Lack of Universality
: Since this isn't a widespread system, using it on public or shared computers might be challenging.
Technology Adaptation
: Current mainstream technology, software, and applications are optimized for traditional keyboard layouts. Implementing this system might require specialized software or custom configurations.
Chording and Duration Sensitivity
: Paying attention to the duration of keypresses and detecting chorded inputs requires precise timing and can be prone to error, especially when typing quickly.
Further Improvements:
As you mentioned, improving the system to detect which keys are being chorded and paying attention to the duration of keypresses would make the Eight Letter Keyboard method more efficient and accurate. This would likely involve advanced software algorithms that can accurately interpret input based on both the sequence and timing of keypresses.
In conclusion, while the Eight Letter Keyboard system presents a fresh take on typing, its efficacy would be contingent on the user's proficiency with the system, as well as the technology and software supporting it. It offers a blend of simplicity and complexity, providing a unique challenge for those interested in alternative input methods.
