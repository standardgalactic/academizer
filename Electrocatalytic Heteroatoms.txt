1. Introduction 
With increasing attention on climate change, the fixation and 
transformation of carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas, has 
become a hot topic for chemical researchers.[1���6]CO2is a one- 
carbon (C1) source that is nontoxic, nonflammable, renewable, 
abundant, and inexpensive. The use of CO2instead of toxic 
phosgene or CO in organic synthesis has high value in research 
and development.[7���13]Unfortunately, the high thermodynamic 
stability and kinetic inertness of CO2make its chemical trans- 
formation very difficult. To solve this problem, the classical 
method is to trap it with highly reactive compounds, such as 
Grignard or organolithium reagents. However, this method has 
poor functional group compatibility and requires strictly anhy- 
drous and anaerobic conditions. To address these problems, 
CO2fixation processes with less reactive organometallic re- 
agents (such as boron or zinc reagents) or halogenated hydro- 
carbons have been developed in recent years.[14]However, 
these methods require prefunctionalization of the substrate, 
and also produce needless waste, and thus, fail to meet the re- 
quirements of green and sustainable chemistry. Although tran- 
sition-metal-catalyzed reductive carboxylation of unsaturated 
hydrocarbons partially solves the problem of substrate pre- 
functionalization, these reactions still generally require stoi- 
chiometric or even excessive amounts of reductants, such as 
organozinc reagents, aluminum reagents, or hydrosilanes.[15,16] 
The functionalization of C@H bonds is an important method 
forconstructingcarbon���carbonandcarbon���heteroatom 
bonds in organic chemistry.[17���21]In light of its high atom and 
step economy, C@H bond functionalization demonstrates a 
wide range of application in the syntheses of pharmaceuticals, 
natural products, and organic materials.[22���24]The use of ubiqui- 
tous C@H bonds to react with CO2is 
an ideal way to produce 
high value-added chemicals. Key to achieving this goal is to 
combine the selective activation and functionalization of inert 
C@H bonds with the activation of CO2. 
Organized according to 
the types of C@H bond involved in the reaction, this review 
summarizes recent progress in the functionalization of C@H 
bonds with CO2as a carboxylative reagent. We note that some 
published reviews cover part of contents in this paper. For ex- 
ample, C@H carboxylation of aromatic compounds through 
CO2fixation has been reviewed recently.[3]The direct carboxy- 
lation of C(sp3)@H and C(sp2)@H bonds with CO2by 
transition- 
metal-catalyzed and base-mediated reactions has also been 
surveyed.[25]However, some important aspects, including sever- 
al specific types of C@H carboxylation reactions, transition- 
metal-free reactions (including Lewis acid mediated reactions), 
multicomponent reactions, tandem reactions, and key theoreti- 
cal studies related to the carboxylation of C@H bonds, are 
overlooked. To this end, it is highly desirable to thoroughly 
summarize the field of C@H carboxylation with CO2. 
By doing 
so, we can find many interesting points, which will enhance 
our understanding of this exciting field. For example, many 
transition-metal-catalyzed C@H carboxylation reactions with 
CO2(including C(sp)@H bonds and C(sp2)@H bonds) can be de- 
veloped into transition-metal-free versions (see Sections 2.2.4 
and 3.1.1.2., and Scheme 56); copper can catalyze all types of 
C@H carboxylation reactions with CO2(e.g., 
see Sections 2.1.1, 
2.2.1, 2.3, and 3.1.1.1, and Schemes 71 and 78); bases can me- 
diate all types of C@H carboxylation reactions for substrates 
with relatively acidic C@H bonds (e.g., see Sections 2.2.4, 
3.1.1.2, and 3.3 and Schemes 68 and 73); and all types of C@H 
carboxylation reactions can be incorporated into tandem or se- 
quential reactions (e.g., see Section 2.3 and Schemes 45, 55, 
and 70).

whereas, at higher temperature, methane reacts with O2 
to give methanol, or reacts with CO2to give acetic acid. Re- 
cently, Ge and co-workers reported a theoretical study of Zn- 
doped ceria-catalyzed C@C coupling reaction of CO2and 
meth- 
ane.[225]The results show that the Zn dopant stabilizes the 
methyl group through the formation of a Zn@C bond, thereby 
inhibiting subsequent dehydrogenation of methane. CO2can 
be inserted into the Zn@C bond in an activated bent configura- 
tion. The transition state of this insertion reaction is in the 
form of a three-centered Zn@C@C arrangement, with an activa- 
tion energy barrier of 0.51 eV. The acetate ion generated by 
C@C coupling can bind to the surface proton generated by dis- 
sociation of methane, and then desorbs in the form of free 
acetic acid. They also examined other possible dopants, such 
as Al, Ga, Cd, In, and Ni, and found a positive correlation be- 
tween the activation barrier of C@C coupling and the electro- 
negativity of the dopant. In addition, carboxylation reactions 
of methane and other simple alkanes with CO2have also been 
reported.[226���232] 
In 2017, Martin and co-workers reported a remote carboxyla- 
tionofhalogenatedaliphatichydrocarbonswithCO2 
(Scheme 85).[233]Neither purification nor isolation of the inter- 
mediate halogenated compounds was necessary for this regio- 
convergent carboxylation of alkanes with CO2to obtain single- 
regioisomer carboxylic acids. Tunable and controllable dis- 
placement of the Ni catalyst through a saturated hydrocarbon 
side chain enables switchable site-selective carboxylation at 
remote C(sp3)@H sites. 
5. Summary and Outlook 
The carboxylation of C@H bonds with CO2combines 
the activa- 
tion of chemically inert C@H bonds with thermodynamically 
stable CO2and thus has great research value. This type of reac- 
tion has developed rapidly in recent years and many important 
advances have been made. The advantages are as follows: 
1) the use of CO2as a C1source avoids the use of toxic CO or 
phosgene; 2) C@H bonds are ubiquitous in organic molecules; 
3) it conforms with the requirements of green chemistry, in 
terms of atom economy and step economy; 4) it is easy to in- 
corporate into tandem or multicomponent reactions; and 
5) many reactions have good industrial application prospects, 
such as the syntheses of FDCA and sodium acrylate. 
The Kolbe���Schmitt reaction, a classical C@H bond carboxyla- 
tion with CO2, has been an industrial method for producing 
salicylic acid. At present, there are several problems in this 
field: the reaction conditions are relatively harsh in many 
cases, for example, requiring high temperature or high-pres- 
sure CO2; there is still much room for expansion in the scope 
of the substrates, especially the carboxylation of C(sp3)@H 
bonds; many reactions still require stoichiometric additives
metal-exchange reagents; some carboxylation catalysts are not 
sufficiently efficient; some reactions are unsatisfactory in terms 
of chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivity; the mechanism of 
some reactions is not clear; green reaction media are still 
rarely used; and the cost and recovery of catalysts remains a 
problem. In terms of the reaction mechanism, a dual activation 
strategy is more promising than the single activation of C@H 
bonds or CO2. Inexpensive metal catalysis, transition-metal- 
free, electrochemical, and light-driven methods deserve more 
attention. Combining theoretical calculations with experimen- 
tal research will certainly promote the growth of this field. 
More effective integration of CO2capture and chemical trans- 
formation is still a major challenge in this field.

At higher temperatures, methane can react with O2 to produce methanol, or with CO2 to yield acetic acid. A study by Ge et al. on Zn-doped ceria-catalyzed C-C coupling reactions of CO2 and methane showed that Zn doping stabilizes the methyl group, inhibiting methane's dehydrogenation. CO2 can insert into the Zn-C bond, with the transition state having a three-centered Zn-C-C arrangement. Martin et al. reported remote carboxylation of halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons with CO2, allowing regioconvergent carboxylation of alkanes with CO2 to yield single-regioisomer carboxylic acids. The review emphasizes the research value and rapid development of C-H bond carboxylation with CO2.

Abstract
The electrolysis of organic acids has garnered increasing attention in recent years. In addition to the famous electrochemical decarboxylation known as Kolbe electrolysis, a number of other electrochemical processes have been recently established that allow for the construction of carbon���heteroatom and sulfur���heteroatom bonds from organic acids. Herein, recent advances in electrochemical C���X and S���X (X=N, O, S, Se) bond-forming reactions from five classes of organic acids and their conjugate bases, namely, carboxylic, thiocarboxylic, phosphonic, sulfinic, and sulfonic acids, are surveyed.

1 Introduction
Organic electrochemistry represents one of the most powerful and sustainable methods in organic chemistry.1 Hazardous stoichiometric external oxidants or reductants generally used in conventional organic synthesis can be avoided or used in catalytic amounts through organic electrosynthesis.2 Among the oxidative coupling reactions, external oxidant-free methods with hydrogen evolution are particularly attractive; these can be realized by employing organic electrochemistry.3 Additionally, in certain cases, some chemical reagents, such as strong bases or highly active oxidants, can be electrogenerated in situ; these are both environmentally friendly and mechanistically interesting.4 Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of organic electrosynthesis in inert bond functionalization5 and difunctionalization of alkenes or alkynes.6

The electro-decarboxylation of aliphatic carboxylic acids to form dimeric products, known as the Kolbe reaction, has found widespread application in organic electrochemistry.7 Mechanistically, alkyl radicals are generated and coupled in a classical Kolbe reaction. In recent years, the concept of Kolbe electrolysis has been largely expanded due to the rich chemistry of alkyl radicals.8 In addition, a number of non-decarboxylative electrochemical transformations of carboxylic acids have also been developed in recent years. Prior to the extrusion of carbon dioxide, the carboxylic acid group can participate in various C���O bond-forming reactions to provide esters and lactones as products. The anodic oxidation of other organic acids, such as sulfinic acids, is very similar to that of carboxylic acids. Sulfinic acids, such as CF3SO2Na, were well known to release SO2 through anodic oxidation. It should be noted that, generally, C���S or S���X, instead of C���O or O���X, bond-forming reactions are observed in the electrolysis of thiocarboxylic acids and sulfinic acids. Herein, recent advances in C���O, C���S, and S���X (X=N, O, S, Se) bond-formation reactions, involving organic acidic functional groups, through electrochemical methods are summarized based on the types of reacting organic acid substrates. The organic acids involved in this review include carboxylic, thiocarboxylic, phosphonic, sulfinic, and sulfonic acids. Representative examples involving C���H functionalization and alkene/alkyne difunctionalization processes are highlighted. Electrochemical reactions involving merely expulsion of CO2 or SO2 from respective carboxylic acids or sulfinic acids are out of the scope of this review.

ChatGPT
A heteroatom is an atom in a molecule that is neither carbon nor hydrogen. Typically, heteroatoms are elements like oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, or halogens (such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). These atoms are called "heteroatoms" because they are the "other" atoms that differ from the carbon and hydrogen framework typically found in organic compounds. Heteroatoms often play a crucial role in determining the chemical properties and reactivity of a molecule, as they can introduce different functionalities and interactions.
