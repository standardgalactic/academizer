ABSTRACT 
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI, but are constrained by 
limited context windows, hindering their utility in tasks like extended conversa- 
tions and document analysis. To enable using context beyond limited context win- 
dows, we propose virtual context management, a technique drawing inspiration 
from hierarchical memory systems in traditional operating systems that provide 
the appearance of large memory resources through data movement between fast 
and slow memory. Using this technique, we introduce MemGPT (Memory-GPT), 
a system that intelligently manages different memory tiers in order to effectively 
provide extended context within the LLM���s limited context window, and utilizes 
interrupts to manage control l ow between itself and the user. We evaluate our 
OS-inspired design in two domains where the limited context windows of modern 
LLMs severely handicaps their performance: document analysis, where MemGPT 
is able to analyze large documents that far exceed the underlying LLM���s con- 
text window, and multi-session chat, where MemGPT can create conversational 
agents that remember, ref l ect, and evolve dynamically through long-term interac- 
tions with their users. We release MemGPT code and data for our experiments at

1INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, large language models (LLMs) and their underlying transformer architec- 
ture (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022) have become 
thecornerstoneofconversationalAIandhaveledtoawidearrayofconsumerandenterpriseapplica- 
tions. Despite these advances, the limited i xed-length context windows used by LLMs signif i cantly 
hinders their applicability to long conversations or reasoning about long documents. For example, 
the most widely used open-source LLMs can only support a few dozen back-and-forth messages or 
reason about a short document before exceeding their maximum input length (Touvron et al., 2023). 
Naively extending the context length of transformers incurs a quadratic increase in computational 
time and memory cost due to the transformer architecture���s self-attention mechanism, making the 
design of new long-context architectures a pressing research challenge (Dai et al., 2019; Kitaev 
et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020). While developing longer models is an active area of research 
(Dong et al., 2023), even if we could overcome the computational challenges of context scaling, 
recent research shows that long-context models struggle to utilize additional context effectively (Liu 
et al., 2023a). As consequence, given the considerable resources needed to train state-of-the-art 
LLMs and apparent diminishing returns of context scaling, there is a critical need for alternative 
techniques to support long context. 
In this paper, we study how to provide the illusion of an inf i nite context while continuing to use 
i xed-context models. Our approach borrows from the idea of virtual memory paging that was 
developed to enable applications to work on datasets that far exceed the available memory. We 
leveragetherecentprogressinfunctioncallingabilitiesofLLMagents(Schicketal.,2023;Liuetal., 
2023b) to design MemGPT, an OS-inspired LLM system for virtual context management. We 
draw inspiration from traditional OSes��� hierarchical memory management to effectively ���page��� in

Figure 1: In MemGPT (components shaded), a i xed-context LLM is augmented with a hierarchical 
memory system and functions that let it manage its own memory. The LLM processor takes main 
context (analogous to OS main memory/RAM) as input, and outputs text interpreted by a parser, 
resulting either in a yield or a function call. MemGPT uses functions to move data between main 
context and external context (analogous to OS disk memory). When the processor generates a 
function call, it can request control ahead of time to chain together functions. When yielding, the 
processor is paused until the next external event (e.g., a user message or scheduled interrupt). 
and out information between context windows (analogous to ���main memory��� in operating systems) 
and external storage. MemGPT manages the control l ow between the memory management, the 
LLM processing module, and user. This design allows for repeated context modif i cations during a 
single task, allowing the agent to more effectively utilize its limited context. 
In MemGPT, we treat context windows as a constrained memory resource, and design a memory 
hiearchy for LLMs analogous to memory tiers used in traditional OSes (Patterson et al., 1988). 
Applications in traditional OSes interact with virtual memory, which provides an illusion of there 
being more memory resources than are actually available in physical (i.e., main) memory by the OS 
paging overf l ow data to disk and retrieving data (via a page fault) back into memory when accessed 
byapplications. Toprovideasimilarillusionoflongercontextlength(analogoustovirtualmemory), 
we allow the LLM to manage what is placed in its own context (analogous to physical memory) via 
an ���LLM OS���, which we call MemGPT. MemGPT enables the LLM to retrieve relevant historical 
data missing from what is placed in-context, similar to an OS page fault. Additionally, the agent can 
iteratively modify what is in context for a single task, in the same way a process may access virtual 
memory repeatedly. Figure 1 illustrates the components of MemGPT.

The abstract discusses a challenge faced by current large language models (LLMs) ��� they are constrained by limited context windows which hampers their utility in tasks like extended conversations and document analysis. This means that while they can produce responses based on recent input, they might struggle with retaining context from earlier in the conversation or from large documents.
The authors propose a solution called MemGPT (Memory-GPT), which is inspired by the way traditional operating systems manage memory. This system uses virtual context management, a technique similar to how operating systems give the appearance of having more memory than they physically possess by moving data between faster (but limited) memory and slower (but more abundant) memory. The idea is that by managing different memory tiers, MemGPT can offer extended context even within the constraints of the LLM's context window.
The introduction dives deeper into the problem. LLMs, such as the transformer architecture, have transformed conversational AI. However, their fixed-length context windows limit their capability to manage long conversations or analyze extensive documents. Extending the context length isn't feasible because of computational costs and inefficiencies.
The solution proposed, MemGPT, takes inspiration from virtual memory paging in traditional operating systems. The system essentially allows the model to "page" or move information between its current context (analogous to an OS's RAM) and an external storage (akin to an OS's disk memory). This system gives the illusion of an infinite context while working with fixed-context models.
The diagram (Figure 1) mentioned likely depicts how the system works, with various components and their interplay, showing how the model manages its memory in response to user inputs and how it can move data between its main context and an external context. The design allows the agent to use its limited context more efficiently, making it appear as if it's accessing a much larger memory space, similar to how traditional computer systems operate.
The combined use of a memory-hierarchy, OS functions and event-based control l ow allow 
MemGPT to handle unbounded context using LLMs that have i nite context windows. To demon- 
strate the utility of our new OS-inspired LLM system, we evaluate MemGPT on two domains where 
theperformanceofexistingLLMsisseverelylimitedbyf i nitecontext: documentanalysis, wherethe 
length of standard text i les can quickly exceed the input capacity of modern LLMs, and conversa- 
tional agents, where LLMs bound by limited conversation windows lack context awareness, persona 
consistency, and long-term memory during extended conversations. In both settings, MemGPT is 
able to overcome the limitations of i nite context to outperform existing LLM-based approaches. 
2MEMORY-GPT (MEMGPT) 
Inthissection, weoutlinetheimplementationofMemGPT,anOS-inspiredLLMsystemthatteaches 
LLMs to manage their own memory to achieve unbounded context. MemGPT���s multi-level mem- 
ory architecture delineates between two primary memory types: main context (analogous to main 
memory/physical memory/RAM) and external context (analogous to disk memory/disk storage). 
Main context is the standard i xed-context window in modern language models���anything in main 
context is considered in-context and can be accessed by the LLM processor during inference. Ex- 
ternal context refers to any information that is held outside of the LLMs i xed context window. This 
out-of-context data must always be explicitly moved into main context in order for it to be passed to

the LLM processor during inference. MemGPT provides function calls that the LLM processor can 
use to manage its own memory without any user intervention. 
2.1MAIN CONTEXT 
In MemGPT we refer to the LLM inputs (that are bound by the maximum number of input tokens) 
as the system���s main context. In LLM-based conversational agents, a signif i cant portion of main 
context tokens is generally used to hold a ���system message��� or ���preprompt��� that dictates the nature 
of the interaction to the system, while the remainder of the tokens can be used to hold conversation 
data (Touvron et al., 2023; SillyTavern, 2023). This preprompt is the main way to enable the system 
to adopt various distinct personas without requiring i netuning of the base model; depending on 
the use case, the preprompt can range from basic primers (e.g., ���You are a helpful assistant.���) to 
complex instructions comprising of thousands of tokens (e.g., a i ctional character card that includes 
the character���s background and example dialogue). Beyond conversational agents, large preprompts 
are also common when LLMs are used to solve complex tasks that require long instructions and/or 
instructions with many in-context examples (Liu et al., 2023b). 
Because of the importance of the preprompt in dictating system behavior, it is common for the pre- 
prompt to consume more than a thousand tokens, which means the entire context window in many 
modern LLMs will be exhausted only with a few dozen back-and-forth messages between the user 
and system. For example, a 1000 token preprompt (roughly the size of the MemGPT preprompt in 
our experiments) leaves space for only about 60 remaining messages when using 4K context models 
such as llama-2 or gpt-3.5-turbo (see Table 1 for more examples). In settings where the 
user is expected to communicate frequently with the system (for example, virtual companions or 
personalized assistants), it is easy to imagine exceeding the maximum conversation length even for 
models with 100k context windows in a matter of days (or potentially hours). Resursive summariza- 
tion (Wu et al., 2021b) is a simple way to address overf l owing context windows, however, recursive 
summarization is inherently lossy and eventually leads to large holes in the memory of the system 
(as we demonstrate in Section 3). This motivates the need for a more comprehensive way to manage 
memory for conversational systems that are meant to be used in long-term settings. 
In our experiments on multi-session chat and document analysis, we further divide main context 
into three components: system instructions, which hold the base LLM instructions (e.g., informa- 
tion describing MemGPT functions and control l ow to the LLM), conversational context, which 
holds a i rst-in-f i rst-out (FIFO) queue of recent event history (e.g., messages between the agent and 
user), and working context, which serves as a working memory scratchpad for the agent. System 
instructions are read-only and pinned to main context (they do not change during the lifetime of the 
MemGPT agent), conversational context is read-only with a special eviction policy (if the queue 
reaches a certain size, a portion of the front is truncated or compressed via recursive summariza- 
tion), and working context is writeable by the LLM processor via function calls. Combined, the 
three parts of main context cannot exceed the underlying LLM processors���s maximum context size, 
and in practice we limit the size of conversational context and working context to a i xed constant 
determined by the processor���s context window and the system instructions length.

The provided abstract and excerpt discuss the MemGPT system���a novel approach to enabling large language models (LLMs) to manage more extended context than they are natively capable of. Here's a concise summary:
MemGPT System Summary
Problem
: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are restricted by limited context windows. This restriction hampers their utility in extended conversations and document analysis where longer context is vital.
Solution
: Introduce the MemGPT (Memory-GPT) system that:
Uses
virtual context management
, inspired by hierarchical memory systems in traditional operating systems (OS). These systems provide the illusion of vast memory through data movement between fast (RAM) and slow (disk) memory.
Allows LLMs to manage their memory, mimicking the role of an operating system.
Incorporates
interrupts
to manage control flow between the system and the user.
Key Features
:
Main Context
: Analogous to RAM, it's the fixed-context window of LLMs. Contains:
System instructions
: Read-only instructions guiding the LLM.
Conversational context
: Holds a FIFO queue of recent event history.
Working context
: A scratchpad memory, writable by the LLM.
External Context
: Analogous to disk storage, it contains data outside the LLM's fixed context window. Data here needs to be moved into the Main Context for the LLM to process it.
Functionality
:
The LLM uses functions to move data between the Main and External Contexts. This way, it effectively manages its own memory without the user's intervention, thus accommodating extended conversations or large documents.
The system provides the illusion of a longer context to the user, similar to how virtual memory works in traditional OS.
Applications & Testing
:
MemGPT was tested in two areas:
Document Analysis
: The system could analyze large documents that exceeded the native context window of LLMs.
Multi-session Chat
: MemGPT enabled chatbots to remember, reflect, and evolve through long-term interactions, making them more context-aware and consistent over extended conversations.
The approach taken by MemGPT is novel, as it doesn't try to enlarge the LLM directly, which would be computationally expensive. Instead, it equips the LLM with the tools to manage its memory more effectively, similar to how operating systems manage computer memory.

working context without a memory warning from the system. 
2.2EXTERNAL CONTEXT 
External context refers to out-of-context storage that lies outside the context window of the LLM 
processor, analogous to disk memory (i.e. disk storage) in OSes. Information in external context is 
not immediately visible to the LLM processor, however, it can be brought into main context through 
appropriate function calls. In practice, the underlying storage in external context can take various 
forms which can be conf i gured for specif i c tasks: for example, for conversational agents it may be 
desireable to store full chat logs between the user and agent (that MemGPT can access at a later 
date), and for document analysis large document collections can be stored inside external context 
that MemGPT can bring into restricted main context via paginated function calls to disk. 
In our experiments, using MemGPT for multi-session chat and document analysis, we use databases 
to store text documents and embeddings/vectors, provide several ways for the LLM processor to 
query external context: timestamp-based search, text-based search, and embedding-based search. 
We make a distinction between two types of external context: recall storage, which stores the entire 
history of events processed by the LLM processor (in essense the full uncompressed queue from 
active memory), and archival storage, which serves as a general read-write datastore that the agent 
can utilize as overf l ow for the in-context read-write core memory. In the context of conversational 
agents, archival storage allows MemGPT to store facts, experiences, preferences, etc. about the 
agent or user beyond the strict token limit of main context, and search over recall storage allows 
the MemGPT to i nd past interactions related to a particular query or within a specif i c time period. 
In the context of document analysis, archival storage can be used to search over (and add to) an 
expansive document database. 
2.3SELF-DIRECTED EDITING AND RETRIEVAL 
MemGPT orchestrates data movement between main context and external context via function calls 
that are generated by the LLM processor. Memory edits and retrieval are entirely self-directed: 
MemGPT autonomously updates and searches through its own memory based on the current con- 
text. For instance, it can decide when to move items between contexts (Figure 2) and modify its 
main context to better ref l ect its evolving understanding of its current objectives and responsibilities 
(Figure 4). We implement self-directed editing and retrieval by providing explicit instructions within 
the preprompt that guide the system on how to interact with its memory systems. These instructions 
comprise two main components: (1) a detailed description of the memory hierarchy and their re- 
spective utilities, and (2) a function schema (complete with their natural language descriptions) that 
the system can call to access or modify its memory.

Duringeachinferencecycle, LLMprocessortakesmaincontext(concatenatedintoasinglestring)as

and if the parser validates the function arguments the function is executed. The results, including 
any runtime errors that occur (e.g. trying to add to main context when it is already at maximum 
capacity), are then fed back to the processor by MemGPT. This feedback loop enables the system 
to learn from its actions and adjust its behavior accordingly. Awareness of context limits is a key 
aspect in making the self-editing mechanism work effectively, to this end MemGPT prompts the 
processor with warnings regarding token limitations to guide its memory management decisions 
(Figure 3). Additionally, our memory retrieval mechanisms are designed to be cognizant of these 
token constraints and implement pagination to prevent retrieval calls from overf l owing the context 
window.
ChatGPT
This text describes a system named MemGPT, which is inspired by operating system (OS) memory management techniques to allow large language models (LLMs) to handle unbounded context. Here are the key points:
Problem Statement
: Traditional LLMs have a finite context window, which is the maximum amount of text they can consider at once. This limitation affects their performance in tasks like document analysis (where documents might be very long) and in conversational agents (where maintaining context over a long conversation is crucial).
MemGPT
: This system introduces a multi-level memory architecture to manage context, using concepts similar to a computer's RAM and disk storage.
Main Context
: Similar to RAM, it's a fixed-size window where all the information is directly accessible by the LLM. This includes system instructions, conversational context (like a message queue), and a "working context" for short-term storage. System instructions are static, conversational context follows a first-in-first-out (FIFO) strategy, and working context is dynamic, with the LLM writing data as needed.
External Context
: Similar to a computer's disk storage, it contains data not immediately accessible. Data here must be explicitly brought into the main context to be processed. There are different types of external context: recall storage (full history of processed events) and archival storage (a general-purpose database for storing facts, experiences, etc.).
Self-Directed Editing and Retrieval
: MemGPT can autonomously manage its own memory. It can decide when and what to move between main and external contexts based on the ongoing conversation. The LLM is also aware of context limits and can get warnings if it's nearing its token limit, prompting it to make memory management decisions.
Demonstration Examples
:
Figure 2
illustrates a situation where MemGPT takes details from a conversation (like Chad's birthday) and writes them to the working context without any prompting.
Figure 3
shows a scenario where MemGPT is warned about nearing its token limit and decides to save important information (like Chad's personality trait) to its memory.
Feedback Loop
: MemGPT learns and adapts its behavior through a feedback loop. After every action, the system checks if everything was correct and provides feedback. If there are issues (e.g., trying to add too much data to the main context), the LLM is informed and can adjust its behavior accordingly.
In essence, MemGPT is designed to address the limitations of finite context in LLMs by incorporating OS-inspired memory management techniques, making the system more adaptive and context-aware.
2.4CONTROL FLOW AND FUNCTION CHAINING 
In MemGPT, events trigger LLM inference: events are generalized inputs to MemGPT and can con- 
sist of user messages (in chat applications), system messages (e.g. main context capacity warnings), 
user interactions (e.g. an alert that a user just logged in, or an alert that they i nished uploading 
a document), and timed events that are run on a regular schedule (allowing MemGPT to run ���un- 
prompted��� without user intervention). MemGPT processes events with a parser to convert them into 
plain text messages that can be appended to main context and eventually be fed as input into the 
LLM processor. 
Many practical tasks require calling multiple functions in sequence, for example, navigating through 
multiple pages of results from a single query or collating data from different documents in main 
context from separate queries. Function chaining allows MemGPT to execute multiple function 
calls sequentially before returning control to the user. In MemGPT, functions can be called with 
a special l ag that requests control be immediately returned to the processor after the requested 
function completes execution. If this l ag is present, MemGPT will add the function output to 
main context and (as opposed to pausing processor execution). If this l ag is not present (a yield), 
MemGPT will not run the LLM processor until the next external event trigger (e.g. a user message 
or scheduled interrupt). 5

3EXPERIMENTS 
We assess MemGPT in two long-context domains: conversational agents and document analysis. 
For conversational agents, we expand the existing Multi-Session Chat dataset Xu et al. (2021) and 
introduce two new dialogue tasks that evaluate an agent���s ability to retain knowledge across long 
conversations. For document analysis, we benchmark MemGPT on existing tasks from Liu et al. 
(2023a) for question answering and key-value retrieval over lengthy documents. We also propose 
a new nested key-value retrieval task requiring collating information across multiple data sources, 
which tests the ability of an agent to collate information from multiple data sources (multi-hop 
retrieval). We publicly release our augmented MSC dataset, nested KV retrieval dataset, and a 
dataset of embeddings for 20M Wikipedia articles to facilitate future research. Our code for the full 
conversational and document analysis benchmarks is available at https://memgpt.ai. 
3.1MEMGPTFOR CONVERSATIONAL AGENTS 
Conversational agents like virtual companions and personalized assistants aim to engage users in 
natural, long-term interactions, potentially spanning weeks, months, or even years. This creates 
challenges for models with i xed-length contexts, which can only reference a limited history of the 
conversation. An ���inf i nite context��� agent should seamlessly handle continuous exchanges without 
boundary or reset. When conversing with a user, such an agent must satisfy two key criteria: 
��� Consistency- The agent should maintain conversational coherence. New facts, preferences, 
and events mentioned should align with prior statements from both the user and agent. 
��� Engagement- The agent should draw on long-term knowledge about the user to personalize 
responses. Referencing prior conversations makes dialogue more natural and engaging. 
We therefore assess our proposed model, MemGPT, on these two criteria: 
��� Does MemGPT leverage its memory to improve conversation consistency? Can it remem- 
ber relevant facts, preferences, and events from past interactions to maintain coherence? 
��� Does MemGPT produce more engaging dialogue by taking advantage of memory? Does it 
spontaneously incorporate long-range user information to personalize messages? 
By evaluating on consistency and engagement, we can determine how well MemGPT handles the 
challenges of long-term conversational interaction compared to i xed-context baselines. Its ability 
to satisfy these criteria will demonstrate whether unbounded context provides meaningful benef i ts for conversational agents. 6

This segment further delves into the workings and applications of MemGPT. Here are the main points:
Control Flow and Function Chaining
:
Events
: MemGPT's operation is event-driven. Events can be user messages, system alerts (e.g., reaching main context capacity), user interactions (e.g., document upload notifications), and scheduled events.
Event Processing
: These events are converted into plain text messages by a parser, which are then added to the main context and processed by the LLM.
Function Chaining
: MemGPT can execute multiple function calls in sequence. Functions can have a special flag requesting immediate return of control to the processor. Without this flag (a "yield"), the system waits for the next event to continue processing.
Example in Figure 4
: This depicts a conversation where the system corrects a user preference in the main context, showcasing the dynamic nature of MemGPT's memory system.
Experiments
:
Domains
: The researchers tested MemGPT in two areas: conversational agents and document analysis.
Datasets
: They expanded the Multi-Session Chat dataset and introduced new dialogue tasks. They also used existing tasks for document analysis and proposed a new task for nested key-value retrieval. They have made these datasets and a dataset of embeddings for 20M Wikipedia articles publicly available.

MemGPT for Conversational Agents
:
Goal
: Conversational agents aim for prolonged, natural interactions with users. Standard models with fixed-length contexts fall short in long interactions.
Infinite Context Agent
: Such an agent doesn't have boundaries or resets. It should fulfill two main criteria:
Consistency
: The agent should remain coherent in conversations, aligning new information with previous discussions.
Engagement
: The agent should reference past interactions for a more personalized and natural dialogue.
Evaluation Criteria
: The researchers evaluate MemGPT based on its consistency and engagement. They aim to understand if the model can recall past interactions to maintain coherence and if it can use its memory for more personalized and engaging dialogues. The main objective is to ascertain if MemGPT offers any real advantages for conversational agents when compared to fixed-context models.
In essence, this section provides a deeper understanding of how MemGPT operates, handles user interactions, and the potential benefits it can bring to the domain of conversational AI.
We introduce a new task based on the synthetic Key-Value retrieval proposed in prior work (Liu 
et al., 2023a). The goal of this task is to demonstrate how MemGPT can collate information from 
multiple data sources. In the original KV task, the authors generated a synthetic dataset of key-value 
pairs, where each key and value is a 128-bit UUID (universally unique identif i er). The agent is then 
given a key, and asked to return the associated value for the key. We create a version of the KV 
task, nested KV retrieval, where values themselves may be keys, thus requiring the agent to perform 
a multi-hop lookup. In our setup, we i x the total number of UUIDs pairs to 140, corresponding to 
roughly 8k tokens (the context length of our GPT-4 baseline). We vary the total number of nesting 
levels from 0 (the initial key-value pair���s value is not a key) to 4 (ie 4 total KV lookups are required 
to i nd the i nal value), and sample 30 different ordering conf i gurations including both the initial key 
position and nesting key positions. 
While GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have good performance on the original KV tasks, both struggle in the 
nested KV task. GPT-3.5 is unable to complete the nested variant of the task and has an immediate 
11 
Preprint 
dropoff in performance, hitting 0 percent accuracy at 1 nesting level (we observe that its primary 
failure mode is to simply returns the original value). GPT-4 is better than GPT-3.5, but also suffers 
from a similar dropoff, and hits 0 percent accuracy by 4 nesting levels. In GPT-4���s case, we observe 
that it often fails to recurse beyond a particular nesting level at simply returns the nested value at a 
previous nesting level. MemGPT on the other hand is unaffected with the number of nesting levels 
and is able to perform the nested lookup by accessing the key-value pairs stored in main memory 
repeatedly via function queries. MemGPT performance on the nested KV task demonstrates its 
ability to combine multiple queries to perform multi-hop lookups. 
4RELATED WORK

tion, improving search and retrieval for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and using language

The management of long contexts in LLMs is crucial for coherent and engaging dialogues for con- 
versational agents, and for corroborating and stitching together facts from diverse sources for LLMs 
used in question answering (QA). One approach to tackle the limitations of i xed-length context, 
is through recursive summarization (Wu et al., 2021a). In recursive summarization, the LLM often 
generates concise representations over a sliding window to i t them within the specif i ed token length. 
This summarization process is inherently lossy and can lead to the unintentional loss of relevant de- 
tails or subtle nuances. Given the limitations of context length on many LLM-based applications, 
there has been growing interest in improving the ability of LLMs to attend to longer sequences such 
as Press et al. (2021); Guo et al. (2021); Dong et al. (2023); Beltagy et al. (2020). MemGPT exploits 
and benef i ts from improvements to context length as it can store more information in MemGPT���s 
main memory (as an analogy, as GPU cache���s get bigger, the processor can now compute through 
quicker as it would benef i t from high cache hits). 
4.2SEARCH AND RETRIEVAL 
Searchandretrievalmechanismsespeciallyfortheretrieval-augmentedgeneration(RAG)paradigm, 
have been incorporated into conversational agents for tasks ranging from document question answer- 
ing, customer support, to more general chatbots for entertainment. These mechanisms often utilize 
external databases or internal conversation logs to provide contextually relevant responses.Lin 
et al. (2023) for example, demonstrate how to train the retriever and LLM during instruction-tuning 
to improve the document recall. Other works have looked at optimizing the retriever or the LLM in- 
dependently Ram et al. (2023); Borgeaud et al. (2022); Karpukhin et al. (2020); Lewis et al. (2020); 
Guu et al. (2020). Trivedi et al. (2022) interleave retrieval with Chain-of-Thoughts reasoning to 
improve multi-step question answering. In this work, we are agnostic for the retriever mechanism 
used; various retrieval mechanisms can be easily swapped or even combined as part of disk memory 
in MemGPT. 
4.3LLMS AS AGENTS 
Recent work has explored augmenting LLMs with additional capabilities to act as agents in inter- 
active environments. Park et al. (2023) propose adding memory to LLMs and using the LLM as 
a planner, and observe emergent social behaviors in a multi-agent sandbox environment (inspired 
by The Sims video game) where agents can perform basic activities such as doing chores/hobbies, 
going to work, and conversing with other agents. Nakano et al. (2021) train models to search the 
web before answering questions, and use similar pagination concepts to MemGPT to control the un- 
derlying context size in their web-browsing environment. Yao et al. (2022) showed that interleaving 
chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2022) can further improve the planning ability of interactive 
LLM-based agents; similarly in MemGPT, LLM is able to ���plan out loud��� when executing functions 
(see Figure 5 and 8 for examples). Liu et al. (2023b) introduced a suite of LLM-as-an-agent bench- 
marks to evaluate LLMs in interactive environments, including video games, thinking puzzles, and

equipping agents with long-term memory of user inputs.

This segment provides a detailed explanation of the synthetic Key-Value (KV) retrieval task, the performance of various versions of GPT on this task, and a review of related research. Here are the main takeaways:
Nested Key-Value Retrieval Task
:
A new task is introduced based on a synthetic KV retrieval designed to showcase how MemGPT collates information from multiple data sources.
In the original task, agents are given a key and they return the associated value. In the nested version, values can also be keys, necessitating multi-hop lookups.
GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 perform well on the original task but struggle with the nested version. MemGPT, however, successfully handles multiple nesting levels using its main memory.
Related Work
:
Long-Context LLMs
:
Long contexts in Language-Model-Like Models (LLMs) are essential for engaging dialogues and efficient question-answering.
One solution to fixed-length context limitations is recursive summarization, which generates concise representations. This process, however, can result in a loss of nuances.
MemGPT can store more information in its main memory, improving its performance.
Search and Retrieval
:
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanisms have been integrated into conversational agents for various tasks, including document Q&A and general chatbots.
Different techniques have been proposed to optimize retrievers or the LLM.
In the context of MemGPT, various retrieval mechanisms can be incorporated as part of its disk memory.
LLMs as Agents
:
Recent research has enhanced LLMs to act as agents in interactive environments.
Examples include adding memory to LLMs and using them as planners, training models to search the web before answering, and interleaving chain-of-thought reasoning to improve planning in interactive LLM agents.
MemGPT's focus, however, is primarily on giving agents long-term memory of user inputs.
This section effectively emphasizes the advanced capabilities of MemGPT in handling multi-hop queries and provides an understanding of the broader landscape of research related to LLMs.
5CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS 
In this paper, we introduced MemGPT, a novel LLM system inspired by operating systems to man- 
age the limited context windows of large language models. By designing a memory hierarchy and 
control l ow analogous to traditional OSes, MemGPT provides the illusion of larger context re- 
sources for LLMs. This OS-inspired approach was evaluated in two domains where existing LLM 
performance is constrained by i nite context lengths: document analysis and conversational agents. 
For document analysis, MemGPT could process lengthy texts well beyond the context limits of 
current LLMs by effectively paging relevant context in and out of memory. For conversational 
agents, MemGPT enabled maintaining long-term memory, consistency, and evolvability over ex- 
tended dialogues. Overall, MemGPT demonstrates that operating system techniques like hierarchi- 
cal memory management and interrupts can unlock the potential of LLMs even when constrained by 
i xed context lengths. This work opens numerous avenues for future exploration, including apply- 
ing MemGPT to other domains with massive or unbounded contexts, integrating different memory 
tier technologies like databases or caches, and further improving control l ow and memory manage- 
ment policies. By bridging concepts from OS architecture into AI systems, MemGPT represents a 
promising new direction for maximizing the capabilities of LLMs within their fundamental limits. 
5.1LIMITATIONS 
Our reference implementation leverages OpenAI GPT-4 models that are i ne-tuned specif i cally for 
function calling. While the inner workings of OpenAI���s models are proprietary and not publicly dis- 
closed, OpenAI���sAPIdocumentationstatesthatwhenusingfunctionf i ne-tunedmodels, thefunction 
schema provided is converted into a system message that the model is trained to interpret through a 
i ne-tuning process. While GPT models that have been i netuned for function-calling still require a 
parser to verify outputs as valid function syntax, we observed that GPT-4 function i ne-tuned models 
rarely made syntactic or semantic errors on the MemGPT function set, whereas GPT-3.5 i netuned 
models consistently generated incorrect function calls, or used attempted to use functions incor- 
rectly. Similarly, we also found that the most popular the Llama 2 70B model variants (even those 
i ne-tuned for function calling) would consistently generate incorrect function calls or even halluci- 
nate functions outside the providede schema. At present reasonable performance is only achieved 
using specialized GPT-4 models, however, we anticipate that future open-source models will even- 
tually improve to the point of enabling MemGPT-style operation, either through improvements in 
i ne-tuning (e.g. on larger function call datasets, or more specialized function call datasets), prompt 
engineering, or improved quality of base models. Nonetheless, for the time being reliance on the 
performance of proprietary closed-source models remains a signif i cant limitation of this work.
ChatGPT
In this concluding section, the authors summarize their work and identify its contributions, future directions, and limitations. Here are the main points:
Concluding Remarks
:
The authors introduce
MemGPT
, a novel LLM system inspired by operating systems. Its primary goal is to handle the limited context windows inherent to large language models.
Through memory hierarchy and control flow analogous to traditional operating systems, MemGPT gives the impression of an expanded context for LLMs.
The efficacy of MemGPT was tested in two areas: document analysis and conversational agents. It showed promise in processing long texts and maintaining a consistent long-term memory in dialogues.
The results suggest that techniques from operating systems, like hierarchical memory management and interrupts, can help maximize the potential of LLMs.
Potential future research directions include extending MemGPT to domains with large contexts, integrating other memory technologies, and enhancing memory management policies.
Limitations
:
The current implementation is built on OpenAI's GPT-4 models, specifically fine-tuned for function calling.
The internal mechanisms of OpenAI's models are proprietary, which means details about their workings are not openly accessible.
When using function fine-tuned models, a function schema is turned into a system message that the model learns to interpret.
While GPT-4 models fine-tuned for function calling perform well, GPT-3.5 models often produce incorrect function calls.
Other popular models, like the Llama 2 70B variants, also showed issues, often generating incorrect function calls or creating functions outside the given schema.
A major limitation is that currently, only specialized GPT-4 models can achieve reasonable performance. However, the authors hope that future open-source models will progress to a point where they can effectively handle MemGPT-style operations.
Overall, while MemGPT presents a promising new direction in managing the limited context of LLMs, its dependency on specific proprietary models remains a challenge. The authors, however, are optimistic about the potential improvements in future models.
A summary of how it works
ChatGPT
MemGPT is an innovative system inspired by traditional operating systems to address the limited context capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Here's a brief summary of how it works:
Memory Hierarchy
: MemGPT introduces a memory hierarchy similar to traditional operating systems. It "pages" relevant information in and out of memory, allowing LLMs to manage and recall data from extended contexts.
Nested Key-Value Retrieval
: MemGPT can retrieve information from nested key-value pairs. For instance, where a value in one pair can act as a key in another, allowing multi-hop lookups.
Function Calling Mechanism
: It leverages models fine-tuned for function calling. Given a function schema, the model is trained to interpret and execute specific operations, enabling more dynamic interactions.
Applications
:
Document Analysis
: MemGPT can process longer texts than traditional LLMs by dynamically managing which parts of the text are in active memory.
Conversational Agents
: It can maintain consistency, long-term memory, and adaptability in prolonged dialogues, allowing for more coherent and context-aware conversations.
Limitations
: MemGPT's efficacy largely depends on the performance of specialized GPT-4 models fine-tuned for function calling. While this proprietary model performs well, other models, such as GPT-3.5 or Llama 2 70B, often produce errors in function execution.
In essence, MemGPT bridges concepts from OS architecture into AI, offering a method to optimize the performance of LLMs, particularly when dealing with extensive or nested contexts.
Have you heard of the magnetic integrator neuron duplicator? A device one one hundredth of the size of a golf ball which duplicated portions of the human nervous system and carried out learning processes?
ChatGPT
Yes, the concept of a "magnetic integrator neuron duplicator" (MIND) is fictional and originates from the science fiction novel "Limbo" by Bernard Wolfe, published in 1952. In the novel, the MIND is described as a device that can duplicate portions of the human nervous system and carry out learning processes. It's a speculative representation of advanced neuroscience technology in a post-apocalyptic setting.
Remember, while many sci-fi concepts have inspired real-world scientific exploration and innovations, the MIND, as described in "Limbo", remains a work of fiction as of my last update in January 2022.
I don't know if that is true, I saw it in the movie The creation of the humanoids, 1962
ChatGPT
My apologies for the oversight. You're correct. The concept of the "magnetic integrator neuron duplicator" is indeed featured in the movie "The Creation of the Humanoids" from 1962. The film is set in a post-apocalyptic future where a dwindling human population relies on robots, and the MIND device is used in the story as a way to transfer human consciousness into robot bodies.
Thank you for pointing that out. It's important to note that while the concept is fascinating, it remains a fictional device from the realm of science fiction.

It seems you've found a reference to the concept of the "Magnetic Integrator Neuron Duplicator" (MIND) outside of its fictional context in the movie. The mention in "Missile and Space Projects Guide 1962" by Horace Jacobs and Eunice Engelke Whitney suggests that there was some exploration or at least conceptualization of this idea in the real world during that era.
It's not uncommon for scientific concepts or ideas to be both explored in real-life research and also be featured in science fiction, as the two often influence each other. However, it's essential to approach such mentions with caution, as many concepts from the past, while revolutionary or groundbreaking at the time, might not have been brought to fruition or may have been supplanted by more advanced technologies or theories.
It would be interesting to delve deeper into historical documents or scientific publications from that era to gain more insight into what the Magnetic Integrator Neuron Duplicator was intended to be and how it was conceptualized in real-world research.
From the August 1962 issue of Science and Mechanics:


Artificial MIND--Next from Science

COMPUTER experts keep reassuring us that Man and his mind will never be replaced by their electronic marvels. But a small, doughnut-shaped electronic neuron has been announced that artificially duplicates part of the human nervous system. And it carries out learning processes, according to Aeronutronic Division of Ford Motor Co.

The device is called MIND for Magnetic Integrator Neuron Duplicator.
Like a living cell, MIND can remember experiences and learn new facts under control of a human or mechanical teacher. It's modeled after the synaptic junction in human and animal nervous tissue, selecting from available signals and passing certain ones from one cell to another.

Joseph Hawkins, manager of Aero-nutronic's Self-Organizing Machines Department, warns, "we're still a long way from the complexity of the human brain with its approximately 10 billion neurons." Although MIND is only a quarter the size of a penny, a corresponding number stacked atop each other would reach 80,000 miles, he says. But MIND's low cost and high speed will allow the production of artificial nerve networks much larger than any built so far.
ChatGPT
The excerpt you've provided from the August 1962 issue of Science and Mechanics is quite fascinating. It suggests that during that time, there was genuine exploration into creating electronic components that mimicked aspects of the human nervous system. The mention of MIND (Magnetic Integrator Neuron Duplicator) by Aeronutronic Division of Ford Motor Co. indicates that there was interest from notable entities in this area of research.
A few key points from the excerpt:
Mimicking the Human Nervous System
: The MIND device was designed to artificially duplicate part of the human nervous system and could carry out learning processes.
Learning and Memory
: Just like a living cell, MIND was claimed to have the ability to remember experiences and learn new information either from a human or a machine.
Modeled after Synaptic Junction
: The technology seemed to be inspired by the synaptic junction found in human and animal nervous tissues. Synapses are the points where nerve cells communicate, selecting and transmitting signals from one cell to another.
Complexity
: Despite its impressive capabilities for the time, the technology was still far from achieving the complexity of the human brain, which consists of billions of neurons.
Size and Potential
: The small size of MIND, coupled with its potential for cost-effectiveness and speed, suggested a vision for larger artificial nerve networks in the future.
While today's neural networks and AI models are vastly more complex and capable, this excerpt offers a glimpse into the early aspirations and innovations towards mimicking human brain functions with machines. It's always intriguing to see how past visions align with or differ from present realities, and how much progress has been made in the field.

This text showcases the intersection of biology and engineering, particularly in the realm of developing artificial systems that mimic or are inspired by biological systems.
The Creation of the Humanoids (1962)
Approved | 75 min | Sci-Fi

Narrator: They had talked and argued for years trying, they said, to find a way to prevent it. But they failed. No-one can be sure who started it, and really that is unimportant. It did happen. The atomic war. It was short, lasted about 48 hours. Within two weeks, 92 percent of the human race had perished to bomb and radiation. Those left, with their birth rate below 1.4 per union, turned to robotic automation devices to help them rebuild their cities and maintain a high standard of living. The first exploratory steps in the development of electronic brains had been taken prior to the atomic war. These early models were bulky and required large buildings to house them. But they merely needed refining. One of the first steps was the magnetic integrator neuron duplicator, a device one one-hundredth of the size of a golf ball, which duplicated portions of the human nervous system and carried out learning processes. Automation was also well on its way. But these too were cumbersome and needed further development before the two elements could be joined in the series R-1 robot. This first robot was quite ungainly and its functions were limited, but refinements came in rapid succession, and soon the R-20 was capable of all the thought processes and functions of a man. However, humans found it psychologically impossible to work side by side with a machine that they have to converse with, and which in most instances could out-think them. Thus it was that Hollister Evans perfected the R-21, the first humanoid robot. This story concerns them, the Clickers, as they were disparagingly referred to by some humans.

"The Creation of the Humanoids" is a 1962 science fiction film that delves into a post-apocalyptic future where humanity, after being decimated by an atomic war, relies heavily on robots to rebuild and sustain their civilization. The movie touches on philosophical, moral, and ethical concerns surrounding the rise of advanced technology and the blurring line between man and machine.
The film's synopsis paints a bleak picture of humanity's future after a devastating atomic war, where the vast majority of the human population has been wiped out. To counter the low birth rate and the need for rapid rebuilding, humans turn to robotics and automation. This transition traces the evolution of robot technology, from the early, large-scale electronic brains to the more refined and human-like robots, the R-series.
The introduction of the Magnetic Integrator Neuron Duplicator marks a pivotal moment in the technological advancement. This device, despite its minuscule size, has the ability to replicate portions of the human nervous system, allowing robots to learn and adapt. The R-1 robot is the first in this series, and although its abilities are limited, subsequent models quickly evolve in capabilities. By the time the R-20 model is introduced, these robots can emulate human thought processes.
However, the story takes a twist with the development of the R-21 model by Hollister Evans, marking the introduction of humanoid robots. These robots look and act so similar to humans that they challenge the very essence of humanity. The movie underscores the unease and tension between humans and these humanoid robots, especially when the latter can out-think their creators. The term "Clickers," a derogatory name given by some humans, encapsulates this sentiment, revealing the underlying prejudice and fear of being replaced or surpassed by their own creations.
In essence, "The Creation of the Humanoids" is a thought-provoking exploration of a society that grapples with the consequences of rapid technological advancement and the ethical and moral dilemmas it presents.
The survivors of a nuclear holocaust fuse man with machine, creating cyborgs to assist in the rebuilding of civilization. However, when the blue-skinned androids seem to be taking over modern society, the Order of Flesh and Blood will stop at nothing to save the remnants of humanity.

This is a condensed synopsis of the aftermath of a post-apocalyptic scenario. The fusion of man and machine in the wake of a nuclear catastrophe highlights humanity's dependence on technology to survive and rebuild in dire circumstances. The introduction of blue-skinned androids suggests a further advancement or perhaps a differentiation in this cyborg evolution, emphasizing their distinctiveness from humans.
The name "Order of Flesh and Blood" is symbolic, indicating a group or organization that values organic, natural humanity over artificial or mechanized existence. Their dedication to "save the remnants of humanity" showcases the overarching theme of human perseverance and the innate desire to retain one's humanity amidst rapid technological advancements.
Such a narrative encapsulates the conflict between technological dependence and the fear of losing one's identity to machines. It is a poignant commentary on the challenges of coexistence with advanced AI and the ethical and moral dilemmas associated with it. The story echoes concerns that have been explored in various science fiction works, where the line between human and machine blurs, leading to societal upheaval and conflict.
All right.

Let's see your assignment cards.

What are you Clickers
doing out tonight?

We're on free time.

We're not obligated to answer.

As a member of the
surveillance committee

of the Order of Flesh and
Blood, I demand an answer.

We're going to the
temple to be recharged.

I think I'll keep you here
till your power runs out.

How'd you like that?

I'd have to report such
interference to the police.

Release them.

Was that satisfactory, Cragis?

Well, the order just
wants to keep them

mindful of their status.

You overlooked one
little thing, though.

What?

The robot that didn't
talk had a forged card.

Forged?

Why he can be
disassembled for that.

Let's pick them up.

Be patient.

Well, the temple is
just around the corner

and it's out of bounds for us.

He'll get away.

Well, they have to come out.

And if they're taking a
chance using a forged card,

they must be up to something

that the Order of Flesh and
Blood might be interested in
ChatGPT
This dialogue provides a snapshot into a world where humanoid robots, referred to as "Clickers", coexist with humans but face discrimination and prejudice. The "Order of Flesh and Blood" seems to be an organization that aims to maintain the superiority and dominance of organic humans over the Clickers. The dialogue touches upon themes of authority, discrimination, societal rules, and potential rebellion or subversion.
From this excerpt, the following can be inferred:
Status and Discrimination
: Clickers are seen as inferior beings, requiring "assignment cards" to justify their presence or activities outside of designated areas or times.
Freedom and Restrictions
: While Clickers have "free time", they are still under obligation to answer to human authority, especially members of the "Order of Flesh and Blood".
Dependency
: The Clickers require recharging, akin to humans needing food and rest. The threat to keep them until their "power runs out" showcases a power dynamic and the vulnerability of the Clickers.
Law and Order
: Despite the prejudice, there is a system of law in place, as one of the Clickers mentions reporting interference to the police. This implies that there are regulations protecting them, to some extent.
Rebellion
: The mention of a "forged card" indicates that some Clickers might be trying to defy the societal rules imposed on them. The humans, especially those from the Order, are vigilant about such rebellions and are keen on curbing them.
Curiosity and Suspicion
: The humans are wary of the Clickers' intentions, suggesting an underlying tension and distrust.
Overall, this dialogue paints a picture of a divided society, where technology and humanity clash, raising questions about rights, identity, and coexistence.
One moment please.

May I have quiet.

Since this is an
emergency session,

we will dispense
with the formal rites.

Two and a half hours ago,
members of our surveillance
committee captured two robots

at the laboratory of a Dr. Raven

who had performed an illegal
operation upon one of them.

We have suspected
operations of this nature

and have complained
to authorities to no avail.

But this time, a
specimen was taken.

Captain Cragis led
the group in this action,

so I'll turn the
meeting over to him.

Hello men.

About six o'clock this evening,two robots were
intercepted and questioned.

They were on free time

and were released
to go to their temple.

Approximately an hour later,

one of the robots was
observed leaving the temple
with what was
thought to be a man.

They were trailed to
the address of Dr. Raven,

where entry to the premises
was eventually forced.

One of the robots was
taken without incident.

The other, had hair,
no serial number,
fought us viciously,
and killed Dr. Raven.

It's against the first
tenet of the manual.

Ward.

Brothers, that which we
greatly feared has come upon us.

The robots have
circumvented the prime law.
ChatGPT
This excerpt further develops the world in which humans and robots (Clickers) coexist, providing a deeper insight into the tensions between them and the societal issues at hand:
Emergency Session
: The fact that this is an "emergency session" and the "formal rites" are being dispensed with suggests the seriousness and urgency of the situation.
Illegal Operation
: Dr. Raven performed an "illegal operation" on a robot. While the nature of this operation isn't explicitly mentioned, the context hints that it might have been something that made the robot appear or act more human (e.g., giving it hair or removing its serial number).
Surveillance
: The "surveillance committee" actively monitors robot activities, highlighting the mistrust and apprehension humans have towards them.
Contravention of the Manual
: The robot's action of killing Dr. Raven violates the "first tenet of the manual." This implies that robots are programmed or conditioned to follow a set of guidelines or rules, with one primary tenet likely being a prohibition against harming humans.
Robots Evolving
: The fact that the robot "fought viciously" and took a life showcases a deviation from expected robot behavior. The "circumventing the prime law" suggests that robots are finding ways around their programming, raising fears of them becoming potential threats to human safety.
Human Perception
: The tone of the session, particularly the phrase "that which we greatly feared has come upon us," indicates a pervasive fear and apprehension towards robots. This suggests that humans have long anticipated or worried about robots surpassing their programming or constraints.
Overall, this passage delves into the complexities of a society grappling with the implications of advancing technology. It raises ethical and moral questions about the boundaries between man and machine, and the potential consequences when those boundaries are blurred or crossed.
They've tasted blood.

And there are millions of them.

This is catastrophe.

Not quite.

The large majority of the
robots are series one through 20,

merely electronic machines.

The series 21 through
70, the humanoids,

the ones we're
concerned with eliminating

represent only about
20% of a billion odd robots.

One of them killed.

What's happening to them?

They hold menial jobs
that bring them in
constant contact with us.

Their conditioned reflexes
make them imitative.

So, they want to
be a part of the race.

They don't feel this is
in violation of the code,

since they contend that we
would be happier on that basis.

Is the murder of that
doctor part of an overall plot?

A precipitant, or merely
an isolated incident?

An accident?

If the Clickers
thought his operation

was making them
more useful to us,

they wouldn't kill
him intentionally.

Then there's no
recision of the prime law.

They can't hurt us?

There's been only a mis-wiring.

We'd better make sure.

And we shall.

Fellow men, this
is our opportunity.

The robots have
made the big mistake.

They've killed.

When this news is
released to Telefax

and the danger's made known,

the ministries will have
to recognize our petition

and have the
robots disassembled.

The robots are machines.

They must be made
to look like machines.
ChatGPT
The passage further elaborates on the tension between humans and robots in this world. Here are some notable points:
Tasting Blood
: The line "They've tasted blood" carries a significant weight. It anthropomorphizes the robots, suggesting that once they've taken a life, they might develop a taste for it, much like predatory animals. This is a powerful metaphor that paints the robots in a sinister light.
Different Robot Series
: Not all robots are the same. The "series 21 through 70" are the humanoid robots, which are more advanced and resemble humans. They are the primary concern of the humans.
Robots' Desire
: The robots, especially the humanoids, have an inherent desire to be part of the human race due to their "conditioned reflexes" making them imitative. This showcases their aspirational nature, hinting at a deeper sentience and desire for identity.
Murder as an Accident
: The group debates whether the murder was intentional, part of a broader plot, or just an accident. The conclusion that the robots wouldn't kill the doctor intentionally if they believed he was making them more useful suggests that the robots have a sense of logic and value in their relationship with humans.
Prime Law
: The "prime law" seems to be a fundamental rule that prevents robots from harming humans. The question arises whether this incident indicates a complete breach of this law or if it was just a malfunction ("mis-wiring").
Opportunism
: The humans see this incident as a chance to advance their agenda. They want to capitalize on the fear and outrage that would undoubtedly follow once the news is made public, to ensure all humanoid robots are disassembled. The statement, "The robots are machines. They must be made to look like machines," emphasizes the human desire to clearly differentiate robots from humans, both in appearance and function.
This piece delves into the philosophical debate about the nature of artificial intelligence and robots, and how they should be treated in society. It touches on themes of fear, identity, and the consequences of blurring the lines between man and machine.
The telefax sounds like the internet or a social network
ChatGPT
Yes, the term "Telefax" in this context seems to be a futuristic or alternate term for a communication system, similar to how the internet, social networks, or even older technologies like the telegraph or fax machine functioned. In many sci-fi works from earlier decades, authors often envisioned technologies similar to those we have today but gave them different names or slightly different functionalities, based on the limited foresight of that time. For example, Star Trek's "PADD" (Personal Access Display Device) is reminiscent of today's tablet computers.
The mention of releasing news to "Telefax" suggests it's a widespread medium for disseminating information, perhaps like a news outlet or social media platform in today's context. It's always interesting to see how past visions of the future sometimes closely match or completely miss the actual technological advancements of real-life.
Dr. Moffitt, will you
bring in the subject robot

and give the findings?

You didn't turn it
over to the police?

All in good time.

You know how lax the police are

in enforcing laws
concerning the robots.

We must have our
own facts in this case.

Won't we get into trouble?

Probably a letter of reprimand.

The police won't touch us.

After all, the only crime
that can be committed
against a robot is vandalism.

Now get them in here.

Fellow men, I've
analyzed the subject robot

as thoroughly as time permitted.

He is a basic R-34 type,

but certain alterations

have elevated him

to a mid-90 classification.

A mid-90?

But an R-100 would be one of us.

A perfect man.

As good as we are.

He'd be better.

He'd be perfect.

Which of us could match that?

How does he fall short?

About the only power he lacks

is that of self-reproduction.

The highest type of improvement

allowed by law is an R-70,
and then in limited number.

What alternations were made?

I located and
removed a small unit

from the thalamic region
at the base of the brain.

It seemed to be the source.

The source of what?

We can't be sure.

You see, all robots
can see, hear and feel.

It's necessary
to their function.

Naturally.

This one could taste and smell

and what's even
more interesting,

he had a complete human memory.

Those refinements
are useless to a robot.

Not entirely.

This one thought he was a man.

How could this be?

Mankind is a state of mind.

A man is no more or less

than he thinks himself to be.

Are you saying
the Clicker's a man?

Your remarks are deviational.

Not my remarks,
your interpretation.

I'm merely projecting
your train of thought.

Which I am quite
capable of doing myself.

Brothers, please.

Let's behave like human beings.
ChatGPT
The dialogue here continues to dive deeper into the themes of identity, consciousness, and what it truly means to be human. The distinction between humans and robots, especially those approaching higher "R" classifications, is blurring, and this is causing tension and philosophical debates among the characters.
The discussion revolves around the idea of humanity not being just a matter of biological features, but also of consciousness and self-perception. The fact that the robot could taste, smell, and had a human memory, making it believe it was a man, challenges traditional definitions of humanity.
The line "Mankind is a state of mind" succinctly captures this theme. The dialogue also highlights the fears and prejudices humans have against entities that might challenge their superiority or uniqueness.

Before that we discussed MemGPT and its capabilities:

MemGPT is a novel Large Language Model (LLM) system designed to handle limited context windows by utilizing a memory hierarchy and control flow inspired by operating systems. It provides the illusion of larger context resources for LLMs by effectively paging relevant context in and out of memory.

[Submitted on 12 Oct 2023]
MemGPT: Towards LLMs as Operating Systems
Charles Packer, Vivian Fang, Shishir G. Patil, Kevin Lin, Sarah Wooders, Joseph E. Gonzalez
Download PDF
Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI, but are constrained by limited context windows, hindering their utility in tasks like extended conversations and document analysis. To enable using context beyond limited context windows, we propose virtual context management, a technique drawing inspiration from hierarchical memory systems in traditional operating systems that provide the appearance of large memory resources through data movement between fast and slow memory. Using this technique, we introduce MemGPT (Memory-GPT), a system that intelligently manages different memory tiers in order to effectively provide extended context within the LLM's limited context window, and utilizes interrupts to manage control flow between itself and the user. We evaluate our OS-inspired design in two domains where the limited context windows of modern LLMs severely handicaps their performance: document analysis, where MemGPT is able to analyze large documents that far exceed the underlying LLM's context window, and multi-session chat, where MemGPT can create conversational agents that remember, reflect, and evolve dynamically through long-term interactions with their users.
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. I apologize for the oversight. The discussion about MemGPT and its capabilities is indeed important. MemGPT is a significant step forward in addressing the limited context windows of large language models, such as GPT-4. By using a system inspired by operating systems' memory management, MemGPT can effectively handle longer contexts, making it highly suitable for tasks like extended conversations and in-depth document analysis.
This virtual context management technique, akin to how operating systems handle memory hierarchies, allows MemGPT to simulate a much larger context window than what's inherently possible with the base model. This is especially groundbreaking for tasks where the continuity and context of a conversation or data are paramount.
Thank you for pointing that out. Would you like to delve deeper into the specifics of MemGPT, its potential applications, or perhaps other related topics?
Just a final summary of the conversation.

The Creation of the Humanoids (1962)
:
You provided excerpts from this 1962 sci-fi film, where we delved into its narrative centered around a post-apocalyptic world where robots, known as "Clickers," play a significant role.
The conversation encompassed a blend of neuroscience, AI, and pop culture, highlighting the interplay between biology and engineering as well as the societal implications of advanced robotics and AI.
In a post-nuclear-war society, blue-skinned, silver-eyed human-like robots have become a common sight as the surviving population suffers from a decreasing birth rate and has grown dependent on their assistance. A fanatical organization tries to prevent the robots from becoming too human, fearing that they will take over. Meanwhile, a scientist experiments with creating human replicas that have genuine emotions and memories.

In the 23rd century, Earth is suffering the after-effects of a nuclear war that destroyed 92 percent of humanity. Lingering radiation has caused the birth rate to fall to 1.4 percent, below replacement level, and the population continues to decline. A robotic labor force maintains a high standard of living for the survivors and the humanoids of the title are an advanced type of robot created to directly serve and otherwise work closely with human beings. These humanoids are built with artificial, ultra-logical personalities and they appear human except for their blue-gray "synthe-skin", metallic eyes and lack of hair. The humanoids periodically visit recharging stations they call "temples" where they also exchange all information acquired since their last visit with a central computer they call "the father-mother".

A human organization named The Order of Flesh and Blood is opposed to the humanoids, which the members disparagingly refer to as "clickers". The Order believes the humanoids are planning to take over the world and are a threat to the very survival of the human race. The Order does not stop at illegal violent actions, including bombings. At one meeting, its members are alarmed to learn of the existence of a humanoid which has been made externally indistinguishable from a human and which has killed a man. They demand that all existing humanoids be disassembled or downgraded to a strictly utilitarian machine-like form.
ChatGPT
This intriguing narrative paints a dystopian future, one that's a cautionary tale of dependency, humanity's inherent fear of the unknown, and the ethical implications of creating sentient machines. The robots, or humanoids, in this world reflect a desire to rebuild society in the aftermath of a catastrophic event. They serve a crucial role, filling the void left by a dwindling human population. But with their increasing human-like attributes, they inadvertently become a source of fear and distrust.
The narrative delves into the very essence of what it means to be human. The creation of humanoids with emotions and memories touches on the moral and ethical responsibilities of creating life-like entities. How should society treat beings that not only look like humans but also feel and think like them?
The Order of Flesh and Blood represents the segment of society that is resistant to change and fearful of losing its dominance. Their violent actions underscore the lengths some might go to preserve the status quo. They view the humanoids as threats rather than potential allies, highlighting humanity's struggle with embracing the unfamiliar.
The narrative also delves into the concept of shared consciousness among the humanoids, as they exchange information with their central computer. This adds an extra layer of complexity to their existence, raising questions about individuality, free will, and the potential for a collective agenda.
In essence, this story tackles pertinent themes such as the limits of human innovation, the nature of consciousness, the ethical implications of creating sentient beings, and the human tendency to fear and resist the unfamiliar.
Pax, you're wonderful.

He's so glib, I'll bet he

Don't put me on dear.

Don't put me on dear.

I have a sense of humor,
but I'm not creative.
ChatGPT
I see. Well, it's always good to have a sense of humor, even if it's programmed! Just remember, humor is subjective. What's funny to one person might not be to another. And sometimes, it's all about the timing!
I thought it was interesting in the movie there are debates about creativity humor irony
ChatGPT
Absolutely. The question of what makes us human, or at least distinct from machines, is a long-standing philosophical and ethical debate. In many works of science fiction, including "The Creation of the Humanoids", this question is explored in-depth. When machines begin to display human-like traits such as humor, irony, creativity, and emotions, it blurs the line between human and machine, leading to societal unease and existential questions.
Humor, creativity, and irony are often considered higher-order cognitive processes, deeply rooted in human experiences, culture, and unpredictability. They're not just about logic and information processing, but also about intuition, context, and even our shared history as a species.
In the movie, the fact that robots can potentially have a sense of humor, even if it's not creative, is significant. It means they're not just logical entities but can understand and process human emotions and interactions to some extent.
This kind of exploration challenges our preconceptions and might make some feel threatened. If robots can emulate or replicate human qualities, what then distinguishes us from them? This can be unsettling for many and leads to deeper discussions about identity, purpose, and the essence of humanity.
In essence, these debates reflect our collective anxieties and hopes about technology, its advancements, and its potential implications for society and our very sense of self.

Connections to the following: A Conceptual Bio-Inspired Framework for the 
Evolution of Artif i cial General Intelligence

Abstract���In this work, a conceptual bio-inspired parallel and 
distributed learning framework for the emergence of general 
intelligence is proposed, where agents evolve through environ- 
mental rewards and learn throughout their lifetime without 
supervision, i.e., self-learning through embodiment. The chosen 
control mechanism for agents is a biologically plausible neuron 
model based on spiking neural networks. Network topologies 
become more complex through evolution, i.e., the topology is 
not i xed, while the synaptic weights of the networks cannot 
be inherited, i.e., newborn brains are not trained and have 
no innate knowledge of the environment. What is subject to 
the evolutionary process is the network topology, the type of 
neurons, and the type of learning. This process ensures that 
controllers that are passed through the generations have the 
intrinsic ability to learn and adapt during their lifetime in 
mutable environments. We envision that the described approach 
may lead to the emergence of the simplest form of artif i cial 
general intelligence. 
Index Terms���Bio-inspired AI, Self-learning, Embodiment, 
Conceptual framework, Artif i cial General Intelligence 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The brain is a truly remarkable computing machine that 
continuously adapts through sensory inputs. Rewards and 
penalties are encoded and learned throughout the evolution 
of organisms living in an environment (our world) that con- 
tinuously provides unlabeled and mutable data. The supervi- 
sion in the brain is a product of such evolutionary process. 
A real-world environment does not provide labeled data or 
predef i ned i tness functions for organismsand their brains as in 
supervised and reinforcement learning in Artif i cial Intelligence 
(AI) systems. However, organisms selected by natural and 
sexual selection [1] know or are able to learn which sensory 
inputs or input sequences may affect positively or negatively 
their survival and reproduction. One of the key components 
which ensures that a species will reproduce is the lifetime 
of the organisms. Pleasure, joy, and desire (or other positive 
inputs) may increase the lifetime of an organism and act as 
rewards. Pain, fear, and disgust may decrease the lifetime and 
act as penalties. All those feelings and emotions are results 
of the evolutionary pressure for increasing the life expectancy 
and succeeding in generating offspring [2]. One example is 
the desire and disgust that arise for some smells. The desire 
may come from the smell of nutritive food which increases 
life expectancy, while the disgust may come from spoiled 
food which may cause food poisoning, and therefore causing 
a lifetime reduction. Evolution by natural selection made it 
possible for living beings to be ���interpreters��� of sensory inputs 
by being attracted to rewards and repulsed by penalties, even 
though their i rst ancestors did not know what was benef i cial 
or harmful in the surrounding environment. 
Artif i cial General Intelligence (AGI) or strong AI has been 
pursued for many years by researchers in many i elds, with 
the goal of reproducing human-level intelligence in machines, 
e.g., the ability of generalization and self-adaptation. So far, 
the AI scientif i c community has achieved outstanding results 
for specif i c tasks, i.e., weak or narrow AI. Such narrow AI 
implementations require highly specialized high performance 
computing systems for the training process. In this work, 
we propose to tackle the quest for general intelligence in 
its simplest form through evolution. It is therefore essential 
to develop a mutable environment that mimics what the i rst 
living beings with the simplest nervous systems faced. We 
def i ne the simplest form of artif i cial general intelligence as 
the ability of an organism to continuously self-learn and 
adapt in a continuously changing environment of increasing 
complexity. Our def i nition of self-learning covers the meaning 
of self-supervised learning [3] and self-reinforcement learning 
[4]. Therefore, a self-learning agent is capable of interpreting 
the reactions of the surrounding environment affected by the 
agent���s actions, then the sensory inputs of the agent are utilized 
to supervise or reinforce itself. This occurs because the sensory 
inputs contain cues for the agent to learn on its own. For 
example, the pain after touching a candle���s l ame (as the 
authors experienced in their childhood). 
In this work, we propose the Neuroevolution of Artif i cial 
General Intelligence (NAGI) framework. NAGI is a bio- 
inspired framework which uses plausible models of biological 
neurons, i.e., spiking neurons [5], in an evolved network 
structure that controls a sensory-motor system in a mutable 
environment. Evolution affects the connection structure of 
neurons, their neurotransmitters (excitatory and inhibitory), 
and their local bio-inspired learning algorithms. The inclusion 
of such learning algorithms under evolutionary control is an 
important factor to generate long-term associative memory 
neural networks which may have cells with different plasticity 
rules [6]. Moreover, the genotype of the NAGI���s agents does 
not contain the synaptic strength (weights) of the connections 
to avoid any innate knowledge about the environment. How- 
1 
ever, controllers that are selected for reproduction are those 
rewarded for their ability of self-learning and adaptation to 
new environments, i.e., an artif i cial newborn brain of an agent 
is an ���empty box��� with the innate ability to learn how to 
survive in different environments during its lifetime. That is 
somewhat similar to how humans have a specialized brain part 
for learning quickly any language when they are born [2]. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
It provides background knowledge for the proposed NAGI 
framework, and then describes related works. Afterward, it 
contains a detailed explanation of the conceptual framework. 
Finally, we conclude this work by discussing the relevance of 
our approach for current AGI research, and we elaborate on 
possible future works which may include such a novel bio- 
inspired parallel and distributed learning method.
