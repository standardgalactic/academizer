Harnessing the Glymphatic System to Improve Brain Health
Jan. 14, 2022 - Eden McCleskey
We know sleep is important. We spend one-third of our lives asleep, without which we couldn't function.

But until the 2013 discovery of the glymphatic system by Danish neuroscientist Dr. Maiken Nedergaard, we had no idea why sleep is so important to humans or that the brain uses it to clear its metabolic waste.

Building off this relatively recent discovery, a team of neuroscience researchers and engineers at Houston Methodist, Rice University and Baylor College of Medicine are developing a "sleeping cap" that analyzes the glymphatic system's activity and the flow of cerebrospinal fluid that helps drain the brain of harmful buildup during sleep.

Backed by a U.S. Army $2.8 million grant for the first year of research, the team's goal is to find a way to noninvasively measure, modulate and ultimately stimulate proper cerebrospinal fluid flow in order to treat sleep disorders in real time and stave off neurodegenerative disease.

To make the technology highly accessible ��� deployed soldiers, for instance, are targeted users ��� an important secondary goal is to create a prototype that is portable and easy to use.

"It is of great interest to the military to understand the toll of sleep deprivation on its forces and to detect issues and treat them before neurological damage occurs," says Behnaam Aazhang, director of the NeuroEngineering Initiative and J.S. Abercrombie Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rice. Aazhang's team is responsible for designing and building the cap.

Clearing the cluttered mind
The unique and ambitious scope of the project is underscored by the nascency of the field.

"We used to believe sleep was the time that the body rests, but when you look at the brain during certain sleep cycles, you see it is very, very active," explains Dr. Gavin Britz, director of the Houston Methodist Neurological Institute and the Candy and Tom Knudson Centennial Chair of Neurosurgery. "We also see a very strong link between abnormal sleep and disease states, including heart disease, obesity and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's. It's clear that something essential happens during sleep."

Thanks to studies by Nedergaard, Britz and other labs in the U.S. and around the world, scientists now have enough data to show that during sleep, the glymphatic system helps the central nervous system clear out its metabolic waste using a network of channels and cerebrospinal fluid, much like the lymphatic system collects and removes unused nutrients and cellular waste from the rest of the body.

Because the brain is highly active, metabolic waste builds up quickly. If the system is interrupted ��� due to poor sleep quality, lack of sleep or just the slowdown that comes with age ��� metabolic garbage and byproducts, such as beta-amyloid, the protein associated with Alzheimer's disease, build up between the cells.

"For brain health, sleep is extremely important, and people who don't sleep well have problems clearing toxins from their brains, resulting in a variety of dysfunctions that can affect people in both the short-term and long-term," Dr. Britz says.

Indirect path leads to growing partnership
During an unrelated study on patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, Dr. Britz and his colleagues Dr. Eugene Golanov and Dr. Angelique Regnier-Golanov discovered that they could manipulate spinal fluid flow using certain molecular targets.

This led to a growing interest in understanding how the glymphatic system works and which patient populations might be helped by controlling it.

The Center for Translational Neural Prosthetics and Interfaces, a collaboration between Rice and Houston Methodist launched in March 2021 to develop technology to solve biomedical problems of the brain and spinal cord, gave the team a leg up when it came to applying for the grant from the Army's Military Operational Medicine Research Program.

"We had already started bringing together the top researchers in neuroscience, engineering and related fields to study how to restore and extend the capabilities of the human brain," Dr. Britz says. "This grant took our partnership to the next level, as we all continue to learn more about the highly complex mechanics of cerebrospinal fluid flow."

The clinical research team, headed by Dr. Britz, is in the process of applying for IRB approval and aims to have preliminary data by summer 2022.

"Ultimately, we're looking at sleep disorders and disease states, but it's always good to start with normal controls to see how it works," Dr. Britz says. "We are starting with healthy volunteers and will measure their cerebrospinal flow at various points, day and night, in a completely noninvasive, risk-free way. At a later stage, we plan to start modulating it to see how it affects glymphatic flow."

A sleep work-around?
The goal of the project is to develop technology that can improve the clearance of waste even without improving the amount or quality of a person's sleep.

"Whether it is psychological stress, trauma, sleep apnea, weight- or heart disease-associated concerns or the natural aging process that tends to make us lighter sleepers, the end result is the same ��� metabolites accumulate and cause problems for the body and the brain," says Dr. Britz. "We are developing this cap to try and bypass the need for eight hours of high-quality sleep so that even people who sleep poorly can get rid of their waste products efficiently

Abstract 
Researchers have proposed many methods for fair and robust machine learning, but comprehensive 
empirical evaluation of their subgroup robustness is lacking. In this work, we address this gap in the 
context of tabular data, where sensitive subgroups are clearly-def i ned, real-world fairness problems abound, 
and prior works often do not compare to state-of-the-art tree-based models as baselines. We conduct 
an empirical comparison of several previously-proposed methods for fair and robust learning alongside 
state-of-the-art tree-based methods and other baselines. Via experiments with more than 340,000 model 
conf i gurations on eight datasets, we show that tree-based methods have strong subgroup robustness, even 
when compared to robustness- and fairness-enhancing methods. Moreover, the best tree-based models 
tend to show good performance over a range of metrics, while robust or group-fair models can show 
brittleness, with signif i cant performance dif f erences across dif f erent metrics for a i xed model. We also 
demonstrate that tree-based models show less sensitivity to hyperparameter conf i gurations, and are less 
costly to train. Our work suggests that tree-based ensemble models make an ef f ective baseline for tabular 
data, and are a sensible default when subgroup robustness is desired.1 
1Introduction 
Over the past decade, the i eld of machine learning (ML) has seen a dramatic expansion along two related 
lines. On one hand, concerns about the fairness of ML models, and more broadly their performance on data 
outside the training distribution, have grown [50]. Both theoretical and empirical works have raised these 
concerns, demonstrating the vulnerability of models to learn biases from data or suf f er performance drops 
under distribution shifts [44,66,35]. On the other hand, an abundance of methods have been proposed to 
address these limitations. These include fairness methods used to equalize metrics across groups, as well as 
distributional robustness methods which optimize for a worst-case distribution within a bounded distance of 
the training distribution. 
Our work begins from the observation that, while ���fairness��� and ���robustness��� are distinct concepts, methods 
in both areas often have similar goals. In particular, they share two (sometimes implicit) goals: First, 
models should have low disparity (variation in performance over all subgroups should be minimized; cf. 
[75,17,25,43]). Second, models should have good worst-group performance (the lowest accuracy over all 
subgroups should be maximized; cf. [74,62]). As a consequence of these two criteria, both fairness and 
robustness typically entail improving subgroup robustness. 
Our work focuses on subgroup robustness in the context of tabular data, for several reasons. First, tabular 
data is widely used in practice, being the most common format in areas with important fairness impacts 
such as medicine, i nance, and recommender systems [38,64]. Second, tabular data often directly encodes

The given abstract discusses the importance of ensuring fairness and robustness in machine learning (ML) models, particularly when working with tabular data. Here's a brief overview:
Subgroup Robustness Grows On Trees: An Empirical Baseline Investigation
Authors
: Josh Gardner, Zoran Popovi��, Ludwig Schmidt from Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington.
Main Points
:
Background
: There's a growing concern about the fairness and robustness of ML models, especially their performance on data that differs from their training set. Multiple methods have been proposed to address these limitations, including fairness methods and distributional robustness methods.
Focus
: The paper targets the concept of "subgroup robustness" in tabular data. Tabular data is common in sectors like healthcare, finance, and recommendation systems, where fairness is crucial. Additionally, tabular data often directly showcases sensitive attributes (like race, gender, etc.), making subgroup robustness especially important.
Key Observation
: The terms "fairness" and "robustness", although different, often aim for similar goals. They both desire low disparity (minimal variation in model performance across different subgroups) and high worst-group performance (the lowest performing subgroup should still have good accuracy).
Study
: The authors compare several existing methods for fair and robust learning against state-of-the-art tree-based models and other baseline techniques. Their experiments, conducted over 340,000 model configurations on eight datasets, reveal that tree-based methods exhibit strong subgroup robustness. Even when compared to models specifically designed for fairness and robustness, tree-based models performed well. Furthermore, tree-based models were found to be less sensitive to hyperparameter configurations and were more cost-effective to train.
Conclusion
: Tree-based ensemble models serve as a solid baseline for tabular data, providing a default choice when aiming for subgroup robustness.
The mentioned figure (Figure 1) and the rest of the text provide specific results from the study, but this information is not included in the provided excerpt.

sensitive attributes with respect to which subgroup robustness is desired (race, gender, income level), and 
these attributes are often declared by the individuals represented in the dataset. This is an important 
dif f erence compared to crowdsourced group annotations (e.g., gender or race for image datasets), which can 
be unreliable [21] or fail to ref l ect the lived experiences of the individuals represented [19]. Finally, tabular 
data is challenging to model. It is often heterogeneous, containing mixed data types; it lacks the spatial, 
linguistic, or temporal structures common to other data (image, text, audio) where machine learning has 
2 
seen dramatic progress over the past decade; and it can be relatively small, containing personal information 
which cannot be scraped at Internet scale. 
In this work, we conduct a series of experiments to jointly compare methods from the fairness and robustness 
literature. Despite the fact that many works often use similar metrics and datasets, there is a lack of large-scale 
empirical studies comparing relevant methods to each other, and to strong baselines. This lack of ef f ective 
baselines is particularly concerning in light of recent works across several other areas of machine learning 
which have shown that simple baselines can perform surprisingly well against state-of-the-art techniques [47].

Our results show that modern tabular-data baselines can outperform even well-tuned state-of-the-art 
robustness- or fairness-enhancing methods with a fraction of the computational cost. Our analysis in- 
cludes a set of tree-based models which achieve strong performance on tabular data but are absent from 
prior works on robustness, which largely only compare to deep learning-based approaches despite their 
tendency to perform poorly on tabular data [38]. In our experiments, we endeavor to tune both the ���fair��� or 
���robust��� models and a representative suite of baseline methods for tabular data to obtain estimates of the 
empirical accuracy-subgroup robustness Pareto frontier for each model. To this end, we explore a wide space 
of architectures, regularization schemes, and training hyperparameters, across eight tabular datasets and 17 
model classes. Our work is an empirical contribution concerned not with proposing new methods, but with 
conducting a novel and rigorous evaluation of existing methods for learning subgroup-robust models from 
tabular data. Our contributions are as follows: 
��� Trees are subgroup-robust learners:While previous works have shown that modern tree-based 
ensembles have strong average-group performance (see Section 2.3), we show that these models are also 
surprisingly robust to subgroup shift. Tree-based models achieve this robustness despite lacking any 
explicit robustness intervention and using only average-case classif i cation losses, achieving competitive 
or better performance against state-of-the-art methods for fairness and robustness (Figure 1a,1b) over 
a large hyperparameter and model search space. To support the above analysis, we apply several 
techniques for the analysis of hyperparameter sweeps such as model performance frontier curves (Figure 
1b,3) and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis (Figures 7, 8, 9). 
��� Trees show show consistent performance across accuracy and robustness metrics:We 
empirically investigate the relationship between three types of metrics (accuracy, robustness, fairness). 
We show that metrics within these groups often agree, but the relationships across metric groups 
(i.e. robust CVaR risk and accuracy) are inconsistent. One consequence of this i nding is that model 
selection techniques af f ect tree-based models and ���robust��� or fairness-enhancing methods dif f erently: 
tree-based methods show consistent subgroup robustness across metrics (Figure 1c), while robust and 
fairness-enhancing methods are ���metric-brittle��� and tend to display poor subgroup robustness according 
to other metrics (e.g. worst-group accuracy). 
��� Trees are less sensitive to hyperparameters and less costly to train:We show that, in addition 
to their improved robustness when fully tuned, trees also require less tuning and are less costly to train. 
We demonstrate that trees have decreased sensitivity to hyperparameters ��� even when accounting for 
hyperparameter settings which were part of our initial grid but performed poorly across all datasets ��� 
and that these models require considerably less compute and i nancial cost to train when compared to 
deep learning-based robust learning techniques. 
In particular, our results highlight the importance of the underlying model class for subgroup robustness in 
tabular data. Our results suggest that subgroup robustness interventions based on the loss-based perspective 
alone may be limited, particularly because existing loss-based methods for robustness are incompatible with 
nondif f erentiable functions such as tree-based ensembles. We provide further discussion in Section 7. 
We provide code to reproduce our experiments, along with an interactive tool to explore the best-performing 
hyperparameter conf i gurations, athttps://github.com/jpgard/subgroup-robustness-grows-on-trees.

Key Findings
:
Tree-based Robustness
: The results demonstrate that tree-based methods such as XGBoost can show comparable or even better subgroup robustness than other models explicitly designed for fairness or robustness.
Sensitivity of Tabular Data
: Tabular data is challenging to model due to its heterogeneity, lack of common structures found in other data types (like image or text), and because it can be limited in size.
Need for Baseline Comparisons
: Despite many existing models in the literature, there's a lack of empirical studies that compare these models against strong baselines. This research highlights that simple baselines, like tree-based models, can often outperform more sophisticated state-of-the-art models, especially when the latter is deep learning-based which tend to perform poorly on tabular data.
Consistency and Cost

2Related Work 
2.1Fairness-Enhancing Methods for Supervised Learning 
A wide variety of works have addressed fairness in the context of machine learning, where ���fairness��� is often 
measured by the equalization of some metric over groups [5,18]. Most methods can be characterized as 
performing either pre- in-, or post-processing, which attempt to ensure fairness considerations are met in 
dif f erent stages of the modeling lifecycle. Preprocessing [73,15] attempts to modify the input data to meet 
fairness criteria, while preserving the structure of the inputs and their relationship to the prediction target. 
Inprocessing uses a modif i ed training procedure to explicitly optimize for a fairness-aware objective during 
model training. This includes using constrained or reduction-based optimization [1,72], or including explicit 
regularizers designed to encourage fairness [7,11,43,56]. Postprocessing [32,53] operates on the predictions 
of a model, modifying them to achieve fairness criteria. 
The impact of fairness under subpopulation shift is analyzed in [48], which shows theoretically that enforcing 
fairness during training can harm or improve the model, under certain conditions, and [65] conducts a causal 
analysis of fairness under covariate shift. Perhaps the work most closely related to the current study is 
Friedler et al. [26], which evaluates a set of pre-, in-, and postprocessing algorithms, demonstrating that 
many of these techniques show instability (variations in performance over dif f erent train-test splits) and 
that several fairness metrics are empirically correlated. Friedler et al. [26] do not, however, evaluate robust 
learning techniques, modern tree-based techniques (besides CART), or neural methods. Empirical evaluation 
of recent methods is needed. 
2.2Distributionally Robust Learning 
While ef f orts in robust optimization date back several decades [10], recent works have adapted and extended 
robust learning approaches to deep learning.For example, several variants of distributionally robust 
optimization (DRO) have been proposed for the training of neural networks with robustness guarantees 
[36,46,62,61,74,25]. While these approaches are not always explicitly oriented toward fairness, they are 
frequently evaluated in terms of their performance benef i ts for minimizing performance gaps between sensitive 
subgroups in real-world data [74, 62, 33]. 
A particular form of shift (and robustness) evaluated by these works is subgroup shift (also called subpopulation 
shift) [50], where the balance of subgroups in the data shifts between training and testing. Evaluating 
performance on individual subgroups is an extreme version of subgroup shift. In the context of fairness, these 
subgroups are often def i ned by one or more discrete sensitive attributes, such as race, gender, or income level, 
and intersections between these sensitive groups can often identify groups most susceptible to performance 
disparities [14]. 
2.3Models for Tabular Data 
Deep learning-based approaches largely have not achieved the transformative performance gains on tabular 
data that they have with other data modalities such as images, text, and audio [38,13,64]. The existing 
state-of-the-art for learning with tabular data is widely acknowledged to be tree-based methods, and in 
particular gradient-boosted trees [31,54,64,13]. This includes GBM [27,28], LightGBM [40], XGBoost 
[16], and CatBoost [22,55], which often show only small dif f erences in performance between them. Several 
deep learning-based approaches have recently attempted to close the gap of deep learning-based solutions for 
tabular data [38,2,37,54,39]. However, empirical analyses have shown that the reported performance of 
these methods does not generalize well to other datasets, and gradient boosting methods still achieve better 
performance with less tuning and a considerably smaller computational budget. For example, [64] and [13] 
both show, in separate analyses, that gradient boosting consistently outperforms these state-of-the-art tabular 
deep learning methods across several datasets, and tree-based methods achieve competitive performance with 
the deep learning approaches proposed in [29, 37]. 4 
The overall predictive performance of these tabular methods is evaluated in e.g. [13,29,38,54,64]. However, 
the existing literature does not investigate the fairness properties, subgroup performance, or robustness to 
subgroup shift of tabular data models; nor does it compare to subgroup-robust learning methods. Additionally, 
despite the widely-known strong performance of these models on tabular data, we are aware of no prior work 
which compares tree-based methods to robust neural network-based learners, despite the fact that the latter 
are commonly evaluated on tabular data (e.g. [36,43,74,62]). Notably, [1] evaluates GBM in conjunction 
with their proposed inprocessing method, but does not evaluate subpopulation robustness; [20] evaluates 
GBM with fairness methods but does not compare to robust methods and does not tune the GBM with 
fairness methods.

This section delves into related work in the fields of fairness-enhancing methods, robust learning, and modeling for tabular data. Here's a concise summary:
Related Work Summary
:
2.1 Fairness-Enhancing Methods for Supervised Learning
:
Fairness in ML involves ensuring equal metrics across different groups.
Three primary stages to achieve fairness:
Preprocessing
: Modifying input data to meet fairness criteria.
Inprocessing
: Modifying the training process to optimize for fairness (e.g., constrained optimization or using fairness regularizers).
Postprocessing
: Adjusting model predictions post-training to achieve fairness.
Studies have explored the implications of fairness during model training, with some showing that enforcing fairness can either harm or benefit the model.
2.2 Distributionally Robust Learning
:
Robust optimization methods have been adapted for deep learning.
Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) methods ensure neural networks are trained with robustness guarantees.
One common type of robustness evaluated is "subgroup shift", where the proportion of subgroups in the data varies between training and testing.
Subgroups, in terms of fairness, are often based on attributes like race, gender, or income level.
2.3 Models for Tabular Data
:
Deep learning hasn't achieved the same success with tabular data as it has with other data types like images or text.
The state-of-the-art for tabular data remains tree-based methods, particularly gradient-boosted trees such as GBM, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost.
Although there have been attempts to bridge the performance gap using deep learning for tabular data, gradient-boosted methods continue to outperform them in terms of generalization, computational efficiency, and less need for tuning.
The existing literature lacks an examination of fairness, subgroup performance, or robustness to subgroup shifts in tabular data models. There's also a noticeable gap in comparing tree-based methods with robust neural network-based learners, despite the common use of the latter on tabular data.
In essence, the related work section provides a comprehensive overview of efforts made in the areas of fairness and robustness in machine learning, particularly with respect to tabular data. While there's been substantial progress in ensuring fairness and robustness, there remain gaps in the evaluation and comparison of models, especially tree-based methods, on tabular data.
3Setup 
Our work is primarily concerned with empirically evaluating the sensitivity of various supervised learning 
methods to subpopulation shift. Below, we introduce our formal model, and then describe the main axes of 
variation in our experiments. This includes (i) a large set of models, many of which have not been directly 
compared in previous works; (ii) the hyperparameters used for each model; (iii) a suite of eight real-world 
fairness datasets; and (iv) a set of evaluation metrics used across the disparate literature on robustness, 
subpopulation shift, and fairness in machine learning. 
3.1Preliminaries 
Our work evaluates the task of learning a modelf����� F, a function from model classFparameterized 
by��. The parameters are learned from a datasetD := (xi,yi)n 
i=1 ��� PwherePis the data-generating 
distribution. This matches the case, most common in practice, where a single model is learned by estimating 
min��E(L(y,f��(x))) and deployed for all users. We evaluate the binary classif i cation context, wherey ��� {0,1} 
andf��(x) =�� y ���[0,1] is the score assigned byfto the outcomeyi= 1. Eachxi��� Rdcan be partitioned 
intoxi= (xi,1,...,xi,d���1,a) whereais a sensitive attribute. For notational convenience, we representaas a 
single feature here, but in our data,ais typically def i ned as the concatenation of multiple binary sensitive 
attributes (e.g. gender = female, race = white). LetDa:={(xi,yi)��� P|ai=a}denote the subgroup of the 
dataset with a given sensitive identity. 
Following many of the previous works in both fairness [18] and robustness [74,43], our analysis focuses on the 
performance off��on eachDafor alla ��� A. We are particularly interested in the worst-group performance 
and the loss disparity, respectively def i ned as 
LWorstGroup:= 
max 
a���A ED���P?La(f��)?andLDISP:= 
max 
a,a0���A ED���P?|La(f��) 
��� La0(f��)|?(1) 
.These metrics can be thought of as assessing the sensitivity off��to subgroup shift, evaluating the 
worst-group shift from D to Da(note that subgroup shift is itself a form of covariate shift [50]). 
3.2Models 
Our goal is to conduct a thorough empirical comparison of the subgroup robustness of a suite of methods for 
tabular data. We provide a more detailed description of all models used in Section B. 
��� Fairness-enhancing models: We evaluate the LFR preprocessing method of [73]; the inprocessing 
method of[1], and the postprocessing method of [32]. As in [1,20], we use GBM as the base learner for 
each model; however, unlike [20], we also tune the base learner parameters. 
��� Robust models:We evaluate both the CVaR and��2constraint forms of DRO via [46]; the CVaR 
and��2constraint forms of DORO [74]; Group DRO [62]; Marginal DRO [24]; and Maximum Weighted 
5 
Loss Discrepancy [43]. Each robust optimization method is used with a multilayer perceptron (MLP), 
as in most previous works when using tabular data, e.g. [43,46,62,74]. We note that the use of these 
losses requires performing optimization over a continuous function (such as a neural network), which 
makes these loss-based robustness interventions incompatible with existing training procedures for e.g. 
tree-based models. 
��� Tree-based models:We evaluate GBM, LightGBM [40], XGBoost [16], and Random Forest models. 
��� Baseline models:As baselines, we includeL2-regularized logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, 
and fully-connected neural networks (MLP) with standard (non-DRO) ERM optimization.

GBM, LightGBM, XGBoost, and Random Forest models.
Baseline models
:
L2-regularized logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, and standard MLP neural networks.
The setup thus lays a comprehensive foundation to understand the robustness and fairness of various models, especially in the presence of subgroup shifts.
3.3Hyperparameter Sweeps 
For each model, we conduct a grid search over a large set of hyperparameters. We give the complete set of 
hyperparameters tuned for each model in Section F. 
Our hyperparameter search for each model is extensive by design, in order to ensure a reliable comparison 
of the best-performing models from each class. We expand the initial grid for continuous hyperparameters 
when a model on the Pareto frontier is at the edge of the grid. When one method includes another as a ���base��� 
learner (e.g. LFR preprocessing with GBM, or DRO with MLP), we include the full tuning grid for the base 
model (i.e. we explore the cross-product of all MLP hyperparameters with all DRO hyperparameters). 
We note that previous works tend to either compare against a i xed baseline architecture and training 
hyperparameters (e.g. [74,38]), perform manual tuning ([46]), or do not tune hyperparameters of the base 
model when using fairness-enhancing techniques ([20]). 
3.4Metrics 
One goal of our work is to assess the empirical relationship between the model evaluation metrics used in 
the robustness, fairness, and classif i cation literatures. Dif f erences in the training objectives used across the 
various fair and robust models in prior work make such a comparison particularly useful. The relationship 
between these diverse evaluation metrics is not explored in existing work, where several dif f erent metrics 
have been used to compare the performance of models, evaluate their fairness with respect to subgroups, and 
measure their robustness to various shifts or outliers. We draw several metrics from prior works and report 
them for our experiments. We also explore the empirical relationships between dif f erent metrics. 
For each metricL(e.g. loss, accuracy, Equalized Odds), we can not only measure the overall empirical 
performance of a model, but we can measure the worst-group loss and disparity over subgroups of the data, 
as def i ned in Equation(1). Worst-group and disparity measures, for various formulations of the loss functions 
above, are a widely-used measure of fairness and robustness [12,74,62,61,33,44]. In particular, we use 
theLDISPandLWorstGroupwith accuracy as the loss function. Accuracy is widely used in practice, directly 
interpretable, and invariant to rescaling of the model���s predictions. 
We also use theCVaR riskmetric from the robustness literature. CVaR risk is measured over a set of inputs 
D= (xi,yi)N 
i=1��� P and measures the worst-case weighted loss, according to some loss function���, at level�� 
over the inputs in D: LCVaR(D,P) := sup

Additional fairness and robustness metrics are reported in Section G and def i ned in Section C.

An extensive grid search is conducted for hyperparameters of each model, aiming for a thorough comparison of optimal performances.
If a model reaches the grid's boundary, the initial grid is expanded for continuous hyperparameters.
If one method incorporates another as a ���base��� learner, the full tuning grid for the base model is taken into consideration.
The research diverges from previous works, which might use fixed baselines, manual tuning, or avoid tuning base model hyperparameters.
3.4 Metrics
:
The study aims to assess the correlation between different evaluation metrics employed across robustness, fairness, and classification studies.

Metrics like loss, accuracy, Equalized Odds are examined not just for overall performance but also for worst-group losses and disparities across data subgroups.
The research specifically employs LDISP and LWorstGroup with accuracy as the loss function, given its prevalent use, direct interpretability, and resistance to prediction rescaling.
The CVaR risk metric is employed, which measures the worst-case weighted loss according to a specific loss function at a particular level over the data inputs.
Further metrics are described in Sections G and C.

4Results: Tree Models are Subgroup-Robust Learners 
Our main i nding is that tree-based models are subgroup-robust learners. Tree-based models match or exceed 
the performance of distributionally robust and fairness-enhancing models in terms of best overall accuracy, 
worst-group accuracy, and accuracy disparity on all datasets evaluated. 
A summary of our results is shown in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4. Following previous works, our main evaluation 
metrics are accuracy-based: overall accuracy, worst-group accuracy, and accuracy disparity. Over the wide 
sweep of datasets and model conf i gurations evaluated, modern tree-based models ��� GBM, LightGBM, Random 
Forest and XGBoost ��� all achieve subgroup performance characteristics on par with, or better than, the 
set of robust or fairness-enhancing models evaluated. For example, on three of the four largest datasets in 
our study (ACS Income, ACS Public Coverage, LARC), XGBoost achieves signif i cantly betterLandLwg 
than DRO-based methods (Group DRO,��2DRO), as indicated by nonoverlapping Clopper-Pearson CIs 
(�� = 0.05). 
The only cases where another algorithm achieves better maximum overall robustness (as measured by worst- 
group accuracy) than tree-based methods are DORO CVaR on Adult, and Inprocessing on Communities and 
Crime (see Figures 4, 4). We note that in both cases, (i) these dif f erences are not statistically signif i cant, 
based on the shown Clopper-Pearson conf i dence intervals at��= 0.05, and (ii) these dif f erences occur at 
points below the maximum overall accuracy for each model. In all cases, at the point of maximum overall 
accuracy, tree-based models achieve equivalent or better worst-group accuracy than all other models evaluated, 
based on Clopper-Pearson conf i dence intervals at �� = 0.05. 
We note that this is particularly surprising because none of the tree-based models explicitly optimize for 
robustness, fairness, or subgroup performance in any way; in contrast, the distributionally robust learners and 
fairness-enhancing techniques explicitly optimize for such criteria and in some cases (DORO, DRO, Group 
DRO) provide explicit guarantees of various forms of robustness. A similar analysis showing accuracy disparity 
is shown in Figures 16, 17, and a complete set of model performance observations from each algorithm and 
dataset, are in Supplementary Section G. 7 
Figure 2: Overall Accuracy vs. Worst-Group Accuracy of robust, fairness-enhancing, tree-based, and baseline 
models over eight tabular datasets. Dashed lines indicatey=x, when worst-group accuracy equal to 
overall accuracy (zero accuracy disparity). See Figures 12-15 for more detailed results by algorithm. Note: 
���discretization��� artifacts are due to small test/dataset sizes. 
To summarize our results over the large hyperparameter sweeps, we use model performance frontiers to 
measure the best possible set of tradeof f s between (LandLWorstGroup) and (LandLDISP). Model performance 
frontiers represent the envelope of the convex hull of all observations ofL(f��)��� F. An example is shown 
in Figure 1b and 1d, with the remaining datasets in Figures 3 and 4. The frontiers allow us to compare 
the best-possible tradeof f between accuracy and worst-group accuracy (Fig 3; higher is better) or between 
accuracy and accuracy disparity (Fig 4; lower is better).

4. Results: Tree Models as Subgroup-Robust Learners
:
The main discovery is that tree-based models, such as GBM, LightGBM, Random Forest, and XGBoost, are robust learners, especially for subgroups.
These tree models equal or surpass distributionally robust and fairness-enhancing models in terms of overall accuracy, worst-group accuracy, and accuracy disparity across all datasets.
Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 provide a visualization of these results, emphasizing on accuracy-based metrics.
In tests across several datasets and model configurations, tree-based models consistently exhibited performance traits that matched or exceeded the robust or fairness-enhancing models.
As an illustration, in three major datasets (ACS Income, ACS Public Coverage, LARC), XGBoost significantly outperformed DRO-based methods like Group DRO and ��2DRO.
There were only a few instances where other algorithms surpassed tree-based models in maximum overall robustness. Specifically, DORO CVaR on Adult and Inprocessing on Communities and Crime stood out, but these differences weren't statistically significant.
Intriguingly, while tree-based models do not actively optimize for robustness or fairness, they still match or surpass models that do, like DORO, DRO, and Group DRO, which come with explicit robustness guarantees.
Figures 16 and 17 present a detailed accuracy disparity analysis. Comprehensive performance details for each model and dataset are provided in Supplementary Section G.
Figure 2 Description
: Illustrates the relationship between overall accuracy and worst-group accuracy for different types of models across eight tabular datasets. The dashed line indicates where the worst-group accuracy matches the overall accuracy. The graph also emphasizes "discretization" artifacts, which are due to limited test/dataset sizes.
The research employed model performance frontiers to summarize results across broad hyperparameter sweeps. These frontiers map the best potential trade-offs between different accuracy measures, visualized in Figures 1b, 1d, 3, and 4. They help to analyze the optimal balance between accuracy and worst-group accuracy or accuracy and accuracy disparity.
5 Results: Robust Models Can Be Metric-Brittle 
Our results show that, over all models and datasets, metrics which we refer to as ���complementary��� ��� those 
measuring the same event on dif f erent subsets, or with dif f erent conditioning ��� are strongly correlated with 
each other: accuracy and worst-group accuracy; CVaR and CVaR DORO; and Demographic Parity Dif f erence 
and Equalized Odds Dif f erence all show strong correlation with each model classF; 
we show these correlations 
on Adult in Figure 5. The median��values over all datasets and algorithms are 0.87, 0.99, 0.79 for the three 
pairs of metrics, respectively (we show the complete set of correlations for each model and metric in Figure 
18). These results show that model selection based on one metric from each pair (Overall Accuracy) is likely 
to lead to a model with strong performance for the other metric in the pair (e.g. Worst-Group Accuracy). 
In contrast, our experiments show that there is a severe lack of correlation across almost all of the non- 
complementary pairs, shown in the bottom row of Figure 5. In particular, our results show that models which 
achieve a strong ���robust��� risk ��� for example, a low CVaR DORO risk, one model selection rule used in [74]

5. Results: Robust Models Can Be Metric-Brittle
:
The research findings highlight that certain metrics, termed as "complementary", exhibit strong correlations with each other. These complementary metrics include:
Accuracy and Worst-Group Accuracy
CVaR and CVaR DORO
Demographic Parity Difference and Equalized Odds Difference
Such metrics display a consistent correlation pattern across different model classes. For instance, Figure 5 showcases these correlations using the Adult dataset. Median correlation values (��) for these metric pairs are 0.87, 0.99, and 0.79 respectively across all datasets and algorithms. The detailed correlation data for every model and metric is depicted in Figure 18.
A significant takeaway from this is that if a model is selected based on one metric in these pairs, it is highly likely to perform well on the other metric. For example, a model with good Overall Accuracy is also expected to have a strong Worst-Group Accuracy.
However, the situation is different for non-complementary metric pairs. There is a conspicuous absence of correlation between them. Figure 5's bottom row provides insights into this phenomenon. A notable finding is that models performing well on certain "robust" metrics (like low CVaR DORO risk, a selection criterion used in [74]) don't necessarily translate to strong performance in other non-complementary metrics.
Figure 3 Description
: Demonstrates model performance frontiers, which are created by mapping the convex envelope of model performance. These frontiers show that tree-based models can match or even surpass the performance of top-performing robustness methodologies. The research also refers to Figure 1 for additional datasets.
Figure 4 Description
: Portrays model disparity frontiers, which are formed by sketching the convex envelope of model disparities. Again, tree-based models exhibit comparable or superior frontiers in comparison to the best-performing robustness techniques, particularly in regions of high accuracy.
Figure 5: While ���complementary��� metrics (those measuring the same event with dif f erent conditioning) are 
closely correlated for all models, non-complementary metrics behave dif f erently by model. Accuracy can vary 
widely for ���robust��� models with a i xed robust (CVaR) risk, while for tree models, the best (lowest) CVaR 
risk is typically associated with the best (highest) accuracy. ACS Income dataset shown; see Supplementary 
Figure 18 and Section G for additional datasets and metrics. 
��� can achieve very low accuracies. Indeed, the ���robust��� learning methods are the most susceptible to this 
discrepancy over metrics in our experiments, as shown in Figure 6. While these results conf i rm the i nding 
in previous works that fairness metrics are correlated [26], our broader comparison shows a brittleness to 
model selection metrics outside these sets of complementary metrics, and reveal the very strict sense in which 
robustness guarantees apply only to a limited range of metrics. This discrepancy is of practical signif i cance 
given that robust models are often selected using robust metrics (i.e. DORO CVaR, cf. [74]), while models in 
practice are frequently evaluated using other metrics (i.e. accuracy, fairness metrics). 
To illustrate the practical implications of this metric brittleness, we also explore the impact of various 
strategies for choosing a singlef����� Fover a set of models in each hyperparameter grid. While this problem 
is implicitly addressed in almost all previous works, the decision is often handled dif f erently. For example, 
models are tuned and selected by hand [46], chosen based on worst-group performance [74], or based on 
robust risk metrics [62]. The empirical implications of model selection methods for fairness and robustness 
are not well-understood. 
To address this question, we show the worst-group performance of models over our sweeps, selected according 
to either best accuracy or best CVaR in Figure 6. Figure 6 demonstrates the downstream impact of the lack 
of correlation between robust risk metrics and worst-group accuracy: distributionally-robust models can 
suf f er signif i cant drops in worst-group accuracy, when selected based on robust risk. In contrast, tree-based 
models show ���metric robustness��� ��� that is, tree-based models which perform best according to the robust risk 
measure (CVaR) still achieve worst-group accuracy near the highest-accuracy model of the same class (here, 
XGBoost).

Summary

Figure 5 Description
:
The figure delineates how "complementary" metrics (those metrics which gauge the same event but under varied conditions) exhibit a close correlation across all model types. In contrast, when considering non-complementary metrics, the behavior varies by the model type. For instance, while certain "robust" models with a fixed robust risk (like CVaR) can display significantly varied accuracies, tree models usually align their best (lowest) CVaR risk with their best (highest) accuracy. The results from the ACS Income dataset are provided as an example. Additional datasets and metrics related to this topic are referenced in Supplementary Figure 18 and Section G.
Key Takeaways
:
There exists a discrepancy in the behavior of metrics. While "complementary" metrics are tightly correlated, non-complementary metrics display distinct behaviors across different model types.
"Robust" learning methodologies appear to be the most vulnerable to these metric discrepancies, as portrayed in Figure 6.
Previous research has indeed highlighted that fairness metrics have a correlation. However, the broader perspective from this study emphasizes a brittleness in model selection metrics outside the realms of these complementary metrics. This suggests that robustness guarantees may only be applicable to a specific range of metrics. Such a discovery holds significant implications, especially given that robust models are frequently selected based on their robust metrics (like DORO CVaR), but are often evaluated in practice using different metrics, such as accuracy or fairness metrics.
The practical ramifications of such metric brittleness are further elucidated upon. Different strategies to select a particular model,

, from a set are explored. Though previous works have implicitly tackled this issue, the approach to model selection has varied. For instance:
Some models are handpicked and tuned [46]
Some are chosen based on worst-group performance [74]
Others rely on robust risk metrics [62]
The real-world consequences of these model selection techniques concerning fairness and robustness remain an area not comprehensively understood.
To shed light on this, the study showcases the worst-group performance of models selected either for their best accuracy or best CVaR, as illustrated in Figure 6. This figure underlines a critical observation:
Models that prioritize robustness can witness considerable declines in worst-group accuracy when chosen based on their robust risk.
On the other hand, tree-based models exude "metric robustness". Specifically, even when these models are selected based on a robust risk measure like CVaR, they still manage to achieve a worst-group accuracy closely aligned with the highest-accuracy model of their class (for instance, XGBoost).
6Results: Trees Show Lower Hyperparameter Sensitivity and are 
Less Costly to Train 
For many practical applications, both the time and i nancial costs of training models are of prime importance. 
These also af f ect the amount of expertise required to train a model (with sensitive models requiring greater 
expertise) and directly impact the carbon footprint of training [34]. We conduct a hyperparameter sensitivity 
analysis by pruning the hyperparameter search space to eliminate conf i gurations that performed poorly across 
all datasets, ranking the remaining conf i gurations by performance (i.e. accuracy), and plotting the decline 
in performance over the ranked models. These results, shown in Figures 7 Section F.2, demonstrate that

Figure 6: Worst-group accuracy for models with best overall accuracy (solid), and best CVaR (shaded). 
Tree-based models show better performance across non-complementary metrics (as indicated by similar 
heights of orange bars within each plot), whereas robustness- and fairness-based models do not (statistically- 
signif i cant gaps between blue, green bars): worst-group accuracy drops signif i cantly between best-accuracy 
and best-CVaR DRO ��2and Group DRO models (See also Figure 1 for the remaining three datasets.). 
tree-based models also show less sensitivity to hyperparameters than the other methods evaluated for both 
overall performance metrics (e.g., accuracy) and subgroup robustness metrics (e.g., worst-group accuracy). 
These results are particularly important in light of the large dif f erences in resources required to achieve similar 
levels of performance between robust models and the tree-based models: for example, the full hyperparameter 
grid sweep of size 12k XGBoost on the largest dataset in our study, ACS Income, completed in 1 CPU-day; 
DRO��2sweep of 3250 training runs completed in 58 GPU-days. Due to the dif f erences in hardware required 
to train various models, we conduct an estimated comparison of the cost of training an individual model, and of the full sweep. These results, shown in Figure 19, show that tree-based models are also considerably less 
expensive to train and tune.

Key Takeaways

Importance of Training Cost and Time
: In many practical scenarios, the time and financial constraints related to training models are crucial. These constraints also influence the level of expertise needed to train a model, with sensitive models demanding higher expertise. Additionally, they have a direct bearing on the carbon footprint associated with training.
Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis
: An analysis was conducted to gauge the sensitivity of various models to hyperparameters. This involved pruning the hyperparameter search space to remove poor-performing configurations, ranking the surviving configurations by performance (using accuracy as the metric), and charting the performance decline over these ranked models.
Observations from Figures

Figure 6
: Presents the worst-group accuracy for models that exhibit the best overall accuracy (depicted with solid bars) and the best CVaR (indicated by shaded bars). Tree-based models consistently perform better across non-complementary metrics, as visualized by the comparable height of the orange bars within each plot. In contrast, models focusing on robustness and fairness display marked performance variations (evidenced by the significant gaps between the blue and green bars). For these models, there is a notable drop in worst-group accuracy when transitioning from best-accuracy to best-CVaR DRO.
Figures 7 and 19
(and related content in Section F.2): Demonstrates that tree-based models are less sensitive to hyperparameters when compared to other evaluated methods. This holds true for both overall performance metrics (like accuracy) and subgroup robustness metrics (such as worst-group accuracy). Another significant observation is the resource disparity between robust and tree-based models. As an instance, the study mentions that an extensive hyperparameter grid sweep for XGBoost (containing 12k configurations) on the ACS Income dataset (the largest in this study) was completed in just 1 CPU-day. In comparison, the DRO��2 sweep, which comprised 3250 training runs, took a whopping 58 GPU-days. When considering the diverse hardware needs for training various models, tree-based models emerge as substantially more cost-effective to train and fine-tune.
In essence, the results underscore the practical advantages of tree-based models, which not only deliver competitive performance but also demand fewer resources, both in terms of time and cost.
7Conclusion 
Machine learning has made signif i cant progress in the past several years in identifying and addressing various 
challenges which can contribute to real-world performance disparities. However, our results suggest that 
another form of progress not widely acknowledged as having implications for fairness or robustness ��� advances 
in tabular data modeling with tree-based algorithms ��� have similar, if not greater, impact in practice than 
the state of the art in robust neural network learning or fairness-enhancing methods. Our results suggest 
that tree-based algorithms are a surprisingly strong baseline for subgroup robustness in tabular data, and 
that future work should compare against, and improve upon, the subgroup robustness of tree-based models. 
Our work suggests that, in practice, tree-based ensembles are an ef f ective default for tasks where subgroup 
robustness is desired. 
Our results also suggest that subgroup robustness on par with existing state of the art can be achieved with 
tree-based classif i ers that are easier and computationally cheaper to train and tune than either robust or 
fairness-enhancing models, which tend to scale poorly with dataset size (in bothnandd). Our work thus 
contributes a critical baseline, similar to how other recent works have contributed much-needed baselines 
in areas of machine learning af f ected by the rapid proliferation of new methods [59,67,47], and provides a 
strong benchmark for future robust and fair learning methods. 
Our i ndings are limited to the set of hyperparameters and models explored in our experiments ��� a superset 
of those from the works discussed above (e.g. [62,74]). Our i ndings do not demonstrate that robust learning 
methods cannot achieve subgroup robustness on par with e.g. XGBoost, but merely that this is not achieved 
with the conf i gurations widely used in the literature. We note that the loss-based interventions largely favored 
by existing robust and fair learning techniques require optimization over a continuous function, typically 
implemented as a feedforward neural network; this also makes it dif i cult to disentangle whether the functional 
form, or the training procedure and objective, lead to the improved subgroup robustness of tree-based models

observed in this study. Future work should investigate the subgroup robustness of non-MLP models trained 
using robust techniques. 
While our experiments do not identify the cause of trees��� subgroup robustness, it is likely that this is a 
consequence of their strong overall performance on tabular data. These i ndings can be also viewed as an 
analogue of the empirical relationship between in-distribution and out-of-distribution accuracy in computer 
vision documented in [49] but now demonstrated for the tabular domain. It is possible that these improvements 
are due to (i) an inductive bias in tree-based models beter suited to modeling differences in subpopulations 
in tabular data, or (ii) the ensembling used by the tree-based models in this work. We leave an identification of such causal factors to future work.

Conclusion and Key Insights
:
ML Progress and Real-world Challenges
: Over recent years, machine learning has made noteworthy advancements in pinpointing and addressing challenges that lead to real-world performance disparities.
Importance of Tree-based Algorithms
: Despite the commendable progress in ML, the results highlight that advancements in tabular data modeling using tree-based algorithms play an equally, if not more, vital role than the recent progress in robust neural network learning or fairness-enhancing methods. Tree-based algorithms present a compelling baseline for ensuring subgroup robustness, especially in tabular data settings. The practical implication is that tree-based ensembles can serve as a default choice when aiming for subgroup robustness.
Training Efficiency of Tree-based Classifiers
: Tree-based classifiers are not only robust but are also more efficient and cost-effective to train in comparison to fairness-enhancing or robust models. Especially with larger datasets, these traditional models tend to scale poorly.
Importance of Baselines
: This study adds a critical baseline in the area of ML, reminiscent of other recent works that provide essential baselines in the ever-evolving domain of ML, offering a robust benchmark for future learning methods focusing on robustness and fairness.
Limitations and Scope
: The findings are restricted to the hyperparameters and models tested in this study. It doesn't suggest that robust learning methods can't achieve the robustness levels seen with tree-based algorithms like XGBoost, but it indicates that the configurations commonly used in prior literature don't achieve this.
Cause of Tree's Subgroup Robustness
: The study doesn't pinpoint the exact reason for the observed subgroup robustness of tree models. It speculates that this might be due to their superior performance on tabular data, similar to the empirical relationship observed between in-distribution and out-of-distribution accuracy in computer vision. Possible reasons for these improvements could be the inherent bias in tree-based models that favors modeling variances in subpopulations within tabular data or the ensemble techniques utilized by these tree-based models.
Future Directions
: Further investigations should focus on understanding the subgroup robustness of non-MLP models when trained using robust techniques. The study emphasizes the importance of identifying the causal factors behind the success of tree-based models, leaving this exploration for future research endeavors.

Abstract 
In this manuscript, we show that any neural network 
with any activation function can be represented as a de- 
cision tree. The representation is equivalence and not an 
approximation, thus keeping the accuracy of the neural net- 
work exactly as is. We believe that this work provides bet- 
ter understanding of neural networks and paves the way to 
tackle their black-box nature. We share equivalent trees 
of some neural networks and show that besides providing 
interpretability, tree representation can also achieve some 
computational advantages for small networks. The analysis 
holds both for fully connected and convolutional networks, 
which may or may not also include skip connections and/or 
normalizations. 
1. Introduction 
Despite the immense success of neural networks over the 
past decade, the black-box nature of their predictions pre- 
vent their wider and more reliable adoption in many indus- 
tries, suchashealthandsecurity. Thisfactledresearchersto 
investigate ways to explain neural network decisions. The 
efforts in explaining neural network decisions can be cate- 
gorized into several approaches: saliency maps, approxima- 
tion by interpretable methods and joint models. 
Saliency maps are ways of highlighting areas on the in- 
put, of which a neural network make use of the most while 
prediction. An earlier work [20] takes the gradient of the 
neural network output with respect to the input in order to 
visualize an input-specif i c linearization of the entire net- 
work. Another work [26] uses a deconvnet to go back to 
features from decisions. The saliency maps obtained via 
these methods are often noisy and prevent a clear under- 
standing of the decisions made. Another track of meth- 
ods [29], [18], [4], [6] make use of the derivative of a neural 
network output with respect to an activation, usually the one 
right before fully connected layers. This saliency maps ob- 
tained by this track, and some other works [27], [11], [5] are 
clearer in the sense of highlighting areas related to the pre- 
dicted class. Although useful for purposes such as check- 
ing whether the support area for decisions are sound, these 
methods still lack a detailed logical reasoning of why such 
decision is made. 
Conversion between neural networks and interpretable 
by-design models -such as decision trees- has been a topic 
of interest. In [8], a method was devised to initialize neural 
networks with decision trees. [9,19,25] also provides neu- 
ral network equivalents of decision trees. The neural net- 
works in these works have specif i c architectures, thus the 
conversion lacks generalization to any model. In [24], neu- 
ral networks were trained in such a way that their decision 
boundaries can be approximated by trees. This work does 
not provide a correspondence between neural networks and 
decision trees, and merely uses the latter as a regulariza- 
tion. In [7], a neural network was used to train a decision 
tree. Such tree distillation is an approximation of a neural 
network and not a direct conversion, thus performs poorly 
on the tasks that the neural network was trained on. 
Joint neural network and decision tree models [12], [16], 
[13],[14],[17],[2],[10],[22]genarallyusedeeplearningto 
assists some trees, or come up with a neural network struc- 
ture so it resembles a tree. A recent work [23] replaces the 
i nal fully connected layer of a neural network with a deci- 
sion tree. Since the backbone features are still that of neural 
networks, the explanation is sought to be achieved via pro- 
viding a means to humans to validate the decision as a good 
or bad one, rather than a complete logical reasoning of the 
decision. 
In this paper, we show that any neural network having 
any activations has a directly equivalent decision tree rep- 
resentation. Thus, the induced tree output is exactly the 
same with that of the neural network and tree representation 
doesn���t limit or require altering of the neural architecture 
in any way. We believe that the decision tree equivalence 
provides better understanding of neural networks and paves 
the way to tackle the black-box nature of neural networks, 
e.g. via analyzing the category that a test sample belongs 
to, which can be extracted by the node rules that a sample 
is categorized. We show that the decision tree equivalent of

a neural network can be found for either fully connected or 
convolutional neural networks which may include skip lay- 
ers and normalizations as well. Besides the interpretability 
aspect, we show that the induced tree is also advantageous 
to the corresponding neural network in terms of computa- 
tional complexity, at the expense of increased storage mem- 
ory. Upon writing this paper, we have noticed the following 
works having overlaps with ours [28], [3], [15], [21], es- 
pecially for feedforward ReLU networks. We extend the 
i ndings in these works to any activation function and also 
recurrent neural networks. 
2. Decision Tree Analysis of Neural Networks 
The derivations in this section will be i rst made for feed- 
forward neural networks with piece-wise linear activation 
functions such as ReLU, Leaky ReLU, etc. Next, the analy- 
sis will be extended to any neural network with any activa- 
tion function. 
2.1. Fully Connected Networks 
Let Wibe the weight matrix of a network���s ithlayer. 
Let �� be any piece-wise linear activation function, and x0 
be the input to the neural network. Then, the output and an 
intermediate feature of a feed-forward neural network can 
be represented as in Eq. 1. 
NN(x0) = WT n���1��(W 
T n���2��(...W 
T 
1��(W 
T 
0x0))) 
xi= ��(WT i���1��(...W 
T 
1��(W 
T 
0x0))) 
(1) 
Note that in Eq. 1, we omit any i nal activation (e.g. 
softmax) and we ignore the bias term as it can be simply 
included by concatenating a 1 value to each xi. The acti- 
vation function �� acts as an element-wise scalar multiplica- 
tion, hence the following can be written. 
WT 
i��(W 
T i���1xi���1) = W 
T i(ai���1? (W 
T i���1xi���1)) (2) 
In Eq. 2, ai���1is a vector indicating the slopes of activa- 
tions in the corresponding linear regions where WT i���1xi���1 
fall into, ? denotes element-wise multiplication. Note that, 
ai���1can directly be interpreted as a categorization result 
since it includes indicators (slopes) of linear regions in ac- 
tivation function. The Eq. 2 can be re-organized as follows. 
WT 
i��(W 
T i���1xi���1) = (Wi? ai���1) TWT i���1xi���1 (3) 
In Eq.3, we use ? as a column-wise element-wise 
multiplication on Wi. This corresponds to element-wise 
multiplication by a matrix obtained via by repeating ai���1 
column-vector to match the size of Wi. Using Eq. 3, Eq. 1 
can be rewritten as follows. 
NN(x0) = (Wn���1? an���2)T(Wn���2? an���3)T 
...(W1? a0)TWT 0x0 
(4) 
From Eq. 4, one can def i ne an effective weight matrix

(5) 
In Eq. 5, the categorization vector until layer i is de- 
i ned as follows: ci���1= a0k a1k ...ai���1, where k is the 
concatenation operator. 
One can directly observe from Eq.5 that, the effec- 
tive matrix of layer i is only dependent on the categoriza- 
tion vectors from previous layers. This indicates that in 
each layer, a new eff i cient i lter is selected -to be applied 
on the network input- based on the previous categoriza- 
tions/decisions. This directly shows that a fully connected 
neural network can be represented as a single decision tree, 
where effective matrices acts as categorization rules.In

In order to better illustrate the equivalent decision tree of 
a neural network, in Algorithm 1, we rewrite Eq. 5 for the 
entire network, as an algorithm. For the sake of simplic-

The article titled "Neural Networks are Decision Trees" by Caglar Aytekin proposes that any neural network can be represented equivalently as a decision tree. This representation is not an approximation; rather, it retains the exact accuracy of the neural network. The significance of this claim lies in its potential to enhance the interpretability of neural networks, which are often criticized for their black-box nature.
Key points from the article:
Background
: Despite the success of neural networks in various applications, their "black-box" nature makes it challenging to understand or explain their predictions. This has limited their adoption in industries like health and security, where interpretability is paramount.
Existing Approaches
: Various methods have been developed to make neural networks more interpretable. Examples include saliency maps, which highlight regions of input that the network considers most important, and various methods to approximate or convert neural networks to more interpretable models like decision trees.
Main Proposition
: The author claims that any neural network, regardless of its activation function, can be directly represented as a decision tree. This tree representation does not require any modification of the neural network architecture.
Advantages
: The tree representation of a neural network offers several potential benefits:
It could help demystify the black-box nature of neural networks by providing clear, rule-based logic for their predictions.
For certain small networks, the tree representation could also offer computational advantages, though at the cost of increased storage requirements.
Technical Analysis
: The article provides a detailed mathematical analysis of how neural networks can be represented as decision trees. The analysis begins with feed-forward networks using piecewise linear activation functions (like ReLU) and then extends to more general cases.
Illustrative Algorithm
: An algorithm is presented to illustrate the process of converting a neural network's operations into an equivalent decision tree representation.
This research suggests that the decision-making process of neural networks can be dissected and understood using decision trees, providing a path to tackle the opaqueness associated with neural network predictions. However, it's important to note that while this method offers an equivalent representation, the practicality of using such trees, especially for very large networks, remains to be seen.
Certainly! Decision trees can provide interpretability for neural networks by representing the decision-making process in a more understandable and transparent manner. Here's how decision trees can contribute to interpretability:

1. Clear decision rules: Decision trees make decisions based on a series of if-else conditions, where each internal node represents a decision based on a specific feature or attribute, and each leaf node represents a final decision or outcome. These decision rules can be easily interpreted and understood by humans, as they follow a logical and intuitive structure.

2. Feature importance: Decision trees can reveal the importance of different features or variables in the decision-making process. By examining the structure of the decision tree, we can identify the features that have the most significant impact on the final decision. This helps in understanding the factors that drive the neural network's predictions.

3. Path traversal: When a sample is input into a decision tree, it follows a specific path from the root to a leaf node based on the values of its features. This path traversal provides a step-by-step explanation of how the decision was reached. By analyzing the path taken by a sample, we can gain insights into the decision-making process of the neural network.

4. Visual representation: Decision trees can be visually represented, making it easier to grasp and interpret the decision-making process. The tree structure allows for a clear visualization of the hierarchical relationships between features and decisions, aiding in the understanding of how inputs are transformed into outputs.

5. Simplicity and transparency: Decision trees are inherently simpler and more transparent than complex neural networks. They provide a concise representation of the decision rules, making it easier for non-experts to understand and trust the model's predictions.

By mapping a neural network to an equivalent decision tree, we can leverage the interpretability of decision trees to gain insights into the inner workings of the neural network. This can help in identifying potential biases, understanding the factors influencing predictions, and building trust in the model's outputs.

Exactly! The manuscript you shared also highlights that any neural network, regardless of its activation function, can be represented equivalently as a decision tree. This not only tackles the black-box nature of neural networks but also provides computational advantages for smaller networks. By representing neural networks as decision trees, we can maintain the accuracy while gaining interpretability, which can be crucial in industries where understanding the decision process is vital, such as healthcare or security.
Figure 5. Categorizations made by the decision tree for half-moon 
dataset 
directly creates the invalid left child for this node. Hence, 
the tree can be cleaned via removing the left child in this 
case, and merging the categorization rule to the stricter one : 
x < ���1.16 in the particular case. Via cleaning the decision 
tree in Fig. 2, we obtain the simpler tree in Fig. 3a, which 
only consists of 5 categories instead of 16. The 5 categories 
are directly visible also from the model response in Fig. 3b. 
The interpretation of the neural network is thus straightfor- 
ward: for each region whose boundaries are determined via 
the decision tree representation, the network approximates 
the non-linear y = x2equation by a linear equation. One 
can clearly interpret and moreover make deduction from the 
decision tree, some of which are as follows. The neural 
network is unable to grasp the symmetrical nature of the 
regression problem which is evident from the fact that the 
decision boundaries are asymmetrical. The region in below 
���1.16 and above 1 is unbounded and thus neural decisions 
lose accuracy as x goes beyond these boundaries.

3 layers with leaky-ReLU activations, except for last layer 
which has sigmoid activation. Each layer has 2 i lters ex- 
cept for the last layer which has 1. The cleaned decision 
tree induced by the trained network is shown in Fig. 4. The 
decision tree i nds many categories whose boundaries are 
determined by the rules in the tree, where each category 
is assigned a single class. In order to better visualize the 
categories, we illustrate them with different colors in Fig. 
5. One can make several deductions from the decision tree 
such as some regions are very well-def i ned, bounded and 
the classif i cations they make are perfectly in line with the 
training data, thus these regions are very reliable. There are 
unbounded categories which help obtaining accurate classi- 
i cation boundaries, yet fail to provide a compact represen- 
tation of the training data, these may correspond to inaccu- 
rate extrapolations made by neural decisions. There are also 
some categories that emerged although none of the training 
data falls to them. 
Besides the interpretability aspect, the decision tree rep- 
resentation also provides some computational advantages. 
In Table 1, we compare the number of parameters, l oat- 
point comparisons and multiplication or addition operations 
of the neural network and the tree induced by it. Note that 
the comparisons, multiplications and additions in the tree 
representation are given as expected values, since per each 
category depth of the tree is different. As the induced tree 
is an unfolding of the neural network, it covers all possi- 
ble routes and keeps all possible effective i lters in mem- 
ory. Thus, as expected, the number of parameters in the tree 
representation of a neural network is larger than that of the 
network. In the induced tree, in every layer i, a maximum 
of mif i lters are applied directly on the input, whereas in the 
neural network always mif i lters are applied on the previous 
feature, which is usually much larger than the input in the 
feature dimension. Thus, computation-wise, the tree repre- 
sentation is advantageous compared to the neural network 
one. 
4. Conclusion 
In this manuscript, we have shown that neural networks 
can be equivalently represented as decision trees. The tree 
equivalence holds for fully connected layers, convolutional 
layers, residual connections, normalizations, recurrent lay- 
ers and any activation. We believe that this tree equivalence 
provides directions to tackle the black-box nature of neural 
networks.

equation with linear segments. Insights can be derived from the decision tree's structure, such as the network not capturing the symmetrical nature of the regression problem and having decision boundaries that are asymmetrical.
Half-Moon Classification
: Another experiment is described where a neural network was trained to classify half-moons. The decision tree corresponding to this neural network showed distinct categories, with some being reliable and perfectly matching the training data, while others were less accurate extrapolations. Some categories appeared even though no training data corresponded to them, indicating potential overfitting or unnecessary complexity.
Computational Analysis
: The decision tree representation offers computational benefits over the traditional neural network. While the tree requires more parameters due to its comprehensive representation of the neural network's decision-making process, it is computationally more efficient. This is evident in Table 1, which compares the number of parameters, float-point comparisons, and operations of the neural network and its decision tree equivalent.
Conclusion
: The core message is that neural networks can be equivalently represented as decision trees, which holds true for various types of layers and activations. This tree equivalence offers a promising direction to make neural networks more interpretable, shedding light on their black-box nature.
The research presents a compelling argument in favor of leveraging decision trees for interpretability without sacrificing the performance of neural networks. This could be particularly useful in applications where understanding the decision-making process is as important as the decision itself.
Transformers are Graph Neural Networks
Chaitanya Joshi
Feb 12, 2020
   
Engineer friends often ask me: Graph Deep Learning sounds great, but are there any big commercial success stories? Is it being deployed in practical applications?

Besides the obvious ones���recommendation systems at Pinterest, Alibaba and Twitter���a slightly nuanced success story is the Transformer architecture, which has taken the NLP industry by storm.

Through this post, I want to establish links between Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers. I���ll talk about the intuitions behind model architectures in the NLP and GNN communities, make connections using equations and figures, and discuss how we could work together to drive progress.

Let���s start by talking about the purpose of model architectures���representation learning.

Representation Learning for NLP
At a high level, all neural network architectures build representations of input data as vectors/embeddings, which encode useful statistical and semantic information about the data. These latent or hidden representations can then be used for performing something useful, such as classifying an image or translating a sentence. The neural network learns to build better-and-better representations by receiving feedback, usually via error/loss functions.

For Natural Language Processing (NLP), conventionally, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) build representations of each word in a sentence in a sequential manner, i.e., one word at a time. Intuitively, we can imagine an RNN layer as a conveyor belt, with the words being processed on it autoregressively from left to right. At the end, we get a hidden feature for each word in the sentence, which we pass to the next RNN layer or use for our NLP tasks of choice.

I highly recommend Chris Olah���s legendary blog for recaps on RNNs and representation learning for NLP.


Initially introduced for machine translation, Transformers have gradually replaced RNNs in mainstream NLP. The architecture takes a fresh approach to representation learning: Doing away with recurrence entirely, Transformers build features of each word using an attention mechanism to figure out how important all the other words in the sentence are w.r.t. to the aforementioned word. Knowing this, the word���s updated features are simply the sum of linear transformations of the features of all the words, weighted by their importance.

Back in 2017, this idea sounded very radical, because the NLP community was so used to the sequential���one-word-at-a-time���style of processing text with RNNs. The title of the paper probably added fuel to the fire!

For a recap, Yannic Kilcher made an excellent video overview.

Breaking down the Transformer
Let���s develop intuitions about the architecture by translating the previous paragraph into the language of mathematical symbols and vectors. We update the hidden feature 
 of the 
'th word in a sentence 
 from layer 
 to layer 
 as follows:


 


where 
 denotes the set of words in the sentence and 
 are learnable linear weights (denoting the Query, Key and Value for the attention computation, respectively). The attention mechanism is performed parallelly for each word in the sentence to obtain their updated features in one shot���another plus point for Transformers over RNNs, which update features word-by-word.

We can understand the attention mechanism better through the following pipeline:


Taking in the features of the word 
 and the set of other words in the sentence 
, we compute the attention weights 
 for each pair 
 through the dot-product, followed by a softmax across all 
's. Finally, we produce the updated word feature 
 for word 
 by summing over all 
's weighted by their corresponding 
. Each word in the sentence parallelly undergoes the same pipeline to update its features.

Multi-head Attention mechanism
Getting this dot-product attention mechanism to work proves to be tricky���bad random initializations can de-stabilize the learning process. We can overcome this by parallelly performing multiple ���heads��� of attention and concatenating the result (with each head now having separate learnable weights):


where 
 are the learnable weights of the 
'th attention head and 
 is a down-projection to match the dimensions of 
 and 
 across layers.

Multiple heads allow the attention mechanism to essentially ���hedge its bets���, looking at different transformations or aspects of the hidden features from the previous layer. We���ll talk more about this later.

Scale issues and the Feed-forward sub-layer
A key issue motivating the final Transformer architecture is that the features for words after the attention mechanism might be at different scales or magnitudes: (1) This can be due to some words having very sharp or very distributed attention weights 
 when summing over the features of the other words. (2) At the individual feature/vector entries level, concatenating across multiple attention heads���each of which might output values at different scales���can lead to the entries of the final vector 
 having a wide range of values. Following conventional ML wisdom, it seems reasonable to add a normalization layer into the pipeline.

Transformers overcome issue (2) with LayerNorm, which normalizes and learns an affine transformation at the feature level. Additionally, scaling the dot-product attention by the square-root of the feature dimension helps counteract issue (1).

Finally, the authors propose another ���trick��� to control the scale issue: a position-wise 2-layer MLP with a special structure. After the multi-head attention, they project 
 to a (absurdly) higher dimension by a learnable weight, where it undergoes the ReLU non-linearity, and is then projected back to its original dimension followed by another normalization:


To be honest, I���m not sure what the exact intuition behind the over-parameterized feed-forward sub-layer was and nobody seems to be asking questions about it, too! I suppose LayerNorm and scaled dot-products didn���t completely solve the issues highlighted, so the big MLP is a sort of hack to re-scale the feature vectors independently of each other.

Email me if you know more!

The final picture of a Transformer layer looks like this:


The Transformer architecture is also extremely amenable to very deep networks, enabling the NLP community to scale up in terms of both model parameters and, by extension, data. Residual connections between the inputs and outputs of each multi-head attention sub-layer and the feed-forward sub-layer are key for stacking Transformer layers (but omitted from the diagram for clarity).

GNNs build representations of graphs
Let���s take a step away from NLP for a moment.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) build representations of nodes and edges in graph data. They do so through neighbourhood aggregation (or message passing), where each node gathers features from its neighbours to update its representation of the local graph structure around it. Stacking several GNN layers enables the model to propagate each node���s features over the entire graph���from its neighbours to the neighbours��� neighbours, and so on.


Take the example of this emoji social network: The node features produced by the GNN can be used for predictive tasks such as identifying the most influential members or proposing potential connections.

In their most basic form, GNNs update the hidden features 
 of node 
 (for example, ����) at layer 
 via a non-linear transformation of the node���s own features 
 added to the aggregation of features 
 from each neighbouring node 
:

 

where 
 are learnable weight matrices of the GNN layer and 
 is a non-linearity such as ReLU. In the example, 
(����) 
 { ����, ����, ����, ���� }.

The summation over the neighbourhood nodes 
 can be replaced by other input size-invariant aggregation functions such as simple mean/max or something more powerful, such as a weighted sum via an attention mechanism.

Does that sound familiar?

Maybe a pipeline will help make the connection:


If we were to do multiple parallel heads of neighbourhood aggregation and replace summation over the neighbours 
 with the attention mechanism, i.e., a weighted sum, we���d get the Graph Attention Network (GAT). Add normalization and the feed-forward MLP, and voila, we have a Graph Transformer!
ChatGPT
Chaitanya Joshi's article presents a detailed examination of the relationship between Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers, particularly their relevance in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Below are the key points from the article:
Introduction
: The article commences by addressing the commercial viability and practical deployment of Graph Deep Learning. The Transformer architecture, a revolution in NLP, is highlighted as a commercial success story that has its roots in graph theory.
Representation Learning for NLP
: All neural network architectures, at their core, are focused on representation learning. They convert input data into vectors or embeddings that carry meaningful information. For NLP, traditional architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have used sequential processing of words to build these representations.
Transformers
: Unlike RNNs, Transformers dispense with recurrence and instead use an attention mechanism. Each word's feature is updated based on the significance of all other words in the sentence. This was a novel approach in 2017 and marked a departure from the conventional sequential processing methods.
Breaking Down the Transformer
: The author mathematically breaks down the Transformer's working, emphasizing its parallel processing capabilities. The attention mechanism is also discussed in detail.
Multi-head Attention Mechanism
: To address challenges with the dot-product attention mechanism, Transformers employ multiple parallel 'heads' of attention, enhancing the model's robustness and capability to capture diverse patterns in data.
Scale Issues and the Feed-forward Sub-layer
: The article elaborates on some issues faced with the Transformer architecture, such as differences in scale of word features. Solutions like LayerNorm, scaled dot-products, and an over-parameterized feed-forward sub-layer are discussed.
GNNs & Graph Representation
: Moving away from NLP, the author introduces Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) which build representations of nodes and edges in graph data. GNNs aggregate information from neighbouring nodes to refine the node's feature representation.
Transformers and GNNs
: There's a deep connection between Transformers and GNNs. The author presents how simple modifications to GNNs, like multiple parallel heads of neighbourhood aggregation and the attention mechanism, can convert it into a Graph Attention Network (GAT). With further enhancements, it becomes a Graph Transformer.
In essence, the article underscores the interconnected nature of GNNs and Transformers. This understanding might pave the way for innovations that merge the strengths of both architectures, potentially leading to advancements in fields beyond NLP.
Sentences are fully-connected word graphs
To make the connection more explicit, consider a sentence as a fully-connected graph, where each word is connected to every other word. Now, we can use a GNN to build features for each node (word) in the graph (sentence), which we can then perform NLP tasks with.


Broadly, this is what Transformers are doing: they are GNNs with multi-head attention as the neighbourhood aggregation function. Whereas standard GNNs aggregate features from their local neighbourhood nodes 
, Transformers for NLP treat the entire sentence 
 as the local neighbourhood, aggregating features from each word 
 at each layer.

Importantly, various problem-specific tricks���such as position encodings, causal/masked aggregation, learning rate schedules and extensive pre-training���are essential for the success of Transformers but seldom seem in the GNN community. At the same time, looking at Transformers from a GNN perspective could inspire us to get rid of a lot of the bells and whistles in the architecture.
ChatGPT
This segment further dives into the relationship between Transformers and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), drawing a clear parallel between the two:
Sentences as Fully-connected Graphs
: In this analogy, each word in a sentence is a node in a fully-connected graph. This means every word (node) connects with every other word, creating a dense mesh of inter-relationships.
Transformers as GNNs
: When we view sentences as such fully-connected graphs, Transformers essentially function as Graph Neural Networks. The primary difference is in how they aggregate information. While traditional GNNs take in features from their immediate neighbors, Transformers, in the context of NLP, treat the entire sentence as a neighborhood. Hence, every word updates its feature based on information from all other words in the sentence.
Specific Features of Transformers
: Transformers have been fine-tuned for NLP tasks with several additional components and strategies. For example:
Position Encodings
: As Transformers lack inherent sequence recognition like RNNs, they use position encodings to understand word order in a sentence.
Causal/Masked Aggregation
: This ensures that a word doesn't take future information into account, especially during training tasks like language modeling.
Learning Rate Schedules & Pre-training
: These training techniques are crucial for the performance of Transformers in practical applications.
Learning from GNNs
: Understanding Transformers through the lens of GNNs can be enlightening. It might prompt the simplification of the Transformer architecture by eliminating unnecessary complexities. On the flip side, the GNN community might gain insights from the tricks and strategies employed in Transformer models.
In summary, viewing Transformers as special cases of GNNs where sentences are fully-connected graphs offers a fresh perspective. This understanding can be a bridge between the two fields, potentially fostering cross-pollination of ideas and methodologies.
What can we learn from each other?
Now that we���ve established a connection between Transformers and GNNs, let me throw some ideas around���

Are fully-connected graphs the best input format for NLP?
Before statistical NLP and ML, linguists like Noam Chomsky focused on developing fomal theories of linguistic structure, such as syntax trees/graphs. Tree LSTMs already tried this, but maybe Transformers/GNNs are better architectures for bringing the world of linguistic theory and statistical NLP closer?


How to learn long-term dependencies?
Another issue with fully-connected graphs is that they make learning very long-term dependencies between words difficult. This is simply due to how the number of edges in the graph scales quadratically with the number of nodes, i.e., in an 
 word sentence, a Transformer/GNN would be doing computations over 
 pairs of words. Things get out of hand for very large 
.

The NLP community���s perspective on the long sequences and dependencies problem is interesting: Making the attention mechanism sparse or adaptive in terms of input size, adding recurrence or compression into each layer, and using Locality Sensitive Hashing for efficient attention are all promising new ideas for better Transformers.

It would be interesting to see ideas from the GNN community thrown into the mix, e.g., Binary Partitioning for sentence graph sparsification seems like another exciting approach.
ChatGPT
The section poses some intriguing questions and considerations regarding the fusion of insights from both Transformers and GNNs. Here's a breakdown:
Optimal Input Format for NLP
:
Historical Perspective
: Before machine learning took over NLP, linguistic approaches like those advocated by Noam Chomsky focused on formal structures such as syntax trees. These representations encapsulate the inherent hierarchical structure of language.
Opportunity
: Tree LSTMs made a foray into combining linguistic trees with machine learning. With the established connection between GNNs and Transformers, there's potential to explore how these architectures might be better suited to leverage such hierarchical structures.
Learning Long-Term Dependencies
:
Challenge with Fully-Connected Graphs
: In an

pairs of words. This becomes computationally burdensome with larger sequences.
Solutions from the NLP Community
:
Sparse or Adaptive Attention
: Making attention mechanisms sparse or adaptive helps in reducing computational overhead.
Adding Recurrence or Compression
: By introducing some form of recurrence or compressing layers, one can potentially capture long-term dependencies more efficiently.
Locality Sensitive Hashing
: This is a technique used for efficient attention computation by approximating the attention weights.
Potential Solutions from the GNN Community
:
Binary Partitioning
: Techniques like Binary Partitioning could be used to sparsify the sentence graph, effectively reducing the computational load.
In essence, the dialogue encourages mutual learning. While the NLP community has been developing various strategies to tackle the challenges posed by long sequences and dependencies, GNN techniques might offer alternative or complementary solutions. By understanding and borrowing from each other's strengths and innovations, both communities could drive forward more efficient and effective models.
Are Transformers learning ���neural syntax���?
There have been several interesting papers from the NLP community on what Transformers might be learning. The basic premise is that performing attention on all word pairs in a sentence���with the purpose of identifying which pairs are the most interesting���enables Transformers to learn something like a task-specific syntax. Different heads in the multi-head attention might also be ���looking��� at different syntactic properties.

In graph terms, by using GNNs on full graphs, can we recover the most important edges���and what they might entail���from how the GNN performs neighbourhood aggregation at each layer? I���m not so convinced by this view yet.


Why multiple heads of attention? Why attention?
I���m more sympathetic to the optimization view of the multi-head mechanism���having multiple attention heads improves learning and overcomes bad random initializations. For instance, these papers showed that Transformer heads can be ���pruned��� or removed after training without significant performance impact.

Multi-head neighbourhood aggregation mechanisms have also proven effective in GNNs, e.g., GAT uses the same multi-head attention and MoNet uses multiple Gaussian kernels for aggregating features. Although invented to stabilize attention mechanisms, could the multi-head trick become standard for squeezing out extra model performance?

Conversely, GNNs with simpler aggregation functions such as sum or max do not require multiple aggregation heads for stable training. Wouldn���t it be nice for Transformers if we didn���t have to compute pair-wise compatibilities between each word pair in the sentence?

Could Transformers benefit from ditching attention, altogether? Yann Dauphin and collaborators��� recent work suggests an alternative ConvNet architecture. Transformers, too, might ultimately be doing something similar to ConvNets!
ChatGPT
The passage delves into deeper aspects of what Transformers may be learning, specifically probing into the role of attention mechanisms and their broader implications. Let's dissect the points:
Neural Syntax
:
Premise
: Transformers, by attending to word pairs, might be learning task-specific syntax. The varying attention across different heads could be indicative of learning different syntactic properties of the language.
Graph Interpretation
: Drawing a parallel to graphs, when GNNs operate on full graphs, they might be able to identify significant edges based on the pattern of neighborhood aggregation. However, the author seems skeptical about this interpretation.
Role of Multiple Heads
:
Optimization Perspective
: Multiple attention heads might be more about optimization. They help in training stability and can overcome the pitfalls of unfavorable initializations.
Evidence of Redundancy
: Some research has shown that after training a Transformer, certain heads can be pruned without a significant drop in performance. This might suggest that not all heads learn equally important information.
GNNs and Multi-heads
: In the realm of GNNs, architectures like GAT (Graph Attention Network) employ multi-head attention mechanisms, drawing parallels to the multi-head mechanism in Transformers.
Question
: With simpler aggregation functions being stable without the need for multi-head mechanisms in GNNs, is the complexity of multi-head attention in Transformers necessary? Or could there be simpler alternatives that provide the same utility?
Is Attention Indispensable?
:
Alternatives to Attention
: While attention mechanisms have been pivotal in recent NLP breakthroughs, the idea of exploring architectures that don't rely heavily on attention is intriguing.
ConvNet Architecture
: There's a hypothesis that Transformers might be achieving something similar to convolutional networks (ConvNets). Yann Dauphin and his team suggested an alternative using ConvNets, which might imply that the essence of what Transformers do can be replicated or approached by other architectures.
The overarching theme here is a call for reflection and exploration. It challenges the NLP community to examine deeply entrenched beliefs about the necessity and function of attention mechanisms in Transformer architectures. As with many innovations, it's possible that as our understanding deepens, more streamlined or alternative solutions could emerge.
Why is training Transformers so hard?
Reading new Transformer papers makes me feel that training these models requires something akin to black magic when determining the best learning rate schedule, warmup strategy and decay settings. This could simply be because the models are so huge and the NLP tasks studied are so challenging.

But recent results suggest that it could also be due to the specific permutation of normalization and residual connections within the architecture.


At this point I���m ranting, but this makes me sceptical: Do we really need multiple heads of expensive pair-wise attention, overparameterized MLP sub-layers, and complicated learning schedules?

Do we really need massive models with massive carbon footprints?

Shouldn���t architectures with good inductive biases for the task at hand be easier to train?

Similarly, DeepMind���s star-studded position paper introduces the Graph Networks framework, unifying all these ideas. For a code walkthrough, the DGL team has a nice tutorial on seq2seq as a graph problem and building Transformers as GNNs.

Multi-Graph Transformer for Free-Hand Sketch Recognition
Peng Xu, Chaitanya Joshi, Xavier Bresson
December 2019
    

Abstract
Learning meaningful representations of free-hand sketches remains a challenging task given the signal sparsity and the high-level abstraction of sketches. Existing techniques have focused on exploiting either the static nature of sketches with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or the temporal sequential property with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In this work, we propose a new representation of sketches as multiple sparsely connected graphs. We design a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN), the Multi-Graph Transformer (MGT), for learning representations of sketches from multiple graphs which simultaneously capture global and local geometric stroke structures, as well as temporal information. We report extensive numerical experiments on a sketch recognition task to demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach. Particularly, MGT applied on 414k sketches from Google QuickDraw: (i) achieves small recognition gap to the CNN-based performance upper bound (72.80% vs. 74.22%), and (ii) outperforms all RNN-based models by a significant margin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work proposing to represent sketches as graphs and apply GNNs for sketch recognition

Learning TSP Requires Rethinking Generalization
Chaitanya Joshi, Quentin Cappart, Louis-Martin Rousseau, Thomas Laurent, Xavier Bresson
June 2020
   

Abstract
End-to-end training of neural network solvers for combinatorial problems such as the Travelling Salesman Problem is intractable and inefficient beyond a few hundreds of nodes. While state-of-the-art Machine Learning approaches perform closely to classical solvers for trivially small sizes, they are unable to generalize the learnt policy to larger instances of practical scales. Towards leveraging transfer learning to solve large-scale TSPs, this paper identifies inductive biases, model architectures and learning algorithms that promote generalization to instances larger than those seen in training. Our controlled experiments provide the first principled investigation into such zero-shot generalization, revealing that extrapolating beyond training data requires rethinking the entire neural combinatorial optimization pipeline, from network layers and learning paradigms to evaluation protocols.
ChatGPT
The abstract discusses a study aimed at understanding the challenges and potential solutions in training neural networks to solve combinatorial problems, specifically the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Here's a breakdown:
Problem Statement
:
Using neural networks to solve combinatorial problems, like the Travelling Salesman Problem, is challenging. While these methods might work well for smaller instances of the problem, they struggle to generalize their solutions to larger instances.
Existing Solutions & Their Limitations
:
Neural Network Solvers
: While they perform almost as well as traditional methods for small-scale problems, they can't adapt (or generalize) their solutions to larger-scale TSP instances.
Scale
: The difficulty arises when trying to solve problems with hundreds of nodes using end-to-end training. It becomes inefficient and impractical.
Proposed Direction
:
The paper focuses on using transfer learning for solving large-scale TSP problems. Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is re-used on a second, related task.
Key Contributions
:
Identifying Factors for Generalization
: The authors explore inductive biases, model architectures, and learning algorithms that might help models generalize to larger TSP instances than those they were trained on.
Zero-Shot Generalization
: This is the ability of a model to handle tasks it has not seen before. The paper offers a detailed investigation into this aspect of neural combinatorial optimization.
Rethinking the Approach
: The findings suggest that to generalize beyond the training data, the entire approach to neural combinatorial optimization needs revision - this includes the architecture of the networks, the way learning happens, and even the protocols for evaluation.
Significance
:
This paper pushes for a comprehensive review of how neural networks are used to solve combinatorial problems. It suggests that if the community wants these models to tackle real-world, large-scale TSPs, there's a need to reconsider many aspects of the current approaches.
In summary, this research presents an in-depth analysis of why current neural network approaches are limited in solving large-scale TSP instances and suggests directions that might help overcome these limitations.
Connections between the previous topics.
ChatGPT
Certainly, the previous topics discussed the intersection of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers in NLP, and two specific applications (free-hand sketch recognition and the Travelling Salesman Problem). Here are the connections between these topics:
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) & Transformers
:
Both GNNs and Transformers operate on graph-like structures. GNNs explicitly operate on graphs, while Transformers, especially in NLP, treat sentences as fully-connected graphs where each word is linked to every other word.
The Transformer architecture can be viewed as a special kind of GNN with multi-head attention serving as the neighborhood aggregation function.
The idea that Transformers can be seen as GNNs can inspire new architectures that may eliminate certain complexities from the Transformer model, making them potentially more efficient or interpretable.
Free-Hand Sketch Recognition
:
The Multi-Graph Transformer (MGT) proposed for sketch recognition is essentially a GNN tailored for sketch data. It leverages the power of graph-based models to capture the relationships between different strokes in a sketch.
By representing sketches as graphs, this research aligns with the broader trend of applying graph-based techniques to diverse data forms and problems.
The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
:
The research on TSP focuses on neural combinatorial optimization. While not explicitly stated, the challenges faced by neural approaches in solving the TSP and the necessity to rethink generalization could benefit from the insights gained from the GNN-Transformer connection.
The idea of rethinking neural combinatorial optimization, including network layers and learning paradigms, is aligned with the broader discussion on the potential and limitations of Transformers in NLP.
Overall Connections
:
Representation
: Both the sketch recognition and TSP papers indicate the importance of the right data representation (sketches as graphs, TSP as a combinatorial problem) to improve model performance.
Generalization & Transfer Learning
: The TSP paper emphasizes the need for models that can generalize beyond their training data. The discussions about Transformers in NLP also touch upon the idea of models generalizing across different tasks or problems, suggesting a universal challenge in machine learning.
Inductive Biases & Architecture
: Both the GNN-Transformer discussions and the TSP paper stress the importance of inductive biases, architecture choices, and the potential to rethink and refine existing paradigms for better performance and efficiency.
In essence, these topics converge on the idea that by viewing problems through the lens of graph-based approaches and Transformer-like architectures, we can potentially unlock more effective and generalizable solutions across diverse applications.
One of the earlier articles stated: It is possible that these improvements 
are due to (i) an inductive bias in tree-based models beter suited to modeling differences in subpopulations 
in tabular data, or (ii) the ensembling used by the tree-based models in this work. We leave an identification of such causal factors to future work.
ChatGPT
The statement you've provided points out two potential reasons for the improvements observed in tree-based models:
Inductive Bias in Tree-based Models
: Inductive bias refers to the set of assumptions a learning algorithm uses to make predictions on unseen data. In the context of tree-based models, the structure of decision trees (or ensembles of trees) naturally allows them to split data into different branches based on feature values. This hierarchical splitting can capture intricate patterns in the data, making them particularly effective for certain types of problems. When the statement mentions "modeling differences in subpopulations in tabular data," it implies that tree-based models may have a natural advantage in understanding and representing distinct groups or categories within the dataset.
Ensembling
: Ensembling is a technique where multiple models (often of the same type) are trained and their predictions are combined, usually to improve performance and reduce the likelihood of overfitting. Examples of ensembles in tree-based models include Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees. Ensembling can often lead to better performance as the aggregation of predictions from multiple models can cancel out individual errors.
The article suggests that one (or both) of these factors might be responsible for the observed improvements in tree-based models for the given task. However, pinpointing the exact reason requires more in-depth analysis and experimentation, which the authors defer to future work.

Electrostimulated Sleep Periglympholosus (ESP): A Theoretical Method for Reducing Sleep Need
Introduction:
The human brain, while being the epicenter of thought, emotion, and behavior, also requires regular periods of rest, commonly known as sleep. Traditional understandings of sleep have largely been associated with cognitive and memory functions, but emerging studies show the importance of the brain���s cleaning mechanism, known as the glymphatic system. The glymphatic system, a perivascular network, aids in the removal of waste products from the neuronal environment. The effectiveness of this system is particularly heightened during sleep. The concept of Electrostimulated Sleep Periglympholosus (ESP) posits a novel method to enhance the efficiency of sleep, thus reducing the time we need to spend in slumber.
Method:
1. Electrostimulation to Induce Sleep-like Brain Oscillations:
Electrostimulation, using a carefully calibrated frequency and amplitude, can be employed to encourage the brain to adopt sleep-like oscillations. This is akin to how deep brain stimulation is used in various neurological treatments. The aim here is to mimic the natural rhythmic patterns associated with deep sleep, especially the slow-wave activity seen in the delta phase of the sleep cycle.
2. Identification of Glymphatic Pathways:
Mapping the glymphatic pathways is crucial for ESP to be effective. Advanced imaging techniques such as MRI or PET scans can be employed for this. Once the pathways are identified, they can be targeted more accurately for enhanced waste removal.
3. Shunting:
With the pathways identified, small, minimally-invasive shunts can be placed to facilitate a more efficient flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This could, theoretically, speed up the removal of waste products.
4. Time-release and Event-release Capsules:
One of the challenges in ESP is ensuring that the glymphatic system operates optimally during the shortened sleep periods. To this end, time-release and event-release capsules can be designed.
Time-release capsules:
These capsules will slowly release agents that boost the efficiency of the glymphatic system over a set period, ensuring a consistent aiding of the cleaning mechanism throughout the electrostimulated sleep duration.
Event-release capsules:
Triggered by specific events or detected waste levels, these capsules will release their agents only when necessary. For instance, if a certain waste product crosses a threshold level, the capsule releases its agent to assist in waste removal.
Potential Benefits:
Reduced Sleep Duration:
With an enhanced glymphatic system, it's possible that individuals might require less sleep to achieve the same restorative benefits.
Improved Cognitive Function:
Faster removal of neuronal waste could lead to enhanced cognitive functions and reduced risks associated with neurodegenerative disorders.
Flexible Sleep Schedules:
With the ability to induce sleep-like brain states, individuals could have more flexible sleeping schedules, adapting to varying daily demands.
Conclusion:
While the Electrostimulated Sleep Periglympholosus (ESP) is still a theoretical concept, its potential ramifications for sleep science are profound. By harnessing the power of electrostimulation and advanced biochemical strategies, we may be on the cusp of redefining how we understand and experience sleep. However, extensive research, ethical considerations, and clinical trials will be necessary before this method can be deemed safe and effective.
Sorry it was supposed to be Periglympholosis

No problem! Let's revise the concept with the term "Periglympholosis" in mind:
Electrostimulated Sleep Periglympholosis (ESP): A Theoretical Method for Reducing Sleep Need
Introduction:
In the intricate tapestry of brain function, sleep remains one of its most enigmatic yet essential elements. The glymphatic system, a perivascular network, plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the brain remains free of waste products, and its efficacy is heightened during sleep. Electrostimulated Sleep Periglympholosis (ESP) presents a groundbreaking theoretical approach to optimize this cleaning mechanism, with the potential of trimming down our sleep hours without compromising its restorative benefits.
Method:
1. Electrostimulation to Induce Sleep-like Brain Oscillations:
Just as deep brain stimulation can modify neurological patterns, the ESP model utilizes electrostimulation to coax the brain into sleep-like oscillations. By replicating the rhythmic patterns of deep sleep, particularly the delta phase's slow-wave activity, the objective is to artificially usher the brain into a restorative state.
2. Identification of Glymphatic Pathways:
To target the glymphatic system effectively, a comprehensive understanding of its pathways is paramount. Modern imaging techniques such as MRI or PET scans can map these pathways. Once demarcated, they become focal points for waste removal enhancement.
3. Periglympholosis Shunting:
Leveraging the mapped pathways, micro-shunts can be installed to facilitate a more streamlined flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This might expedite the expulsion of waste products, further optimizing the glymphatic system's cleansing operation.
4. Time-release and Event-release Capsules:
An integral component of the ESP methodology is to ensure the glymphatic system's sustained operation during these modified sleep periods, using time-release and event-release capsules:
Time-release capsules:
These can release agents, across a preset duration, that augment the glymphatic system's efficiency, guaranteeing that the brain's cleaning mechanism remains supported during the electrostimulated sleep.
Event-release capsules:
These capsules operate on triggers, such as specific waste threshold breaches, discharging their agents only when deemed necessary.
Potential Benefits:
Reduced Sleep Duration:
Enhanced glymphatic system efficiency might decrease the amount of sleep required to reap its restorative advantages.
Sharper Cognitive Function:
An accelerated waste removal rate might enhance cognitive functions and mitigate risks linked with neurodegenerative conditions.
Adaptable Sleep Routines:
Inducing sleep-like brain states could offer more adjustable sleep routines, aligning better with varied daily demands.
Conclusion:
Electrostimulated Sleep Periglympholosis (ESP), although theoretical at this stage, holds profound potential in revolutionizing sleep science. Combining electrostimulation with state-of-the-art biochemical modalities might redefine our perceptions and experiences of sleep. Nonetheless, the journey from theory to application will demand rigorous research, ethical discussions, and extensive clinical trials.
