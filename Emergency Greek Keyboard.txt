Creating a visual chart for your "Emergency Greek Keyboard" requires a clear and concise layout that displays each English character or combination of characters alongside their corresponding Greek character. The chart will feature two columns: on the left, the English input (such as :C*:A*, :C*:B*, etc.), and on the right, the Greek character it translates to (��, ��, ��, etc.). This will be an easy-to-follow reference for using your custom keyboard layout for Greek characters. Let's create this chart.
Here is the chart for your "Emergency Greek Keyboard." It displays each English character input alongside its corresponding Greek character, arranged in a clear and organized two-column format. This should serve as a handy reference for your custom keyboard layout.

You
Are there any conflicts?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Upon reviewing the chart, there are indeed a few conflicts in the input mappings:
E
mapped to both �� and ��:
* The input "E*" is assigned to both the Greek characters Epsilon (��) and Eta (��). You'll need to differentiate these inputs to avoid ambiguity.
P
mapped to both �� and ��:
* The input "P*" is used for both Pi (��) and Psi (��). These should have unique inputs.
Th
and U
Repeat Mappings:** Both "Th*" and "U*" have two mappings each. "Th*" is assigned to Theta (��) and a variant of Theta (��), while "U*" is assigned to Upsilon (��) and a variant of Upsilon (��).
To resolve these conflicts, you should consider using different input sequences for each Greek character. For example, you could use "E1*", "E2*", "P1*", "P2*", etc., to distinguish between the characters that currently share the same input.
You
Good catch. E maps to �� and e maps to �� (the C* prefix in AHK makes it case-sensitive) I updated it to: Ps*::�� and  up*::��

Great! With those updates, your keyboard layout should now be free of conflicts. Here's the revised chart reflecting these changes:

I was kind of thinking it would be uper than lower case, and maybe divide the alphabet into three or four lines each time to make it readable on the screen
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Understood. I'll arrange the Greek characters and their corresponding inputs in a more screen-friendly format, with uppercase and lowercase characters separated and divided into several lines for better readability. Here's the revised layout:

Hmm I was thinking each line was too long, Is there anyway to put this in a chart where we can see them, not in a code block?
