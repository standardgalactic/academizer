2.4Are Neuron-like Functions in Single-Cell Organisms 
an Indication of Emotion or Mind? 
In the late nineteenth century, Herbert Spencer Jennings began analyzing the 
behavior of protozoa. He sought to understand emotion and/or mind in animals, as 
revealed in his paper entitled ���The psychology of a protozoan��� (Jennings 1899). 
40S. Maegawa 
Of course, emotion and mind cannot be measured and examined directly with 
biological methods in animals because we cannot communicate and interview the 
animals. Nevertheless, emotion and mind in bacteria and ciliates can be considered 
philosophically. 
As described previously,bacteria and ciliates can respond to external signals and 
make ���decisions��� to approach or escape the signals. If the function of emotion and 
mindistorespondtoexternalsignalsandtodeterminebehavior,bacteriaandciliates 
seem to have well-established emotion and mind. Based on these criteria for the 
function of emotion and mind, bacteria, ciliates, yeast, invertebrates, vertebrates, 
and plants should possess emotion and mind. 
If bacteria and ciliates merely show a ref l ex to external stimuli, then it is diff i cult 
to explain human behaviors. Human behaviors can be considered as complex 
ref l exesifemotionandmindarenotconsidered.Ofcourse,anestimationofemotion 
and mind in humans can be attained through questioning, and we can measure 
emotionandmindbyinterviewingexaminees.However,themechanismsofemotion 
and mind in the brain are too diff i cult to understand only within one scientif i c 
i eld. We can only fully reveal the mechanisms of emotion and mind in the brain 
by aligning expertise and knowledge from the i elds of biology, neurophysiology, 
psychology, computer science, and informatics. Thus, in the future, emotion and 
mind may be understood in humans and other living organisms, including bacteria 
and ciliates.

The passage you provided discusses an intriguing philosophical question regarding the possibility of emotion and mind in single-celled organisms like bacteria and ciliates. The author builds upon ideas dating back to Herbert Spencer Jennings in the late 19th century, who studied protozoa and speculated about the presence of psychological aspects in these organisms. Let's break down some of the key points from the text:
Behavior of Single-Celled Organisms:
Single-celled organisms like bacteria and ciliates have been observed to respond to external signals and make decisions, such as approaching or avoiding certain stimuli. This suggests that these organisms exhibit a form of behavior that could be seen as purposeful or intentional.
Emotion and Mind as Functional Concepts:
The passage suggests that if we define "emotion" and "mind" in functional terms���i.e., the ability to respond to external signals and determine behavior���then bacteria and ciliates could be seen as possessing basic forms of these faculties. From this perspective, emotion and mind aren't exclusive to more complex animals with nervous systems, but are distributed across all living organisms, perhaps as a spectrum of behavioral responses.
Philosophical Reflection:
Since it's impossible to directly measure or communicate with these simple organisms as we might with humans, the presence of emotion and mind in bacteria and ciliates must be considered more philosophically. This poses questions about the nature of mind and emotion itself���whether they are properties of complex nervous systems or whether they can exist in simpler forms of life as well.
Implications for Human Behavior:
If bacteria and ciliates only display reflexive behavior without any emotional or cognitive components, then human behaviors might similarly be reduced to complex reflexes if we exclude emotion and mind from the analysis. This raises deeper questions about what separates human cognition and emotion from that of simpler organisms.
Multidisciplinary Approach to Emotion and Mind:
The passage highlights the difficulty of fully understanding the mechanisms of emotion and mind even in humans. It suggests that insights from various fields such as biology, neurophysiology, psychology, computer science, and informatics are necessary to understand these complex phenomena. In the future, this multidisciplinary approach could extend our understanding of emotion and mind not only in humans but also in other organisms, possibly even bacteria and ciliates.
Conclusion:
While single-celled organisms like bacteria and ciliates demonstrate behaviors that could be functionally similar to decision-making or reflexes, interpreting these as indications of "emotion" or "mind" is still a philosophical stance. The debate lies in whether we view these organisms as having rudimentary cognitive functions or simply as biological machines reacting to their environment. In either case, this discussion opens the door to reconsidering the broader nature of cognition, emotion, and what it means to have a mind.

3.2.4Protoneurons: An Ancestral Neurosecretory Cells? 
Many primary ciliated larvae of marine invertebrates possess the apical sensory 
neurosecretorycells expressing RFamide and Wamide neuropeptides(Lacalli 1983; 
Dickinson and Croll 2003; Nielsen 2005; Tessmar-Raible et al. 2007; Byrne et 
al. 2007; Conzelmann et al. 2011, 2013; Conzelmann and J��kely 2012). Sensory 
neurosecretory cells have repeatedly been considered in different evolutionary 
contexts as ancestral neuronal cells or ���protoneurons��� (V��gh and V��gh-Teichmann 
1982; Tessmar-Raible et al. 2007; Sakarya et al. 2007; Richards et al. 2008; 
J��kely et al. 2015). Since vertebrate and invertebrate deuterostomes possess an 
assembly of ciliated sensory neurosecretory cells contacting the cerebrospinal 
l uid in the lumen of the CNS (vertebrates) or ambient seawater (invertebrates), 
ciliated sensory neurosecretory cells have been regarded as a phylogenetically 
old neurosecretory cell type, the ���protoneuron��� (V��gh and V��gh-Teichmann 1982; 
Vigh et al. 2004). Detailed molecular and cellular dissections of the developing 
apical neurosecretory cell cluster of annelid larvae have suggested that the sensory 
neurosecretory cells already existed in the common bilaterian ancestor (Tessmar- 
Raible et al. 2007; Conzelmann et al. 2013; Tosches and Arendt 2013; Marlow et 
al. 2014; Nielsen 2015). RFamidergic sensory neurosecretory cells have also been 
identif i ed in cnidarian planula larvae (Plickert 1989; Leitz and Lay 1995; Gajewski 
et al. 1996). Although peptidergic neurophysiological features of the ctenophoran 
54H. Watanabe 
nervous system remain highly understudied,a rich neural gene repertoire, including 
peptide-gated ion channels (PGICs) in poriferan, placozoan, and ctenophoran 
genomes indicate that the conceptual protoneuron might be traced back to the 
sensory neurosecretory cell types that may have existed in the common metazoan 
ancestor (Fig. 3.3) (Smith et al. 2014; J��kely et al. 2015). This idea is supported 
by the fact that the RFamide neuropeptides are expressed exclusively in cnidarian 
nervous systems and placozoan neurosecretory gland cells. Since conventional 
chemical neurotransmitters don���t seem to be neuron-specif i c in cnidarians, it would 
be useful to identify neuropeptides in neurons and sensory cells in sponges and 
ctenophores.

This passage discusses the evolutionary significance of sensory neurosecretory cells, often referred to as "protoneurons," and their potential ancestral role in the development of modern neurons. Here's a breakdown of the key ideas:
1.
Protoneurons and Ancestral Neurosecretory Cells:
The passage highlights the existence of
sensory neurosecretory cells
in various marine invertebrates, especially in their larvae. These cells express neuropeptides such as
RFamide and Wamide
, which are important signaling molecules.
These sensory neurosecretory cells are sometimes called
protoneurons
because they are believed to represent an ancient form of neuronal cells, potentially serving as a precursor to more complex nervous systems seen in later-evolving organisms like vertebrates.
2.
Phylogenetic Significance:
Both vertebrates and invertebrates (especially deuterostomes) have ciliated sensory neurosecretory cells that either contact the
cerebrospinal fluid
(in vertebrates) or
ambient seawater
(in invertebrates). This shared feature suggests that these cells are
phylogenetically old
, meaning they existed early in the evolution of bilaterians and may have been present in a common ancestor of many different animal groups.
Studies of
annelid larvae
(marine worms) show that apical neurosecretory cell clusters, which are sensory in nature, likely existed in the
common bilaterian ancestor
(an ancestor common to both vertebrates and many invertebrates).
3.
Cnidarians and RFamide Neuropeptides:
Sensory neurosecretory cells that produce
RFamide neuropeptides
have been identified not only in bilaterians but also in
cnidarians
(a group that includes jellyfish and corals). This further supports the idea that these types of cells are ancient and may have been a basic feature of early nervous systems.
Interestingly,
chemical neurotransmitters
that are commonly found in more complex organisms (like acetylcholine, dopamine, etc.) are not neuron-specific in cnidarians, meaning neuropeptides may have been more central to early nervous system function.
4.
Molecular Evidence from Other Early Animal Lineages:
Genomic studies of other early-evolving animal groups like
sponges (poriferans), placozoans, and ctenophores
(comb jellies) show the presence of
peptide-gated ion channels (PGICs)
and other neural genes. This suggests that although these animals may not have fully developed nervous systems like those in bilaterians, they may still possess primitive neural signaling components that could be linked to early forms of protoneurons.
5.
Implications for Understanding the Evolution of the Nervous System:
The identification of neuropeptides, like RFamide, in a wide range of early-evolving animals hints that
neurosecretory cell types
, which are peptidergic in nature, might represent the first step toward the evolution of neurons.
This suggests that
neuropeptide signaling
predates more conventional neurotransmitter systems, and neuropeptides played a significant role in early metazoan (multicellular animal) nervous systems. Understanding this could help reconstruct the
ancestral nervous system
in the
common metazoan ancestor
.
Conclusion:
This passage presents the idea that
sensory neurosecretory cells
in early animals may have functioned as primitive neurons (or protoneurons) and that these cells were important in the evolution of nervous systems. The presence of neuropeptides like RFamide across a wide range of species, and the molecular evidence from ancient animal lineages, supports the hypothesis that the basic components of neurosecretory and neural systems evolved early in animal history, possibly from a common
metazoan ancestor

Functional Specif i cation of a Primitive 
Bilaterian Brain in Planarians 
Takeshi Inoue 
Abstract The mammalian brain is remarkably complex in function as well as 
morphology, and therefore understanding the original evolutionary function and 
primitive principles of brain function is an important and classical challenge. The 
planarian is an emerging new model of the nervous system as well as regenerative 
biology because it belongs to an evolutionarily early group possessing a central 
nervous system (CNS), including a brain with simple architecture. Recently, it 
has been revealed that the planarian brain is divided into several functional and 
structural domains as def i ned by the discrete expression of homeobox genes and 
a surprisingly complex set of genes, and is composed of several types of neurons 
distinguishedbytheirneurotransmittersandneuralmodulators,whichareconserved 
with those used by vertebrates. Furthermore, the planarian brain functions as an 
information-processing center to produce distinct behavioral traits in response to a 
variety of signals arising from the external environment. This chapter summarizes 
recent insights into cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate planarian brain 
formation and function. The relative simplicity of the planarian brain, combined 
withits molecularaccessibility,planariancomplexbehavioraltraits,andadvancesin 
planarian stem cell biology associated with the planarian extraordinaryregenerative 
capacity, provide a unique opportunity to unravel molecular and cellular mecha- 
nisms underlying fundamental brain function and brain evolution.

This chapter focuses on the
functional specification of a primitive bilaterian brain
in
planarians
, a group of flatworms belonging to the phylum Platyhelminthes. Planarians have become a significant model organism for studying both the nervous system and regenerative biology, due to their simple central nervous system (CNS) structure and remarkable ability to regenerate. Below is a breakdown of the key concepts from this abstract:
1.
Planarian as a Model Organism:
Planarians are a new and
emerging model
for studying the nervous system because they represent an evolutionarily early group of animals with a central nervous system (CNS), including a
brain
.
The
planarian brain
is relatively simple in structure compared to the mammalian brain but is surprisingly complex in terms of its genetic and molecular makeup. This makes planarians ideal for understanding the
primitive principles of brain function
.
2.
Structural and Functional Domains of the Planarian Brain:
Research has revealed that the planarian brain is divided into
functional and structural domains
, which are defined by the expression of
homeobox genes
���a group of genes crucial for regulating the development of the nervous system.
The planarian brain contains several types of neurons, distinguished by the
neurotransmitters
and
neural modulators
they use. Interestingly, many of these are
conserved
with vertebrates, suggesting that the molecular components of brain function are ancient and shared across diverse species.
3.
Planarian Brain as an Information-Processing Center:
Despite its simplicity, the planarian brain acts as an
information-processing center
, allowing the organism to produce distinct
behavioral traits
. It responds to various external signals from the environment, demonstrating that even primitive brains can integrate sensory information and drive complex behaviors.
4.
Regenerative Biology and Stem Cells in Planarians:
Planarians are known for their
extraordinary regenerative abilities
, particularly in their nervous system.
Neoblasts
, which are planarian stem cells, play a key role in this process. These stem cells enable the planarian to regenerate not only its body but also its brain.
The study of
planarian stem cell biology
���specifically how neoblasts contribute to brain regeneration���offers unique insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin brain function and development.
5.
Implications for Understanding Brain Evolution:
The
relative simplicity
of the planarian brain, combined with modern genetic tools like
RNA interference (RNAi)
, makes it possible to dissect the molecular and cellular processes underlying brain function.
These advances allow researchers to explore how the
primitive bilaterian brain
may have evolved into more complex structures, providing valuable insights into the
evolutionary origins
of brain function.
Conclusion:
The planarian brain, though simple in architecture, has a
complex genetic and functional structure
. This simplicity, along with the accessibility of planarians for molecular and genetic studies, makes them a powerful model for unraveling the
fundamental mechanisms
of brain function and evolution. Understanding how planarians regenerate their brain, and how their neurons function, can provide critical clues about the origins of nervous systems in early bilaterians and help illuminate the evolutionary pathways that led to the development of more complex brains in vertebrates.

4.1What Is a Planarian? 
Freshwater planarians are free-living members (class Turbellaria) of the phylum 
Platyhelminthes, that is, the l atworms. The Platyhelminthes are located in an 
important position with respect to the evolution of metazoans (Hyman 1940; Egger 
et al. 2009). They are widely recognized as being among the simplest organisms 
possessing three tissue layers (triploblasts), bilateral symmetry, cephalization, and 
complex organ systems. Among the metazoans, planarians are representatives of 
the order Tricladida, a designation that is based on the three main branches that 
comprise their digestive system. Planarians have characteristic organs along the 
anteroposterior axis, such as a pair of eyes and auricles, and a brain with simple 
architecture in the anterior head (Fig. 4.1a). A pharynx in the middle portion of the 
body acts as a mouth and anus, and an intestinal tract instead of a blood vascular 
system spreads and supplies nutrients throughout the body (Fig. 4.1a, b). 
One of the most notable characteristics of planarians is their high regenerative 
ability (Fig. 4.1c). They can regenerate whole animals, including a functional brain, 
from tiny fragments from almost any part of their bodies after amputation (Agata 
and Watanabe 1999; Newmark and Sanchez Alvarado 2002; Agata et al. 2003; 
Reddien and Sanchez Alvarado 2004; Umesono and Agata 2009; Umesono et al. 
2011;King and Newmark 2012; Elliott and Sanchez Alvarado2013; Rink 2013),an 
ability that has have been the focus of intense study by many biologists for almost 
250years. An early workeron planariansdescribedthemas ���almost immortal under 
the edge of the knife��� (Dalyell 1814).The i rst description of planarian regeneration 
was published in 1767 (Pallas et al. 1767). Later, Charles Darwin, famous as the 
author of The Origin of Species, was also interested in the regenerative ability 
of planarians (Darwin 1844), and Thomas Hunt Morgan, known as the originator 
of Drosophila genetics, showed that planarians can regenerate completely when 
cut in half transversely or longitudinally, as can fragments that are derived from 
cutting the worm into small pieces (Morgan1898). The robust regenerative abilities 
of planarians are based on a population of pluripotent stem cells called neoblasts, 
which are the only mitotic somatic cells in adults and are distributed throughoutthe 
bodyin planarians(Fig.4.1d)(BagunaandSlack 1981;Bagunaet al. 1989;Sanchez 
Alvarado 2007; Shibata et al. 2010; Reddien 2013). Therefore, many biologists 
have been deeply interested in the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying 
the nature of the neoblasts

Planarians are freshwater flatworms belonging to the
class Turbellaria
within the phylum
Platyhelminthes
. They represent an important group in the study of evolution due to their position among the simplest organisms to exhibit complex characteristics such as
bilateral symmetry
,
cephalization
(development of a head with sensory organs), and
triploblastic tissue organization
(three primary tissue layers).
Key Features of Planarians:
Body Structure
:
Bilateral Symmetry and Triploblasty
: Planarians possess three primary tissue layers, making them triploblastic, and they are bilaterally symmetrical, meaning their body can be divided into two mirrored halves.
Cephalization
: They have distinct body regions along the anteroposterior axis, including a pair of
eyes
and
auricles
(sensory structures) at the anterior end, and a
brain
with simple architecture located in the head.
Digestive System
: The digestive system has three branches, which is the defining characteristic of the
order Tricladida
. Planarians use a
pharynx
located in the middle of the body as both a mouth and an anus. They lack a blood vascular system, so nutrients are distributed through the intestinal tract.
High Regenerative Capacity
:
Remarkable Regeneration
: One of the most extraordinary features of planarians is their
extensive regenerative ability
. They can regenerate an entire organism, including a fully functional brain, from a small fragment of their body. This regeneration ability has fascinated biologists for centuries.
Historical Significance
: The study of planarian regeneration dates back to the 18th century, with early work by researchers such as Pallas in 1767. Later scientists like
Charles Darwin
and
Thomas Hunt Morgan
also studied this phenomenon. Morgan, for example, demonstrated that a planarian can regenerate fully from fragments cut either transversely or longitudinally, even from tiny pieces.
Neoblasts: The Key to Regeneration
:
Pluripotent Stem Cells
: The secret behind planarians' regenerative abilities lies in their
neoblasts
���a population of
pluripotent stem cells
that are the only dividing somatic cells in adult planarians. Neoblasts are distributed throughout the body and play a crucial role in regeneration by proliferating and differentiating into any cell type needed to rebuild damaged or lost tissues.
Longstanding Research Interest
: The ability of neoblasts to regenerate a planarian has been a subject of scientific study for nearly 250 years, with modern biologists using advanced molecular techniques to explore the cellular and genetic mechanisms involved.
Importance in Scientific Research:
Planarians' simple nervous system, combined with their robust regenerative abilities, makes them an attractive model for studying
stem cell biology
,
regenerative medicine
, and
basic principles of nervous system function
. The accessibility of molecular tools like
RNAi
(RNA interference) allows researchers to investigate the roles of specific genes in regeneration and brain formation.
Conclusion:
Planarians, with their
simple yet efficient body systems
, are important models in evolutionary biology and regeneration research. Their
remarkable regenerative powers
, which depend on pluripotent neoblasts, provide critical insights into the fundamental mechanisms of tissue regeneration, stem cell function, and the evolution of nervous systems.

Embryo geometry: a theory of evolution from a single cell to the complex vertebrate body
August 29, 2021

The shape of a perfect egg, defined by a universal formula
One of biology���s biggest mysteries is the genesis of animal form. Biologists trying to understand the genesis and evolution of life have studied and sought to characterize the embryology of all multicellular animal phyla since the 19th century. Many people believed that by the turn of the twentieth century, this work would have been completed.

Anatomists have succeeded in giving comprehensive descriptions of the musculoskeletal, organ, and neurological systems, ranging from Leonardo Da Vinci and Vesalius through Gray���s Anatomy. However, the genesis of these and other elements of organismal shape remains a mystery. Because the body develops from the embryo, nineteenth-century anatomists logically sought a solution by observing early animal development���or embryogenesis. By the end of the nineteenth century, virtually all major phyla���s embryological phases had been described in minute detail.

Major evolutionary changes, according to Neo-Darwinian theory, occur as a result of the selection of random, fortunate genetic mutations through time. However, other experts argue that this hypothesis fails to account for the emergence of fundamentally diverse living forms and their rich complexity, notably in vertebrates like humans.

The authors beg the reader to suspend skepticism that such a complex and longstanding problem is subject to a solution of relative simplicity. ���Embryo geometry���, developed by a team from the University of San Diego, Mount Holyoke College, Evergreen State College, and Chem-Tainer Industries, Inc. in the United States, considers animal complexity in general, and the vertebrate body in particular, to be the result of mechanical forces and geometric laws rather than random genetic mutation.

They offer 24 ���blueprints��� in their article that illustrate how the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, neurological, and reproductive systems evolve through the mechanical deformation of geometric patterns. These images show how the vertebrate body might have evolved from a single cell during the evolutionary time and during individual development.

Though neither rigorous nor exhaustive in an empirical sense, our model offers an intuitive and plausible description of the emergence of form via simple geometrical and mechanical forces and constraints. The model provides a template, or roadmap, for further investigation, subject to confirmation (or refutation) by interested researchers.

The concept of ���embryo geometry��� suggests that the vertebrate embryo might be produced by mechanical deformation of the blastula, a ball of cells formed when a fertilized egg splits. As these cells multiply, the volume and surface area of the ball expand, changing its shape. According to the hypothesis, the blastula preserves the geometry of the initial eight cells generated by the egg���s first three divisions, which establish the three axes of the vertebrate body.

The premise that complex animal form arises from mechanical forces acting on geometrically constrained populations of dividing cells in the early embryo provides a new lens through which to view developmental and evolutionary processes, and may pose a significant challenge to the Modern Synthesis���s dictum that evolution proceeds by a selection of adventitious mutations resulting from random mutations.

Though speculative, the model addresses the poignant absence in the literature of any plausible account of the origin of vertebrate morphology. A robust solution to the problem of morphogenesis���currently an elusive goal���will only emerge from consideration of both top-down (e.g., the mechanical constraints and geometric properties considered here) and bottom-up (e.g., molecular and mechano-chemical) influences.

The article titled
"Embryo Geometry: A Theory of Evolution from a Single Cell to the Complex Vertebrate Body"
offers a speculative yet intriguing theory on how vertebrate morphology might emerge through mechanical forces and geometric principles during early embryogenesis. Here's a breakdown of the key points:
1.
Problem of Morphogenesis and Evolution:
Since the 19th century, biologists have attempted to understand how complex animal forms, including vertebrates, arise during development and evolution.
While anatomical descriptions of complex organ systems (musculoskeletal, neurological, etc.) have been extensively documented, the
origins
of these structures during embryonic development have remained a mystery.
2.
Critique of Neo-Darwinian Evolution:
The
Neo-Darwinian theory
posits that major evolutionary changes occur through the
selection of random genetic mutations
over time. However, some experts argue that this fails to fully explain the
emergence of diverse and complex forms
such as those seen in vertebrates.
The article suggests that
embryo geometry
, a theory involving mechanical forces and geometric constraints, might offer a more intuitive and plausible explanation for how vertebrate bodies evolve and develop.
3.
Embryo Geometry:
The authors propose that the vertebrate body evolves from
mechanical deformation of geometric patterns
in early embryonic development.
Blastula and Gastrulation
: The theory focuses on the
blastula
, an early stage in embryogenesis characterized by a ball of cells. As cells divide and multiply, mechanical forces cause the expansion and deformation of this structure, which leads to the eventual formation of various
organ systems
.
Geometric Principles
: The model suggests that the initial geometry of the first few divisions of the egg (the blastula) sets the axes for the body plan. These geometric constraints then guide how cells move and differentiate into complex structures such as the nervous system, musculoskeletal system, and other organs.
4.
Illustrations of Evolution and Development:
The article provides 24 blueprints that illustrate the hypothetical evolution of the vertebrate body. These include:
Blastulation and Gastrulation
: Describes how early embryonic layers organize and form the foundation for the vertebrate body.
Organogenesis
: Demonstrates the formation of major organ systems like the
nervous system
,
cardiovascular system
, and
musculoskeletal structures
(vertebrae, skull, limbs).
Radial vs. Bilateral Forms
: Illustrates how different animal forms (radial or bilateral symmetry) emerge from the same geometric constraints.
Reproductive Systems
: Depicts how the
ovary
,
testis
, and
urogenital tract
develop via geometric deformation.
5.
Challenging the Modern Synthesis:
The theory challenges the
Modern Synthesis
(the integration of Darwinian evolution with genetics) by emphasizing
mechanical and geometric factors
over random genetic mutations as drivers of evolution and development.
It posits that
mechanical constraints
acting on the blastula, combined with the preservation of geometric patterns from early cell divisions, play a pivotal role in determining body form.
6.
A Speculative Model for Further Research:
While the model is
speculative
and lacks rigorous empirical backing, it offers an intuitive framework for understanding how
mechanical forces
could shape animal form.
The authors acknowledge that further investigation is needed to confirm or refute the model, and they suggest that a comprehensive understanding of morphogenesis requires integrating both
top-down
(mechanical and geometric influences) and
bottom-up
(molecular and genetic) approaches.
7.
Potential Impact:
This theory offers a fresh perspective on
embryology
and
evolutionary biology
by emphasizing the role of physical forces and geometry in shaping biological form.
If validated, this model could provide a
new lens
for understanding the evolution of complex organisms and may prompt a reevaluation of some aspects of evolutionary theory.
Conclusion:
The concept of
embryo geometry
presents a novel hypothesis that vertebrate body plans arise not solely from genetic mutations but also through
mechanical deformation
and the conservation of
geometrical patterns
during early development. Though speculative, this theory encourages further exploration of the intersection between
physical forces
,
geometry
, and
evolution
, offering a potentially groundbreaking perspective on how complex forms evolve and develop from a single cell.

SUMMARY 
A striking property of vertebrate embryos is the emergence of a conserved body plan across a wide range of 
organisms through the process of gastrulation. As the body plan unfolds, gene regulatory networks (GRNs) 
and multicellular interactions (cell regulatory networks, CRNs) combine to generate a conserved set of 
morphogeneticeventsthatleadtothephylotypicstage.Interrogationofthesemultilevelinteractionsrequires 
manipulation of the mechanical environment, which is diff i cult in vivo. We review recent studies of stem cell 
models of early embryogenesis from different species showing that, independent of species origin, cells in 
culture form similar structures. The main difference between embryos and in vitro models is the boundary 
conditions of the multicellular ensembles. We discuss these observations and suggest that the mechanical 
and geometric boundary conditions of different embryos before gastrulation hide a morphogenetic ground 
state that is revealed in the stem-cell-based models of embryo development. 
The emergence of an organism from a fertilized egg is the 
result of a coordination of cellular multiplication, diversif i cation, 
and spatial organization. Each of these events is driven by 
schedules of gene expression within individual cells that are in 
turn regulated by the spatial rearrangement of cells and tissues 
via intercellular signaling. Early in this process, a mass of seem- 
ingly identical cells resulting from the proliferation of the zygote 
engages in a choreography of morphogenetic movements that 
shapes the recognizable outline of an organism. This is a feature 
of all metazoan organisms and the ensemble of movements is 
called ������gastrulation,������ a term introduced by Ernst Haeckel to ac- 
count for the formation of the gut in sponges and generally un- 
derstood as a stage between the ������blastula������ and the ������neurula,������ 
during which germ layers are specif i ed (Haeckel, 1872, 1874; 
Stern, 2004b). The multicellular choreographies associated 
with gastrulation are species specif i c, determined by the geom- 
etry and organization of the egg of origin. In vertebrates, each of 
these variant gastrula morphologies nevertheless leads to a 
conserved phylotypic process, represented by the emergence 
of a segmentally organized anteroposterior (AP) axis with the 
pharyngeal arches at the front, an orthogonal axis demarcating 
the dorsoventral (DV) positions of the nervous system, and the 
gut and a midline (ML) that def i nes a bilateral symmetry. How 
such a conserved body plan emerges through a process that is 
associated with extensive differences in global morphology is a 
fundamental problem in biology. 
Gastrulation and the emergence of the vertebrate body plan 
have traditionally been studied in model organisms either by 
experimental embryology, amphibia and birds, or genetics in 
mammals, with zebraf i sh providing a useful combination of the 
two (Solnica-Krezel and Sepich, 2012; Stern, 2004b). Over the 
last 20 years, a convergence of these approaches to the notions 
of embryonic induction and morphogen activity has created a 
framework to think about the emergence of tissues and organs 
during embryogenesis focused on gene regulatory networks 
(GRNs). In what often appears like a parallel universe stands 
morphogenesis, the way cells coordinate their activities to 
generate shapes. This is the realm of processes such as cell di- 
vision,adhesion, polarization, and deformation,which, incell en- 
sembles, are translated into tissue l ows, cell migration, cavita- 
tion, extension, and branching. These are excluded from the 
GRN framework, but may be elements of a set of what we sug- 
gest to calling cell regulatory networks (CRNs); GRNs specify 
cell fates, CRNs specify the organization of multicellular ensem- 
bles (Gorf i nkiel and Martinez Arias, 2021). The omission of CRNs 
from the GRN framework is not deliberate, but rather ref l ects a 
new casting of an old problem: we do not yet know how to 
deal with the higher order activities of cells, i.e., the outputs of 
the integrated activity of the cytoskeleton and adhesion systems 
as in individual and collective cell movements, nor how to relate 
them to gene activity (Shook and Keller, 2008). 
The notion that development results from an interaction be- 
tween two different operative systems was foreshadowed by 
Alan Turing in his seminal paper on ������the chemical basis of 
morphogenesis������ (Turing, 1952), in which he states that ������the 
description of the state [of a biological system] consists of two 
parts, the mechanical and the chemical. The mechanical part 
of the state describes the positions, masses, velocities and 
elastic properties of the cells, and the forces between them. 
The chemical part.is given as the chemical composition of 
each separate cell.������ The statement has a corollary, namely, 
������The interdependence of the chemical and mechanical data 
ll 
Developmental Cell 56, September 13, 2021 �� 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.2405 
adds enormously to the diff i culty [of understanding the system] 
and attention will therefore be conf i ned, so far as is possible, 
to cases where these can be separated.������ We shall refer to this 
statementasthe������Turingconjecture������andwilluseittoemphasize 
the importance of understanding interactions between GRNs 
(chemical) and CRNs (mechanical) to gain a complete picture 
of how the vertebrate body plan emerges. Turing began to 
address the problem with a theoretical analysis of the chemical 
component, isolated from the mechanical one, and the recent 
work on GRNs represents an extension of this. However, as 
we have pointed out, GRNs do not explain morphogenesis, a 
process thatisthe realmof cellsratherthanthatof genes.Efforts 
are being made to bridge the two (Collinet and Lecuit, 2021; 
Shook and Keller, 2008), but our understanding of CRNs is 
very preliminary, largely because while we know their compo- 
nents, we have not yet thought of how to assemble them into 
networks and circuits. 
The study of morphogenesis has traditionally been based on 
experimental embryology, an approach that, by explanting tis- 
sues and culturing them ex vivo, or through heterotopic trans- 
plantation of def i ned regions of the embryo, elucidates specif i c 
tissue interactions to determine the relationship between inter- 
cellular communication and pattern formation (Hamburger, 
1988). This work is currently undergoing a renaissance through 
the development of novel imaging and computational tech- 
niques, but still requires the use of embryos of appropriate size 
and accessibility to perform microsurgical manipulations. A 
new experimental paradigm provided by mammalian pluripotent 
stem cells (PSCs) allows for the emergence of multicellular inter- 
actions to be observed as cells undergo differentiation from a 
common pluripotent state and is particularly useful for asking 
questions about these events in embryos for which direct exper- 
imental manipulation has been challenging (Moris et al., 2020b). 
Taking advantage of the potential of these cells to generate 
most, if not all, cell types of an organism ex vivo, it is possible 
to ask how much of an organism, understood as a collective of 
celltypes,tissues,andorgans,canberecapitulatedwithouthav- 
ing undergone any prior instruction from signals in the embryo. 
Here, we focus on gastrulation and the emergence of the 
vertebrate body to survey these studies in the context of exper- 
imental embryology. We suggest that experiments with PSCs 
uncover principles of multicellular organizations, which are hid- 
den in embryos owing to the interdependence of chemical and 
mechanical signals in morphogenesis. We shall discuss how 
these new experimental systems begin to untangle the two com- 
ponents and will argue that the organization of PSCs over time 
reveals how conserved gastrulation processes can lead to a 
common morphology when released from the geometrical con- 
straintsimposedonwholeembryosinvivo.Wesuggestthatspe- 
cies-specif i c gastrulation movements can be considered as a 
conserved set of gene regulatory interactions molded by a 
more l exible morphogenetic driver based on multicellular inter- 
actions and is dependent on geometry and mechanics. The 
importance of considering the role of mechanics in gastrulation 
has been known for some time (Keller et al., 2003), and has 
recently come to the fore through the discovery of multiple 
mechanisms of mechanotransduction (Collinet and Lecuit, 
2021; Gross et al., 2017). Here, we focus on the need to under- 
stand how feedback between GRNs and CRNs operates at the 
whole embryo level and emphasize its central importance in laying down the body plan.

This article titled
"Establishment of the Vertebrate Body Plan: Rethinking Gastrulation through Stem Cell Models of Early Embryogenesis"
by Benjamin Steventon, Lara Busby, and Alfonso Martinez Arias, provides a comprehensive analysis of how the
vertebrate body plan
emerges during
gastrulation
, a crucial phase in embryogenesis. Below is a summary of the key points discussed:
1.
Vertebrate Body Plan and Gastrulation
:
Gastrulation is a pivotal process during early embryogenesis that leads to the formation of the
germ layers
(ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) and organizes the body plan of vertebrates.
Despite differences in embryo geometry and early development across species,
gastrulation
leads to the conserved formation of the
anteroposterior (AP) axis
,
dorsoventral (DV) axis
, and
bilateral symmetry
, establishing the basic vertebrate body structure.
Gene regulatory networks (GRNs)
control cell fate specification, while
cell regulatory networks (CRNs)
guide the organization of cells and tissues, translating cellular movements into organismal structure.
2.
Mechanical and Chemical Interactions in Development
:
The authors argue that the emergence of body form results from the
interaction of mechanical forces
(CRNs) and
chemical signals
(GRNs).
Alan Turing's conjecture
from his 1952 paper, which discusses the interplay between mechanical and chemical components in morphogenesis, is used to highlight the importance of understanding both systems for a comprehensive view of development.
While GRNs determine the gene expression schedules that guide cell behavior, CRNs dictate the spatial organization of cells during processes like
cell division, migration, adhesion, and polarization
.
3.
Stem Cell Models and Gastrulation
:
Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs)
provide a new experimental paradigm for studying early embryogenesis, as they can mimic many of the key developmental processes, including gastrulation, outside of the embryo.
These
in vitro models
allow researchers to observe how cells self-organize into multicellular structures, offering insights into how the
vertebrate body plan
can be established without the geometric and mechanical constraints present in vivo.
The authors suggest that stem cell models help reveal hidden
morphogenetic principles
that are less accessible in natural embryos due to the interdependence of mechanical and chemical signals during development.
4.
Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) vs. Cell Regulatory Networks (CRNs)
:
GRNs
are traditionally understood as networks of genes that regulate each other to control
cell fate decisions
. They explain how tissues and organs emerge from gene activity.
However,
morphogenesis
���the actual shaping of tissues���relies more on the
CRNs
, which involve the mechanical and cellular behaviors (e.g., cell migration, extension, and branching) necessary to form structures.
The authors argue that CRNs have been largely overlooked in studies focused on GRNs and call for more attention to the
mechanical properties
and cell-cell interactions that influence tissue formation.
5.
Species-Specific Gastrulation Movements
:
Although species exhibit differences in the geometries of their eggs and
gastrulation movements
, the basic processes that lead to a conserved vertebrate body plan are thought to be driven by
common regulatory interactions
.
The study suggests that
mechanical forces and geometry
play a significant role in shaping the embryo and emphasizes the need for further research on the
feedback loops
between GRNs and CRNs.
6.
Mechanotransduction and Morphogenesis
:
Recent discoveries in
mechanotransduction
���the process by which cells sense and respond to mechanical forces���are providing new insights into the mechanics of gastrulation.
The authors call for more research to understand how
mechanical feedback
at the whole embryo level interacts with gene regulatory networks to drive the formation of the body plan.
Conclusion:
The article emphasizes the importance of integrating
gene regulatory networks (GRNs)
and
cell regulatory networks (CRNs)
to fully understand how the vertebrate body plan emerges during gastrulation. Using
stem cell models
of early embryogenesis, researchers can uncover the underlying
mechanical and chemical interactions
that guide morphogenesis. The authors advocate for more attention to
mechanical forces
and
multicellular organization
to explain the conserved processes of vertebrate development across species.

We propose that the phylotypic process itself has not been 
developmentally constrained in an evo-devo sense, i.e., via the 
repeated conservation of developmental mechanisms at this 
stage above that of earlier stages. Instead, such a conservation 
has been acting throughout the proceeding gastrulation stages. 
It is merely a mechano-geometrical constraint that has been 
relaxed to allow for the observed hourglass structure upon 
reaching a conserved body plan (Figure 4). Therefore, von Baer 
might have been correct in supposing that there are develop- 
mental constraints happening to drive conservation during 
essential stages of development. However, this is happening in 
thecontextofconservingahighlyregulativemechanismofmulti- 
axial patterning that can allow for a concomitant variation in 
morphology. The main difference between embryos are the 
boundary conditions imposed to their pluripotent cells, and likely 
contributed signif i cantly to the feedback between CRNs and 
GRNs that shapes the embryo (Figure 4). If boundary conditions 
are removed, as in the case of pescoids and gastruloids, the 
multicellular system reverts to a morphogenetic ground state, 
which appears to be associated with an elongated structure 
patterned by GRNs. Therefore, we suggest that what is unveiled 
in gastruloid and pescoid experiments is an underlying mecha- 
nismthat is able to respond to alterations in boundary conditions 
and self-assemble multiaxial patterning through a wide range of 
morphologies. When all such boundary conditions are released 
in culture, a morphology emerges that is a product of such 
conserved gastrulation processes coupled with similar starting 
conditions. 
Several questions remain as to how exactly pattern regulation 
is achieved, how is it that biological systems exhibit the size 
invariant proportionality of tissues and organs, and how is it 
that such a critical process as gastrulation is so robust to certain 
manipulations. This might be in an experimental context upon 
manipulation of the early embryo, in the generation of embryo- 
like structures in vitro, and through the evolution of gastrulation. 
The answers will most likely lie in the fact that gastrulation is a 
highly integrated process that relies on continued information 
exchange across many levels of biological organization. Within

early embryo morphologies up until the point of the 
phylotypic process. In the second (cyan), develop- 
mental constraints are acting to conserve the

these interactions are used repeatedly through 
development, conservation is maintained at a

each cell, GRNs drive cells to differentiate and adopt specif i c 
behaviors. Their coordination at the level of cell populations 
then results in the progressive deformation of tissues during 
morphogenesis. Tissues then interact via inductive interactions 
to build multitissue structures, which, in turn, form interacting or- 
gans of the animal body. Concomitant with the causal relation- 
ships outlined above is a reversal of this information l ow to 
confer changes to GRN activity in response to alterations in 
the size and shape of tissues. In other words, downward causa- 
tion must exist from higher levels of biological organization (i.e., 
at the whole organism or multitissue level) to lower levels (at the 
level of gene expression within single cells). Such a mechanism 
for downward causation in development has been termed ������tis- 
sue tectonics������ in reference to the multitissue repositioning that 
lies at the heart of patterning processes, such as body plan 
establishment during gastrulation (Blanchard et al., 2009; Busby 
and Steventon, 2020). 
Understanding the mechanisms of multiscale information l ow 
during development is at the heart of what we have termed here 
as ������Turing���s conjecture������ and represents one of the most impor- 
tant questions facing modern developmental biology. It has a 
huge potential impact in terms of inf l uencing the bioengineering 
of embryo-like structures and organoids in vitro. In selecting the 
appropriate control parameters with which to alter boundary 
conditions and engineer multicellular systems and embryo-like 
structures in vitro, it makes sense to take inspiration from 
comparative developmental biology to def i ne which elements 
of development evolution has selected upon to generate diver- 
sity in form. We def i ne such an approach as ������evo-engineering,������ 
inreference toobservations ofhowalterations in properties such 
as progenitor growth rates have generated diversity in the devel- 
opmentalmechanismsofaxialelongation(CrespiandSemeniuk, 
2004; Steventon and Martinez Arias, 2017). Where the limits of 
robustness are reached, it is likely the development and 
patterning of multicellular systems that can be manipulated 
and guided in a controllable manner. In many ways, this could 
not come at a better time, as the ability to obtain quantitative in- 
formation from multiple levels of biological organization offers a 
real possibility for the development of predictive models for 
multicellular development.

This section of the article explores how the
phylotypic process
, which leads to a conserved vertebrate body plan, is influenced not only by genetic regulatory mechanisms but also by
mechanical and geometric constraints
during embryogenesis. Here���s a breakdown of the key concepts:
1.
Phylotypic Process and Developmental Constraints
:
The
phylotypic process
refers to the stage in vertebrate embryonic development when embryos of different species converge into a conserved body plan, characterized by a similar arrangement of key anatomical features.
The authors propose that
developmental constraints
on this process are not only genetic but also mechanical, involving the physical boundary conditions imposed on pluripotent cells during
gastrulation
.
These constraints are relaxed as development progresses, allowing for the emergence of species-specific traits after the conserved body plan is established.
2.
Hourglass Model of Development
:
The
developmental hourglass
is a pattern in which early embryos exhibit high diversity in morphology, converge on a conserved body plan during the phylotypic stage, and then diverge again as species-specific characteristics develop.
According to the authors, this can be explained by three interlinked aspects:
Maternal reproductive strategies
: Differences in egg size and nutrient content create diverse starting conditions for early embryo morphologies.
Conservation of gene regulatory networks (GRNs)
: GRNs are maintained throughout development to ensure the proper formation of conserved body structures.
Cell regulatory networks (CRNs) during gastrulation
: Mechanical and cellular interactions drive morphogenesis, leading to the formation of the body plan.
3.
Stem Cell Models of Early Development
:
In
in vitro models
like
pescoids
and
gastruloids
, pluripotent stem cells are cultured without the physical constraints of the embryo. Under these conditions, the cells self-organize and reveal a
morphogenetic ground state
, producing structures that resemble the body plan seen in vivo.
These models suggest that removing boundary conditions can lead to a reversion to a more fundamental developmental state, in which GRNs and CRNs drive multiaxial patterning across various morphologies.
4.
Mechanics and Robustness of Gastrulation
:
Gastrulation is a highly integrated process that remains robust despite variations in experimental manipulation, suggesting that it is driven by a tightly coordinated interaction between
mechanical forces
(CRNs) and
gene regulation
(GRNs).
Understanding how
multiscale information flow
operates���how cellular processes lead to tissue formation and how tissue interactions affect gene activity���is critical to grasping how robust body plans emerge.
5.
Tissue Tectonics and Downward Causation
:
The authors refer to the concept of
tissue tectonics
, which describes the repositioning of tissues during development. This concept also highlights
downward causation
, where changes at the organismal or tissue level influence gene expression at the cellular level, completing the feedback loop between genetic and cellular processes.
This multilevel interaction is key to understanding
morphogenesis
and the establishment of body plans, particularly during gastrulation.
6.
Evo-Engineering and Bioengineering Implications
:
The idea of
evo-engineering
draws from evolutionary principles to guide the development of embryo-like structures and organoids in vitro by manipulating
boundary conditions
and
multicellular interactions
.
By understanding the limits of developmental robustness, researchers can manipulate and guide multicellular systems in a controlled manner, offering exciting potential for
bioengineering
and the development of
predictive models
of multicellular development.
Conclusion:
The authors argue that the
phylotypic process
is shaped by both
genetic
and
mechanical constraints
during gastrulation. The relaxation of these constraints allows for diversity in species-specific traits. By studying
stem cell models
of early development, scientists can uncover the
morphogenetic ground state
that drives the conserved body plan across species. The integration of
gene regulatory networks (GRNs)
and
cell regulatory networks (CRNs)
, along with concepts like
tissue tectonics
and
downward causation
, provides a framework for understanding the complex interactions that govern embryonic development and offers new avenues for
bioengineering
and
evo-engineering
approaches.

What are some connections between the topics we've discussed?
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Several connections exist between the topics we've discussed, tying together ideas from evolutionary biology, developmental biology, neurobiology, and regenerative models. Here's a synthesis of these connections:
1.
Neurons and Evolution of the Nervous System
:
The discussion on
protoneurons
(ancestral neurosecretory cells) and their evolutionary significance connects with the
planarian brain
as a model for understanding how simple nervous systems evolved into more complex ones in vertebrates. Both highlight how ancient neural structures share conserved molecular and cellular mechanisms across species, revealing common evolutionary origins for nervous systems.
In planarians, despite the simplicity of their nervous system, we see
neurotransmitters
conserved with vertebrates, which echoes the idea that primitive organisms like bacteria and ciliates may exhibit neuron-like functions.
2.
Embryo Geometry and Evolutionary Development
:
The idea of
embryo geometry
proposing that mechanical forces and geometric constraints shape early development directly ties into the
gastrulation process
described in the establishment of the vertebrate body plan.
Both approaches emphasize how physical processes (like the mechanical deformation of embryonic cells) and
geometric principles
contribute to the formation of complex structures, challenging the traditional view that evolution is purely driven by random genetic mutations. In both cases,
mechanical forces
are suggested to play a crucial role in shaping biological form across evolutionary time.
3.
Regeneration and Stem Cell Models
:
Planarian regeneration
demonstrates the ability of
pluripotent stem cells
(neoblasts) to rebuild complex structures like the brain from small fragments. This ties directly into discussions about
pluripotent stem cell models
of gastrulation, where stem cells self-organize into structures mimicking early development stages.
Both models (planarian regeneration and stem-cell-derived gastruloids) underscore how pluripotent cells follow
conserved developmental pathways
to regenerate or form structures, driven by both
gene regulatory networks (GRNs)
and
cell regulatory networks (CRNs)
.
The study of planarian stem cells offers practical insights into regenerative biology, which complements the broader exploration of
stem cell models
in understanding embryogenesis and developmental constraints.
4.
Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) and Morphogenesis
:
The interplay between
GRNs
and
CRNs
in shaping the vertebrate body plan through
gastrulation
connects with the molecular mechanisms controlling
planarian brain regeneration
and
protoneuron evolution
. All involve complex regulatory interactions governing cell fate, tissue organization, and morphogenesis.
In the context of
embryo geometry
and
gastrulation
, GRNs are suggested to guide gene expression, while mechanical forces (CRNs) influence the physical arrangement of cells, similar to how planarians' pluripotent cells regenerate tissue following injury, governed by similar genetic and mechanical rules.
5.
Developmental Constraints and Conservation Across Species
:
The idea of
developmental constraints
maintaining conserved body plans (discussed in gastrulation and embryo geometry) resonates with the
conservation of nervous system components
seen in the study of
protoneurons
and
planarian nervous systems
. These constraints ensure that, despite variations in species-specific traits, certain fundamental biological processes are conserved across evolutionary time.
Stem cell models
and
regenerative biology
also illustrate how early developmental mechanisms are conserved, enabling species to regenerate tissues or organize structures in predictable ways, which ties into the broader
evolutionary framework
discussed in both the
vertebrate body plan
and
nervous system evolution
.
Conclusion:
Across all these topics, the common theme is the interaction between
genetic regulatory mechanisms
(GRNs),
mechanical forces
(CRNs), and
evolutionary conservation
in shaping complex biological systems. Whether it���s the evolution of the nervous system, the regeneration of tissues, or the emergence of body plans during gastrulation, the underlying principles of
mechanics
,
geometry
, and
gene regulation
are consistently at play, providing insights into how complexity arises in both development and evolution.
