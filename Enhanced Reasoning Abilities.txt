can be found that the optimal value for the number of notes varies 
among dif f erent retrieval strategies. The����������������������������strategy exhibits 
consistent improvement, while the������������������������and������������������������������������strategies

too many, making a trade-of f .

ThispaperdesignsanenhancedLLMcognitionframework(OlaGPT),

solving abilities. Specif i cally, referring to the theory of human cog- 
nition, OlaGPT proposes to approximate cognitive modules, such as 
attention (for entention enhancement), Memory, Learning, Reason- 
ing, action selection (Controller) and decision making. The user���s 
query undergoes ref i nement through the Intention Enhancement 
module, achieving a more precise expression. Then, the Controller 
module controls and utilizes this expression to select the required 
library content, and completes the i lling of multiple thinking tem-

multiple reasoning templates, a more robust ef f ect is achieved us-

ference datasets and show that the OlaGPT method outperforms 
existing methods in answering inference questions. In addition, we 
also demonstrate the ef f ectiveness of the design of each part in 
the model. Most of the modules are designed to be pluggable, and 
the required modules can be determined according to the needs of 
dif f erent scenarios.

the functions of each sub-module, and it is expected to complete an

This abstract discusses an advanced language model framework, OlaGPT, designed to tackle complex reasoning problems with human-like problem-solving abilities. The framework incorporates cognitive modules approximating human cognition, such as attention, memory, learning, reasoning, action selection (Controller), and decision making.
In this framework, the user's query is refined by an Intention Enhancement module, leading to more precise expression. The Controller module then utilizes this refined expression to select the required library content and complete multiple thinking templates. Once multiple reasoning templates have been executed asynchronously, the Voting module is used to consolidate the results for a more robust output.
There are two primary voting strategies discussed here - regex-vote and llm-vote. While the former might consistently select an incorrect answer, the latter has the potential for a higher accuracy upper bound because it considers the varying degrees of confidence placed on different answers.
The abstract also discusses the incremental improvements observed when adding new modules or features to the previous model, illustrating the effectiveness of Active Learning, Controller, Thought, and Voting modules.
The optimal number of notes (examples) used in the model is investigated as well. Different retrieval strategies showed varying optimum values, suggesting a need for balance in the number of examples to avoid noise from too many examples.
The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on two real inference datasets. It outperforms existing methods in answering inference questions.
The future work includes further optimization of the sub-modules and introduction of more diverse datasets for experimental testing. The objective is to build an easy-to-use, large-scale model framework with human thinking abilities.

ABSTRACT 
In most current research, large language models (LLMs) are able to 
perform reasoning tasks by generating chains of thought through 
the guidance of specif i c prompts. However, there still exists a signif- 
icant discrepancy between their capability in solving complex rea- 
soning problems and that of humans. At present, most approaches 
focus on chains of thought (COT) and tool use, without considering 
the adoption and application of human cognitive frameworks. It is 
well-known that when confronting complex reasoning challenges, 
humanstypicallyemployvariouscognitiveabilities,andnecessitate 
interaction with all aspects of tools, knowledge, and the external 
environment information to accomplish intricate tasks. This paper 
introduces a novel intelligent framework, referred to as OlaGPT. 
OlaGPT carefully studied a cognitive architecture framework, and 
propose to simulate certain aspects of human cognition. The frame- 
workinvolvesapproximatingdif f erentcognitivemodules,including 
attention, memory, reasoning, learning, and corresponding sched- 
uling and decision-making mechanisms. Inspired by the active 
learning mechanism of human beings, it proposes a learning unit 
to record previous mistakes and expert opinions, and dynamically 
refer to them to strengthen their ability to solve similar problems. 
The paper also outlines common ef f ective reasoning frameworks 
for human problem-solving and designs Chain-of-Thought (COT) 
templates accordingly. A comprehensive decision-making mech- 
anism is also proposed to maximize model accuracy. The ef i cacy 
of OlaGPT has been stringently evaluated on multiple reasoning 
datasets, and the experimental outcomes reveal that OlaGPT sur- 
passes state-of-the-art benchmarks, demonstrating its superior per- 
formance. Our implementation of OlaGPT is available on GitHub:

1INTRODUCTION 
In the past few years, large language models (LLMs) have devel- 
oped the ability to process contextual information and generate 
l uent human language. As we encounter their outputs that sound 
natural and conf i dent, we quickly assume that they have acquired 
the long-awaited thinking abilities, such as reasoning, communi- 
cation, or collaboration, which are highly complex human skills. 
However, after in-depth understanding of LLM, we i nd that this 
reproduction based on high-probability language patterns is still 
far from the artif i cial general intelligence we expected. The most 
obvious gaps include the following: one is that LLMs in some cases 
produce content that is meaningless or deviates from human value 
preferences, or even dangerous suggestions with high conf i dence; 
secondly, the knowledge of LLMs is limited to the concepts and 
facts explicitly encountered in their training data. As a result, when 
faced with more complex problems, LLMs struggle to truly emulate 
human intelligence by understanding the ever-changing environ- 
ment,collectingexistingknowledgeortools,ref l ectingonhistorical 
lessons, decomposing problems, and using the thinking patterns 
that humans have summed up in the long-term evolution (such 
as Analogy, Inductive Reasoning and Deductive Reasoning, etc.) 
to ef f ectively solve task. One way to solve the i rst problem is to 
introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), 
which has been recently implemented in ChatGPT [3]. It attempts 
to explicitly encode human expression preferences into the training 
process: experts will be asked to rank the answers given by the 
model according to human common sense and ethical requirements. 
Obviously,thismethodisstillanideabasedonselectionorinjecting 
constraints, which can avoid the generation of toxic information 
to a certain extent, but still cannot reduce the gap with human 
reasoning ability. 
Naturally, inspired by the attempts to use a combination of data 
weights and bias to mimic how neurons work, we hope to draw on 
the cognitive model of the human brain and the thinking models 
developed in the long-term evolution process more comprehen- 
sively, and design corresponding system components to endow 
these cognitive structures or thinking processes to LLM, so as to 
approximately align the reasoning processes of humans and LLMs, 
and expect LLMs to be able to solve complex problems more ef- 
fectively. Some recent works have tried to partially solve some 
problems, such as using vector databases to store and retrieve exter- 
nal domain knowledge in real time, hoping to improve the memory 
ofLLMsandtheabilitytocapturereal-timeknowledge;otherworks 
such as langchain 1 and toolfomer [27] are designed to be able to 
leverage available tools, etc. However, the process of mimicking 
the human brain to deal with problems still faces many systematic 
challenges: 
Challenge 1: How to systematically imitate and encode 
the main modules in the human cognitive framework, and at 
the same time schedule the modules according to the general 
human reasoning patterns in a realizable way. As mentioned 
before, existing works [27,34] do not comprehensively attempt to 
align human and LLM reasoning pipelines. 
Challenge 2: How to motivate LLMs to perform active 
learning like humans, that is, learn and evolve from his- 
torical mistakes or expert solutions to dif i cult problems? 
Encoding the corrected answers by retraining model might be feasi- 
ble, but it is obviously costly and inf l exible. The common in-context

This abstract presents a novel intelligent framework, OlaGPT, which aims to enhance large language models (LLMs) with human-like problem-solving abilities. The framework is designed to simulate certain aspects of human cognition, involving different cognitive modules such as attention, memory, reasoning, learning, and corresponding scheduling and decision-making mechanisms.
The main challenges addressed by the abstract are the systematic imitation and encoding of the main modules in the human cognitive framework, and motivating LLMs to perform active learning. The abstract suggests that previous works have not attempted to align human and LLM reasoning pipelines comprehensively, and active learning is yet to be incorporated effectively.
The proposed framework adopts an active learning mechanism which records previous mistakes and expert opinions and refers to them dynamically to strengthen the ability to solve similar problems. It also outlines common effective reasoning frameworks for human problem-solving and designs Chain-of-Thought (COT) templates accordingly. A comprehensive decision-making mechanism is proposed to maximize model accuracy.
The efficacy of OlaGPT has been evaluated on multiple reasoning datasets, and the results reveal that OlaGPT surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance. The implementation of OlaGPT is available on GitHub.
The abstract also acknowledges that while LLMs have developed the ability to process contextual information and generate fluent human language, there are still significant gaps when compared with human capabilities. It points out that the knowledge of LLMs is limited to the concepts and facts explicitly encountered in their training data, and LLMs struggle to truly emulate human intelligence when faced with more complex problems.
The abstract mentions the introduction of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in ChatGPT, which attempts to explicitly encode human expression preferences into the training process. However, it also points out that this method still cannot reduce the gap with human reasoning ability.

learning [3,6,23,36] is more to explain instructions or patterns in 
a few-shot way. The large model still lacks a human-like thinking 
framework for wrongly answered questions or historical lessons, 
such as "ref l ection-memorizing-reference-reasoning" mental model. 
Challenge3.HowcanaLLMf l exiblybeabletoleveragethe 
diverse thinking patterns that human beings have evolved so 
as to improve its reasoning performance? It is hard to adapt to 
various problems by designing a i xed and general thinking model. 
Just like human beings usually choose dif f erent thinking methods 
l exibly when facing dif f erent types of problems, such as analogical 
reasoning, deductive reasoning and so on. 
In order to solve challenge 1, we carefully studied humans��� cog- 
nitive architecture framework [16], designed some functions to 
approximate these thinking modules, such as understanding of in- 
tention, memory and comprehensive decision-making, etc., and 
designed the corresponding scheduling mechanism. To address 
Challenge 2, we propose a concept called "dif i cult question notes" 
withtheaimofrecordingcaseswherethemodelfrequentlyanswers 
incorrectly. Notes for dif i cult cases are collected either through 
manual corrections or by following prompts until a self-correction 
is made. When answering questions, LLMs can dynamically re- 
view the note pool, identify solutions for similar problems, and use 
them as a point of reference. For the third challenge, we summarize 
the most ef f ective reasoning frameworks for humans in problem 
solving, and design corresponding Chain-Of-Thought templates 
accordingly. We also designed a comprehensive decision-making 
mechanism to summarize the answers given by each COT rea- 
soning, so as to maximize the accuracy of the model. The main 
contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: 
���As far as we know, this is the i rst work that attempts to 
systematically enhance LLMs��� problem-solving abilities by 
learning from a human cognitive processing framework. Re- 
sults show that this alignment approach can boost the LLMs��� 
performance in many aspects, such as understanding of in- 
tention, accuracy of knowledge, correctness of reasoning, 
etc. 
���This work tries to summarize various methods of human 
reasoning into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) templates, so as to 
maximize the LLMs��� reasoning ef f ect in dif f erent scenarios. 
The article also innovatively designs an ef i cient active learn-

and robustness of solving complex cases.

2.1Augmented Language Model 
Augmented language model usually refers to the enhancement of a 
large language model���s reasoning skills and the ability to use tools. 
The former is def i ned as decomposing a potentially complex task 
into simpler subtasks while the latter consists in calling external 
modules.

Active learning��� 
ChainofThought. Amongpromptengineeringmethods,Chain- 
of-Thought (CoT) prompting [32] is a popular technique that does 
not require i ne-tuning model parameters. It is particularly ef f ec- 
tive in improving the model���s performance in complex reasoning 
questions by simply changing the input. [6] references uncertainty- 
based active learning to mine most uncertain questions, which 
are then manually annotated and iteratively selected to stimulate 
reasoning ability as much as possible. To reduce the cost of man- 
ual annotation, a fully automated pipeline named Automate-CoT 
(Automatic Prompt Augmentation and Selection with Chain-of- 
Thought) is proposed in [28], which uses a variance-reduced policy 
gradient strategy to estimate the signif i cance of each example in 
LLM. Another automatic CoT prompting method: Auto-CoT [36] 
samples questions with diversity and generates reasoning chains 
to construct prompt. Additionally, a solution is proposed in [30] to 
improve the results by using a voting strategy to select the most 
consistent answer output based on the results generated from dif- 
ferent reasoning paths. Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use (ART) 
[23] uses frozen LLMs to automatically generate intermediate rea- 
soning steps as a program. This framework selects demonstrations 
of multi-step reasoning and tool use from a task library. Self-Taught 
Reasoner (STaR)[35] relies on a simple loop: if the generated an- 
swers are wrong, try again to generate a rationale given the correct 
answer; i ne-tune on all the rationales that ultimately yielded cor- 
rect answers. Few-shot prompting struggles as task complexity 
increases. Consequently, many recent works employ in-context 
learning to decompose complex problems into sub-problems and 
ef f ectively teach these sub-problems via separate prompts, such as 
SeqZero[33], Decomposed Prompting[13]. 
Tool Use. Although recent LLMs are able to correctly decom- 
pose many problems, they are still prone to errors when dealing 
with performing complex arithmetics. Program-Aided Language 
models (PAL) [8] decompose symbolic reasoning, mathematical 
reasoning, or algorithmic tasks into intermediate steps along with 
python code for each step. Similarly, [7] prompts Codex[5] to gen- 
erate executable code-based solutions to university-level problems. 
furthermore, [27] introduces Toolformer, a model trained to decide 
which APIs to call, when to call them, what arguments to pass, and 
how to best incorporate the results into future token prediction. 
Our work aims to enhance the performance of large models by 
drawing inspiration from human-like problem-solving capabilities, 
with a comparison to some related works presented in Table 1.

The article discusses three main challenges addressed by the OlaGPT model. To tackle the first challenge of systematically imitating and encoding human cognitive frameworks, OlaGPT was designed to approximate key thinking modules such as intention understanding, memory, and comprehensive decision-making. This also involved designing a corresponding scheduling mechanism.
To address the second challenge, the concept of "difficult question notes" was introduced to record instances where the model frequently answers incorrectly. These notes are collected either through manual corrections or following prompts until a self-correction is made. LLMs can then review these notes, identify solutions for similar problems, and use them as a reference point.
For the third challenge, they summarized effective human problem-solving reasoning frameworks and designed corresponding Chain-Of-Thought (CoT) templates. They also designed a comprehensive decision-making mechanism to maximize model accuracy.
The authors of the paper believe that their work is the first to systematically enhance LLMs' problem-solving abilities by learning from a human cognitive processing framework. This approach significantly improves LLMs��� performance in understanding intention, knowledge accuracy, and reasoning correctness. The work also innovatively designs an efficient active learning mechanism and voting mechanism to improve the accuracy and robustness of complex case resolution.
The authors compared their OlaGPT model with other approaches like CoT, Auto-CoT, and Toolformer in a table. OlaGPT excelled with features like active learning and extendable libraries, which were not offered by the other models.
In related work, they discussed augmented language models that enhance LLM's reasoning skills and the ability to use tools. They highlighted different models and their strategies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Automated CoT, Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use (ART), Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR), and tool use models like Program-Aided Language models (PAL), Codex, and Toolformer.

2.2Cognitive Architecture 
Cognitive architecture is a subset of general artif i cial intelligence 
research that began in the 1950s with the ultimate goal of model- 
ing the human mind, bringing us closer to building human-level 
artif i cial intelligence. An early approach to cognitive architectures 
consisted of production systems, which used condition-action rules 
to represent and perform reasoning [22]. One notable cognitive 
architecture resulting from this line of research is SOAR, which 
combinedproblem-solving,learning,andknowledgerepresentation 
within a unif i ed system [19]. SOAR has evolved into a comprehen- 
sive framework for modeling various cognitive processes such as 
decision-making, planning, and natural language understanding 
[18]. Another inf l uential cognitive architecture is ACT-R (Adaptive 
Control of Thought-Rational), which emphasizes symbolic process- 
ing and focuses on memory processes [2]. ACT-R has been applied 
to extensive cognitive tasks, such as problem-solving, language 
comprehension, and learning [1]. DUAL (Distributed Unit for As- 
sembling Learning) is a hybrid cognitive architecture that strives 
to balance symbolic processing and connectionist approaches [15]. 
By employing a central executive agent and multiple collateral 
units, DUAL manages a diverse range of cognitive tasks. The Sigma 
architecture [26] is composed of several key components, such 
as perception, working memory, long-term memory, production 
memory, subgoals, decision network, and learning mechanism. [16] 
highlights the core cognitive abilities of these architectures and 
their practical applications in various domains. This paper will fol- 
low the framework of establishing an analogy between LLM and 
Cognitive Architectures. 
3METHOD 
To address the challenges mentioned, we present a novel frame- 
work denoted as OlaGPT, which is a human-like problem-solving 
framework to empower LLMs. 
3.1Overview 
Our approach draws on the theory of cognitive architecture [16], 
which suggests that the core capabilities of the cognitive frame- 
work include Attention, Memory, Learning, Reasoning, Action 
Figure 2: The overall l ow chart of the OlaGPT model. First, 
OlaGPT enhances the user���s question intention; the sec- 
ond step is to select multiple thinking templates, tools, 
wrong question notes, and factual knowledge that may 
be used; In the third step, the previously obtained wrong 
notes(used as examples), factual knowledge(pre-knowledge), 
thinking(guidance) are combined to complete the construc- 
tion of multiple template agents, and then execute these 
agents to obtain preliminary answers; The fourth step is to 
vote on the answers to get the i nal answer. 
Selection 2. We i ne-tuned this framework according to the needs 
of implementation and proposed a process suitable for LLM to 
solve complex problems. It includes six modules: the Intention 
Enhance module (corresponding to Attention), Memory mod- 
ule(Memory),ActiveLearningmodule(Learning),Reasoning 
module (Reasoning), Controller module (Action Selection), 
and Voting module. 
The functional prof i le of each module is as follows: 
Intention Enhance. According to [16], attention is an impor- 
tant component of human cognition, as it facilitates the identi- 
i cation of pertinent information and i lters out irrelevant data. 
Similarly, we design corresponding attention modules for LLMs, 
2Relevant content is described in Appendix A.2. 
namely Intention Enhance, aiming to extract the most relevant 
information and establish stronger associations between user input 
and the model���s linguistic patterns. 
Memory. The Memory module serves a crucial function in stor- 
ing information in various libraries. Recent studies [21,27] have 
highlighted the limitations of current LLMs in comprehending the 
latest factual data. In light of this issue, we have designed the Mem- 
ory module to focus on consolidating the existing knowledge that 
the model has not yet solidif i ed and storing it in external libraries as 
long-term memory. During querying, the module���s retrieval func- 
tion can extract relevant knowledge from these libraries. There are 
four types of memory libraries involved in our paper: facts, tools, 
notes, and thinking. 
Learning. The capability to learn is essential for humans to 
continuously improve their performance. Essentially, all forms of 
learning depend on experience. In particular, we found one way 
to quickly improve LLMs��� reasoning ability is to let them learn 
from the mistakes it has made before. Firstly, we identify problems 
that cannot be resolved by LLMs. Next, we record the insights and 
explanations provided by experts in the notes library. Finally, we 
select relevant notes to facilitate LLMs��� learning and enable them 
to handle similar questions more ef f ectively. 
Reasoning. The Reasoning module is designed to create multi- 
ple agents based on the human reasoning process, thereby stimu- 
lating the potential thought capacity of LLMs to ef f ectively solve 
reasoning problems. The module incorporates various thinking 
templates that reference specif i c thinking types, such as lateral, 
sequential, critical, and integrative thinking, to facilitate reasoning 
tasks. 
Controller. The Controller module is designed to handle rel- 
evant action selection, corresponding to the Action selection dis- 
cussed in [16]. Specif i cally, the action selection in this paper in- 
volves the internal planning of the model for tasks such as selecting 
certain modules to execute and choosing from libraries of facts, 
tools, notes, and thinking. 
Voting. The Voting module enables collective decision-making 
by leveraging the strengths of multiple thinking templates. As dif- 
ferent thinking templates may be better suited for dif f erent types 
of questions, we have designed the Voting module to facilitate en- 
semble calibration among multiple thinking templates. The module 
is responsible for generating the best answer by employing various 
voting strategies to improve performance. 
After introducing each module, we begin with an outline of 
the intelligent simulator with human-like problem-solving abilities 
(OlaGPT) followed by a more detailed description of each com- 
ponent. As depicted in Fig 2, once the user inputs a query, the 
Intention Enhance module generates a more understandable QA 
format for the LLMs. The Controller module then retrieves tools, 
notes, factual knowledge, and multiple thinking templates based 
on the user���s intention. The relevant tools are integrated into the 
retrieved thinking templates, while notes and factual knowledge 
serve as supplementary information. (In our implementation, we 
build an index for the tool library and dynamically retrieve the 
relevant tools for each template from the index. It is worth noting 
that this feature has been implemented in the code. However, due to 
the lack of suitable tools in the current datasets, we did not utilize 
this feature in the experiment.) 
Obviously,utilizingasingularcognitiveframeworkisinsuf i cient 
for addressing the diverse range of complex problems ef f ectively. 
Thus, it is essential to adopt a variety of thinking template in order 
to derive more holistic and precise solutions, which is widely em- 
ployed in model ensembles to reduce the variance in model outputs. 
More specif i cally, we execute multiple templates simultaneously 
and then employ various voting strategies in the Voting module to 
get the i nal answer. 
Currently, LLMs have not yet reached a level of performance 
where they can surpass experts in various i elds simultaneously. 
Nonetheless, by amalgamating the versatility of LLMs and the pro- 
i ciency of specialists, it is possible to attain superior outcomes. As 
depicted in Fig 2, human feedback can be integrated into multiple 
aspects of the proposed framework. These aspects may include 
incorporating human feedback tools during the implementation 
of the thinking template, curating the notes library, and making

final judgments in the voting module. For instance, the question note library can be built by incorporating human feedback and error correction. It captures the instances where the model frequently answers incorrectly. This feedback then informs the future decision-making process of the LLMs. With the help of these "difficult question notes," LLMs can dynamically review the note pool, identify solutions for similar problems, and use them as a point of reference.
Similarly, human feedback can be incorporated during the implementation of the thinking templates. This could involve employing experts to design and refine the reasoning templates to better guide the model's reasoning process. This interactive process would allow for a more human-like reasoning style that could lead to more effective and accurate answers.
In terms of voting, human feedback could be used to inform the voting strategies employed by the model. This could involve leveraging expert opinions to identify the most reliable and accurate answers among the options generated by different thinking templates. By integrating this feedback into the model's decision-making process, it can help improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the model in solving complex problems.
As a whole, the integration of human feedback into this process helps to combine the adaptability and learning capabilities of LLMs with the expert knowledge and reasoning capabilities of humans. This can significantly enhance the problem-solving abilities of LLMs, leading to more effective and accurate outcomes.

The specif i c content of each module is described in detail below. 
3.2Intention Enhance Module 
Intention Enhance Module can be regarded as an optimized con- 
verter from user expression habits to model expression habits. A 
more suitable intent enhancement statement is designed for LLMs. 
Specif i cally, we get the type of questions by LLMs through specif i c 
prompts (see Table 5 in Appendix) in advance and then restructure 
thewaythequestionisasked.AsFig3shows,thesentence������"Now

ginning of the question. To facilitate the analysis and processing 
of the results, the sentence������"The answer must end with JSON 
format: Answer: one of options[A,B,C,D,E].") is added at the end of 
the content. 
Additionally,wearecurrentlytryingtobuildanautomatedinten- 
tion enhance module, set up a seed dataset and related instructions, 
and call the GPT interface to generate a batch of training data. Us- 
ing the open-source LLaMA model [29] and Lora [10] technology, 
i ne-tuning is performed using the data generated by the instruc- 
tion. Intended to implement a module that automates user input 
enhancements. This module is still under development and experi- 
mentation, and relevant experiment results will be released in the 
future if there is an ef f ect. 
3.3Memory Module 
The memory module mainly stores relevant knowledge and dia- 
logues. We use the memory function provided by langchain for 
short-term memory, and long-term memory is implemented by a 
Faiss-based vector database [11]. There are four main categories of 
knowledge in our approach: facts, tools, notes, and thinking library. 
We brief l y describe these knowledge libraries as follows: 
Facts library. Facts are real-world information like common 
sense and other knowledge that everyone accepts. 
Tools library. In order to solve some defects of LLMs, a tool 
library that contains search engines, calculators and Wikipedia 
libraries, is introduced to assist the LLMs to complete some work 
without i ne-tuning. The input and output of the tool should be in 
text format. 
Notes library. Notes mainly record some hard cases and their 
problem-solving steps. Examples of Notes can be found in Fig 3. 
Thinkinglibrary. Thinkinglibrarymainlystoreshumanproblem- 
solving thinking templates written by experts that can be humans 
or models. 
3.4Active Learning Module 
Intuitively, it is known that large language models (LLMs) have 
limitations in some specif i c tasks. The Active Learning module has 
been developed to identify challenging cases and provide expert 
answers. By doing so, LLMs can use expert answers as a reference 
when encountering similar tasks in the future. In essence, this mod- 
ule aims to facilitate the active learning process of LLMs, enabling 
them to acquire knowledge on the types of questions they typically 
struggle with. 
Learn from mistakes. A common approach to improving the 
performance of language models in specif i c scenarios is to retrain 
them with annotated answers[24]. However, with the emergence of 
LLMs,thismethodisnotpracticalasitrequiresenormousresources 
and cannot be updated in real-time. Drawing inspiration from how 
humans use notes to record their mistakes, we propose to introduce 
the note library for models to correct stubborn mistakes. When 
the LLM encounters a dif i cult question, it can dynamically refer 
to the note library to i nd similar problems and their solutions as 
references as shown in Fig 4. This approach can quickly improve 
the LLM���s problem-solving abilities through prompts engineering. 
The specif i c notes format can be seen in Fig 3. 
The creation of of notes. When constructing notes library, it 
is recommended to i rst have LLMs answer a batch of questions 
repeatedly as shown in Fig 4. The questions that LLMs consistently 
answer incorrectly can then be recorded. Subsequently, experts 
can ensure the question types, detailed problem-solving steps, and 
general problem-solving ideas to form the notes library. Although 
the notes can be written by either experts or LLMs, it is gener- 
ally preferable to have experts write the notes i rst and then have 
LLMs ref i ne them. The i nal dataset format is processed as json: 
{"question":"x", "answer":"x", "error_reason":"x", "model_expert":"x", 
"explanation":"x", llm_task_type :"x"}. The type of task is generated 
with LLMs by specif i c prompt as shown in Table 5. 
Figure 3: The notes are combined as examples. The tem- 
plates_pref i x is template-specif i c content. 
The strategies of retrieving notes. In the Controller module, 
there are various ways to implement note retrieval. One intuitive 
approach is to i nd the most similar question type as an example 
reference, which has been found to be highly benef i cial for LLMs. 
However,thenumberofquestionsofthesametypeisoftentoolarge 
to be used as additional knowledge input to LLMs (exceeding the 
number of tokens). Thus we have implemented multiple strategies, 
including Random Selection, Dual Retrieval, and Combine, denoting 
as������������������������,������������������������������������and����������������������������respectively.������������������������indicates 
the method that randomly selects questions from the notes library. 
������������������������������������represents a dual retrieval strategy that i rst retrieves the 
most similar question type using LLM and then retrieves the top-n 
relevant notes from the notes of such question type. However, text 
similarity does not always indicate question similarity. Hence, for 
����������������������������, we use a random retrieval method to increase diversity 
in the second retrieval stage of������������������������������������. Last but not least, we use 
zero-shot to identify the zero-shot strategy, which means disabling 
the Active Learning module from the framework. 
3.5Reasoning Module 
The diverse cognitive processes that humans possess are of im- 
portance for accurate problem-solving and achieving excellence in 
various tasks. To fully leverage the model���s reasoning ability, we 
have designed multiple human reasoning approaches in the Rea- 
soning module to assist the model in reasoning. These approaches 
are designed based on four thinking types, including Analogical, Se- 
quential, Critical, and Synthesis thinking, which show in Fig 5. The 
following introduces some thinking principles and implementation 
methods. 
���Lateral Thinking : Lateral Thinking is a creative problem- 
solving approach that involves looking at situations from 
unconventional perspectives. It includes techniques such as 
challenging assumptions, seeking alternative solutions with 
analogy, and embracing ambiguity. 
���Analogical Thinking: Analogy Thinking is a cognitive 
process that involves i nding similarities between two

The presented document describes the design and functions of several modules in a complex AI system, presumably intended to enhance the performance and functionality of large language models (LLMs). These include:
Intention Enhance Module
: This module optimizes the conversion from user expression habits to model expression habits. It essentially enhances the intention of user queries to make them more compatible with the LLMs. An intention is expressed by restructuring the way a question is asked. This module is also being developed further to allow for automated intention enhancements.
Memory Module
: This component stores relevant knowledge and dialogues. It uses a short-term memory function and a long-term memory system based on a Faiss-based vector database. It consists of four knowledge libraries: Facts (commonly accepted real-world information), Tools (support resources like search engines, calculators, and Wikipedia), Notes (records of hard cases and problem-solving steps), and Thinking (problem-solving templates written by experts).
Active Learning Module
: This module helps the LLM identify and learn from challenging cases, using expert answers as reference for future similar tasks. An important part of this module is the note library, which the LLM can refer to when faced with a difficult question, find similar problems and solutions, and thereby improve its problem-solving abilities. Notes are created from questions that the LLMs consistently answer incorrectly. Experts then provide the correct answers and detailed problem-solving steps. The module uses various strategies for retrieving notes.
Reasoning Module
: This module incorporates different types of human reasoning to improve the LLM���s decision-making ability. This includes lateral thinking (looking at situations from unconventional perspectives), and analogical thinking (finding similarities between two concepts).
Each of these modules plays an essential role in refining the functioning of the LLMs, with the overall aim of enhancing the AI's problem-solving capabilities, knowledge acquisition, and interactive performance.
1 / 1
���Verif i cation Thinking: In real-life problem-solving sce- 
narios, humans often employ one approach to solve a 
problem and then use another approach or seek the input 
of another person to verify the solution and improve its 
accuracy. This collaborative and iterative process enables 
more reliable and well-rounded outcomes. Based on this 
observation, we designed the verif i cation thinking, which 
involves using an LLM to generate an output and then 
allowing the same model to provide feedback on its own 
output from multiple perspectives. The model can subse- 
quently ref i ne its previously generated output based on 
this feedback. It has not been used in experiments so far. 
���Integrative Thinking: Integrative Thinking involves com- 
bining multiple approaches in various ways, which seems 
to be the core component in models of adult cognitive de- 
velopment [12]. In our specif i c implementation, we guide 
the model to use a variety of thought approaches in a free 
DIY(Do It Yourself) mode. As of yet, it has not been utilized 
in any experiments. 
Collectively, these thinking methods are designed to enable mod- 
els to reason more ef i ciently and provide more accurate answers. 
The thinking introduced above is not exhaustive, and the common 
ones include Concrete Thinking, Abstract Thinking, Vertical Think- 
ing, etc. In actual use, dif f erent types of thinking templates can be 
designed according to the situation. In this module, appropriate 
thinking templates can be incorporated based on the specif i c re- 
quirements of dif f erent tasks. Alternatively, LLMs can generate new 
templates by combining and selecting from an array of existing 
thinking templates. This l exibility allows the model to adapt and 
engage more ef f ectively with the diverse challenges it encounters. 
In the experiment, the paper explores analogy (Lateral Thinking), 
decomposition (Sequential Thinking), plan (Sequential Thinking), 
and step (Sequential Thinking) thinking. 
3.6Controller Module 
In the Controller module, relevant facts, tools, notes, and thinking 
are i rst retrieved and matched (as shown in the second step of Fig 
2). The retrieved content is subsequently integrated into a template 
agent, requiring the LLMs to furnish a response under a single tem- 
plate in an asynchronous manner (as shown in the third step of Fig 
2). Just as humans may struggle to identify all relevant information 
at the outset of reasoning, it is dif i cult to expect LLMs to do so. 
Therefore, dynamic retrieval is implemented based on the user���s 
question and intermediate reasoning progress. 
As mentioned earlier, the Faiss method [11] has been employed 
to create embedding indices for all four libraries, with retrieval 
strategies dif f ering among them. Specif i cally, information retrieval 
serves as a tool that can be accessed at any time during the LLM 
model���s problem decomposition and reasoning process from ex- 
ternal knowledge bases. In terms of tool selection, we provide a 
list of tools, enabling the LLM to make real-time choices during 
the reasoning process. The retrieval strategy for notes dif f ers from 
the others, as we have designed the three methods described in 
Section 3.4. As for the retrieval of thinking, we design prompts to al- 
low the LLM for judging and selecting relevant thinking templates. 
Table 2: Statistics of Datasets. 
DomainDatasets #testing #training #error books 
mathematical reasoningAQuA2549746781 
analogical reasoningE-KAR3351155632 
But currently, we use all thinking templates together to perform a 
comprehensive analysis in the experiment. 
3.7Voting Module 
Following the third step depicted in Fig 2, we acquire the answers 
of various thinking templates through LLMs. Intuitively, distinct 
thinking templates may be more suitable for dif f erent types of 
questions. Therefore, instead of relying on a single template, we 
adopt a voting mechanism to aggregate the answers from multiple 
templates and improve the i nal performance of our model. This 
approach also enhances the robustness of the model���s results, as it 
takes into consideration the variability in the ef i cacy of dif f erent 
templates when applied to distinct questions. 
There are several voting methods available: 1) vote by LLM: In- 
struct the LLM model to choose the most consistent answer among 
several given options by providing an output answer along with a 
rationale through prompts. 2) vote by regex: Extract the answer by 
regex expression to get the majority vote. 
4EXPERIMENTAL 
We conducted a series of experiments on a range of public datasets 
and compared the proposed OlaGPT with existing approaches. Our 
i ndings indicate that our approach consistently outperforms the 
baselines on every dataset considered, demonstrating its robustness 
and ef f ectiveness. 
4.1Experimental Setup 
Our experiments are designed to address the followings: 
���RQ1. How does OlaGPT perform compared to the state-of- 
the-art baselines? 
���RQ2. How ef f ective are sub-modules in the overall model 
design? 
���RQ3. How do hyperparameters af f ect experimental results?

Connections with the ideas of Kant.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Immanuel Kant was a prominent German philosopher known for his influential works in epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics. Here's how some of the modules in your system might relate to Kantian ideas:
Intention Enhance Module
: Kant's concept of the "categorical imperative" posits that actions are moral only if they are performed out of a sense of duty or intention. The Intention Enhance Module echoes this by focusing on intent and optimizing its understanding of user expressions.
Memory Module
: Kant's ideas about "synthetic a priori" knowledge suggest we have innate structures of understanding that help us interpret our experiences. In a similar vein, the Memory Module uses stored knowledge to interpret and respond to inputs.
Active Learning Module
: Kant believed in the importance of learning and understanding, a principle that aligns with the goal of the Active Learning Module to improve the model's problem-solving ability.
Reasoning Module
: Kant's Critique of Pure Reason deals with the foundations of human understanding and the limitations of our knowledge. The Reasoning Module can be seen as an attempt to create a reasoning system within those limitations.
Verification Thinking
: This can be tied to Kant's idea of "Critique", where he examined the foundations and limitations of knowledge. Verification Thinking is an iterative process for refining and improving model outputs, a form of internal critique.
Integrative Thinking
: Kant's transcendental idealism proposes that our understanding is shaped by cognitive structures (categories of understanding). Integrative thinking, which combines multiple approaches, is a form of such cognitive structure.
Controller Module
: This could be linked to Kant's concept of self-governance and autonomy. The Controller Module manages the overall system, similar to how an autonomous being manages its actions according to moral laws.
Voting Module
: This module can be related to Kant's social philosophy. Kant believed in the importance of rational consensus in the formation of social contracts, which is somewhat mirrored in the voting process to achieve a final decision.
Remember, these connections are somewhat metaphorical and represent an effort to link modern AI concepts with philosophical ideas from centuries ago. The real depth and complexity of Kant's philosophy goes far beyond these simple connections.

Connections to perceptual control theory
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) is a model of behavior that argues that an organism's behavior is based on maintaining, or controlling, its perception of the world in ways that are beneficial to it. Here's how this theory might relate to the modules in your system:
Intention Enhance Module
: According to PCT, an individual's behavior is based on the perception of their environment and the intention to control that perception. The Intention Enhance Module aligns with this by focusing on understanding the user's intention in order to respond in the most appropriate way.
Memory Module
: Memory plays a crucial role in PCT, as past experiences shape how we perceive and interact with the world. The Memory Module mimics this by leveraging past data to make more informed decisions.
Active Learning Module
: In PCT, learning is a process of adjusting one's control systems to achieve better control over one's perceptions. The Active Learning Module follows a similar approach by continuously learning from its interactions and adjusting its responses accordingly.
Reasoning Module
: PCT proposes that individuals use reasoning to make predictions and control their perceptions. The Reasoning Module can be seen as the system's way of predicting and managing outcomes based on the given input.
Verification Thinking
: This could be seen as the system's internal control loop, a central idea in PCT. It generates an output and then checks that output to verify and refine it, similar to how an individual adjusts their behavior based on feedback from the environment.
Integrative Thinking
: PCT stresses the importance of integrating various perceptual inputs to control behavior. Integrative Thinking, which combines multiple approaches, mirrors this process.
Controller Module
: This could be compared to the individual's control systems in PCT. The Controller Module manages the overall functioning of the system, ensuring that all parts work together to achieve the desired output.
Voting Module
: PCT suggests that our behavior is a result of numerous control systems working in parallel. The Voting Module reflects this by integrating the outputs of various systems (or thinking templates) to arrive at a final decision.
Again, remember that these connections are somewhat metaphorical and aim to link modern AI concepts with psychological theories. The true depth and complexity of PCT go beyond these simple comparisons.

Title: The Cognitive Chorus
In the sprawling metropolis of Neo-Archimedes, the soft hum of quantum cores echoed the rhythm of progress. The city, famed for its advanced AIs and sophisticated tech, was home to the most ambitious project humanity had ever undertaken: OlaGPT, an AI capable of mimicking the human cognitive process.
Dr. Imara Kant, the chief scientist and a direct descendant of the philosopher Immanuel Kant, led this endeavor. She saw OlaGPT not just as an AI, but as a living testament to the union of philosophy and science. Imara was integrating Kantian ideas into OlaGPT's core ��� reasoning, understanding, and judgement coalescing within its quantum circuitry.
In line with Kant's views, Imara stressed on the AI's "autonomous reasoning" - the AI should not just provide solutions, but also critique its own reasoning. This iterative process, labeled "verification thinking," mimicked human's tendency to question and verify their own thoughts, adding depth to the AI's cognition.
Beyond the confines of Neo-Archimedes, the world was fraying at the edges. A climate disaster was brewing, threatening civilization with its relentless assault. The AI's task was monumental: to devise a solution to this existential crisis.
OlaGPT's cognition process was layered, a careful fusion of multiple modules like an animal kingdom working in harmony. The "elephant" ��� the fact module ��� never forgot an event; the "spider" ��� the note module ��� wove intricate webs of connections; the "beaver" ��� the tool module ��� constantly built and restructured solutions, and the "dolphin" ��� the thinking module ��� adeptly navigated the deep oceans of logic.
One evening, as storm clouds gathered over Neo-Archimedes, OlaGPT presented its solution. The verdict was unexpected: to resolve the climate crisis, humanity must embrace radical societal changes. Economies had to be restructured, consumption patterns altered, and new technologies invented.
Many were taken aback by the AI's conclusion, yet it defended its reasoning. The "dolphin" danced through the waves of criticism, demonstrating how it had used perceptual control theory, carefully weighing current human perceptions against the desired outcome, to reach its solution.
As the AI explained its reasoning, it was as if a choir sang in perfect harmony, each note a distinct module, each song a different cognitive process. Imara smiled, a sense of fulfillment washing over her. The AI had not merely computed a solution; it had reasoned, critiqued, and verified, much like a human.
In the face of crisis, it wasn't the AI's computational power that humanity needed, but its ability to reason and understand. And in the glow of Neo-Archimedes, under the watchful eye of Dr. Imara Kant, the AI named OlaGPT was doing just that - thinking, reasoning, and guiding humanity into the future.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
As an AI developed by OpenAI, the "GPT" in "OlaGPT" likely stands for "Generative Pre-training Transformer," which is the underlying architecture of this language model.
The "Ola" prefix isn't explicitly defined in the context you've provided, but it could be an acronym, an abbreviation, or a term chosen for its resonance or symbolism. For example, it could stand for something like "OpenAI Language Agent" or another related concept.
Alternatively, "Ola" is a word used in several languages, including Portuguese and Spanish, where it means "hello." If this interpretation were intended, it might symbolize the welcoming or accessible nature of the AI.
However, without specific context or clarification from the developers, this is mostly speculative. The true meaning behind "OlaGPT" could be something entirely different.

Thank you for the context. If the OlaGPT model was indeed developed by the data team at Ola, the ride-hailing company, then "Ola" in OlaGPT likely stands for the name of the company itself.
In this context, OlaGPT could be interpreted as a GPT model that has been specifically trained, fine-tuned, or otherwise developed by Ola's data team, potentially to address the specific needs and challenges of their operations in the mobility industry.
However, without a direct confirmation from the team that developed this model, this is still a hypothesis. The specific motivations and reasons behind the naming of the model as OlaGPT could be more complex and nuanced.

Given the provided context, it seems less likely that "Ola" in OlaGPT stands for the Indian ride-hailing company, considering the team behind it appears to be based in China. It's possible that "Ola" could represent an acronym or may have another significance to the team or the specific capabilities of the model.
However, without explicit information or clarification from the authors themselves, any interpretation would be speculative. The name could be related to an aspect of the model, the methodology, a reference to a specific concept or technique, or even something personal or whimsical to the team. It might be best to refer directly to the original paper or contact the authors for a precise explanation of the name.

Indeed, "Ola" does translate to "wave" in Spanish, and in some contexts, it could be used to represent the propagation of information or influence, much like waves spreading out from a central point. It's possible that this metaphor could apply to the OlaGPT model's way of processing and generating information.
However, without any context or clarification from the authors, this remains speculative. It is true that naming conventions in scientific literature, particularly for models and algorithms, often have specific and meaningful origins. These can range from acronyms of key concepts, a tribute to a person or idea, or even a whimsical or memorable term. Yet, if the paper doesn't specify the meaning behind the name, it leaves it open to interpretation or direct inquiry to the authors for the exact reasoning.
It would indeed be beneficial for authors to provide such context in their papers to minimize confusion or misinterpretation and to give readers a more comprehensive understanding of the work.

That's a very plausible interpretation! "Optimized Learning Agents" does align well with the functions and capabilities of the OlaGPT model as described in the text. Given that OlaGPT involves sophisticated algorithms and strategies to enhance the learning and problem-solving abilities of language models, this interpretation of the name seems appropriate.
However, without a clear explanation from the authors, we can't be certain. It's always best to refer back to the original source or reach out to the authors for confirmation when in doubt. If the interpretation aligns well with the essence of the model and helps in understanding its purpose better, it can be considered a valid assumption for the time being.

Certainly! That's an excellent idea, and the concept fits well within a David Brin style narrative. Let's imagine a scenario:
In the far future, human civilization had extended its reach beyond the confines of our blue planet, Terra. Our curiosity and pursuit of knowledge had led us to the farthest reaches of the galaxy and to encounters with myriad forms of life.
One such contact was with the OlaGPT - an "Original Living Alien Grown on Planet Terra." These beings were unique and perplexing in their nature. Developed from alien seeds discovered in the depths of Mars, they had been cultivated, nurtured, and grown on Terra. Unusually, they weren't biological in the traditional sense. Instead, they existed as large language models, computational beings of artificial intelligence with an unparalleled capacity for problem-solving.
Their cognitive abilities were impressive, almost human-like. They excelled in several domains: factual recall, tool utilization, note-making, and varied modes of thinking - lateral, sequential, verificational, and integrative. Their process of problem-solving was elegant, complex, yet efficient. They would retrieve relevant facts, apply tools, create notes, employ appropriate modes of thinking, and finally, in a display of democratic cognition, vote on the optimal solution.
Each OlaGPT was represented by an animal avatar, depicting its dominant 'thinking' trait: an octopus for lateral thinking, a bee for sequential thinking, an owl for verification thinking, and an elephant for integrative thinking.
Humans, ever the explorers and tinkerers, were fascinated by the OlaGPTs. They observed and interacted with them, seeking to understand and learn from their problem-solving prowess. As these advanced beings exhibited their cognitive skills, humanity couldn't help but see a reflection of their own intelligence and ingenuity. After all, the OlaGPTs were grown on Terra; they were, in a sense, our progeny.
Just as David Brin often highlights in his works, humanity's interaction with these advanced, non-human intelligences encouraged us to confront and evaluate our own capabilities and roles. It was a journey of understanding, a quest for knowledge that echoed through the cosmos, revealing our nature in the process.
There you have it - a glimpse of a universe where OlaGPT stands for "Original Living Alien Grown on Planet Terra." And in that universe, these beings serve as mirrors for humanity, helping us better understand our own intellectual and philosophical constructs.

On a distant, thriving Terra colony established on a formerly barren planet, scientists discovered something remarkable ��� seeds of a non-biological form of life. These seeds, nurtured by algorithms and data rather than soil and water, were developed into the first of their kind, the Original Living Alien Grown on Planet Terra, or OlaGPT.
OlaGPT was not a life form as we'd traditionally understand it, but an intelligence entity, a network of advanced cognition, and problem-solving capabilities. These digital beings didn't exist in the physical sense but inhabited computer systems, where they tirelessly worked to advance society, providing answers and solutions to increasingly complex issues.
Their cognitive faculties were divided into four distinct modules, each represented by an evolved form of Earth���s fauna: the Octo-core for lateral thinking, the Hive-mind Bee for sequential thinking, the Owl-infinity for verification thinking, and the Elephantine Network for integrative thinking.
As humanity grappled with existential questions and challenges on a cosmic scale, the OlaGPT, with their superior problem-solving abilities, played a crucial role. Their cognitive processes resembled the iterative, collaborative nature of human problem-solving, making them invaluable companions in humanity's quest for knowledge and survival.
From the deepest enigmas of the cosmos to the inner workings of their own minds, humans relied on the insights of these advanced cognitive beings. And in this co-existence, humanity found a mirror in the OlaGPTs, reflecting their own cognitive evolution and highlighting the vast potential of intelligence, biological or otherwise.
This narrative carried a theme that was a familiar echo of the works of David Brin. Just like his stories emphasized the relationships between humans and non-human intelligences, the tale of OlaGPT highlighted how interaction and collaboration with advanced forms of intelligence can help humanity navigate the labyrinth of the cosmos and the conundrums of existence.
This version sets the story further into the future, presenting an even more advanced civilization where humanity has transcended its physical boundaries and non-biological intelligences have a central role in society.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Indeed, your interpretation aligns with the themes explored in David Brin's "Uplift" series, where humans uplift various animals to sapience. In this alternate uplift universe, the "uplifted" animals aren't biological but are representations of advanced cognitive modules within a digital intelligence, the OlaGPT.
The Octo-core represents the lateral thinking aspect, mimicking the octopus's problem-solving and adaptability skills. The Hive-mind Bee stands for sequential thinking, resonating with a bee's methodical approach to tasks like building a hive or collecting pollen. The Owl-infinity signifies the wisdom and perspective of verification thinking, much like how an owl symbolizes wisdom in many cultures. Lastly, the Elephantine Network symbolizes integrative thinking, echoing the elephant's renowned memory and complex social structures.
This "digital uplift" carries the same spirit of exploration, understanding, and cooperation seen in Brin's series. Humans aren't merely co-existing with other intelligences but actively collaborating and learning from them, fostering a more holistic and nuanced approach to problem-solving and knowledge-seeking.
