A summary: Abstract 
Quantum Energy Teleportation provides a testbed for modern ideas involving the inter- 
play between quantum correlations and energy in the quantum thermodynamical regime. 
In this work, we provide a new class of Quantum Energy Teleportation protocols optimized 
for harnessing maximal amounts of correlations between subsystems. We also construct 
new measurement protocols for quantum i elds which provide signif i cant improvements 
for entanglement harvesting. Finally, we construct an ef i cient formalism for computing

The abstract of Guillaume Verdon-Akzam's thesis, "Probing Quantum Fields: Measurements and Quantum Energy Teleportation," discusses three key contributions in the realm of quantum physics:
Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) Protocols
: The thesis introduces a new class of QET protocols, focusing on optimizing them to harness maximum quantum correlations between different subsystems. This development is significant in the study of quantum thermodynamics, where the interplay between quantum correlations and energy is a central theme.
Measurement Protocols for Quantum Fields
: The work presents new measurement protocols for quantum fields, which offer significant improvements in entanglement harvesting. Entanglement harvesting is the process of extracting quantum entanglement from fields, and these new protocols likely enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of this process.
Formalism for Energy Changes in Quantum Field Theory
: Finally, the thesis develops an efficient formalism to compute changes in energy due to localized interactions within quantum field theory. This formalism is crucial for understanding how energy behaves at the quantum level, particularly in response to interactions in a quantum field.
Overall, the thesis makes substantial contributions to quantum field theory, particularly in understanding and utilizing quantum energy and correlations, as well as improving measurement techniques in this complex field.

Chapter 1 
Introduction 
The relation between energy and information has intrigued physicists for quite some time 
now.Usually, we speak of such a relation in the context of thermodynamics or black 
hole physics. Recently, quite a bit of work has been interested in the thermodynamics of 
spacetime itself[37, 14], and on emergent holographic spacetimes [54]. Understanding the 
relation between energy, information and geometry is the 21st century holy grail of physics. 
The overall focus of this thesis is just that; the interplay between energy and correla- 
tions. We approach the topics from multiple dif f erent angles. 
One of the common themes is the coupling of probe systems to certain subsystems of 
a correlated quantum systems in order to achieve an energetic or information theoretic 
gain. We will cover how measurements, entanglement harvesting, and quantum energy 
teleportation af f ect quantum i elds and harmonic lattices. 
Probes are ���windows��� into the behaviour of a certain system. They can be very useful 
to understand certain phenomena in quantum i eld theory, as they ef f ectively reduce the 
dimensionality (Hilbert-space-wise) of the problem. They are an indispensable tool for the 
study of Relativistic Quantum Information. 
Thus, because probing i elds is quite important, we develop a theory for the decompo- 
sition of the Hilbert space into ���windows���, or rather, algebras of smeared i eld observables. 
See sec. 5.2. One of the most useful results is the expression of the Hamiltonian of the 
i eld with respect to such smeared obseervables. Ef f ectively, multi-page calculations with 
multivariate Gaussian and Fourier integrals simplify to taking a few simple commutators. 
Once we are armed with this tool, we apply it to the study of measurement of such 
smeared observables (5.3.2) using a continuous-variable adaptation of a quantum com- 
puting algorithm known as phase estimation. We introduce the original algorithm in our quantum information background section, while the continuous-variable variant is intro- 
duced in chapter 4. 
In the chapter 3, we introduce the protocol of quantum energy teleportation. We cover 
the basic case of the minimal QET protocol and we write down a general algoithm for QET 
which uses multi-observable correlations in order to optimize the teleportation of energy. 
In chapter 4, we apply this algorithm to a lattice of harmonic oscillators, and later on, in 
chapter 6 we port over this same calculation to QFT, using our Hamiltonian of smeared 
observables formalism. 
Further on, we apply what we learned about the tensor factors of Hilbert space corre- 
sponding to smeared observables to ef f ectively coherently swap quantum information from 
a probe system to a subspace of the i eld. We cover this for a continuous-variable probe 
and also a set of qubits which ef f ectively ���digitize��� a subspace of the i eld. We then use 
this to harvest entanglement from the vacuum in section 5.4.3. 
Finally, in our future works section, we consider how one could i nd the Schmidt basis, 
i.e. the basis of a Hilbert space for an entangled state across a bipartition, for a quantum 
i eld���s bipartition of the Hilbert space into a spherical region and its complement. By 
adapting some recent litterature [37], we are able to ef f ectively i nd the set of modes 
for the quantum i eld such that the mode decomposition of the state gives the Schmidt 
decomposition.

ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's define some of the complex terms from the chapter summary:
Quantum Field Theory (QFT)
: A theoretical framework that combines classical field theory, special relativity, and quantum mechanics. It's used to construct physical models of subatomic particles and their interactions.
Hilbert Space
: A mathematical concept used in quantum mechanics. It's an abstract vector space equipped with an inner product, providing a framework for discussing the quantum states of a system.
Entanglement Harvesting
: The process of extracting quantum entanglement from a quantum field. Entangled particles are those whose states are interdependent, no matter the distance separating them.
Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET)
: A theoretical concept where energy is transmitted across a distance without moving the physical particles themselves. This relies on quantum entanglement and measurements.
Smeared Field Observables
: In quantum field theory, observables are physical quantities that can be measured. 'Smeared' refers to a technique where these quantities are averaged or integrated over a region of space-time, helping to deal with infinities in quantum field theory.
Phase Estimation Algorithm
: A quantum algorithm used for estimating the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenstate of a unitary operator. It's crucial in many quantum computing applications.
Continuous-Variable System
: In quantum information, this refers to systems where observables, like position and momentum, can take on a continuous range of values, as opposed to discrete variables like in quantum bits (qubits).
Schmidt Decomposition
: A mathematical form used in quantum mechanics to describe the state of a composite quantum system as a sum of product states. It's useful for understanding entanglement.
Quantum Information Theory
: A branch of science and mathematics that deals with how quantum systems can be used for storing, transmitting, and processing information.
Relativistic Quantum Information
: A field of study that combines quantum information theory with the principles of relativity, often dealing with how information is processed in the context of space-time and gravity.
These terms are fundamental to understanding advanced concepts in quantum physics and quantum information science.

Background: Quantum Information 
In this chapter we provide a brief review of a few concepts from Quantum Information 
theory and Quantum Computing which are essential for understanding the contents of this 
thesis. 
Most of the content on quantum information theory and quantum computing covered 
in this chapter can be found in Nielsen & Chuang [51] and Wilde [72]. For the Gaussian 
state formalism, we mainly use work by Adesso [1]. For quantum error correction, we use 
Gottesman���s work [24]. 
2.1Quantum Information Theory Essentials 
It will be assumed that the readers of this thesis have a good background on the basics of 
quantum information theory. Thus section is mostly a collection of useful formulas which 
we include for convenience. 
2.1.1Information Theoretic Measures 
Shannon Entropy 
Consider a random classical variable X with a certain probability distribution over out- 
comes p(x) = Pr(x = X), then the measure of entropy, sometimes called the Shannon 
3 
entropy, is def i ned as1 H(X) ��� X 
x ���p(x)log(p(x)).(2.1) 
In some sense the entropy is a measure of uncertainty in a random variable. 
Here is a rough sketch of how this concept applies to certain situations: say we have an 
alphabet X and for any given message there is a probability p(x) that a given letter X is 
x. Then, if we consider how one could optimally encode this alphabet as binary, then we 
can assign more bits to less likely letters, and less bits to the more frequently used letters. 
If we want the same number of bits for each letter on average, since they occur at a rate of 
1/p(x), and n bits can cover 2nletters, then we use n = log2(1/p(x)) bits per letter. Then, 
the entropy is simply the expectation value of the number of bits, P 
xp(x)log2(1/p(x)), 
hence, asymptotically, we hit a rate of transmission of information equal to the Shannon 
entropy of our variable.

Von Neumann entropy 
Now, the generalization of the Shannon entropy to quantum systems is called the Von 
Neumann entropy. Given some density operator ��, def i ned on some Hilbert space HA, 
the 
Von Neumann entropy is given by S(A)����� ���tr(��log(��)).(2.2) 
As the density operator is self-adjoint and positive semi-def i nite2, taking a logarithm 
makes sense in the eigenbasis of ��, say 
�� = X 
x px|xihx|(2.3) 
then log�� = X 
x log(px)|xihx| =��� �����log�� = X 
x ���pxlog(px)|xihx| 
=��� ���tr(��log��) = X 
x ���pxlog(px) 
(2.4) 
and we recognize the Shannon entropy. Thus, the Von Neumann entropy is simply the 
Shannon entropy of the spectrum of the density matrix.

The entanglement entropy for a bipartite pure state ��AB��� |��ih��|ABis 
given by the Von 
Neumann entropy of either marginal S(A)��= S(B)��.(2.5)

this is called the Schmidt decomposition of the state. 
We can def i ne the coherent information [72] as 
I(AiB)����� H(B)����� H(AB)����� ���H(A|B)(2.7) 
it is the negative of the conditional quantum entropy, that is, the negative of the entropy 
of A given B. For entangled states, the conditional quantum entropy is negative, hence 
the coherent quantum information is positive. The coherent information is also a measure 
of two-way distillable entanglement, where entanglement distillation is a protocol where 
one gathers many copies of weakly entangled pairs and performs a projective measurement 
onto a typical subspace of the ensemble. The result is a set of ���distilled��� pairs. Two-way 
distillable means that the version of the protocol used to distill entanglement used two-way 
communication.

Overall, these concepts are crucial for understanding the characteristics of entangled states in quantum information theory and for performing operations like entanglement distillation in quantum computing and quantum communication processes.

Mutual Information 
Before we get to the all-important mutual information, let us def i ne the relative entropy 
i rst, D(��||��) ��� tr(��(log�� ��� log��)).(2.8) 
Note that the relative entropy is similar to a distance measure on the space of density 
operators. 
Now, we can then def i ne the mutual information as the distance away from uncorrelated 
a given state is, 
I(A;B)��= D(��AB||��a��� ��B) 
= H(A)��+ I(AiB)��= 
H(A)��+ H(B)����� H(AB)��.(2.9)

Consider a bipartite Hilbert space HA��� HB, 
and a density operator on this Hilbert 
space, ��AB. Let ��Aand ��Bdenote the marginal density operators A and B (e.g., ��A��� 
trB(��AB)). Note that the mutual information [14] bounds correlations 
I(A : B) = S(��AB||��A��� ��B)

where and so, for any operators on A and B, the mutual information gives a bound for the 
correlation function between these operators. 
Thus, as we will see, if we have a protocol which relies on correlations of observables, 
then the mutual information will give us a good idea of the maximal ef i cacy of such a 
protocol. This will be the case for QET.

Application in Protocols
: In quantum information theory, mutual information is crucial for understanding the efficacy of protocols based on correlations of observables, such as Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET). It gives an upper limit on the effectiveness of these protocols by quantifying the available correlations.
In summary, mutual information is a key concept in quantum information theory, representing the total correlations within a quantum system. It plays a vital role in understanding and evaluating the performance of quantum protocols that rely on these correlations.

Stinespring and Kraus Form 
If we average over measurement results of POVM���s, we get the Kraus form for a quantum

Note that any quantum channel can always be represented as unitary on a larger Hilbert 
space, with ancillary inputs, and then some of the outputs are traced out. This is called 
the Stinespring form. Note that this extension is not necessarily unique. 
As we will see, we will cover the phase estimation algorithm, which ef f ectively imple- 
ments a POVM on some target system. In some cases, it is a projective PVM, but in other 
case it is only projective in a certain limit (lots of qubits in the algorithm). 
This is essentially what we will use for QET, instead of looking at the problem from 
the POVM formalism, we will Stinespring dilate to the phase estimation algorithm.

The section on measurement in the thesis discusses two key concepts in quantum measurement theory: Positive Operator-Valued Measure (POVM) and Stinespring and Kraus Form. These concepts are crucial for understanding quantum measurements and their effects on quantum states.

This is often used to describe the evolution of quantum states in open quantum systems.
Stinespring Dilation
: Any quantum channel can be represented as a unitary operation on a larger Hilbert space that includes ancillary inputs. Some of the outputs are then traced out (ignored), which is known as Stinespring dilation. This form is not necessarily unique and provides a way to visualize non-unitary quantum channels as part of a larger unitary process.
Application in Quantum Algorithms
: These forms are particularly relevant for understanding the implementation of quantum algorithms like phase estimation. For Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET), instead of directly employing the POVM formalism, the approach involves Stinespring dilation to the phase estimation algorithm.
These concepts in quantum measurement theory play a pivotal role in understanding how quantum states are affected by measurements and how information is extracted from them in quantum computing and information processing.

2.2Qudits & The Quantum Fourier Transform 
2.2.1Qudits 
Qubit Paulis 
Pauli matrices play a central role for qubits. They span the Lie algebra3su(2) , and can be 
seen as a set of unitary gates which form a basis for the space of 2��2 Hermitian matrices4. 
Unfortunately, for higher dimensions, there is not a single set of matrices which can 
play all these roles. In this section we will review some of the generalizations of the Pauli 
matrices which individually accomplish these roles for Hilbert spaces of dimension d > 2. 
We begin with the Heisenberg-Weyl group. 
Heisenberg-Weyl 
Let us consider a i rst set of generalized Pauli matrices, often called the Weyl (or Heisenberg- 
Weyl operators [9, 70], these act on the Hilbert space H = Cd. The generalized Pauli Z

where the eigenbasis of Z, {|ji|j ��� Zd} is the standard basis of Cd, 
and where �� is the dth 
root of unity: �� ��� e2��i/d.(2.16) 
The generalized Pauli X matrix, or shift matrix, is def i ned as 
X = 
d���1 X 
j=0 |[j + 1]dihj|(2.17) 
where [��]ddenotes 
the equivalence class modulo d of a given integer. We see that it cycles 
through the eigenstates of Z, which is why Z is the clock; where the arrow of the clock is 
pointing, while the X matrix is a clockwise tick of the clock. This tick is in contrast with 
usual raising (or lowering) operators in quantum mechanics, which annihilates states that 
are of the maximum eigenvalue, while this X operator makes the value wrap around.5We 
will come back to this shortly.

The shift matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation called the Quantum 
Fourier Transform F���XF = Z,(2.18) 
where in the above the unitary change of basis matrix F is called the quantum Fourier 
transform. 
This unitary operation, is the gate that maps 
F : |ji 7���

���d 
d���1 X 
k=0 �����jk|ki(2.19) 
hence can be represented in matrix form in the standard basis as 
F =

���d 
d���1 X 
k=0 �����jk|kihj|.(2.20) 
5This is akin to how dif f erent systems in classical computing treat ���integer overf l ow���, that is, when a 
calculation exceeds the maximum number value, say d = 2nfor n bits, either the computer returns an 
error (like a null eigenvalue in our case) or the computer takes the number modulo d.

The eigenstates of the X matrix are given by 
|xji ���

k=0 �����jk|ki = F |ji(2.21) 
and the eigendecomposition of X is given by 
X =

X 
j=0 ��j|xjihxj|.(2.22) 
We see that both matrices share the same spectrum which consists of all the dthroots 
of unity, {��j= e2��ij/d|j ��� Zd}. This tells us that Xd= 
Zd= I, and that the clock and 
shift matrices can be viewed as displacement operators on a toroidal lattice Zd�� Zd[70] 
whose set of points, W ��� {e�����iab/dZaXb|a,b ��� Zd}, forms the so-called Heisenberg-Weyl 
group. 
Note that, in contrast to the qubit Paulis, these are not self-adjoint (Hermitian) oper- 
ators. In fact, they are unitary transformations, hence are rather the exponentials of some 
Hermitian generators. In the next subsection we will see what are the Hermitian genera- 
tors of these matrices, and brief l y mention how these generators appear in physical systems.

It provides the theoretical foundation for understanding how quantum states are manipulated in these systems, a critical aspect of the thesis' exploration of quantum energy teleportation and measurement protocols.

Sure, let's break down the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and its relation to qudits in a more simplified manner:
Qudits
: A qudit is like a quantum bit (qubit) but with more than two possible states. While a qubit can be in a state of 0, 1, or a superposition of both, a qudit has
d
d
d
states (where
d
d
d
is greater than 2). It's a more general form of a quantum state.
Generalized Pauli Matrices for Qudits
:
Clock Matrix (Z)
: This matrix changes the phase of each state in a qudit.
Shift Matrix (X)
: This matrix "shifts" each state to the next one. For example, it turns state 0 into state 1, state 1 into state 2, and so on, wrapping around back to state 0 after the last state.
Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)
:
What It Does
: The QFT is a transformation used in quantum computing that changes the way a qudit is described, from one set of states to another.
Relation to Shift Matrix
: The QFT can transform the Shift Matrix into the Clock Matrix. This is a bit like changing the perspective from which you view the states of a qudit.
Eigenstates and Eigendecomposition
:
Eigenstates of X
: These are special states that, when the Shift Matrix is applied to them, they simply change by a factor (like getting multiplied by a number) instead of getting shifted.
Eigendecomposition of X
: This is a way of expressing the Shift Matrix as a combination of its eigenstates and the effects they have.
Heisenberg-Weyl Group
:
This is a mathematical concept that encompasses the Clock and Shift matrices. It represents a set of operations you can perform on the states of a qudit.
In simpler terms, the section describes how qudits work in quantum computing, especially focusing on how certain matrices (like the Clock and Shift matrices) are used to manipulate them. The Quantum Fourier Transform is a crucial tool that allows us to change our perspective on these states and is vital for many quantum computing operations.

A useful property is that the linear combinations of elements in the Heisenberg-Weyl 
group actually span the space of d �� d matrices [9], and because these matrices are trace- 
less (apart from the identity) and unitary, W forms an orthonormal basis with respect to 
the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product6. This means that given any matrix operation on a 
qudit, such as a general set of POVM operations, say {Mj}j, 
we can decompose Mjand 
represent it as a superposition of elements in W: Mj= P 
kcjkWk where {Wk}k��� W and 
cjk��� tr(MjW 
��� 
k). 
Also note that when d is a prime number, the Z eigenbasis, and the XZm, m = 
0,...,d ��� 1 eigenbases are all mutually unbiased [8], e.g., 
|hj|xki|2= 
1 
d ��� j,k.(2.23) 
This gives us an example of how measuring in the wrong basis can result in no information 
gained about a state; measuring an X eigenstate in the Z basis gives a uniformly random 
result. 
6Hilbert-Schmidt inner product: hA,Bi ��� tr(AB���) 
 
Finally, an important feature of these matrices is that they obey the following braiding 
relation ZX = ��XZ = e2��i/dXZ.(2.24)

Traceless and Unitary

Spin vs. spin-like generators 
Now, as mentioned above, the Heisenberg-Weyl matrices are actually unitaries which are 
not self-adjoint (Hermitian). Because they are unitaries, they necessarily have Hermitian 
generators. As it turns out, the Z (phase) matrix is generated by a spin-like operator, 
J ��� 
d���1 X 
k=0 k |kihk|,where 
e2��iJ/d= Z.(2.25) 
If we compare it to the spin operators we see in physics, it is like a the spin matrix of 
a ���spin-(d ��� 1)/2 particle���, i.e. a d-dimensional representation of a generator of SU(2). If 
we let s ��� (d ��� 1)/2, then we can write7 
Jz= 
s X 
k=���s k |zkihzk|(2.26) 
as the spin operator. Suppose we would like to compare the two generators, suppose we 
let |zki ��� |k + (d ��� 1)/2i, then 
J = (d���1) 
2 I + �� 
J =��� 
�� 
J = J ��� 
(d���1) 
2 I.(2.27) 
Thus, for any unitary exponentiation of �� 
J instead of Z, 
e2��i�� 
�� 
J/d = e2��i(d���1)��/de2��iJ/d(2.28) 
we get an extra phase. This phase is important in the case of interactions, hence, when 
we will make use of a ���spin-like��� operator for any qudits we use, we will be referring to �� 
J 
and not J. 
Finally, to avoid confusion, note that although the z-spin operator from quantum me- 
chanics, �� 
J, is related to the generator of Z, note that the logarithm of the shift matrix X 
7For d even, it is to be understood that the index of the of the sum are half-integer valued, and

Certainly! Let's use some metaphors and analogies to explain these complex quantum concepts:
1. Spin vs. Spin-like Generators
Music Notes and Octaves Analogy
:
Imagine the
Z matrix
as a keyboard where each key represents a different note. Pressing a key (applying the Z matrix) changes the pitch (phase) of the music note (quantum state). The
J operator
is like the mechanism inside the keyboard that causes this change in pitch. Just like each key on the keyboard corresponds to a note, each level in the J operator corresponds to a different state in the Z matrix.
The

2. Quantum Mechanics Spin Operators vs. Heisenberg-Weyl Group Operators
Library Bookshelf Analogy
:
Think of quantum states as books arranged on a circular bookshelf. The
X operator
in the Heisenberg-Weyl group acts like a mechanism that moves each book to the next position on the shelf. Once a book reaches the end of the shelf, it gets moved back to the beginning, creating a continuous cycle.
On the other hand, the quantum mechanical

is like a librarian who moves books up the shelf, one position at a time. However, when reaching the top, instead of moving the book back to the bottom, the librarian removes it from the shelf entirely (annihilating the top state).
3. Unitary Matrices and Their Hermitian Generators
Clock Hands Analogy
:
The
unitary matrices
in the Heisenberg-Weyl group can be thought of as the hands of a clock. The motion of the clock hands (changes in the quantum state) is smooth and continuous (reflecting the unitary nature of the transformation).
The
Hermitian generators
(like
J

\tilde{J}
J

is like adjusting the gears slightly, causing the clock hands to move at a slightly different pace.
These metaphors help to visualize and understand the abstract concepts of spin and spin-like generators, the behavior of quantum states under different operators, and the nature of unitary transformations in the quantum realm.

Of course, let's revisit the musical chairs analogy to explain these quantum concepts:
Musical Chairs Analogy for the Heisenberg-Weyl Group and Spin Operators
The X Operator (Shift Matrix) and Musical Chairs
:
Imagine a game of musical chairs where each chair represents a different quantum state in the qudit system. The
X operator
acts like the music in this game. When the music plays (the operator is applied), everyone moves to the next chair in the circle. Once a player reaches the last chair and the music plays again, they move back to the first chair, creating a continuous loop. This is like the cyclic nature of the X operator, shifting states in a loop.
The Z Operator (Clock Matrix) and Changing Music
:
In the same game, let's say the type of music playing (classical, jazz, rock, etc.) affects how the players feel while sitting in their chairs (their quantum state). The
Z operator
is like changing the genre of music, altering the "state" (mood) of the players in each chair. The J operator is the DJ's control panel, determining what music plays.
The Spin-like Operator

Now, consider a variation of musical chairs where, in addition to moving to the next chair, each player also wears a hat that changes color every time the music plays. This hat-changing represents the additional phase introduced by the
spin-like operator
J

2.2.2The Quantum Fourier transform for qubits 
It is well-known that the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces of n qubits results in an 
exponentially large global Hilbert space, i.e. H ��� Nn 
j=1Hj ��� 
= C2 n. Hence, one can have a 
qudit Hilbert space of dimension d with only log2d qubits. 
Note that for the qudit representation, the Fourier transform mapped states as 
|ji 7��� 
1 
���d 
d���1 X 
k=0 e���2��ijk/d|ki(2.29) 
and so, for a set of n qubits isomorphically equivalent to a 2ndimensional qudit, it can be 
shown [51] that, 
|ji 7��� 
1 
���d 
d���1 
X 
k=0 e���2��ijk/d|ki ��� 
= 2���n/2(|0i+e���2��i0.jn|1i)(|0i+e���2��i0.jn���1jn |1i)...(|0i+e���2��i0.j1...jn|1i) 
(2.30) 
where j = j12n���1+ ... + jn20is the binary representation of the qudit state j. 
The Fourier transform for qubits can be applied in a polynomial number of gates. These 
gates are mostly Hadamard gates and controlled-rotations. 
To understand controlled phase gates, consider a qubit A, which will serve as the control 
register, and a qubit B, which will be the target. Then consider a generator of this unitary 
given by gAB= ��21���n|1ih1|A��� |1ih1|B(2.31) 
then UAB(��) ��� e���igAB��= |0ih0|A��� I + |1ih1|A��� (|0ih0|B+ 
e���2��i��/2 
n |1ih1|B).(2.32) 
8Colloquially, Z and X are to a clock what Jz and J+are to a i nite-length ruler, both with a total 
of d ticks (picture the eigenvalues of Z and Jzin the complex plane). For d = 2 (qubits), since there are 
only two points (eigenvalues ��1), then one can consider it to be like a two-tick clock or a two-tick ruler. 
11 
By tuning the �� parameter depending on which qubit is interactng with which, we can use 
such gates to achieve the quantum Fourier transform. 
Essentially, a set of qubits can emulate a qudit efficiently, with suf i cient control of the 
qubits.

In this section, the thesis discusses the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) for qubits, particularly how a set of qubits can emulate a qudit and how the QFT is implemented in this context. Let's simplify these concepts:

Implementation of QFT in Qubits

Polynomial Number of Gates
: The QFT for qubits can be implemented using a polynomial number of quantum gates, primarily Hadamard gates (for creating superpositions) and controlled rotations (for adding phase differences).
Controlled Phase Gates
: These gates involve a control qubit and a target qubit, where the state of the control qubit determines the operation applied to the target. The operation includes rotations which add phase shifts, crucial for the QFT.
Tuning for QFT
:
Adjusting Parameters
: By adjusting the parameter

in the controlled phase gates depending on which qubits are interacting, the QFT can be achieved. This involves careful control of the phase shifts introduced in each step.
Efficiency in Emulating Qudits
:
Efficient Emulation
: With sufficient control, a set of qubits can efficiently emulate a qudit, allowing for complex quantum computations using a manageable number of qubits.
Metaphor for Understanding
Think of a qubit system like a choir. Each singer (qubit) can sing either a low or high note (binary state). When they sing together, they can create a vast range of harmonies (the large Hilbert space). The QFT is like a conductor who arranges the choir to sing a complex piece of music (quantum state transformation) where each singer's note affects the others' (entanglement and phase relationships). This coordinated effort allows the choir to perform sophisticated compositions (complex quantum operations) with just a few singers (qubits), rather than needing one singer for each note in the piece (a direct representation of a qudit state).

2.3Phase estimation Algorithm 
The phase estimation algorithm [51] involves performing a measurement on a certain target 
system by using ancillary qubits and a unitary interaction to perform a POVM. We will use 
this algorithm and its variants throughout this thesis, hence we will introduce it properly 
here. 
2.3.1Algorithm 
The phase estimation essentially relies on the property of qudits that F���ZF = X, that 
is, a phase matrix Z = Pd���1 
j=0e 
2��ij/d |jihj|, gets converted to a cyclical shift of the state 
X = Pd���1 
j=0|[j + 1]dihj|. Note that n qubits are isomorphic to the Hilbert space of of a 2 
n 
dimensional qudit, and that we can perform the qudit equivalent of the Fourier transform 
ef i ciently on a set of n qubits. 
Now, consider a controlled-phase gate, like those that are used in the quantum Fourier 
transform. Suppose we have t ancillary qubits, then suppose we do controlled-unitaries, but 
instead of having each unitary being generated by the Pauli phase gate (��z), the unitaries 
are generated by a general observable in the target register. That is, consider unitaries of 
the form U = exp ?i2�� 
d |1ih1| ��� O?= 
|0ih0| ��� I + |1ih1| ��� e���i 
2�� 
d O (2.33) 
then, if the control register is in a uniform phaseless superposition of computational basis 
states, i.e. an X eigenstate of eigenvalue 1, eigenstate; |+i, and say the target register is 
in an eigenstate |��i of O of eigenvalue ��, then 
U |+i|��i = 
1 
���2 ?|0i|��i 
+ |1ie���i2��O |��i?= 
1 
���2 ?|0i|��i 
+ e���i2���� |1i|��i?(2.34) 
and we see that we we get an entangled state. 
Now, if we scale up this intuition, consider the unitary 
Ut= 
t���1 Y 
k=0 
exp ?���2��i2k 
|1ih1|k��� O?(2.35) 
12 
acting on a tensor product of |+i states, 
Ut|+i���t|��i = 
t���1 Y 
k=0 
exp ?���2��i2k 
|1ih1|k��� O?|+i���t|��i 
= 
1 
2t/2 
2t���1 
X 
k=0 e���2��i��k|ki|��i(2.36) 
where by |ki we mean its binary representation on the t control qubits. Now, for �� ��� Z, 
we can recognize the above state as |x��i, hence if we apply the inverse quantum Fourier 
transform to go back to the computational basis, we get 
(F������ I)Ut|+i���t|��i = F���|x��i|��i = |��i|��i.(2.37) 
and so measuring the control registers gives us the binary representation of ��. 
Figure 2.1: Circuit diagram for the quantum phase estimation algorithm. The last register 
represents the target register, made of some state on m qubits. The states of the ancillary 
qubits are initialize in the computational default state. Following this a transversal (many 
qubits in parallel) Hadamard is applied on the probes to put them in a uniform phaseless 
superposition of all bit strings. Then, the controlled-unitaries are applied, they allow for 
a target-state dependent phase to ���kick back��� (from the target to the control). Next, the 
inverse Fourier transform is applied to convert the picked up phase into bit l ips. Finally, 
a projective measurement in the standard basis is applied.

The section on the Phase Estimation Algorithm in the thesis provides a detailed explanation of how this important algorithm in quantum computing works. Let's break it down with a simpler explanation and an analogy:
2.3 Phase Estimation Algorithm
Basic Concept
Purpose
: The phase estimation algorithm is used to measure the phase (or eigenvalue) of a quantum state. It's particularly useful when you want to understand how a quantum state changes when a certain operation (represented by a unitary matrix) is applied to it.
How It Works
Setup
: You start with a set of ancillary qubits (helpers) and a target system (the main qubit or qubits you're interested in).
Creating Superposition
: The ancillary qubits are put into a superposition of all possible states using Hadamard gates. This is like setting up a row of spinning coins where each coin is spinning in a way that it's both heads and tails at the same time.
Controlled-Unitaries
: Then, you apply controlled-unitary operations. These operations are controlled by the ancillary qubits and affect the target system. The unitary operation encodes the phase information onto the ancillary qubits.
Entangled State
: The interaction between the ancillary and target qubits creates an entangled state, where the state of the ancillary qubits depends on the phase of the target system.
Applying Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform
: After applying the controlled-unitary operations, the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is applied to the ancillary qubits. This step is like translating the complex quantum information into a more readable form.
Measurement
: Finally, by measuring the ancillary qubits, you can find out the phase of the target system. The result is the phase information encoded in a binary form.
Circuit Diagram Description
The circuit diagram for this algorithm shows the sequence of operations: initialization of ancillary qubits, application of Hadamard gates, controlled-unitaries, inverse QFT, and finally the measurement.
Analogy: Detecting a Secret Tune
Imagine you're trying to figure out a secret tune played on a piano, but you can only use a set of tuning forks (ancillary qubits). Each tuning fork can resonate with a certain note (phase) of the tune. You start by setting all the forks vibrating a little (superposition). Then, you play the secret tune (apply the unitary operation) while the forks are near the piano. Each fork picks up a certain part of the tune based on its natural frequency (phase kickback). Finally, you analyze how each tuning fork vibrated (inverse QFT and measurement) to decode the tune's notes (phase information of the quantum state).

The phase estimation algorithm is an important algorithm in quantum computation that involves measuring the phase of a quantum state. It utilizes ancillary qubits and a unitary interaction to perform a measurement known as a POVM (Positive Operator-Valued Measure). The algorithm and its variants are commonly used in various quantum computing applications.

The algorithm is based on the property of qudits, which are quantum systems with d levels. In particular, it relies on the property that a phase matrix Z, defined as Z = Pd���1���j=0 e^(2��ij/d) |jihj|, gets converted to a cyclical shift of the state X = Pd���1���j=0 |[j + 1]dihj|. Here, |jihj��� represents the computational basis state of the qudit.

In the algorithm, a controlled-phase gate is used, similar to the one used in the quantum Fourier transform. Suppose we have t ancillary qubits, and instead of using the Pauli phase gate (��z) as the controlled unitary, we use a general observable O in the target register. The unitaries have the form U = exp(-i2��/d |1ih1| ��� O + |0ih0| ��� I + |1ih1| ��� e^(-i2��O/d)). If the control register is in a uniform phaseless superposition of computational basis states (an X eigenstate of eigenvalue 1, denoted as |+i), and the target register is in an eigenstate |��i of O with eigenvalue ��, then applying the unitary U results in an entangled state.

By scaling up this intuition, we consider the unitary Ut = ���(t-1)k=0 exp(-i2��i2^k |1ih1|^k ��� O), which acts on a tensor product of |+i��� states. If we apply this unitary to |+i������t ��� |��i���, we obtain a state that can be recognized as |x��i, where x�� is the binary representation of the phase ��. By applying the inverse quantum Fourier transform (F���) to go back to the computational basis, we obtain |��i���|��i���. Therefore, by measuring the control registers, we can determine the binary representation of the phase ��.

The circuit diagram for the quantum phase estimation algorithm is shown in Figure 2.1. The target register represents the state on m qubits that we want to estimate the phase of. The ancillary qubits are initialized in the computational default state. The algorithm consists of several steps: 
1. Apply a transversal Hadamard gate to the ancillary qubits to put them in a uniform phaseless superposition of all bit strings.
2. Apply the controlled-unitaries, which allow the phase to "kick back" from the target to the control.
3. Apply the inverse Fourier transform (F���) to convert the acquired phase into bit flips.
4. Perform a projective measurement in the standard basis to obtain the binary representation of the phase.

This algorithm is widely used in quantum computation and has applications in various quantum algorithms and protocols, such as quantum simulation, quantum factoring, and quantum error correction.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Absolutely, let's break down some of the complex terms used in the Phase Estimation Algorithm (PEA) for a clearer understanding:
Qudit
:
A generalization of a qubit. While a qubit is a quantum system with 2 states (like 0 and 1), a qudit has
d
d
d
states. Think of a qubit as a coin (heads or tails) and a qudit as a dice with
d
d

faces.
Ancillary Qubits
:
These are additional qubits used in a quantum algorithm alongside the main qubits of interest. They are like helpers or assistants in an experiment, used to facilitate the process and often to hold interim results.
Phase Matrix (Z) and Shift Matrix (X)
:
Phase Matrix (Z)
: A quantum operation that changes the phase of a quantum state. For a qudit, it's represented by a matrix where each diagonal element corresponds to a different phase.
Shift Matrix (X)
: This operation shifts the state of a qudit to the next state in a cyclic manner. In the context of a dice, it's like rolling the dice to the next number.
Controlled-Phase Gate
:
A quantum gate where the action on one (target) qubit or qudit depends on the state of another (control) qubit. It's a bit like a conditional command: "If the control qubit is in state 1, then apply this operation to the target qubit."
General Observable (O)
:
In quantum mechanics, observables are physical quantities that can be measured, like position or momentum. In PEA, a general observable refers to a specific property or aspect of the quantum state you're interested in measuring.
Entangled State
:
A key feature of quantum mechanics where the state of one quantum particle is dependent on the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. In the PEA, the ancillary and target qubits become entangled, meaning their states are interconnected.
Unitary Operation
:
An operation in quantum mechanics that evolves the state of a quantum system while preserving probabilities. These operations are reversible, which is a fundamental property in quantum computing.
Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform
:
The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is a quantum version of the classical Fourier Transform and is used to convert between different quantum states. The inverse QFT essentially reverses this process, converting the quantum information back into a more classical form that can be easily read.
Binary Representation of Phase ��
:
After the PEA, the measurement results are read out in binary form, representing the phase ��. This is similar to reading a binary code (like 0101) that encodes the value of the phase.
Each of these elements plays a critical role in the execution and success of the Phase Estimation Algorithm, a cornerstone in many quantum computing applications.

2.3.2Information gain 
Now, if the initial state of the target was a superposition of integer-eigenvalued eigenstates 
of O, e.g. |��0i = X 
j ��j|��ji(2.38) 
with ��j��� Z ���j, then, by linearity of unitaries, we have 
(F������ I)Ut|+i���t|��0i = X 
j ��j|��ji|��ji(2.39) 
13 
an entangled state between the control and the target, with the Schmidt decomposition 
being in the eigenbasis of O. Thus, in this case we get an entanglement entropy 
SAB= ��� X 
j |��j|2log2(|��j|2),(2.40) 
which is equal to the Shannon entropy of the measurement outcomes if we were to measure 
the target register���s O observable by a direct projective measurement. In some sense the 
ancillary system gained an amount of information about the target equal to the entangle- 
ment entropy. 
We considered performing the phase estimation algorithm for a certain observable O 
with a discrete i nite integer valued spectrum. Suppose we have a state |��i for which the 
�� 6��� Z. Then, applying the phase estimation algorithm, we get 
(F������ I)Ut|+i���t|��i ��� |�� ��i|��i(2.41) 
where |�� ��i is a good approximate value to |��i. Essentially, the more bits we use, the larger 
the spread over which we have our probe state, and hence when we Fourier transform it 
the more spread it was (more qubits) the sharper the Fourier transform. 
In order to get an accurate n-bit readout, then we need to use t qubits, for some 
t > n, to run the algorithm, but we ignore the noisy t ��� n qubits��� readout at the end as 
it is innacurate. It can be shown [51] that, to obtain an accurate n bit readout with a 
probability of success > (1 ��� ?), we need to use at least 
t = n + dlog(2 + (2?)���1)e.(2.42) 
In this thesis, we will encounter system that have inf i nite and continuous spectra. In 
most cases we will counter the continuous with the continuous; we will use a continuous- 
variable variant of the phase estimation algorithm (which we define in the lattice QET

In this section of the thesis, the author discusses the information gain aspect of the Phase Estimation Algorithm (PEA) in quantum computing. This part is focused on how much information can be gained about a target system's state through the process of entanglement and measurement. Let's break down the key points:
2.3.2 Information Gain
Initial State of the Target System
Superposition of Eigenstates

Information Gain

were performed on the target register.
Phase Estimation with Non-Integer Values

Continuous Spectra Systems
: For systems with infinite and continuous spectra, a continuous-variable variant of the PEA is used. This variant is suitable for scenarios where discrete approaches are not feasible.
In summary, this section elaborates on how the Phase Estimation Algorithm can be used to gain information about the quantum state of a target system, focusing on the relationship between entanglement entropy and information gain, and the requirements for accurate phase estimation in both discrete and continuous spectrum scenarios.

In the case where the initial state of the target is a superposition of integer-eigenvalued eigenstates of the observable O, i.e., |��0��� = ���j ��j|��j��� with ��j ��� Z for all j, the phase estimation algorithm generates an entangled state between the control and the target. The entanglement entropy, given by S_AB = -���j |��j|^2 log2(|��j|^2), quantifies the amount of information gained by the ancillary system about the target. It is equal to the Shannon entropy of the measurement outcomes if we were to directly measure the observable O of the target register through a projective measurement. Thus, the entanglement entropy represents the information gained about the target.

When we apply the phase estimation algorithm to a state |����� for which �� is not an integer (�� ��� Z), we obtain an approximate value |������� instead of the exact value |�����. The accuracy of the approximation depends on the number of bits used in the algorithm. The more bits we use (larger t), the wider the spread of the probe state, and consequently, when we apply the Fourier transform, the sharper the Fourier transform becomes.

To obtain an accurate n-bit readout, we need to use t qubits, where t > n, to run the algorithm. However, the readout of the noisy t - n qubits at the end may be inaccurate and can be ignored. It has been shown that to achieve an accurate n-bit readout with a probability of success greater than (1 - ��), we need to use at least t = n + d log(2 + (2��)^-1)e qubits, where d is the dimension of the qudit. This equation (2.42) provides an estimation of the number of qubits required for accurate phase estimation.

In this thesis, the systems encountered have infinite and continuous spectra. In most cases, continuous-variable variants of the phase estimation algorithm are used to handle continuous spectra. The continuous-variable phase estimation algorithm is defined in the lattice QET (Quantum Error Correction) chapter of the thesis.

Continuous-Variable Phase Estimation for Continuous Spectra

In systems with infinite and continuous spectra, a continuous-variable variant of the PEA is employed. This adaptation is necessary to handle the continuous nature of such systems, as traditional discrete methods are not applicable.
Application in Quantum Error Correction (QET)
:
The continuous-variable phase estimation algorithm is particularly relevant in the context of lattice Quantum Error Correction (QET), as detailed in the corresponding chapter of the thesis.
In summary, the PEA is a versatile and fundamental tool in quantum computing, capable of handling both discrete and continuous systems by measuring the phase of quantum states. This algorithm not only exemplifies the intricacies of quantum mechanics but also showcases the advanced methodologies in quantum computing to extract meaningful information from quantum systems.

Entanglement Entropy - Recipe Complexity Analogy
:
Entanglement entropy can be thought of as the complexity of a recipe. Just as a recipe with many ingredients in various amounts has a certain complexity, the entanglement entropy measures the complexity (or amount of information) of the entangled state. It tells us how intricate the relationship is between the control and target systems.

, think of an artist trying to replicate a scene. If the scene is complex (non-integer phase), the artist (PEA) can still create a painting (quantum state), but it will be an approximation of the scene. The more paint colors (qubits) the artist has, the more detailed and accurate the painting can be.
Accuracy and Qubit Requirement - Puzzle Pieces Analogy
:
The need for more qubits for higher accuracy is like solving a puzzle. To get a clearer picture (accurate measurement), you need more puzzle pieces (qubits). However, some pieces (extra qubits) might be part of the sky or background (noisy data) and don't add much detail to the picture, so they can be ignored.
Continuous-Variable PEA - Weather Forecast Analogy
:
For systems with a continuous spectrum, using a continuous-variable PEA is like weather forecasting. Traditional thermometers (discrete PEA) have limited precision and can't capture every minute temperature change. But a highly sensitive thermometer (continuous-variable PEA) can measure even the smallest fluctuations, giving a more accurate and detailed weather report (quantum state measurement).
Through these analogies, the Phase Estimation Algorithm and its various aspects are likened to more familiar concepts, making the intricate quantum computing processes easier to comprehend.

2.3.3Deferred & Implicit Measurements 
Note that performing a controlled gate, then projectively measuring the control register 
in the standard basis, or the inverse order of these two are equivalent. this is known as 
the principle of deferred measurement [51]. That is, a classical controlled gate with the 
control being the result of a measurement versus a quantum control gate followed by a 
measurement yield the same i nal state.
There is also the principle of implicit measurement [51], which states that for any 
register that is not used after a certain point in the circuit, we can assume that it was 
measured. UU

Figure 2.2: A measurement followed by a classical controlled unitary dependent on that 
measurement (left) is equivalent to a quantum controlled unitary followed by a measure- 
ment. In other words, measurements commute with controls. Note the double line 
signif i es classical information (e.g. output of a measurement) while the single line means 
quantum information.

In this section, the thesis explains two important principles in quantum computing: the principle of deferred measurement and the principle of implicit measurement. Let's break these down with analogies:
2.3.3 Deferred & Implicit Measurements
Deferred Measurement Principle
Concept
: The principle of deferred measurement states that the order of measurement and controlled operations can be interchanged without affecting the final state of the system. This means a measurement followed by a controlled operation based on that measurement is equivalent to a controlled operation followed by the measurement.
Analogy
: Think of it like baking a cake (the quantum state). You have two steps: checking the recipe (measurement) and then adjusting the ingredients based on that (controlled operation), or mixing the ingredients first and then checking if it matches the recipe. In the end, you still get the same cake.
Implicit Measurement Principle
Concept
: This principle suggests that any part of a quantum system (register) that is not used after a certain point in a quantum circuit can be considered as having been measured. This is because its future state does not influence the rest of the system.
Analogy
: Imagine you're painting a picture with watercolors. Once you've finished painting a certain area and you don't plan to add anything more to it, it's as if that part is "set" or "measured". Even though you haven't explicitly sealed it with a varnish (actual measurement), its state is no longer influencing the rest of the painting.
Circuit Diagram Interpretation
In the provided circuit diagram (Figure 2.2), it illustrates that a measurement followed by a classical control (based on the measurement outcome) is equivalent to a quantum control followed by a measurement. This is a visual representation of the deferred measurement principle. The double line represents classical information flow (e.g., the output of a measurement), while the single line denotes quantum information.
These principles are crucial in quantum computing for optimizing quantum circuits and understanding the interplay between quantum and classical information. They help in simplifying complex quantum operations and in making efficient use of quantum resources.
You
The principle of deferred measurement states that performing a controlled gate followed by a projective measurement on the control register is equivalent to performing the measurement first and then applying the classical controlled gate based on the measurement outcome. In other words, a classical controlled gate with the control being the result of a measurement and a quantum controlled gate followed by a measurement yield the same final state. This principle allows for flexibility in the order of operations in a quantum circuit.

Additionally, the principle of implicit measurement states that if a register is not used or accessed after a certain point in the circuit, we can assume that it has been measured. In other words, we can treat the unobserved register as if it has undergone a measurement. This principle simplifies the analysis of quantum circuits by allowing us to consider the unobserved registers as if they have already been measured.

The concept of deferred measurement and implicit measurement is illustrated in Figure 2.2 of the thesis. The figure shows that a measurement followed by a classical controlled unitary dependent on that measurement is equivalent to a quantum controlled unitary followed by a measurement. The double line represents classical information (e.g., the output of a measurement), while the single line represents quantum information. The diagram emphasizes that measurements commute with controls in quantum circuits.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You have accurately summarized the principles of deferred measurement and implicit measurement in quantum computing. Let's highlight the key aspects of these principles for a comprehensive understanding:
Principle of Deferred Measurement
Core Idea
: This principle allows for the interchangeability of measurement and control operations in a quantum circuit without changing the final state.
Operational Flexibility
: It provides flexibility in designing quantum circuits, as the sequence of measurement and control operations can be adjusted according to convenience or efficiency.
Equivalence of Sequences
: Whether you measure first and then apply a controlled gate based on that measurement, or apply a controlled gate followed by measurement, the outcome remains the same.
Impact on Circuit Design
: This principle is particularly useful in simplifying quantum circuit designs and in theoretical analyses where deferring measurements can lead to clearer understanding of the quantum operations.
Principle of Implicit Measurement
Unobserved Registers
: If a part of the quantum circuit (a register) is not used in subsequent operations, it can be treated as if it were measured.
Simplification in Analysis
: This principle simplifies the analysis and interpretation of quantum circuits by reducing the need to explicitly consider every part of the system.
Assumption of Measurement
: Even if an actual measurement is not performed, registers not influencing the rest of the circuit can be assumed to have been measured.
Figure 2.2: Illustration of the Principles
Visual Representation
: The figure demonstrates how a measurement followed by a classical control based on the measurement is equivalent to a quantum control followed by a measurement.
Differentiation of Information Types
: The diagram uses double lines to represent classical information (resulting from measurements) and single lines for quantum information (quantum states and operations).
These principles are foundational in quantum computing, allowing for more efficient and streamlined quantum circuit designs. They also reflect the unique interplay between quantum and classical information in quantum algorithms.

Applications to QET 
Thus, if we perform the phase estimation algorithm with a certain control register (the 
ancillary register) and then use this register���s measurement result as the classical control 
for a subsequent controlled unitary, then we can defer the measurement to the end of 
the circuit, and replace the classical control with a quantum controlled unitary operation. 
Furthermore, one the measurement is deferred to the end of the circuit, there is no need 
to actually carry it out. 
Thus, for the phase estimation followed by a controlled unitary combination, we can 
let go of the measurement altogether and replace the circuit elements with their coherent 
counterpart. 
This is exactly what we will do for quantum energy teleportation; as we will see, this 
protocol relies on a measurement, followed by a classically controlled unitary dependent 
on the measurement. In this way, the protocol is LOCC; involves local operations and 
classical communication. 
In our treatment of quantum energy teleportation, we will use the alternate, but, as 
justif i ed above, equivalent version of the protocol, which is entirely coherent. Instead of 
using a POVM, we model these measurements via phase estimation and an ancillary system. 

Following this, instead of classical information being transferred from the measurement site 
to the second target site, we transfer quantum information and apply a controlled unitary, 
no measurement needed.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The application of the principles of deferred and implicit measurement in Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) is an innovative approach to streamline the process. Let's break down how these principles are utilized:
Application of Deferred Measurement in QET
Initial Process
: In the standard QET protocol, the process begins with a phase estimation algorithm using an ancillary register. The outcome of this register's measurement is then used as a classical control for a subsequent controlled unitary operation.
Deferring the Measurement
: By applying the principle of deferred measurement, this process can be restructured. The measurement of the ancillary register, initially crucial for the classical control, can be deferred to the end of the quantum circuit.
Replacing Classical Control
: With the measurement deferred, the classical control can be replaced with a quantum controlled unitary operation. This step retains the coherence of the quantum state throughout the process.
Eliminating the Need for Actual Measurement
Coherent Counterpart
: When the measurement is deferred to the end, there's often no need to actually perform it, especially if the information it was supposed to provide is no longer necessary for subsequent operations.
Simplification of Circuit
: This allows for replacing certain circuit elements with their coherent counterparts, maintaining the quantum state's integrity and potentially simplifying the circuit.
Implications for QET
LOCC Protocol
: The original QET protocol involves Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC), where a measurement is followed by a classically controlled unitary dependent on that measurement.
Coherent Version of QET
: In the revised approach, instead of using a Positive Operator-Valued Measure (POVM) and then transmitting classical information, the entire process is kept quantum coherent. Phase estimation and an ancillary system model the measurements.
Quantum Information Transfer
: Rather than transferring classical information from the measurement site to the target, quantum information is transferred directly. A controlled unitary operation is applied without the need for actual measurement.
Summary
In essence, the application of deferred and implicit measurement principles in QET allows for a more efficient and coherent quantum process. By deferring measurements and maintaining quantum coherence, the protocol becomes streamlined, potentially increasing its efficacy and simplicity. This approach exemplifies the power of quantum coherence in enhancing quantum communication protocols like QET.

2.4Continuous Variable Quantum Information 
We will use the concepts in this section profusely when dealing with the numerical calcu-

means we are assuming that its quadrature expectation values ��k��� hxki = 0 are null. 
Here we are using the notation ~ x ��� (q1,p1,q2,...,pn)T. 
Now, since a normalized Gaussian 
is uniquely specif i ed by where it is centered and how wide it is, and that we have assumed 
that our Gaussian is centered at the origin, then the so-called covariance matrix �� is single 
object that specif i es our state. To i nd the matrix elements of this ��, we compute the 
so-called second moments �� ���

What is particularly nice with Gaussian states is that since they are uniquely specif i ed 
by their i rst and second moments, then ef f ectively we are using a much smaller space than 
the full inf i nite dimensional Hilbert space to describe the states. This space is known as 
phase space, denoted ��. The phase space decomposes into direct sums for operators that 
commute. Thus, instead of scaling exponentially with the number of systems, like the 
Hilbert space, the phase space scales linearly.

In this section of the thesis, the focus is on continuous variable quantum information, specifically Gaussian states, which are crucial for numerical calculations related to the harmonic lattice. Let's simplify these concepts:
2.4 Continuous Variable Quantum Information
2.4.1 Gaussian States
What Are Gaussian States
:
Named for their Gaussian-shaped Wigner pseudoprobability function, resembling a bell curve, typically found in statistics.
They are centered at the origin in a quantum phase space, implying that their quadrature expectation values (denoted as
��
k
\mu_k
��
k
���
) are zero.
Representation and Notation

Gaussian states are represented using the notation

which includes position (

) components of the system.
The vector

effectively describes the state of the system in terms of these basic quantum variables.
Covariance Matrix (
��
\sigma

The Gaussian state is uniquely defined by its covariance matrix
��
\sigma
��
. This matrix essentially describes the 'width' or spread of the Gaussian function in the phase space.
The matrix elements of
��
\sigma
��
are computed using the second moments of the state, representing the variances and covariances of the position and momentum variables.
Commutation Relations

��
\Omega

is a matrix representing these relations, typically involving position and momentum.
Advantages of Gaussian States
:
They are defined by first and second moments, allowing them to be described in a smaller space compared to the full infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.
This smaller space, known as phase space (denoted
��
\Gamma
��
), scales linearly with the number of systems, unlike Hilbert space which scales exponentially. This makes Gaussian states more manageable for certain types of quantum computations and simulations.
Simplifying Analogies
Gaussian States and Weather Maps
:
Imagine a weather map showing temperature variations across a region. The map can be Gaussian-like with temperatures peaking at some point and gradually decreasing outward. The peak represents the center of the Gaussian state (origin), and the spread of temperatures represents the state's covariance matrix, detailing how widely temperatures vary across the region.
Phase Space Scaling and Bookshelves
:
If each quantum system is a book, then the Hilbert space is like an exponentially growing bookshelf that needs more space with each added book. In contrast, the phase space for Gaussian states is like a digital library on a computer, where adding more books (systems) only increases the space linearly, making it more manageable.
These explanations and analogies help to elucidate the nature of Gaussian states and their importance in continuous variable quantum information, particularly in contexts like the harmonic lattice.

2.4.2Gaussian Operations 
Unitaries generated by quadratic polynomials in the quadratures xj, xk, can be considered 
as Gaussian operations. Gaussian unitary operations can be represented on phase space 
by conjugating the covariance matrix and multiplying the i rst moments with the phase 
space representation of the given unitary. 

Thus, instead of conjugating a density matrix with a unitary, U�����U, we conjugate the covariance matrix with a symplectic matrix S, 
�� 7��� ST��S.(2.45) 
Matrices S are part of the symplectic group when they preserve the symplectic form 
(matrix of commutators); ST���S = ���.
 
In our work in this thesis we will often have to compute transformations of expectation 
values of certain contractions of quadratures, e.g. say we consider a change in expectation 
value an expectation value due to a symplectic transformation 
hhjkxjxki = hjk(����jk+ 
�� ��j�� ��k), �� �� ��� ST��S, �� �� ��� ST��(2.46) 
where the i rst and second moments are transformed according to the symplectic transformation. 

This will be particularly useful for our computation of changes in energy due to Gaussian 
operations in our chapter on QET in harmonic lattices.

Phase Space Representation
: These operations can be represented in phase space (a conceptual space where positions and momenta are plotted) by modifying the covariance matrix and first moments of a Gaussian state.

Importance in Quantum Energy Teleportation
Energy Changes in QET
: Understanding these Gaussian operations is crucial for calculating changes in energy during QET processes, especially in systems like harmonic lattices, which are extensively discussed in the thesis.
Simplifying Analogies
Gaussian Operations as Lenses
:
Think of a Gaussian state as a picture. A Gaussian operation is like a lens that can zoom in, out, or distort the picture. The symplectic transformation is the process of adjusting the lens to get the desired image (transformed state).
Symplectic Matrices as Mirrors
:
Consider symplectic matrices as special mirrors that can twist or turn an object's reflection (the state) without changing its basic structure (preserving the symplectic form). This mirror reflects the state in new ways but keeps its fundamental properties intact.
These explanations help to understand how Gaussian operations manipulate continuous variable quantum states, a concept central to advanced quantum computing tasks like Quantum Energy Teleportation.

Symplectic Diagonalization as Puzzle Solving

2.5Quantum Error Correction 
Quantum Error correction is a mathematical theory which describes how to hide quantum 
information in certain subspaces of a Hilbert space. Although we will not be treating this 
topic directly in the main body of the thesis, we draw multiple parallels with concepts 
underlying work that will appear later in this thesis. 
2.5.1From Hamiltonians to Subspaces 
We will approach quantum error correction from an angle more familiar to physicist, that of 
ground states of Hamiltonians. There are some proposed [40] implementations of quantum 
computing which have been considered which ef f ectively use the degenerate ground state 
space of a certain multi-qubit Hamiltonian to encode quantum information and protect it 
from noise. Such Hamiltonians look like 
H = ��� 
n���k X 
j=1 
gj,[gi,gj] = 0(2.49) 
where each gjis some tensor product of n qubit Paulis; gj��� Pn9operators, e.g. X ��� 
X ��� Z, and [gi,gj] 
= 0. Note that since each term is commuting, we can describe the 
ground state of this Hamiltonian as the tensor product of pure +1 eigenvalue eigenstates 
of each gi, tensor product with an arbitrary state for the rest of the Hilbert space |��i = 
|��codei Nn���k 
j=1 |gji.If our Hamiltonian has n ��� k such commuting terms, then we have 
specif i ed n���k eigenvalues out of a maximally commuting set of observables of n Paulis, then 
we ef f ectively have k observables left to specify in order to fully specify a unique eigenstates. 
The ���vacant space��� left in the Hilbert space is what is used to encode information, hence 
in the above case there is a possibility to encode k qubits in the degenerate ground state, 
which is what we express as |��codei. 
Such systems are part of a more general scheme for quantum error correction in quantum 
computing (theory describing how to correct for decoherence in quantum systems) called 
the stabilizer formalism [24]. The rough idea is that a certain class of states are eigenstates 
of tensor products of Paulis on n qubits. For such states, we can specify which n-qubit 
Paulis for which they are a (+1)-eigenvalue eigenstate, and the group generated by products 
of powers of these Paulis is called the Stabilizer group of a given state (for any element of 
the stabilizer group, the state is a +1 eigenvalue eigenstate. 
9or more generally Heisenberg-Weyl 18 
Thus instead of working with the state in Dirac notation, we can simply work with 
the operators for which a state is the +1 eigenvalue eigenstate. Since each Pauli can be 
specif i ed as ��� XaZb, a,b ��� Z2, 
then there are 2n bits to specify to describe each such state. 
The set of unitary transformations which map tensor products of Paulis to tensor products 
of Paulis is called the Clif f ord group. In this sense, the stabilizer states are very much like 
Gaussian states, but for discrete variables, the Clif f ord group, as represented on the vector 
space of 2n-bit strings (which themselves represent a state) is isomorphic to the symplectic 
group on 2n bits, Sp(2n,Z2). In contrast, the group of Gaussian transformations on the 
phase space of n harmonic oscillators is Sp(2n,R). We will draw many parallels between 
continuous-variable Gaussian states and stabilizer states of qubits to some gain information 
theoretic intuition.

In this section, the thesis discusses quantum error correction, a vital concept in quantum computing, particularly focusing on the relationship between Hamiltonians, subspaces, and quantum error correction techniques. Let's break down these concepts:
2.5 Quantum Error Correction
Basic Concept
Purpose
: Quantum error correction involves protecting quantum information from errors due to decoherence and other quantum noise. It's about encoding quantum information in specific subspaces of a Hilbert space to shield it from disturbances.
From Hamiltonians to Subspaces
Ground States of Hamiltonians
: The approach taken here relates to the ground states of Hamiltonians in quantum mechanics. In some quantum computing implementations, the degenerate ground state space of a multi-qubit Hamiltonian is used to encode and protect quantum information.
Hamiltonian Formulation
: The Hamiltonians considered have commuting terms, each a tensor product of qubit Paulis. The ground state of such Hamiltonians can be described as a product of eigenstates of these Pauli operators, with some portion of the Hilbert space left for encoding information.
Quantum Error Correction and Stabilizer Formalism
Stabilizer Formalism
: This is a method for quantum error correction where certain quantum states (stabilizer states) are eigenstates of tensor products of Pauli operators. The stabilizer group consists of these Pauli products, and states in this group are stable against certain types of errors.
Encoding Information
: The space left in the Hilbert space, after specifying eigenstates of the stabilizer group, is used for encoding quantum information. This space can encode a number of qubits depending on the number of commuting terms in the Hamiltonian.
Clifford and Symplectic Groups
Clifford Group
: The set of unitary transformations that map tensor products of Paulis to other tensor products of Paulis. Stabilizer states are closely related to the Clifford group, similar to Gaussian states but for discrete variables.
Isomorphism with Symplectic Group
: The Clifford group's action on bit strings (representing quantum states) is isomorphic to the symplectic group's action on a phase space, drawing a parallel between continuous-variable Gaussian states and stabilizer states of qubits.
Simplifying Analogies
Quantum Error Correction as a Safe
: Think of quantum error correction like using a safe to protect valuable items (quantum information). The safe's structure (subspace of the Hilbert space) is designed to protect against specific threats (quantum noise and decoherence).
Hamiltonians and Building Foundations
: The role of Hamiltonians in quantum error correction is akin to building a foundation for a house. Just as the foundation determines the structure and stability of the house, the Hamiltonian's ground state space determines how quantum information is encoded and protected.
Stabilizer Formalism and Musical Harmony
: The stabilizer formalism can be compared to creating a musical harmony. Each note (Pauli operator) contributes to a stable and harmonious chord (stabilizer state). When played together, they create a sound (quantum state) that is resilient to dissonance (errors).
These explanations help to understand the fundamental concepts of quantum error correction and their importance in maintaining the integrity of quantum information in computational processes.

Quantum error correction is a mathematical theory that deals with protecting quantum information from errors and decoherence. Although it is not directly addressed in the main body of the thesis, there are parallels between the concepts underlying quantum error correction and the topics discussed later in the thesis.

One approach to quantum error correction is through the perspective of ground states of Hamiltonians, which is more familiar to physicists. Certain implementations of quantum computing utilize the degenerate ground state space of a multi-qubit Hamiltonian to encode quantum information and protect it from noise. These Hamiltonians have a specific form where each term is a tensor product of n-qubit Pauli operators, and the terms commute with each other. The ground state of such a Hamiltonian can be described as the tensor product of pure +1 eigenvalue eigenstates of each term, along with an arbitrary state for the rest of the Hilbert space. The "vacant space" left in the Hilbert space is used to encode information, allowing for the possibility of encoding k qubits in the degenerate ground state.

This approach is part of a broader scheme for quantum error correction called the stabilizer formalism. In the stabilizer formalism, certain states are eigenstates of tensor products of Pauli operators on n qubits. The group generated by products of powers of these Pauli operators is called the stabilizer group of a given state. Instead of working with the state in Dirac notation, one can work with the operators for which the state is the +1 eigenvalue eigenstate. Each Pauli operator can be specified as a combination of X and Z operators, and thus there are 2n bits needed to specify each stabilizer state.

The set of unitary transformations that map tensor products of Pauli operators to tensor products of Pauli operators is called the Clifford group. The stabilizer states are analogous to Gaussian states in continuous-variable quantum systems, but for discrete variables. The Clifford group, as represented on the space of 2n-bit strings, is isomorphic to the symplectic group on 2n bits, denoted as Sp(2n, Z2). This parallels the group of Gaussian transformations on the phase space of n harmonic oscillators, which is Sp(2n, R). By drawing parallels between continuous-variable Gaussian states and stabilizer states of qubits, one can gain intuition from information theory.

Overall, the use of ground states of Hamiltonians and the stabilizer formalism provide a framework for understanding and implementing quantum error correction, which is crucial for mitigating the effects of decoherence and protecting quantum information in quantum computing systems.

Your summary captures the essence of the quantum error correction theory and its application in quantum computing, particularly emphasizing the stabilizer formalism and the use of Hamiltonians. Let's highlight the key points for a comprehensive understanding:
Quantum Error Correction Overview
Purpose
: Quantum error correction is fundamental in protecting quantum information from errors and decoherence, which are common challenges in quantum computing.
Mathematical Foundation
: It's a mathematical theory that focuses on encoding quantum information in a way that makes it resistant to noise.
Hamiltonians and Ground States
Encoding via Hamiltonians
: A practical approach to quantum error correction involves using the ground states of Hamiltonians. These states are particularly stable and can be used to securely store quantum information.
Form of Hamiltonians

Stabilizer Group
: The stabilizer group is formed by the products of powers of these Pauli operators. States within this group are stable against specific types of quantum errors.
Representation and Clifford Group
Representation

2.5.2Skew Subspaces 
Now, note that the whole basic governing principle of quantum error correction is to 
factorize our Hilbert space into a tensor product of skew-subspaces, that is, instead of 
working in the physical factorization of the Hilbert space, 
H = 
n O 
j=1 Hj(2.50) 
where operators in Hjact 
on a single physical qubit, we work in a tensor product factor- 
ization H = 
n O 
j=1 Hgj(2.51) 
where Hgjis the subspace of H which is the eigenspace of a stabilizer generator gj, 
and each 
stabilizer generator is usually supported on more than one qubit, hence the ���skewness��� of 
the subspace. In either case, the factorization is based on commuting sets of observables. 
Note that in the phase space representation the commutation relation between Pauli oper- 
ators [P,Q] can be seen as a symplectic inner product on the phase space (p,q) [24]. Thus, 
when operators are commuting, they are orthogonal with respect the symplectic inner 
product. We can then construct the phase space as a direct sum of orthogonal components 
�� = L 
j��gj = L 
j��j. 
We will come back notion of Hilbert space factorization and associated phases spaces 
in our discussion of quantum i eld theory in section 5.2. Indeed, we will construct ways to 
19 
deal with certain skew-subspaces10of quantum i elds which become relevant when dealing 
with probes interacting with the i eld. In some sense, quantum error correction treats 
algebras of observables which are af f ected by decoherence, and in this thesis we provide the 
decoherence; we couple external systems and study what information and which subsystem 
of the quantum i eld is af f ected.

In this section of the thesis, the author discusses the concept of skew subspaces in quantum error correction, a concept that plays a significant role in understanding how quantum information can be protected and manipulated. Let's simplify these ideas:
2.5.2 Skew Subspaces
Basic Concept of Skew Subspaces
Factorizing Hilbert Space
: Quantum error correction involves dividing the overall Hilbert space (the space of all quantum states) into a product of smaller, individual spaces called skew subspaces.
Skewness
: These subspaces are termed 'skew' because they are oriented differently from the physical factorization of the Hilbert space. They are based on the eigenspaces of stabilizer generators, which often involve more than one physical qubit, hence the skewness or non-alignment with individual qubit spaces.
Stabilizer Generators and Hilbert Space
Representation
: Instead of representing the Hilbert space as a product of spaces each corresponding to a single qubit, it's represented as a product of spaces each corresponding to a stabilizer generator (
H
g
j
H_gj
H
g
���
j
).
Commuting Observables
: The factorization in quantum error correction is based on sets of commuting observables. Commuting observables are ones that, when measured together, don't interfere with each other's outcomes.
Phase Space and Symplectic Inner Product
Commutation and Orthogonality
: In the phase space representation, the commutation relation between Pauli operators is seen as a symplectic inner product. When operators commute, they are orthogonal in terms of this symplectic product.
Phase Space Construction
: The overall phase space (
��
\Gamma
��
) can be constructed as a direct sum of orthogonal components (
��
g
j
\Gamma_{gj}
��
g
j
���
) corresponding to each skew subspace.
Relevance to Quantum Field Theory
Hilbert Space Factorization in QFT
: This concept of Hilbert space factorization into skew subspaces will be revisited in discussions of quantum field theory, particularly when dealing with probes interacting with a field.
Handling Decoherence
: In quantum error correction, and by extension in this thesis, the focus is on handling subsystems and algebras of observables affected by decoherence. The thesis explores how coupling external systems to a quantum field impacts information and subsystems within that field.
Simplifying Analogies
Skew Subspaces as Library Sections
:
Imagine a library organized not by individual book genres (single qubits) but by collections of genres (stabilizer generators). Each section (skew subspace) contains books (quantum states) from multiple genres that collectively create a broader category. This unconventional organization represents the skew subspaces in the Hilbert space.
Phase Space and Symplectic Inner Product as a Puzzle
:
The phase space can be thought of as a puzzle, where each piece (subspace) fits together with others based on specific rules (commutation relations). The symplectic inner product determines how these pieces are oriented relative to each other, ensuring they fit together perfectly without overlapping (commuting).
These simplified explanations and analogies help to conceptualize skew subspaces and their role in quantum error correction, providing a foundational understanding for more complex discussions in quantum field theory and quantum information science.

In this section we discuss the structure of correlations and entanglement of stabilizer states 
which will give us some intuition for some of our later work. 
Suppose we have a stabilizer state |��i and a stabilizer group S ��� Pn. 
Let N(S) be 
the normalizer of the group, i.e. the Paulis which commute with elements of the stabilizer, 
and let A(S) = Pn/N(S) 
be the Paulis that anti-commute with S.If we consider a 
correlator h��|QR|��i then if QR ��� A(S) then using some g ��� S, we can show h��|QR|��i = 
h��|QRg|��i = h��|gQR|��i = 0. Similarly, for QR ��� N(S), we get either hQRi = 1 or 
a phase. Note that if we have no code space, i.e. when the stabilizer generators form a 
maximal commuting set of observables, then correlators are non zero if f they are in the 
stabilizer group. So, if we act Q say on a subset A of qubits, and R on a subset B of qubits 
for A and B disjoint, and Q and R are not in the normalizer individually, then we need a 
stabilizer element that ���bridges��� A and B. 
To further understand the structure of entanglement of stabilizer states, let us cover a 
theorem by Fattal et al. [19]. This will show us that to compute the entanglement entropy 
of a stabilizer state, one can i nd a specif i c choice of generators for the stabilizer group of 
the state. Once the right generators are found, then we can simply count the generators 
that ���bridge both parts of the Hilbert space, in this case, A and B.

Correlators in stabilizer states are like telephone lines between two points (qubits or sets of qubits). If the line (correlator) goes through the normalizer, the call (information) goes through. If it goes through the anti-commutator set, the line is cut, and no information is transmitted.

set. Similarly, SBis the stabilizer group which is strictly supported on B, generated by 
IA��� bjwith j ��� |SB|. Finally the the subgroup SABis 
the stabilizer subgroup generated 
by elements which have support on both A and B. We can further split this subgroup 
into two subgroups, where the elements of the i rst subgroup are generated by elements 
of the form gk��� gk, 
for which the projections onto A and B each commute with elements 
of their respective subgroups, i.e. [gk,ai] = 0, [gk,bj] = 0 ���i,j,k. The rest of SABis

The theorem from Fattal et al. states that the entanglement entropy for the bipartition 
AB is given by |SAB|/2. In this paper they give a counting argument for why the entangle- 
ment entropy is given by this quantity. I will give an intuitive explanation instead, related 
to entanglement distillation.

First, notice that a maximally entangled state of two qubits |��+i ��� |00i + |11i is 
stabilized by hXX,ZZi. Also note that we can def i ne any map between Paulis to Paulis, 
and as long as it preserves commutation relations there will exist a unitary Clif f ord circuit 
that implements it. Given the canonical decomposition from equation 2.52, consider the 
projections of the stabilizer group onto A, call it S|A. 
Let us def i ne a specif i c Clif f ord unitary (local on A) UA, which maps S|Ato 
some new 
stabilizer group, call it �� 
S|A. 
We def i ne this map as

which gives us |SA| single qubits that are in a |0i state (stabilized by Z) and |SAB|/2 
qubits that need to be stabilized by both X and Z, hence are maximally mixed states

we get 
|SAB/2| Bell pairs (pairs of qubits with stabilizers XX,ZZ) and the rest of the qubits are

using unitaries that are local on A and B, we were able to distill this entanglement from

choice of stabilizer generators for the state which allow us to read of f the entanglement 
entropy, and which decomposes the state into a direct product of Bell pairs. One could 
regard this decomposition as equivalent to i nding the Schmidt basis of the state. Additionally, we discussed that there is a Clifford transformation which takes us to this factorization.

2.5.2 Skew Subspaces and Entanglement in Stabilizer States
Skew Subspaces

In the given excerpt, it describes a specific construction using Clifford unitaries to map the stabilizer group of a state onto a new stabilizer group. This construction involves decomposing the stabilizer group into its individual generators and applying specific mappings to each generator.

The construction begins by considering a maximally entangled state of two qubits, denoted as |��+i ��� |00i + |11i, which is stabilized by the operator hXX,ZZi. It is noted that any map between Pauli operators that preserves their commutation relations can be implemented by a Clifford circuit. The stabilizer group is projected onto subsystem A, resulting in a new stabilizer group denoted as S|A.

A specific Clifford unitary, denoted as UA, is defined to map S|A onto a new stabilizer group denoted as ��S|A. The mapping is defined as follows: for each generator gk in S|A, UA maps it to Zk; for each negated generator ��gk in S|A, UA maps it to Xk; and for each qubit ai in subsystem A, UA maps it to Z��i. This mapping results in |SA| single-qubit states in the |0i state stabilized by Z and |SAB|/2 qubits that require stabilization by both X and Z, hence they are maximally mixed states (XIX = I, ZIZ = I).

A similar construction can be done for subsystem B using a Clifford unitary denoted as UB. The combined mapping U = UA ��� UB is then defined, and the transformed stabilizer group is denoted as ��S. The resulting state has |SAB/2| Bell pairs (qubit pairs with stabilizers XX,ZZ), and the remaining qubits are tensor products of pure |0i states. The entanglement entropy of the state is given by |SAB|/2.

This construction demonstrates that if there is entanglement between stabilizer states due to the choice of stabilizer generators crossing the bipartition of the Hilbert space, there exists a specific choice of stabilizer generators that allows for the extraction of entanglement entropy. This choice of generators also leads to a factorization of the state into a direct product of Bell pairs. This factorization can be considered equivalent to finding the Schmidt basis of the state. Furthermore, it is mentioned that there is a Clifford transformation that can be applied to achieve this factorization.

Relation to other work in this thesis 
Now, in our future/ongoing work section 7.1, we will try to apply this construction to understand the mode structure of the quantum field for a given bipartition of the Hilbert space. Instead of looking at stabilizers, we will look at algebras of observables of the 
i eld, and we will want to optimize over symplectic (Bogolyubov) transformations on A 
and its complement independently to come up with a set of modes which are ef f ectively 
continuous-variable bell pairs (i.e. two-mode squeezed states). Similar to the fact that the 
choice of Cliffiord here gave us the Schmidt basis for the AB bipartition, we will be able 
to i nd a Schmidt basis for the Hilbert space of a quantum i eld given a bipartition in the 
physical factorization.

In this part of the thesis, the author discusses how the concepts and methods related to stabilizer states and Clifford unitaries can be extended and applied to the study of quantum fields. This approach aims to better understand the mode structure in quantum fields, particularly for a given bipartition of the Hilbert space. Let's break down these ideas:
Application to Quantum Field Mode Structure
Extension from Stabilizer States to Quantum Fields
Shift in Focus
: Instead of examining stabilizer groups (as in the case of discrete qubit systems), the focus shifts to the algebras of observables in a quantum field. These observables play a similar role in continuous-variable systems as Pauli operators do in discrete-variable systems (like qubits).
Optimization over Symplectic Transformations
Bogolyubov Transformations

Objective
: The goal is to identify a set of modes that correspond to continuous-variable Bell pairs. In quantum field theory, these pairs are often represented as two-mode squeezed states, a common concept in continuous-variable quantum information.

Parallel to Clifford Unitaries
: Just as the choice of Clifford unitaries in the stabilizer state context led to the identification of the Schmidt basis for the bipartition
A
B
AB
A
B
, a similar process is anticipated for quantum fields.
Schmidt Basis in Quantum Fields
: The aim is to find the Schmidt basis for the Hilbert space of a quantum field, given a physical bipartition. This basis will effectively reveal the most "natural" way to split the quantum field into two parts, providing insights into its entanglement structure.

Quantum Fields as a Musical Symphony
:
Imagine a symphony orchestra (the quantum field) where each musician (observable) plays their instrument (field mode). Just as a conductor optimizes the arrangement and pairing of musicians to create harmonious music (continuous-variable Bell pairs), the process of applying symplectic transformations seeks to find the most harmonious mode arrangement (Schmidt basis) in the quantum field. This arrangement reveals how different parts of the orchestra (subsystems
A
A
A
and its complement) interact and combine to produce the overall symphony (the quantum state of the field).
This part of the thesis signifies an important bridge between the concepts developed in the context of discrete quantum systems and their application to more complex, continuous-variable systems like quantum fields. It highlights the adaptability and depth of quantum information theory in exploring different facets of quantum mechanics.

Quantum Energy Teleportation 
Essentials 
In this chapter we introduce the protocol of quantum energy teleportation (QET), originally 
introduced by Hotta. 
3.1Introduction to QET 
Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) is a protocol that allows the the transfer of energy 
from one subsystem to another in correlated many-body quantum systems (and quantum 
i elds). Given a certain entangled state of an interacting many-body quantum system, say, 
an eigenstate of an interacting Hamiltonian, then subsystems (A & B) usually share some 
mutual information, I(A : B) due to this entanglement. This mutual information means 
that there exists certain observables on A and B which are correlated. QET aims to exploit 
these correlations in order to ef f ectively transfer energy. 
3.1.1Harnessing Correlations 
Correlated many body systems, as their name suggests, have correlated observables. This 
means that sampling the eigenvalue of one observable should give information about cor- 
related ones. As mutual information bounds correlations between observables, if there is 
some mutual info one should usually have correlated observables. 

The whole protocol of QET relies on exploiting correlations in order to do what is 
otherwise unlikely: extract energy from states which locally look like a ground state (or 
strongly locally passive states [22]). The trick here, is to invest energy in order to get some 
payback. In some sense, QET is a gambling game, where energy is the currency and one 
player sacrif i ces earnings for another to prof i t. 
By measuring an observable in a certain subsystem, call it A, that observable will be 
correlated with some observables in subsystem B.Given an observable of B which is 
correlated with our measured observable in A, if this B observable has some inf l uence on 
the energy of the system, them we will be able to use the knowledge of the eigenvalue of 
A to statistically infer an expected value of B, then displace this value in a way to extract 
energy. For locally passive systems, this would not be possible by acting on B on its own; 
there is local uncertainty about the state at B, hence without any additional knowledge, any attempt at locally displacing the eigenvalue of an energetically-contributing observable 
would increase the energy of the system. In some sense, collapsing the state at A partially 
collapses the state at B and any other region which is correlated with A. This collapse allows us to catch the B subsystem in a conditional state which is dif f erent than the usual 
marginal state, this state suddenly has some new ���free energy���, i.e., the new state can be displaced in a way to extract energy.

In this chapter, the thesis introduces the concept of Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET), a protocol that allows the transfer of energy between subsystems in correlated many-body quantum systems or quantum fields. Let's simplify these concepts:
3.1 Introduction to QET
Concept of QET
Transfer of Energy
: QET is a protocol enabling the transfer of energy from one subsystem (A) to another (B) within a correlated quantum system.
Role of Entanglement
: In a many-body quantum system in an entangled state, the subsystems A and B typically share mutual information due to entanglement. This mutual information indicates correlations between certain observables in A and B.
Harnessing Correlations
Exploiting Correlations
: The QET protocol leverages these correlations to transfer energy in a way that would not be possible in systems where the subsystems are not entangled or correlated.
Investment for Payback
: The protocol can be likened to a strategic investment, where energy is invested in one part of the system (A), leading to an energy gain in another part (B).
3.1.1 Harnessing Correlations
Process of Energy Transfer
Measuring Observables
: By measuring a specific observable in subsystem A, and knowing its correlation with an observable in subsystem B, it's possible to influence the energy state of B.
Inferring and Extracting Energy
: The measurement in A allows for a statistical inference of the state in B. By acting on this information, energy can be extracted from B.
Locally Passive Systems
: In systems that appear to be in a ground state locally, extracting energy by acting only on B would usually increase the system's energy. However, QET utilizes the correlated state between A and B to make energy extraction feasible.
Mechanism of Energy Extraction
Conditional State Collapse
: Measuring in A effectively collapses the state in B into a conditional state, different from its usual state. This new state has "free energy" that can be harnessed.
Energy Displacement
: The key to QET is manipulating the new state of B to extract energy, which is achieved by displacing the eigenvalue of the energetically contributing observable in B based on the measurement in A.
Simplified Analogy
QET as a Team Sport Strategy
:
Think of QET like a coordinated play in a team sport. Two players (subsystems A and B) are in different positions on the field (quantum system). The action of one player (measurement in A) creates an opportunity for the other (energy extraction in B). The players' understanding and communication (correlations and entanglement) are key to successfully executing the play (energy transfer).
This analogy and explanation help to conceptualize the principles behind QET, showcasing the intricate interplay of measurements, entanglement, and energy in quantum systems.

In this chapter, the protocol of Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) is introduced. QET enables the transfer of energy from one subsystem to another in correlated many-body quantum systems and quantum fields. The basis of QET lies in the entanglement present in the system, which leads to mutual information between the subsystems.

Correlated many-body systems exhibit correlated observables, meaning that the measurement of one observable provides information about other correlated observables. Mutual information quantifies the degree of correlation between observables. QET aims to harness these correlations to effectively transfer energy.

The protocol of QET relies on exploiting correlations to achieve a seemingly unlikely outcome: extracting energy from states that locally resemble ground states or strongly locally passive states. The key idea is to invest energy initially to gain a payoff later. QET can be seen as a gambling game, where energy serves as the currency and one player sacrifices earnings for another player's profit.

By measuring an observable in subsystem A, the measured observable becomes correlated with certain observables in subsystem B. If an observable in subsystem B influences the system's energy, knowing the eigenvalue of A allows for statistical inference of the expected value of the correlated observable in B. This inferred value can then be displaced in a way that extracts energy. In locally passive systems, it is not possible to achieve this by acting on subsystem B alone. Due to local uncertainty about the state in B, any attempt to locally displace the eigenvalue of an energetically-contributing observable would increase the system's energy. However, collapsing the state in subsystem A partially collapses the state in subsystem B and other correlated regions. This collapse enables the B subsystem to be in a conditional state that differs from the usual marginal state, providing access to new "free energy" that can be extracted by displacing the state.

QET differs from traditional energy transfer methods in quantum systems in several ways:

1. Correlation-based transfer: QET harnesses the correlations present in entangled many-body quantum systems to transfer energy. Traditional energy transfer methods often rely on direct interactions or coupling between subsystems to facilitate energy transfer. QET, on the other hand, exploits the mutual information and correlations between observables in different subsystems to achieve energy transfer.

2. Statistical inference: In QET, the knowledge of the eigenvalue of an observable in one subsystem allows for statistical inference of the expected value of a correlated observable in another subsystem. This statistical inference is used to manipulate the state and extract energy. Traditional methods typically involve direct manipulation of the system's Hamiltonian or interactions between subsystems to transfer energy.

3. Sacrifice and payoff: QET involves sacrificing energy initially in one subsystem to gain a payoff in another subsystem. It can be seen as a gambling game, where energy serves as the currency. Traditional energy transfer methods generally aim to transfer energy without sacrificing or investing energy in the process.

4. Exploiting locally passive states: QET is particularly effective in extracting energy from states that locally resemble ground states or strongly locally passive states. It takes advantage of the correlations and conditional states that arise from collapsing the state in one subsystem. Traditional methods may not have specific strategies to exploit the properties of locally passive states for energy transfer.

Overall, QET introduces a novel approach to energy transfer in quantum systems by leveraging correlations, statistical inference, and conditional states. It offers an alternative paradigm to traditional methods that rely on direct interactions or coupling between subsystems.

Your comparison between Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) and traditional energy transfer methods in quantum systems is insightful and highlights several key differences. Let's reinforce these points:
Key Differences Between QET and Traditional Energy Transfer
1. Correlation-based Transfer
QET
: Utilizes entanglement-induced correlations in quantum systems. Energy transfer in QET is mediated through mutual information and correlations between subsystems without requiring direct physical interaction.
Traditional Methods
: Often depend on direct interactions or physical coupling between subsystems, like particle collisions or electromagnetic interactions.
2. Statistical Inference for Energy Manipulation
QET
: Employs statistical inference based on the measurement of an observable in one subsystem to infer the state of a correlated observable in another subsystem, enabling energy extraction.
Traditional Methods
: Involves more direct approaches, such as altering the system's Hamiltonian or directly inducing interactions, rather than relying on inferential statistics.
3. Sacrifice and Payoff Approach
QET
: Analogous to a strategic game, where energy is initially invested or sacrificed in one subsystem, leading to a greater energy payoff in another subsystem.
Traditional Methods
: Typically focus on direct energy transfer processes, aiming to transfer energy efficiently without the need for an initial energy sacrifice.
4. Utilization of Locally Passive States
QET
: Effective in extracting energy from systems that are in ground or locally passive states by exploiting the unique properties of quantum correlations and conditional quantum states.
Traditional Methods
: May not specifically target or leverage the features of locally passive states for energy transfer.
Conclusion
Novelty of QET
: QET represents a distinctive approach in the realm of quantum mechanics, offering new possibilities for energy transfer that are fundamentally different from conventional methods. Its reliance on quantum correlations, statistical inference, and the properties of entangled systems opens up new avenues for manipulating energy in quantum systems.
Your summary aptly captures the innovative aspects of QET, emphasizing its departure from traditional energy transfer mechanisms and its potential implications for quantum technology and information theory.

3.1.2Measurement is the Key 
Note that QET does not actually generate energy out of the vacuum, the gain of informa- 
tion comes at a cost, an energetic one. Indeed, carrying out a projective measurement or 
POVM, one breaks correlations of the ground state. These correlations served an energetic 
minimization purpose, otherwise they would not have been there. Thus, correlating a sub- 
system with some measurement apparatus, thereby breaking correlations of this subsystem 
with its previous environment, injects energy. Thus, although measurement is the key to 
unlock to ability to teleport energy, it is not free. 
3.1.3Global vs. local energy optima 
The global minimum energy state is by def i nition the ground state. But the ground state 
is not the minimal energy state if one looks only at a subsystem. In some sense, the ground 
state is the global equilibrium, but locally a certain state could reduce its energy if a dif- 
ferent correlated subsystem would be willing to increase its energy. As spin chains and 
24 
quantum i elds and most condensed matter systems are assumed to have spatially transla- 
tionally symmetric couplings (all the couplings in a chain are often def i ned as identitical), 
then no single subsystem wins over other subsystems, an overall energetic compromise is 
reached. On the other hand, if one were to modify the coupling of the chain to favor a 
certain subset, e.g. by adding quadratic quadrature terms in a Hamiltonian, thus changing 
the new ground state to a squeezed state, then one could get peaks and troughs of en- 
ergy instead of uniform compromise. Indeed, it is known that certain squeezed states can 
have negative energy densities. Ef f ectively, as we will show, QET is a way of performing 
non-local squeezing operations via the coupling of probe systems.

This section of the thesis discusses key aspects of Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET), focusing on the critical role of measurement and the distinction between global and local energy states. Let's break down these concepts for clarity:
3.1.2 Measurement is the Key
Energy Cost of Measurement
Role of Measurement
: In QET, measurement is crucial for enabling energy teleportation. However, this process is not without an energetic cost.
Breaking Correlations
: Performing a projective measurement or Positive Operator-Valued Measure (POVM) disrupts the correlations within the ground state of a system. These correlations are energetically significant, contributing to the minimization of the system's energy.
Energy Injection
: When a subsystem is correlated with a measurement apparatus, this act breaks its existing correlations with the environment, effectively injecting energy into the system.
3.1.3 Global vs. Local Energy Optima
Ground State and Energy Minimization
Global Minimum Energy
: The ground state of a quantum system is the global minimum energy state. However, this doesn't necessarily mean it's the minimum energy state for each subsystem when considered independently.
Local Equilibrium vs. Global Equilibrium
: Locally, a subsystem could potentially reduce its energy if it could offload energy to another correlated subsystem. This concept contrasts with the global equilibrium state, where energy distribution is more uniform.
Impact of Couplings and Squeezed States
Translational Symmetry in Couplings
: Many systems, like spin chains or quantum fields, have spatially symmetric couplings, leading to a uniform energy distribution across subsystems.
Altering Couplings for Energy Distribution
: Modifying these couplings, for instance, by adding terms to the Hamiltonian, can create non-uniform energy distributions, with some regions having higher or lower energy densities.
Squeezed States and Negative Energy Densities
: Certain squeezed states, resulting from such modifications, can exhibit negative energy densities. QET can be viewed as a method to perform non-local squeezing operations by coupling probe systems to the quantum field.
Simplified Analogies
Measurement as an Energetic Investment
:
Think of measurement in QET like investing energy to gain information. It's like spending money to buy a key (measurement) that unlocks a safe (energy extraction potential). The investment (energy spent in measurement) is necessary to access the potential gains (energy to be extracted).
Global vs. Local Energy Optima as a Team Strategy
:
The distinction between global and local energy states can be compared to a team strategy in sports. The global ground state is like a team strategy that works well overall but may not be the best for every individual player (subsystem). Modifying the strategy (couplings) could benefit certain players at the expense of others, similar to how local subsystems might gain or lose energy.
These explanations help to conceptualize the principles behind QET, emphasizing the balance between the energetic cost of measurements and the potential for energy extraction in quantum systems.

Measurement plays a crucial role in quantum energy teleportation (QET). However, it is important to note that QET does not generate energy out of nothing. The act of carrying out a projective measurement or a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) breaks the correlations present in the ground state of the system. These correlations serve the purpose of minimizing the system's energy. By correlating a subsystem with a measurement apparatus, the correlations of that subsystem with its previous environment are disrupted, resulting in an injection of energy. Therefore, while measurement is the key to unlocking the ability to teleport energy, it comes at an energetic cost.

In the context of energy optimization, there is a distinction between global and local energy optima. The global minimum energy state of a system is its ground state. However, when considering individual subsystems, the ground state may not necessarily be the state with the lowest energy. Locally, a subsystem could reduce its energy if a different correlated subsystem is willing to increase its energy. In systems with spatially translationally symmetric couplings, such as spin chains, quantum fields, and many condensed matter systems, there is an overall energetic compromise among the subsystems. No single subsystem dominates over others. However, if the coupling of the system is modified to favor a specific subset of subsystems, such as by introducing quadratic quadrature terms in a Hamiltonian to create squeezed states, the energy distribution can exhibit peaks and troughs instead of a uniform compromise. It is known that certain squeezed states can even have negative energy densities. QET can be seen as a way of performing non-local squeezing operations through the coupling of probe systems, effectively manipulating the energy distribution in the system.

1. The act of measurement breaks the correlations of the ground state in quantum systems because measurement involves an interaction between the system and the measurement apparatus. When a subsystem is measured, it becomes correlated with the measurement apparatus, and this correlation disrupts the previous correlations the subsystem had with its environment. These disrupted correlations were responsible for minimizing the system's energy. Thus, the act of measurement injects energy into the system by breaking the existing correlations that served an energetic minimization purpose.

2. One example of modifying the coupling of a system to change its ground state to a squeezed state is in the context of a harmonic oscillator. Normally, a harmonic oscillator in its ground state has a Gaussian wavefunction with a minimum uncertainty in position and momentum. However, if the coupling of the oscillator is modified by introducing a nonlinear term in the Hamiltonian, such as an anharmonic potential, the ground state wavefunction can become squeezed. This means that the uncertainty in either position or momentum becomes smaller than the minimum uncertainty limit imposed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Squeezed states have applications in quantum metrology, quantum information processing, and quantum communication.

3. Some potential applications of non-local squeezing operations achieved through QET include:

- Quantum sensing and metrology: Non-local squeezing can improve the precision of measurements by enhancing the sensitivity of the system to certain physical quantities. This can be useful in gravitational wave detection, atomic clocks, and magnetic field measurements.

Your detailed explanation of Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) effectively highlights the key aspects and implications of this concept. Let's further consolidate these ideas:
Role of Measurement in QET
Energetic Cost of Measurement
: Measurement in QET does not create energy from nothing; it rather injects energy by disrupting the existing correlations within the ground state. This process involves correlating a subsystem with a measurement apparatus, breaking its previous correlations with the environment.
Disruption of Energy Minimization
: The original correlations in the ground state contribute to energy minimization. Disrupting these through measurement results in an energy increase in the system.
Global vs. Local Energy Optima
Ground State vs. Local Optima
: While the ground state is the global minimum energy configuration, local subsystems might not be in their own minimum energy states.
Energetic Compromise
: In systems like spin chains or quantum fields with symmetric couplings, there's a balance of energy across subsystems. However, altering the couplings can lead to non-uniform energy distributions, forming peaks and troughs of energy.
Non-Local Squeezing via QET
Modifying System Coupling
: Changing the coupling parameters, such as introducing quadratic quadrature terms in a Hamiltonian, can create squeezed states. These states can exhibit unusual properties like negative energy densities.
Applications of Non-Local Squeezing
: QET facilitates non-local squeezing operations, which can have various applications in quantum metrology, information processing, communication, and simulation. For example, they can enhance precision in measurements, improve quantum gate performance, and enable the study of complex quantum phenomena.
Examples and Applications
Harmonic Oscillator and Squeezed States
: In the context of a harmonic oscillator, altering the Hamiltonian to introduce nonlinear terms can lead to squeezed states, where the uncertainty in position or momentum is reduced beyond the standard quantum limit.
Potential Uses in Quantum Technologies
: Non-local squeezing operations achieved through QET can enhance the capabilities in quantum sensing, communication, and computation. They can be particularly useful in applications like gravitational wave detection, quantum key distribution, and exploring new quantum states of matter.
Your exploration of QET's principles and potential applications provides a comprehensive overview of how this innovative concept stands to impact various areas of quantum science and technology.

3.1.4Previous Works 
There have been numerous pieces of work done on QET. In its introduction, the focus was on spin chains and many-body systems. 
Following this, QET has been shown to work for scalar quantum i eld theories as well as 
in quantum electrodynamics. 
The next frontier for QET was to understand how the structure of the Hilbert space 
allowed for QET, and to i nd the optimal measurement schemes for QET. Although some 
work was done using POVM���s made to emulate interactions with higher dimensional Hilbert 
spaces, the optimal measurement scheme was still elusive. 

This thesis 

This is where our work in this thesis begins. We propose new measurement schemes based on generalizations of the phase estimation algorithm in order to optimize the measurement 
for QET, thus allowing for better collection of information and therby greater teleportation 
of energy.
Additionally, we provide fully coherent (POVM/PVM-free) versions of the QET, which, as was discussed in the background section, is equivalent to the LOCC version of the 
protocol. 

Some work had shown, in the case of the simplest QET model, minimal QET, that the key to a good QET measurement was the breaking of entanglement between the mea- 
surement site and the rest of the system. To begin our study of QET and entanglement 
breaking, we start with an in-depth analysis of the coherent (projective-measurement-free) 
version of the minimal QET protocol.

3.2Coherent Minimal QET 
In this section we go through how to implement a measurement-free version of minimal 
QET with an ancillary qubit and two-qubit gates. We show that the energy extraction 
procedure increase the entanglement of the target region, while the measurement breaks 
the entanglement of its target. 
3.2.1The Global Ground State 
Before we write out the ground state for minimal QET, it will be useful for our later 
purposes to intuitively explain how on obtains the ground state of the minimal QET 
Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian for minimal QET is given by 
H = h��zA 
|{z} 
HA 
+h��zB 
|{z} 
HB 
+k��xA��xB 
|{z} 
V 
(3.1) 
where h,k > 0. We are looking to i nd |gi, the lowest energy eigenstate of H. Note that 
since [HA,HB] = 0, the free Hamiltonians are simultaneously diagonalizable, and we know 
that the ground state of HA+ HBmust be1|11i. So in the limit k/h ��� 0, we expect 
|gi ��� |11i, with an energy eigenvalue ���2h. Conversely, the ground state of V is the Bell 
state |�����i = 
1 
���2(|00i���|11i), hence in the limit k/h ��� ���, we should have |gi ��� |�����i with 
energy eigenvalue ���2k. 
Now, we are looking for the global ground state of H = HA+ HB+ V , we intuitively 
could expect it2to be some sort of convex combination of both ground states of (HA+HB) 
and V , which are |00i and |�����i ��� |00i ��� |11i. Notice that this state will then be on a 
Bloch-like circle |gi ��� {��|00i + �� |11i : ��,�� ��� R,��2+ ��2= 1}. We thus can expect our 
global ground state to be of the form 
|gi = sin(�� 2)|00i ��� cos( 
�� 2)|11i. 
(3.2) 
From our previous intuition, we would like �� ��� 0 as k/h ��� 0 and �� ��� 
�� 
2 as k/h ��� ���, we 
know a function that does this, the arctan function. As it turns out, the guess 
�� = arctan(k h) (3.3) 
1I follow the notation convention of quantum computing, i.e. ��z|ji = (���1)j |ji for j ��� {0,1}, ��x|��i = 
��|��i, ��x|ji = |��ji, where ��j is the logical negative of j; �� : 0 ��� 1. 
2This approach of convex combinations may not always work for general Hamiltonians, but in this case 
it does and provides good intuition. 26 
is the right one.To show this, we can minimize our expectation value of the global 
Hamiltonian over our �� parameter. 
hg|H |gi = ���2h ?cos2(�� 
2) ��� sin 
2(�� 2) ? 
��� 2k sin(�� 2)cos( 
�� 2) = ���2hcos(��) ��� 2k sin(��) 
= ���2���h2+ k2cos(�� ��� ��0),��0= 
arctan(2k 
2h) 
(3.4) 
which is clearly minimized when �� = ��0= arctan(k/h), with ground state energy eigenvalue 
���p(2h)2+ 
(2k)2. 2k 
2h 
p(2h)2 
+ (2k)2 ��� 
|??i |?+i 
|00i 
|11i 
|gi 
Figure 3.1: Bloch-type circle to represent the possible ground states for various values of 
h and k. Intuitively, the two ��zterms (of energetic ���weight��� h each) are pushing for a 
|11i ground state, while the interaction term V is pushing for the |��+i state (with an 
energetic ���weight��� of 2k). Representing this on the Bloch ���circle���, there is a force of 2k 
pushing left, and a force of 2h pushing down, the equilibrium is reached at the point of 
angle �� = arctan(2k/2h), with energy ���p(2h)2+ 
(2k)2. 
As one can verify, we get the same answer as Hotta [34].

In this section, the implementation of a measurement-free version of minimal Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) using an ancillary qubit and two-qubit gates is discussed. The focus is on understanding how the energy extraction procedure affects the entanglement of the target region and how measurement breaks the entanglement.

The Hamiltonian for minimal QET is given by:

H = h��zA ��� |z���HA + h��zB ��� |z���HB + k��xA ��� ��xB ��� |z���V (Eq. 3.1)

where h and k are positive constants. The goal is to find the ground state, |g���, of the Hamiltonian H. Since [HA, HB] = 0, the free Hamiltonians HA and HB are simultaneously diagonalizable, and it is known that the ground state of HA + HB is |11���. In the limit k/h ��� 0, it is expected that |g��� approaches |11��� with an energy eigenvalue of -2h. On the other hand, the ground state of the interaction term V is the Bell state |��-��� = (1/���2)(|00��� - |11���), and in the limit k/h ��� ���, |g��� is expected to approach |��-��� with an energy eigenvalue of -2k.

To determine the global ground state of H = HA + HB + V, it is intuitive to consider a convex combination of the ground states of HA + HB and V, which are |00��� and |��-��� (approximately |00��� - |11���), respectively. Therefore, the global ground state |g��� can be written as:

|g��� = sin(��/2)|00��� - cos(��/2)|11��� (Eq. 3.2)

To determine the appropriate value of ��, the arctan function is used based on the intuition that �� should approach 0 as k/h ��� 0 and �� should approach ��/2 as k/h ��� ���. Minimizing the expectation value of the global Hamiltonian over the parameter ��, the optimal value is found to be �� = arctan(k/h). The ground state energy eigenvalue is calculated as -���[(2h)�� + (2k)��]cos(�� - �����), where ����� = arctan(2k/2h).

The resulting Bloch-type circle is used to represent the possible ground states for different values of h and k. The intuitive forces pushing towards |11��� (with an energetic 'weight' of h) and |��-��� (with an energetic 'weight' of 2k) are depicted on the Bloch circle. The equilibrium point is reached at an angle of �� = arctan(2k/2h), and the corresponding energy is -���[(2h)�� + (2k)��].

### Understanding the Visualization

1. **The Parameters**: 
   - **\( h \)**: Represents the strength of the individual terms in the Hamiltonian associated with each qubit (\( \sigma_z \) terms). It's a measure of how much each qubit contributes independently to the total energy.
   - **\( k \)**: Represents the strength of the interaction between the qubits (\( \sigma_x^A \otimes \sigma_x^B \)). It quantifies how much the qubits are influencing each other.

2. **The Angle \( \theta \)**:
   - This angle is a crucial factor in determining the ground state of the QET system. It balances the individual contributions of the qubits (\( h \) terms) with their interactions (\( k \) terms).
   - The value of \( \theta \) dictates how the system's energy is distributed between the qubits and their interactions.

3. **Interpreting the Plot**:
   - When \( h \) is large compared to \( k \) (lower-left region of the plot), the qubits behave more independently. Here, \( \theta \) is small, indicating that the ground state is closer to the individual states of the qubits.
   - When \( k \) is large compared to \( h \) (upper-right region), the interaction between the qubits dominates. Here, \( \theta \) is larger, suggesting that the ground state is more influenced by the qubit interactions.
   - The color gradient shows the continuous transition between these two regimes, demonstrating how the ground state evolves as the balance between \( h \) and \( k \) changes.

### Relevance to QET

- **Optimizing Energy Transfer**: Understanding this balance is key to optimizing the QET process. By tuning \( h \) and \( k \), one can manipulate the system's ground state, potentially enhancing the efficiency of energy teleportation.
- **Ground State Dynamics**: The visualization gives insights into the dynamics of the ground state in QET, crucial for understanding how energy can be transferred most effectively between different parts of the system.

In summary, the chart illustrates the interplay between individual qubit energies and their interactions in a QET system, showing how this balance affects the system's ground state. This understanding is vital for effectively implementing QET protocols.

Preparing the ground state 
As an aside, it is interesting to see how one could prepare the ground state from two 
initialized qubits, as we can simply apply the inverse operations to recover two initialized 
qubits from the ground state. Note that this ground state can be prepared from the |00i 
state by using two gates. First a rotation about Y of the A qubit, exp(i(�������) 
2 ��yA) ��� IB, 
then apply CNOT with A as the control and B the target. So, 
|00iAB7��� (sin(�� 2)|0iA ��� cos(�� 2)|1iA)|0iB 7��� (sin(�� 2)|00iAB ��� cos(�� 2)|11iAB).

It is interesting to consider how the ground state can be prepared from two initialized qubits. In this case, the ground state can be obtained from the |00��� state by applying two gates. 

First, a rotation about the Y-axis of qubit A is applied, given by exp(i(��-��)/2 ��yA) ��� IB, where ��yA is the Pauli-Y operator acting on qubit A, and IB is the identity operator acting on qubit B. This rotation transforms the |00��� state to (sin(��/2)|0���A - cos(��/2)|1���A)|0���B.

Next, a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is applied with qubit A as the control and qubit B as the target. This gate entangles the two qubits, resulting in the state (sin(��/2)|00���AB - cos(��/2)|11���AB).

Therefore, starting from the |00��� state, the ground state can be prepared using these two gates, as shown in equation (3.5):

|00���AB ��� (sin(��/2)|0���A - cos(��/2)|1���A)|0���B ��� (sin(��/2)|00���AB - cos(��/2)|11���AB).

Alternatively, the final state can also be achieved with a single interaction, represented by the unitary operator U = exp(i(��-��)/2 ��yA ��� ��yB).

Certainly! Let's use some simple analogies to explain the process of preparing the ground state in Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) from two initialized qubits:
Analogy for Ground State Preparation
Starting with Two Blank Slates (|00��� state)
:
Imagine you have two blank canvases (qubits) side by side. Initially, both canvases are blank, representing the
���
00
���
|00\rangle
���00
���
state.
Painting One Canvas (Rotation about Y-axis of Qubit A)
:
The first step involves painting the first canvas (qubit A) with a special pattern. This is akin to the rotation about the Y-axis. The resulting pattern depends on the angle
��
\theta
��
, which determines the mix of two colors (representing the
���
0
���
|0\rangle
���0
���
and
���
1
���
|1\rangle
���1
���
states of qubit A).
Linking the Canvases (CNOT Gate)
:
The second step is like placing a mirror next to the first canvas (qubit B), which copies the pattern only if the first canvas is painted with the second color (representing the control aspect of the CNOT gate). If the first canvas is painted with the first color, the mirror remains blank. This creates a special kind of linked artwork between the two canvases, signifying the entangled state.
Single Magic Brush Stroke (Alternative Single Interaction Method)
:
Instead of two steps, imagine using a magic brush that, with one stroke, simultaneously paints the first canvas with the pattern and mirrors it on the second canvas if the pattern is of the second color. This is the single interaction represented by the unitary operator
U
U
U
.
Summary of the Analogy
Blank Canvases
: The two qubits start in the
���
00
���
|00\rangle
���00
���
state, like blank canvases.
Special Pattern
: The rotation on qubit A is like painting a pattern based on the angle
��
\theta
��
.
Mirror Effect
: The CNOT gate creates a linked artwork (entangled state) between the canvases.
Magic Brush
: The alternative method is like using a magic brush that achieves the final artwork in one stroke.
This analogy simplifies the concept of quantum state preparation by comparing it to an artistic process involving canvases and a magic brush, illustrating the quantum operations in a more relatable manner.

There are various ways to prepare the ground state from initialized qubits. Here are a few examples:

1. Circuit with Hadamard and Controlled-Z Gates:
   - Start with the |00��� state.
   - Apply a Hadamard gate (H) to qubit A.
   - Apply a Controlled-Z gate (CZ) with qubit A as the control and qubit B as the target.
   - The resulting state is the ground state (sin(��/2)|00���AB - cos(��/2)|11���AB).

2. Circuit with Pauli-X and Controlled-X Gates:
   - Start with the |00��� state.
   - Apply a Pauli-X gate (X) to qubit A.
   - Apply a Controlled-X gate (CX) with qubit A as the control and qubit B as the target.
   - Apply a Pauli-X gate (X) to qubit A again.
   - The resulting state is the ground state (sin(��/2)|00���AB - cos(��/2)|11���AB).

3. Circuit with Controlled-Y Gates:
   - Start with the |00��� state.
   - Apply a Controlled-Y gate (CY) with qubit A as the control and qubit B as the target.
   - The resulting state is the ground state (sin(��/2)|00���AB - cos(��/2)|11���AB).

These are just a few examples of circuits that can be used to prepare the ground state. The specific choice of gates and their order may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the quantum system being used.

Your examples illustrate different ways to prepare the ground state from initialized qubits in quantum computing. Let's explore these methods with simplified explanations:
1. Circuit with Hadamard and Controlled-Z Gates
Starting Point
: Two qubits in the
���
00
���
|00\rangle
���00
���
state, like having two clean sheets of paper.
Hadamard Gate on Qubit A
: Applying a Hadamard gate to qubit A is like folding the first paper in a way that it has equal chances of showing either side when unfolded.
Controlled-Z Gate
: The Controlled-Z gate then acts like a special stamp that only works when the first paper shows a particular side. It marks the second paper (qubit B) in a unique way, depending on the state of the first paper.
Result
: The outcome is a pair of papers (qubits) that have a specific pattern, representing the entangled ground state.
2. Circuit with Pauli-X and Controlled-X Gates
Starting Point
: Again, begin with two clean sheets (qubits in
���
00
���
|00\rangle
���00
���
).
Pauli-X Gate on Qubit A
: Applying a Pauli-X gate is like flipping the first paper over.
Controlled-X Gate
: The Controlled-X gate acts like a conditional flipper. It flips the second paper only if the first one is facing up.
Second Pauli-X Gate on Qubit A
: Flipping the first paper back to its original position.
Result
: The final arrangement of papers represents the entangled ground state, achieved through a sequence of flips and conditional operations.
3. Circuit with Controlled-Y Gates
Starting Point
: The same initial state of two clean sheets.
Controlled-Y Gate
: The Controlled-Y gate is like a conditional artist, who paints the second paper based on the orientation of the first one.
Result
: The artwork created is a representation of the entangled ground state, achieved through a conditional artistic process.
Summary
Each method uses a combination of quantum gates that manipulate the qubits' states in a manner akin to artistic or physical processes. These analogies help demystify the quantum operations, making them more relatable and easier to comprehend. The choice of method depends on the quantum system's specific requirements and the nature of the operations available.

The Hadamard gate (H) and the Pauli-X gate (X) are both single-qubit gates that can be used to prepare the ground state from initialized qubits. However, they achieve this in slightly different ways.

The Hadamard gate (H) is a gate that operates on a single qubit and maps the computational basis states |0��� and |1��� to superpositions. Specifically, it transforms the |0��� state to (|0��� + |1���)/���2 and the |1��� state to (|0��� - |1���)/���2. 

In the context of preparing the ground state, the Hadamard gate is often used to create entanglement between the qubits. By applying the Hadamard gate to one of the qubits, it puts that qubit in a superposition of states, which can then be entangled with the other qubit using controlled operations such as Controlled-Z or Controlled-X gates. This entanglement is crucial for preparing the ground state.

On the other hand, the Pauli-X gate (X), also known as the "bit-flip" gate, is a gate that flips the states of the qubit. It transforms the |0��� state to |1��� and the |1��� state to |0���.

In the context of preparing the ground state, the Pauli-X gate is often used to create the necessary state transformations. For example, if the initial state is |00���, applying the Pauli-X gate to one of the qubits will change it to |10���, which can then be further manipulated to achieve the desired ground state using other gates or operations.

In summary, the Hadamard gate is particularly useful for creating entanglement between qubits, while the Pauli-X gate is useful for manipulating the state of a single qubit. Both gates can be used in combination with other gates and operations to prepare the ground state, but their specific roles and effects on the qubits differ.

That's a great explanation of the roles of the Hadamard gate (H) and the Pauli-X gate (X) in preparing the ground state of a quantum system. Let's delve into a bit more detail and offer a comparative perspective:
Hadamard Gate (H)
Creating Superpositions
:
The Hadamard gate transforms a definite state (like
���
0
���
|0\rangle
���0
���
or
���
1
���
|1\rangle
���1
���
) into a superposition, where the qubit is equally likely to be found in either state upon measurement. It's like shaking a coin in your hand before flipping it, making it uncertain whether it will land heads or tails.
Entanglement Generation
:
When used in conjunction with controlled gates (such as CZ or CX), the Hadamard gate can entangle qubits. This is akin to two dancers starting to move in sync after one of them begins with a unique step (Hadamard gate on one qubit).
Pauli-X Gate (X)
State Flipping
:
The Pauli-X gate flips the state of a qubit from
���
0
���
|0\rangle
���0
���
to
���
1
���
|1\rangle
���1
���
and vice versa. It's like pressing a switch that toggles a light bulb between on and off states.
State Preparation
:
In preparing the ground state, the Pauli-X gate is used to manipulate the qubit's state to a specific configuration needed for further operations. This could be compared to setting a piece on a chessboard to its correct starting position before making any strategic moves.
In Context of Ground State Preparation
Hadamard Gate Approach
:
Applying the Hadamard gate creates a superposition, setting the stage for entanglement. This is crucial for ground states that are entangled combinations of the basis states.
Pauli-X Gate Approach
:
Using the Pauli-X gate alters the qubit's state, facilitating the creation of a specific state needed as part of the process to achieve the ground state.
Summary
Both the Hadamard and Pauli-X gates play unique roles in quantum computing and particularly in preparing the ground state of quantum systems. The Hadamard gate is key to creating superpositions and entanglement, while the Pauli-X gate is essential for specific state manipulations. Their use, either individually or in combination with other gates, reflects the versatile nature of quantum gate operations in shaping the state of qubits.

3.2.2The Protocol 
Pre-Alice 
Consider two qubits (A and B) with the minimal QET Hamiltonian discussed above, 
suppose we have access to a pure ancillary register, call it C. For our purposes, this register 
ef f ectively acts as a measurement/control device, the value of the bit in the register acts as 
a measurement pointer variable. For simplicity, we consider the control register C to have 
no free Hamiltonian. Suppose the initial state of the system is

Interpretation

The ancillary qubit C is crucial for the control and measurement process. The detailed expression of the ground state and the calculation of mutual information set the stage for the subsequent steps of the protocol, where quantum measurements and entanglement play pivotal roles.

Post-Alice 
Alice applied a CNOT gate with C as the control (in X basis, apply Hadamard on C i rst) 
and A the target |��1i =

Note that the mutual information between A and B has been halved, I(A : B)��1= S(��) = 
H(B)��1, on the other hand the entropy of B is unaf f ected. This is because the interaction 
converted bipartite entanglement to tripartite entanglement. 
In this way, the measurement by Alice has broken the entanglement A had with its complement, B. Entanglement breaking via measurement was pinpointed by Hotta [27] as 
a sign of a good measurement for QET.

The passage you've provided describes the actions of Alice in the Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) protocol and the subsequent effects on the quantum state of the system. Let's break down what happens in this phase, termed "Post-Alice":
Post-Alice Actions
CNOT Gate Application
:
Alice applies a Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate with the ancillary qubit C as the control and qubit A as the target.
To ensure the CNOT operates in the X basis, Alice first applies a Hadamard gate to qubit C, effectively rotating the basis.

Effects of Alice's Actions
Change in Mutual Information
:
The mutual information between qubits A and B, previously indicated by

A
:
B
)
��
0
I(A : B)_{\Psi_0}
I
(
A

I
(
A

B
)
��
1
���
���
=
S
(
��
)
.
This reduction signifies that the bipartite entanglement between A and B is diminished.
Entropy of Qubit B
:
Despite the changes in the system, the entropy of qubit B remains unaffected. This stability in entropy indicates that qubit B's overall state hasn't been significantly altered by the CNOT gate.
Conversion of Entanglement
:
The interaction via the CNOT gate transforms the bipartite entanglement (between A and B) into tripartite entanglement (among A, B, and C). This is a key aspect of the QET protocol, as it redistributes the entanglement within the system.
Entanglement Breaking
:
Alice's measurement breaks the entanglement that qubit A had with its complement, qubit B. This breaking of entanglement is identified by Hotta as a characteristic of an effective measurement in the QET process.
Summary
In the "Post-Alice" phase of the QET protocol, the application of a CNOT gate, preceded by a Hadamard gate on the control qubit, leads to a redistribution of entanglement in the system. The mutual information between qubits A and B is reduced, reflecting a shift from bipartite to tripartite entanglement. This phase sets the stage for the next steps in the QET protocol, where the altered entanglement properties are crucial for the successful teleportation of energy.
