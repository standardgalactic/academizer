In a paper of 1974, Friedman posed a challenge for any coherent account of scientific, and thus presumably also mathematical, explanation: he argued that any such account needed to show how explanation generates understanding. “I don’t see how the philosopher of science can afford to ignore such concepts as ‘understanding’ and ‘intelligibility’ when giving a theory of the explanation relation” (Friedman 1974, 8). While externalist, or ontic, accounts do not directly concern themselves with Friedman’s challenge, they do not deny the link between explanation and understanding. However, they simply do not pose understanding as a defining characteristic of explanation. By contrast, internalist, or epistemic, accounts are those which directly address this challenge.

In the philosophy of science, one of the main conceptions of scientific understanding is the unificationist model which argues that explanations provide understanding by unifying different phenomena. Although the idea is undoubtedly intuitively appealing, the key question is whether the notion of unification can be made more precise so that we can distinguish between what an explanation is and what is not. Friedman (1974) is an early attempt to do this, although his formulation was quickly shown to suffer from several technical problems (see Kitcher 1976). Kitcher is, on the other hand, the main supporter of the unificationist approach. His proposal consists in looking at unification as the reduction of the number of argument patterns used in providing explanations while being as comprehensive as possible in the number of phenomena explained:

Understanding the phenomena is not simply a matter of reducing the “fundamental incomprehensibilities” but of seeing connections, common patterns, in what initially appeared to be different situations. Here the switch in conception from premise conclusion pairs to derivations proves vital. Science advances our understanding of nature by showing us how to derive descriptions of many phenomena, using the same patterns of derivation again and again, and, in demonstrating this, it teaches us how to reduce the number of types of facts that we have to accept as ultimate (or brute). So the criterion of unification I shall try to articulate will be based on the idea that E(K) is a set of derivations that makes the best tradeoff between minimizing the number of patterns of derivation employed and maximizing the number of conclusions generated. (Kitcher 1989, 432)
Let us make this a little bit more formal. Let us start with a set K of beliefs assumed to be consistent and deductively closed (informally one can think of this as a set of statements endorsed by an ideal scientific community at a specific moment in time; Kitcher 1981, 75). A systematization of K is any set of arguments that derive some sentences in K from other sentences of K. The explanatory store over K, E(K), is the best systematization of K (Kitcher here makes an idealization by claiming that E(K) is unique). Corresponding to different systematizations we have different degrees of unification. The highest degree of unification is that given by E(K). But according to what criteria can a systematization be judged to be the best? There are three factors: the number of patterns, the stringency of the patterns, and the set of consequences derivable from the unification.

Two remarks are in order when it comes to Kitcher’s proposal. First, his account of theoretical unification is mainly thought of for the general question of scientific explanation, although he sees as one of the virtues of his viewpoint to be extendable to mathematics as well. Secondly, Kitcher’s model is not meant to address the local question of what distinguishes an explanatory proof from one that does not explain (as all other accounts do); it rather provides a novel perspective on the global question of how to systemize a whole body of knowledge that has explanatory value. The application of Kitcher’s model to explanatory proofs has been explored in two opposite directions. On the one hand, Hafner and Mancosu (2008) tested Kitcher’s model with three different methods to prove theorems about real closed fields (see Brumfiel 1979); the authors showed that the model makes predictions about the explanatory power of these methods which contradicts judgments coming from the mathematical practice (See also Pincock 2015b). On the other hand, Frans (2021) not only reassesses the value of unificatory understanding, which it is a type of explanatory understanding, for mathematics; additionally, he shows through a plethora of different examples, ranging from Pythagoras’ theorem to the theorem that states that sum of the first n integers equals n(n+1)/2, that proofs can contribute to unificatory understanding.

A novel internalist account has recently been proposed by Inglis and Mejía-Ramos (2019), who apply Wilkenfeld’s functional model of understanding (see Wilkenfeld (2014)) to the mathematical case. Wilkenfield’s approach consists in reversing Friedman’s perspective: while Friedman demanded that philosophers clarify how explanations, suitably defined, generate understanding, Wilkenfield defines explanations as those things that generate understanding. By doing so, Wilkenfield moves the burden of clarification from the notion of explanation to that of understanding and how it is generated: this move – he argues – has recently become tenable as philosophical accounts of understanding have become more and more sophisticated.

In Inglis &amp; Mejía-Ramos (2019) the conception of understanding adopted is that of Kelp (2016), along with a modal model of the generation of understanding (see Atkinson and Shiffrin 1968). With these two elements at hand, Inglis &amp; Mejía-Ramos identify three properties that any mathematical explanatory proof is likely to have: (i) an explanatory proof would direct the reader’s attention to its conceptually important section; (ii) it would reorganize the new and existing information into coherent new schema; (iii) it would reduce the chances of working memory capacity to be exceeded.

Other internalist accounts of explanatory proof have been developed by Delarivière, Frans &amp; Kerkhove (2017), Dutilh Novaes (2018), and Lehet (2021).

3. Some connections to other debates
A number of fruitful studies have recently appeared connecting mathematical explanation to mathematical beauty, purity of methods, understanding in mathematics, mathematical style, and mathematical depth. We simply refer to one or two such background studies and encourage the reader to explore the bibliography of the studies referred to. The most extensive studies connecting mathematical beauty and explanation are Giaquinto (2016) and Lange (2016). The notion of purity of method has long been of interest to mathematicians and philosophers (see Detlefsen and Arana (2011) and Arana and Mancosu (2012)). Among the most recent contributions on purity and mathematical explanation are Skow (2015), Lange (2015b), Ryan (2021) and Arana (2023). The connection between mathematical explanation and understanding has been discussed in Molinini (2011), Cellucci (2014), and Delariviére et al. (2017). For connections between mathematical depth and mathematical explanation see Lange (2015c). Moreover, theorists of style in mathematics and science have emphasized the importance of explanatory arguments for characterizing style (see Mancosu (2021) for an overview).

The issues that have shaped the debates about mathematical explanation reviewed in sections 1 and 2 also arise in ongoing debates in the philosophy of mind and moral theory. For the philosophy of mind, one puzzle is how appealing to mental properties can explain human actions even though a human is a physical entity. If non-mental, physical properties are apt to explain any physical event or pattern of physical events, then it seems that mental properties are dispensable or “epiphenomenal”. For moral theory, a series of questions arise about how moral properties relate to the presumably non-moral features of the physical world. In terms of explanation, it seems like there is no explanatory work for moral properties to do, at least with respect to physical events. However, our ordinary practices frequently appeal to these properties in putative explanations. So, as with the philosophy of mind, it seems that we must either revise our explanatory practices or else find a place for these properties in a more comprehensive conception of reality.

Kim’s exclusion argument is a prominent driver of these debates in the philosophy of mind (Kim 2005). Kim argues that the existence of mental properties requires that these properties provide some genuine contribution to the explanation of physical events. However, Kim maintains that mental properties are excluded from this contribution by the causal closure of the physical, i.e. every physical event has a purely physical explanation. One response to Kim is that the right conception of causal explanation makes space for mental properties to explain (Shapiro &amp; Sober 2007, Woodward 2021b). The “explanatory autonomy” of the mental can thus be obtained in a way that parallels similar generalizations of causal explanation to allow for genuine mathematical explanations of physical phenomena (section 1.2). Pluralists about mathematical explanation can develop a different response to exclusion arguments: if explanations come in different kinds, then an explanation of one kind does not stand in the way of an explanation of another kind (Batterman 2021). Baker (2022) has pursued a different kind of response that compares Dennett’s intentional stance with a “mathematical stance” that enables mathematical explanations of physical phenomena.

Harman and Street have advanced explanatory challenges to moral properties that can be fruitfully compared to criticisms of the explanatory indispensability argument for mathematical platonism (Harman 1977, Street 2006). While Harman focuses on the explanation of moral observations (e.g. that some action is wrong), Street emphasizes a broader concern with explaining other phenomena such as the prevalence of some moral judgments (e.g. that murder is wrong). For both, the challenge is that the best explanation does not involve moral properties. That is, moral properties are explanatorily dispensable for the targets in question. As Sinclair and Leibowitz emphasize, this argument, and the responses to it, parallel debates about the explanatory dispensability of mathematical objects (Sinclair &amp; Leibowitz 2016). One innovation in the debate about moral properties is Enoch’s argument that it is sufficient for moral properties to be indispensable to practical deliberation. If this non-Quinean condition for ontological commitment is granted, then it may be feasible to identify new forms of explanatory indispensability for mathematical objects. For some investigations into how such arguments may or may not extend to mathematics, see Leng (2016), Baker (2016), Enoch (2016) and Clark-Doane (2020).</div></div></div><div class="flex

philosophical perspectives on the concept of mathematical explanation. More specifically, it elaborates on "internalist" models of mathematical explanation, which are concerned with how explanations generate understanding, and various debates connected to mathematical explanation.</p><p>The internalist models addressed include:</p><ol><li><p>The unificationist model, supported by Friedman and Kitcher, which suggests that explanations provide understanding by unifying different phenomena. This approach sees understanding as seeing connections and common patterns in what initially appeared as different situations.</p></li><li><p>The model proposed by Inglis and Mejía-Ramos, based on Wilkenfeld’s functional model of understanding. They define explanations as those things that generate understanding, moving the focus from the notion of explanation to the understanding and how it is generated.</p></li></ol><p>The text also connects the concept of mathematical explanation to other debates such as the connections between mathematical explanation and mathematical beauty, purity of methods, understanding in mathematics, mathematical style, and mathematical depth.</p><p>Furthermore, the debates surrounding mathematical explanation are shown to arise in other fields such as philosophy of mind and moral theory. Here, the explanatory value and role of mental and moral properties are discussed, drawing parallels with the challenges and responses in the context of mathematical explanation.</p><p>The text concludes by suggesting that the condition for ontological commitment may not be explanatory indispensability (as suggested by Quine), but rather indispensability to practical deliberation (as argued by Enoch). This shift opens up possibilities for new forms of explanatory indispensability for mathematical objects.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">should rather think of the notion of “conceptual grounding”, as developed by, e.g. Smithson (2020). This notion of ground has an illustrious pedigree in philosophers and mathematicians such as Bolzano (see Kitcher 1975, Mancosu 1999 and Sebestik 1992) or Cournot (see Mancosu 1999), and recent contributions have stressed its value in the mathematical realm (see Betti 2010, Detlefsen 1988, Jansson 2017, Pincock 2015b, Poggiolesi and Genco 2023). Indeed, just as in the scientific literature it is widely accepted that causal explanations track a causal relation in the world and explain by revealing the causes of why a certain fact holds, it seems reasonable to accept that (at least certain) mathematical explanatory proofs track a grounding relation in the mathematical realm and thus explain by mentioning the grounds or reasons why a theorem is true.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

suggests the notion of "conceptual grounding" as a potential framework for understanding mathematical explanation. Grounding, in this context, refers to the idea that explanations in mathematics might work by revealing the "grounds" or foundational reasons why a particular mathematical theorem holds true, in much the same way that causal explanations in science work by elucidating the causes of a particular phenomenon.</p><p>This idea of grounding has roots in the works of philosophers and mathematicians like Bernard Bolzano and Antoine Augustin Cournot. Bolzano is known for his substantial contributions to the foundations of mathematics, including the "Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem," which is a key result in real analysis. Cournot was a French mathematician and philosopher who made significant contributions to economics and probability theory.</p><p>More recent philosophers and mathematicians, such as Betti, Detlefsen, Jansson, Pincock, Poggiolesi, and Genco, have further explored the potential of grounding as a framework for mathematical explanation. The suggestion is that certain mathematical proofs may work by revealing grounding relations within the mathematical realm, in a way analogous to how scientific causal explanations reveal causal relationships in the physical world.</p><p>This perspective resonates with the internalist viewpoint discussed earlier, as it emphasizes understanding through revealing foundational structures and relations within the mathematical realm. However, it also introduces a new aspect of "conceptual grounding," which brings focus on the foundational principles or reasons for a theorem's validity as the basis for explanation and understanding.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Piccolomini in 1547. Piccolomini’s aim was to disarm a traditional claim to the effect that mathematics derives its certainty on account of its use of “scientific demonstrations” in the Aristotelean sense (such proofs were known as “potissimae” in the Renaissance). Since “potissimae” demonstrations had to be causal, Piccolomini attacked the argument by arguing that mathematical demonstrations are not causal. This led to one of the most interesting epistemological debates of the Renaissance and the seventeenth century. Those denying the “causality” of mathematical demonstrations (Piccolomini, Pereyra, Gassendi etc.) argued by providing specific examples of demonstrations from mathematical practice (usually from Euclid’s Elements) which, they claimed, could not be reconstructed as causal reasonings in the Aristotelian sense. By contrast, those hoping to restore “causality” to mathematics aimed at showing that the alleged counterexamples could easily be accommodated within the realm of “causal” demonstrations (Clavius, Barrow, etc.). Interestingly, both positions in the debate assumed that mathematical proofs could be syllogized (Mancosu &amp; Mugnai 2023). The historical developments have been presented in detail in Mancosu 1996 and Mancosu 2000.

What is more important here is to appreciate that the basic intuition – the contraposition between explanatory and non-explanatory demonstrations – had a long and successful history that has influenced both mathematical and philosophical developments well beyond the seventeenth century. For instance, Mancosu 1999 shows that Bolzano and Cournot, two major philosophers of mathematics in the nineteenth century, construe the central problem of philosophy of mathematics as that of accounting for the distinction between explanatory and non-explanatory demonstrations. In the case of Bolzano this takes the form of a theory of Grund (ground) and Folge (consequence). Kitcher 1975 was the first to read Bolzano as propounding a theory of mathematical explanations (see Betti 2010 and Roski 2017 for recent contributions). In the case of Cournot this is spelled out in terms of the opposition between “ordre logique” and “ordre rationelle” (see Cournot 1851). In Bolzano’s case, the aim of providing a reconstruction of parts of analysis and geometry, so that the exposition would use only “explanatory” proofs, also led to major mathematical results, such as his purely analytic proof of the intermediate value theorem.

In conclusion to this section, we should also point out that there is another tradition of thinking of explanation in mathematics that includes Mill, Lakatos, Russell and Gödel. These authors are motivated by a conception of mathematics (and/or its foundations) as hypothetico-deductive in nature and this leads them to construe mathematical activity in analogy with how explanatory hypotheses occur in science (see Mancosu 2001 for more details). Related to inductivism are Cellucci 2008, 2017, which emphasize the connection between mathematical explanation and discovery.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

discusses the historical debate over the nature of mathematical demonstration, especially its relationship to the concept of "causality." The debate began with Alessandro Piccolomini in 1547, who refuted the idea that the certainty of mathematics is derived from its use of "scientific demonstrations" in the Aristotelean sense. This Aristotelean conception of demonstration involved a notion of causality, and Piccolomini argued that mathematical demonstrations did not have this causal nature.</p><p>Different philosophers and mathematicians took sides in this debate. Some, like Piccolomini, Pereyra, and Gassendi, denied the causality of mathematical demonstrations and provided specific mathematical examples that they claimed could not be interpreted in causal terms. Others, like Clavius and Barrow, sought to restore causality to mathematics by arguing that the counterexamples provided could still fit within the framework of causal demonstration.</p><p>This debate over the nature of mathematical demonstration had a significant impact on the development of both mathematics and philosophy beyond the seventeenth century. Bernard Bolzano and Antoine Augustin Cournot, two prominent nineteenth-century philosophers of mathematics, framed the central problem of philosophy of mathematics as understanding the distinction between explanatory and non-explanatory demonstrations.</p><p>In Bolzano's approach, this distinction was expressed through a theory of "Grund" (ground) and "Folge" (consequence). Cournot viewed it in terms of the contrast between "ordre logique" (logical order) and "ordre rationelle" (rational order).</p><p>Moreover, the text mentions another line of thought represented by philosophers such as Mill, Lakatos, Russell, and Gödel, who construed mathematical activity in analogy with how explanatory hypotheses occur in science, emphasizing a hypothetico-deductive nature of mathematics and its foundations.</p><p>Finally, the passage mentions the works of Carlo Cellucci, which highlight the connection between mathematical explanation and discovery, representing an inductivist perspective.</p><p>Overall, this historical account underscores the ongoing debate over the nature of explanation in mathematics and how these differing perspectives have influenced the development of mathematics and its philosophy.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Not all externalist models for mathematical explanations are modifications of Steiner’s theory or conveyed in counterfactual terms. Pincock (2015b) for example proposes to classify a proof as explanatory when it invokes more abstract kind of entities than the topic of the theorem it proves. Wilhelm (2021) and Poggiolesi (2023) contain different proposals for the analysis of explanatory proofs that are similar in perspective to Pincock’s approach. In their cases the determination of the explanatory power of different proofs requires a formalization of the proofs in logical systems. While for Wilhelm (2021) the explanatory power of a proof comes from the balance between the simplicity and the depth of the formalized proof, Poggiolesi (2023) distinguishes an explanatory proof from a non-explanatory one in that only in the (formalized version of the) former one can witness an increase of conceptual complexity from the assumptions to the theorem the proof aims to establish.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

mathematics and philosophy, various externalist models aim to understand the nature of mathematical explanation. As you've mentioned, not all of these models derive from the theory proposed by Mark Steiner or rely on counterfactual considerations.</p><p>According to Chris Pincock's model (2015b), a proof is classified as explanatory when it uses more abstract entities than the ones involved in the theorem it proves. This perspective focuses on the abstraction level involved in the explanatory process.</p><p>Mathematical philosophers Wilhelm (2021) and Francesca Poggiolesi (2023) propose alternative models for analyzing explanatory proofs, both bearing similarities to Pincock's approach. Their models require a formalization of the proofs in logical systems to ascertain their explanatory power.</p><p>For Wilhelm, the explanatory power of a proof hinges on achieving a balance between the simplicity and the depth of the formalized proof. Simplicity and depth here may be understood as measures of how efficiently a proof expresses its result and how far the result extends into the structure of the mathematical field, respectively.</p><p>In contrast, Poggiolesi differentiates between explanatory and non-explanatory proofs based on an increase in conceptual complexity from the assumptions to the theorem in the proof's formalized version. For Poggiolesi, an explanatory proof demonstrates a growth in complexity as it moves from its initial premises to the conclusion it establishes.</p><p>These theories all seek to uncover what makes a mathematical proof explanatory, though they approach this question from different angles and with different emphases. They reflect the ongoing discourse about the nature of mathematical explanation and its important implications for the philosophy of mathematics.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">explains this symmetry? A non-explanatory proof can be given by algebraic manipulations but this does not reveal the reason for the result which, according to Lange, is the fact that the axioms of complex arithmetic are invariant under substitution of i for -i. Bueno and Vivanco (2019) points out that it is unclear why what Lange isolates as the symmetric feature of the proof (which makes it explanatory) is a symmetry at all. They suggest that this proof turns on an appropriate feature of the relevant structure.

Other instances of the bottom-up approach may be found in Paseau (2010), Arana &amp; Mancosu (2012), Colyvan, Cusberg &amp; McQueen (2018), D’Alessandro (2021) and Ryan (2021). Each article considers an aspect of mathematical practice and tries to address it on its own terms.

Top-down approaches take their start from a general theory of mathematical explanation and then explore how well the practice fits the model. A typical example of a top-down approach in mathematical explanation is Kitcher’s unificationist theory, to be discussed below. But one can also apply this description to overarching views on the nature of explanation. While there are several examples one could mention, here we present an influential proposal that finds its origin in Kim (1994). In order to classify the different accounts of scientific explanation Kim uses the contraposition between ‘explanatory internalism’ and ‘explanatory externalism.’ Whereas for ‘explanatory internalism’ explanations are activities internal to an epistemic corpus (a theory or set of beliefs), an ‘explanatory externalist’ will look for some systematic pattern of objective dependence relations which explanations track or can be identified with. We divide the present section in two subsections that follow this division: one will be dedicated to the presentation of the externalist, or ontic, accounts of explanatory mathematical proofs, while the other to the internalist, or epistemic, ones. Among the externalist accounts, we will discuss Steiner’s theory, several counterfactual theories of mathematical explanation, and some other proposals. Among internalist accounts we will discuss Kitcher’s theory, together with two novel ones proposed by Frans (2021) and Inglis &amp; Mejía-Ramos (2019).</div></div></div><div class="flex

primary approaches to understanding mathematical explanation: the bottom-up and the top-down approaches.</p><p>Bottom-up approaches start from particular instances in mathematical practice, examining each one to try to identify explanatory patterns or structures. Lange's interpretation of Euler's formula represents this type of approach. According to Lange, the formula's explanatory power stems from the symmetry found in the axioms of complex arithmetic under the substitution of i for -i. Bueno and Vivanco (2019), however, challenge Lange's argument, claiming it's unclear why Lange's identified feature is considered a symmetry.</p><p>Other scholars, such as Paseau (2010), Arana &amp; Mancosu (2012), Colyvan, Cusberg &amp; McQueen (2018), D’Alessandro (2021), and Ryan (2021), also employ bottom-up approaches to address mathematical explanation in their respective works.</p><p>On the other hand, top-down approaches begin with a general theory of mathematical explanation and then assess how well actual mathematical practice aligns with this theory. For example, Kitcher's unificationist theory is one such model of top-down approach. Similarly, Jaegwon Kim's proposal of 'explanatory internalism' versus 'explanatory externalism' represents a top-down perspective.</p><p>'Explanatory internalism' considers explanations to be activities internal to a theory or set of beliefs. In contrast, 'explanatory externalism' seeks patterns of objective dependence relations that explanations can track or be identified with.</p><p>This perspective leads us to categorize theories of mathematical explanation into two main categories: externalist (or ontic) accounts and internalist (or epistemic) accounts.</p><p>Externalist accounts include theories like Steiner's model, counterfactual theories, and others, which view explanations as external to the body of mathematical knowledge, involving objective structures or relations in the world.</p><p>Internalist accounts, on the other hand, such as Kitcher's theory and those proposed by Frans (2021) and Inglis &amp; Mejía-Ramos (2019), view explanations as arising within the context of a given body of mathematical knowledge.</p><p>Both approaches have their merits and are continuously evolving to better account for the nature of mathematical explanation.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Mathematical Explanation
First published Sun Apr 6, 2008; substantive revision Fri Jul 21, 2023
The philosophical analysis of mathematical explanation concerns itself with two different, although connected, areas of investigation. The first area addresses the problem of whether mathematics can play an explanatory role in the natural and social sciences. The second deals with the problem of whether mathematical explanation occurs within mathematics itself. Accordingly, this entry surveys the contributions to both areas, it shows their relevance to the history of philosophy, mathematics, and science, it articulates their connection, and points to the philosophical pay-offs to be expected by deepening our understanding of the topic.

Mathematical explanation in the empirical sciences
Nearly all of our most successful empirical sciences employ a great deal of mathematics. In addition, scientists often emphasize the value of explaining some phenomenon that they have discovered. It is natural to wonder, then, if mathematics is well-suited to contribute to the explanation of natural phenomena and what these contributions might be. In the philosophy of science most accounts of explanation identify an explanation with an appropriate description of a cause (see Salmon 1984, Cartwright 1989, Woodward 2003, Strevens 2008, and Beebee, Hitchcock &amp; Menzies 2010 for an overview). Nearly everyone can admit that mathematical tools are an excellent means of tracking or representing causes. For example, mathematics can be used to explain why Halley’s comet’s orbit has a period of 75 years. Much of the debate about mathematical explanation in the empirical sciences has focused on more contentious cases: what role might mathematics play in non-causal explanations, if there are any, and how might these cases challenge this or that account of causal explanation (Reutlinger &amp; Saatsi 2018)?</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

For instance, in astronomy, the periodicity of Halley’s Comet, with an orbital period of approximately 75 years, can be explained using mathematical calculations and predictions derived from the laws of physics.</p><p>However, the role of mathematics in explanations isn't limited to cause and effect representations.

For example, why can we not divide our 23 strawberries equally among three friends (Lange 2013), or why can we arrange 81 stamps into a 9 by 9 array? The legitimate explanations seem to be that 23 is not divisible by 3 without remainder and that Neither mathematical fact is a cause of the feature of the process in question, so we seem to have a non-causal explanation where mathematics is part of the explanation. The possibility or impossibility of other processes are explained by other areas of mathematics that investigate structures or formal features of natural systems. For example, why can we not make a circuit of the bridges of Königsberg that involves crossing each of the bridges exactly once (Pincock 2007, Molinini 2012)? This is explained by the abstract structure of the bridge network. Why is it possible for there to be stable planetary orbits? One explanation that has been proposed appeals to the dimensions of space-time (Woodward 2003).</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

necessarily involve direct causal relationships, but rather rely on the intrinsic properties and structures defined by mathematics.</p><ol><li><p>The case of dividing 23 strawberries equally among three friends, and arranging 81 stamps into a 9 by 9 array: These situations draw upon basic principles of number theory. The mathematical fact that 23 is not divisible by 3 without a remainder, and that 81 is a perfect square, are not "causes" in a traditional sense. Still, they explain why certain arrangements or divisions are possible or impossible. The mathematical properties of the numbers involved govern the feasible outcomes.</p></li><li><p>The example of Euler's Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem: The impossibility of walking through the city and crossing each bridge once and only once, is explained by principles from graph theory, a branch of mathematics. The "cause" of the impossibility is not found in the physical characteristics of the bridges or the city, but in the abstract structure of the network of bridges, represented mathematically as a graph.</p></li><li><p>The existence of stable planetary orbits and the dimensionality of space-time: This is a deeper and more abstract example, where the stability of orbits is linked to the mathematical structure of the universe itself, specifically the dimensions of space-time. The explanation doesn't involve a traditional cause-and-effect chain, but rather an understanding of the mathematical framework that defines the universe.</p></li></ol><p>In all these examples, the explanations are rooted in the properties, structures, or constraints defined by mathematics. Thus, these are non-causal explanations where mathematics plays an integral role, demonstrating how mathematics can provide insight and explanation into various phenomena, from the mundane to the cosmological.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Another kind of non-causal mathematical explanation deals with a striking or surprising feature of a phenomenon, where that feature can be identified through a mathematical analysis of the situation. The feature may be tied to a minimization process, or be especially resilient or stable for what is arguably a mathematical reason. Perhaps the most discussed case is the length in years of the life-cycle of three species of periodic cicada: why are these lengths either 13 or 17 years (Baker 2005, 2017)? An explanation is that 13 and 17 are prime numbers and that prime numbered life-cycles confer a relative fitness advantage in avoiding predators and competition for scarce resources like food. Other broadly evolutionary cases include the hexagonal shape of honeycomb cells (Lyon &amp; Colyvan 2008, Räz 2017, Wakil &amp; Justus 2017) and the pattern of seeds in a sunflower (Lyon 2012). There is an extensive literature on how these optimality explanations might work in biology and economics (Potochnik 2007, Rice 2015, 2021). However, this explanatory contribution from mathematics can be found in other domains as well. For example, why do soap films obey Plateau’s laws (Lyon 2012, Pincock 2015a)? This can be explained through a process of surface minimization, subject to constraints. The mathematics of the situation is central to the character that the laws take on. Other cases turn on a mathematical analysis of the stability or instability of some process. For example, why do the so-called Kirkwood gaps appear in our solar system’s asteroid belt (Colyvan 2010)? Occupying some spatial regions is unstable, so that an asteroid that starts in such a region is overwhelmingly likely to leave it. Similar analyses explain patterns in the rings of Saturn or the collapse of an engineered structure like a bridge. (See also Ashbaugh, Chicone &amp; Cushman 1991, Colyvan 2001, Lipton 2004, Baker 2015a and Lange 2017 for a range of other examples.)</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

further illustrate the explanatory power of mathematics in various phenomena, even where traditional causality might not be directly involved. This is particularly evident in cases where specific features of a phenomenon can be traced back to mathematical properties or principles. Here's a summary of your examples:</p><ol><li><p>The life cycle of cicadas: The 13 and 17 year life-cycles of certain cicada species can be explained by the mathematical property of primality. Prime numbers have the unique property of being divisible only by 1 and themselves, reducing the opportunities for predators or competitors to synchronize with the cicada life-cycle. This confers a survival advantage on the cicadas, demonstrating how mathematical properties can indirectly shape biological evolution.</p></li><li><p>Honeycomb structure and sunflower seed patterns: These examples show how mathematical principles of optimality and efficiency can manifest in biological structures. The hexagonal structure of honeycombs maximizes storage while minimizing construction material, an efficient solution that aligns with principles of geometric packing. Sunflower seed patterns, following the Fibonacci sequence, optimize the packing of seeds in the flower head. These examples show how biological systems often align with mathematical optimization principles, leading to specific, predictable patterns.</p></li><li><p>Plateau’s laws and soap films: The properties of soap films, which follow Plateau's laws, are explained by mathematical principles of minimization. The shape of the soap film minimizes the surface area given the constraints, which can be demonstrated mathematically.</p></li><li><p>Kirkwood gaps and spatial patterns: The Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt and the patterns in Saturn's rings can be explained by mathematical analyses of stability. Certain spatial regions are mathematically unstable, making it likely that an object starting in these regions will eventually leave.</p></li></ol><p>These examples further illustrate how mathematics can provide explanations for various phenomena, from biology to astronomy, often highlighting surprising or non-intuitive patterns and behaviors.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">1.1 Some historical remarks
Does mathematics help explain the physical world or does it actually hinder a grasp of the physical mechanisms that explain the how and why of natural phenomena? It is not possible here to treat this topic in its full complexity but a few remarks will help the reader appreciate the historical importance of the question.

Aristotle describes his ideal of scientific knowledge in “Posterior Analytics” in terms of, among other things, knowledge of the cause:

We suppose ourselves to possess unqualified scientific knowledge of a thing, as opposed to knowing it in the accidental way in which the sophist knows, when we think that we know the cause on which the fact depends as the cause of the fact and of no other, and further, that the fact could not be other than it is. (BWA, 111, Post. An. I.1, 71b 5–10)
The causes [aitia] in question are the four Aristotelian causes: formal, material, efficient, and final. Nowadays, translators and commentators of Aristotle prefer to translate aition [aitia] as ‘explanation[s]’, so that the theory of the four causes becomes an account of four types of explanations. For instance, here is Barnes’ translation of the passage quoted earlier: “We think we understand a thing simpliciter (and not in the sophistic fashion accidentally) whenever we think we are aware both that the explanation because of which the object is is its explanation, and that it is not possible for this to be otherwise.” (CWA, 115, Post. An. I.1, 71b 5–10)</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

around the role of mathematics in explaining physical phenomena is fascinating and has long roots reaching back to classical philosophy. Aristotle’s conception of scientific knowledge, as described in "Posterior Analytics," relies heavily on understanding the causes or explanations (aitia) of things. These explanations are categorized into four types, often referred to as Aristotle's four causes:</p><ol><li><p>Formal cause: This refers to the pattern or idea that describes the essence of something. For instance, the formal cause of a statue is the idea or design of the statue in the sculptor's mind.</p></li><li><p>Material cause: This is the physical substance or matter from which something is made. For the statue, this would be the marble or bronze from which it was sculpted.</p></li><li><p>Efficient cause: This is the process or agent that brings something into being. In the case of the statue, the efficient cause is the sculptor who shaped the material into the desired form.</p></li><li><p>Final cause: This is the purpose, goal, or end for which something is made. For the statue, the final cause could be to commemorate an individual or event, or to provide aesthetic enjoyment.</p></li></ol><p>Today, the term "cause" in this context is often translated as "explanation," reflecting the idea that understanding something requires knowing why it is as it is and could not be otherwise. This repositioning from "cause" to "explanation" has significant implications for the role of mathematics. While mathematics might not directly cause a physical phenomenon, it can provide a</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">But how do we obtain scientific knowledge? Scientific knowledge is obtained through demonstration. However, not all logically cogent proofs provide us with the kind of demonstration that yields scientific knowledge. In a scientific demonstration “the premisses must be true, primary, immediate, better known and prior to the conclusion, which is further related to them as effect to causes.” (BWA, 112, Post. An. I.1, 71b 20–25) In Barnes’ translation: “If, then, understanding is as we posited, it is necessary for demonstrative understanding in particular to depend on things which are true and primitive and immediate and more familiar than and prior to and explanatory of the conclusion.” (CWA, 115, Post. An. I.1, 71b 20–25)

Accordingly, in “Posterior Analytics” I.13, Aristotle distinguished between demonstrations “of the fact” and demonstrations “of the reasoned fact”. Although both are logically cogent only the latter mirror the causal structure of the phenomena under investigation, and thus provide us with knowledge. We can call them, respectively, “non-explanatory” and “explanatory” demonstrations.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center

They reveal the underlying reasons or causes of the fact, providing a deeper level of understanding.

The depth and quality of this understanding depends on the nature of the demonstration - whether it merely presents the fact, or goes deeper to reveal the underlying reasons or causes.</p><p>This distinction still plays a significant role in our understanding of the nature of scientific explanation today. The challenge in the philosophy of mathematics is to identify which mathematical proofs or models provide merely "non-explanatory" demonstrations of mathematical facts, and which ones provide "explanatory" demonstrations that give us a deeper understanding of the mathematical phenomena they describe.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">In Aristotle’s system, physics was not mathematized although causal reasonings were proper to it. However, Aristotle also discussed extensively the so-called mixed sciences, such as optics, harmonics, and mechanics, characterizing them as “the more physical of the mathematical sciences”. There is a relation of subordination between these mixed sciences and areas of pure mathematics (see Dear 2011). For instance, harmonics is subordinated to arithmetic and optics to geometry. Aristotle is in no doubt that there are mathematical explanations of physical phenomena:

For here it is for the empirical scientist to know the fact and for the mathematical to know the reason why; for the latter have the demonstrations of the explanations, and often they do not know the fact, just as those who consider the universal often do not know some of the particulars through lack of observation. (CWA, vol. I, 128, Post. An. I.13, 79a1–79a7)
However, the topic of whether mathematics could give explanations of natural phenomena was one on which there was disagreement. As the domains to which mathematics could be applied grew, so also did the resistance to it. One source of tension consisted in trying to reconcile the Aristotelian conception of pure mathematics, as abstracting from matter and motion, with the fact that both physics (natural philosophy) and the mixed sciences are all conversant about natural phenomena and thus dependent on matter and motion. For instance, an important debate in the Renaissance, known as the Quaestio de Certitudine Mathematicarum, focused in large part on whether mathematics could play the explanatory role assigned to it by Aristotle (Mancuso 1996, ch. 1). Some argued that lacking causality, mathematics could not be the ‘explanatory’ link in the explanation of natural phenomena (see also sections 1.2 and 1.3).</div></div></div><div class="flex

mathematics can provide explanations of natural phenomena dates back to Aristotle and has continued throughout history. Despite acknowledging that there are mathematical explanations of physical phenomena, Aristotle saw tension in reconciling the abstract nature of pure mathematics with the material and motion-dependent aspects of physics and mixed sciences.</p><p>For Aristotle, the role of mathematicians was to know the reasons behind phenomena, while the role of empirical scientists was to know the facts. However, this view was not universally accepted. The Quaestio de Certitudine Mathematicarum, a significant debate in the Renaissance, largely centered on the explanatory role of mathematics as suggested by Aristotle.</p><p>Some argued that because mathematics lacks causality – a critical component of Aristotle's conception of scientific knowledge – it cannot be the 'explanatory' link in the explanation of natural phenomena. This view suggests that while mathematics can describe phenomena and reveal relationships between variables, it cannot explain why those relationships exist in the first place.</p><p>However, the growth of areas where mathematics could be applied brought increasing resistance to this view. As more physical and natural phenomena were being successfully modeled and predicted using mathematical principles, it became increasingly hard to deny the explanatory power of mathematics.</p><p>The debate over the explanatory role of mathematics thus reflects a deeper question about the nature of scientific explanation itself: should explanation necessarily involve causal relationships (as Aristotle argued), or can non-causal relationships (as often featured in mathematical models) also provide genuine explanations of natural phenomena? Different philosophical perspectives provide different answers to this question, and this debate continues in contemporary philosophy of science and mathematics.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">One of the major theses of the book is that unification and explanation often pull in different directions and come apart (contrary to what is claimed by unification theories of explanation). One of the examples discussed in her introduction reminds us of Castel’s objections:

Another example is the unification of terrestrial and celestial phenomena in Newton’s Principia. Although influenced by Cartesian mechanics, one of the most striking features of the Principia is its move away from explanations of planetary motions in terms of mechanical causes. Instead, the mathematical form of force is highlighted; the planetary ellipses discovered by Kepler are “explained” in terms of a mathematical description of the force that produces those motions. Of course, the inverse-square law of gravitational attraction explains why the planets move in the way they do, but there is no explanation of how this gravitational force acts on bodies (how it is transported), nor is there any account of its causal properties.

Margaret Morrison's critique of the unification theories of explanation. These theories suggest that the power of a scientific theory lies in its ability to unify diverse phenomena under a common framework. Morrison's critique challenges this perspective, arguing that unification and explanation can diverge and don't always coincide.</p><p>The example she cites involves Newton's "Principia," where terrestrial and celestial phenomena are unified under the law of universal gravitation. Newton's law mathematically describes the force that produces planetary motions and explains why the planets move as they do. However, as Morrison points out, it doesn't explain how this gravitational force is transmitted or reveal any of its causal properties.</p><p>In this context, while Newton's law does achieve unification by describing both terrestrial and celestial phenomena with the same principles, it does not fully explain these phenomena because it doesn't answer all the "how" and "why" questions about the cause and mechanisms of gravitational force.</p><p>Morrison's critique underscores the complexity of the relationship between unification and explanation in the philosophy of science. While unification can be a feature of powerful scientific theories, it is not the same as providing a full causal explanation of the phenomena those theories describe.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">relating a map to some country may be fairly complicated, and involve various conventions for what symbols on the map indicate about the country. Some authors associate the relations that agents establish between model and target with inferential principles (Bueno &amp; Colyvan 2011, Bueno &amp; French 2018). So according to these various proposals, a model explains a feature of a target when either some representational relationship or inferential licenses from model to target have been established by agents, and these connections genuinely explain that feature (e.g. they are causes of the feature). For example, a suitably interpreted map can explain the impossibility of train travel between two cities by accurately representing the train network that fails to link those cites.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white

authors are discussing the role of models in scientific explanation, specifically as it relates to representation and inference. In many scientific and mathematical contexts, models are used to represent a target phenomenon, much like a map represents a geographical area. A model can be a physical or mathematical structure that captures key aspects of the phenomenon it represents.</p><p>The authors mention that the relationship between a model and the target phenomenon might be established through conventions, like symbols on a map that indicate specific features of the terrain. Some theorists propose that these representational relationships can be associated with inferential principles.</p><p>In this view, a model can explain a feature of its target phenomenon if two conditions are met: (1) the model accurately represents that feature, and (2) agents can use the model to make valid inferences about the target.</p><p>For instance, a map of a rail network can explain why it is impossible to travel by train between two cities. If the map accurately represents the rail network and there's no rail link between these two cities, then an agent can infer from the map that train travel between the cities is impossible. The map-model, in this case, provides an explanation for the impossibility of train travel between the cities, not by identifying a cause, but by illustrating a state of affairs - the absence of a train link.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">The different approaches to explanation surveyed in section 1.2 can then be used to identify explanatory models and what they explain. A mechanist about explanation can allow that mathematical models explain by representing mechanisms, while difference-making views will require an explanatory model to represent difference-making, i.e. how changing factor will go along with a change in outcome . All of these proposals will argue that scientific models do not need to be true in order to explain. All that needs to occur is for the model to provide some truths by representing the right things about the target. So the presence of falsehoods that the model also provides about the target does not stand in the way of the model’s explanatory power.

This approach to explanatory models and idealization has been called into question by Batterman. One argument from Batterman is that there are explanatory models that do not explain in virtue of an element of the model representing some explanatorily relevant factor such as a cause or more exotic non-causal difference maker. Instead, in such cases, “while we have a genuine mathematical explanation of physical phenomena, there is no appeal to the existence of mathematical entities or their properties. Instead, the appeal is to a mathematical idealization resulting from a limit operation that relates one model … to another” (2010, 7–8). The case that Batterman is discussing here involves an operation (known as taking the thermodynamic limit) that transforms a “finite statistical mechanical model” into a “continuum thermodynamic model”. This is central to the explanation of the universality of some features of phase transitions that include liquid/gas transitions and magnetization. The features are universal in the sense that they arise across systems with very different microphysical features, and so seem especially puzzling.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

various views about the nature of explanation in science, and how these views relate to the use of models in scientific reasoning. It begins by stating that according to different theories of explanation, different requirements may be placed on what counts as an explanatory model. For instance, those who favor a "mechanistic" view of explanation might insist that an explanatory model must represent some kind of mechanism or causal process. On the other hand, those who favor a "difference-making" view of explanation might insist that an explanatory model must represent how changes in one factor lead to changes in another.</p><p>Importantly, it is pointed out that according to these views, a scientific model doesn't have to be completely accurate or true to be explanatory. Rather, it needs to provide some truths by accurately representing the right things about the phenomenon it's being used to explain. The presence of some inaccuracies or "falsehoods" in the model does not necessarily undermine its explanatory power.</p><p>However, the passage goes on to mention an alternative view proposed by Robert Batterman. Batterman argues that there are some cases in which models explain phenomena not by accurately representing certain features of those phenomena, but through the use of mathematical idealizations and limit operations that relate one model to another. In these cases, the explanation is based not on the model's representational accuracy, but on its mathematical structure. Batterman's example involves the explanation of certain features of phase transitions (like liquid/gas transitions and magnetization), which are universal across a variety of different physical systems and therefore cannot be explained simply in terms of the specific microphysical features of those systems. Instead, the explanation involves taking a limit in the context of a mathematical model that describes these systems.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">One point that Batterman is making here is that mathematical operations that connect models can be significant for a mathematical explanation of an empirical phenomena (see also Batterman &amp; Rice 2014, Batterman 2019, Batterman 2021). The defenders of traditional approaches to model explanation often focus on cases where a single mathematical structure is used to explain. However, the basic ideas of the traditional approach can be extended to deal with the explanatory significance of some mathematical operations. For example, one mathematical model may be transformed into another mathematical model through a mathematical operation. If this operation reflects something of explanatory significance, then the two models and the operation connecting them may be central to the explanation. Some idealizations are associated with these operations, as in the case where an ocean is treated as infinitely deep or a planet is modeled as a point particle. In such cases, the operations function by changing or removing the interpretation of the elements of the model.

Batterman also develops another point that poses a more significant challenge to traditional approaches to model explanation. This is that the “mathematical idealization” that results from this operation, and that is tied to one of these models, is essential to the whole explanation. In the ocean case, there is no temptation to say that the ocean being infinitely deep in one model is explanatorily relevant to the character of the waves on the surface of the actual ocean. All that this idealization turns on is that the depth is above some threshold. Other cases can be handled using similar “Galilean” idealizations that eliminate the falsehood from the genuine explanation (Weisberg 2007). But in Batterman’s cases, such as the phase transition case, he is clear that he takes the idealization to be essential to the explanation: “These nontraditional idealizations play essential explanatory roles involving operations or mathematical processes without representing the system(s) in question” (2010, 23). If this point is accepted, then these cases would undermine the scope of the traditional approach.

In the philosophy of physics there has been an extensive discussion of how essential these idealizations are to the explanations in question (Belot 2005, Bokulich 2008, Norton 2012, Lange 2015a, Franklin 2018, Sullivan 2019, Strevens 2019, Rodriguez 2021. See also Easwaran et al. 2021). Some critics of Batterman have argued that these cases can be dealt with using explanations that avoid these idealizations or that treat these idealizations in the manner that we treated the infinitely deep ocean. Other critics of Batterman have argued that a more selective approach to what these models represent allows one to admit that the idealizations are essential to generating the explanation, but that they are not literally to be included in the explanation itself. For example, a counterfactual approach to these cases would identify the explanation with some counterfactuals that are generated by the model. Batterman and others, in turn, have responded that all of these criticisms fail to do justice to the phenomena in question or what scientists say about their explanations (Morrison 2018, Batterman 2019, McKenna 2021).</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

on Robert Batterman's argument that mathematical operations connecting models can be essential for a mathematical explanation of empirical phenomena. Traditionally, the explanatory significance of models is analyzed in terms of a single mathematical structure, but Batterman argues that in some cases, the explanatory power comes from the mathematical operation that transforms one model into another. Some cases might involve idealizations, such as treating an ocean as infinitely deep or a planet as a point particle, which serve to change or remove the interpretation of the elements of the model.</p><p>The second part of Batterman's argument poses a significant challenge to traditional views on model explanation. Batterman posits that these mathematical idealizations are essential to the explanation. For example, in the case of phase transitions, he argues that the idealization (such as considering an infinitely large system) is not merely a simplification but plays an essential explanatory role without directly representing the physical system in question.</p><p>This argument has sparked considerable debate in the philosophy of physics, with critics suggesting that the same phenomena can be explained without resorting to such idealizations, or that a more selective approach to what these models represent could solve the problem. Some critics propose a counterfactual approach that ties the explanation to hypothetical situations generated by the model, rather than the idealizations themselves.</p><p>In response, Batterman and others argue that these criticisms do not adequately address the phenomena in question or align with scientists' explanations. In other words, they argue that these idealizations are indispensable and cannot be eliminated from the explanations without losing crucial insights.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">We ought to have ontological commitment to mathematical entities (Colyvan 2001, 11).
This notion of ontological commitment was first articulated by Quine (Quine 2004, Putnam 2010). These commitments reflect what one should believe exists. Premise 1 is tied to a naturalistic approach to these beliefs that claims they should be determined by the character of our best scientific theories. For Quine, one’s ontological commitments are settled by the best regimentation of one’s scientific theories into first-order logic, where what makes a regimentation the best is determined by ordinary scientific criteria like consistency and simplicity. Some of Colyvan’s cases in his book invoked the explanatory contribution that mathematical entities make to our best theories. If we suppose that one aim of science is to explain, then a regimentation may be the best in part because it affords explanations of various scientific phenomena.</div></div></div><div class="flex

upon ideas first articulated by W.V. Quine, argues for ontological commitment to mathematical entities. In philosophy, "ontological commitment" refers to the assertion that a particular kind of entity objectively exists. In other words, when one has an ontological commitment to something, they are asserting that this thing is part of the fundamental structure of the world.</p><p>Quine's approach to ontological commitments was tied to his naturalism, the view that philosophical inquiries should be closely aligned with the methods and results of the empirical sciences. According to Quine, one's ontological commitments are determined by the best formulation of one's scientific theories into first-order logic. What constitutes the "best" formulation is determined by standard scientific criteria such as consistency and simplicity.</p><p>Colyvan extends this idea by suggesting that mathematical entities should be included in our ontological commitments because they play an explanatory role in our best scientific theories. In other words, because mathematical entities help us explain various phenomena, we should consider them as real and existing entities. This perspective is grounded in the belief that one of the key goals of science is to explain phenomena, and that any entities that facilitate this goal should be considered as part of our ontological commitments.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">explanation is of key importance in this debate” (Baker 2005, 225). The appeal to IBE avoids the Quinean process of regimentation by directing our attention to some explanatory target such as the length of the life-cycles of some species of cicada. If we are scientific realists, then we accept the use of IBE in support of our claims about the existence of various entities. So if we find that the best explanation also includes abstract objects like prime numbers, then we should also accept their existence.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

discusses Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE), which is an important tool in the philosophy of science. According to IBE, when we have a range of possible explanations for a certain phenomenon, we should infer that the explanation that would, if true, best explain the phenomenon, is the correct one. This is based on the idea that the world is rational and comprehensible, and thus the best explanation is likely to be the correct one.</p><p>Alan Baker's statement suggests that IBE plays a crucial role in the debate over the existence of abstract entities such as mathematical objects. This ties in with the philosophy of scientific realism, which maintains that our best scientific theories give us true or approximately true descriptions of the world, including both observable and unobservable aspects of it.</p><p>The argument, as laid out here, is that if we are scientific realists and accept IBE as a valid method of inference, then when we find that the best explanation of a certain phenomenon includes references to abstract objects such as prime numbers, we should accept their existence. In other words, if the existence of such objects is part of the best explanation for a phenomenon, then, according to the principles of scientific realism and IBE, we should infer that these abstract objects truly exist.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">overview of these debates).

A third kind of worry about premise 2′ is developed by mathematical fictionalists like Yablo and Leng (Leng 2010, 2021, Yablo 2012, 2020). Fictionalists accept the existence of distinctively mathematical explanations and yet argue that these explanations do not presuppose the existence of any mathematical objects. For example, Leng argues that “we can generate mathematical explanations of physical phenomena that do not appeal to any abstract mathematical objects, but instead only require modal truths about what follows logically from our mathematical assumptions, together with the recognition that the assumptions of our mathematical theories are true when interpreted as about the physical system under examination” (Leng 2021, 10437). Leng can thus endorse the very same unified derivation of the features of Baker’s cicadas, and yet refrain from accepting the existence of mathematical objects. While Saatsi takes the physical features of the system to be the genuine explainers, Leng uses those same features to interpret the mathematical theories that are doing the explanatory work. Either way, premise 2′ of the indispensability argument comes out false.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1

phenomena - that of mathematical fictionalism. Mathematical fictionalism is the view that mathematical statements, such as "2+2=4" or "there are infinitely many prime numbers", are akin to the statements found in a work of fiction. They are not literally true, but they serve a useful role in our scientific theories and other practical contexts.</p><p>Leng, a proponent of this perspective, argues that mathematical explanations of physical phenomena do not require the existence of abstract mathematical objects. Instead, the power of these explanations comes from the logical consequences of our mathematical assumptions and the applicability of these assumptions to the physical systems we are studying.</p><p>For example, in the cicadas case, the mathematical explanation might use the concept of prime numbers to explain the life-cycles of certain species. However, Leng would argue that this does not mean we have to accept the existence of prime numbers as real, abstract entities. The power of the explanation comes from the logical consequences of assuming that prime numbers behave in a certain way, and that these behaviors have a certain correspondence with the behavior of cicadas.</p><p>In this view, the mathematical theory is used as a tool to organize and understand the physical phenomena, but the mathematical objects themselves (like prime numbers) do not need to be seen as real entities. As a result, the second premise of the indispensability argument, which asserts that if we use mathematical objects to explain physical phenomena we must commit to their existence, is rejected. This perspective thus provides a way to accept the explanatory power of mathematics without committing to the existence of abstract mathematical entities.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">without numbers (Field 1980). There Field contrasts “intrinsic” explanations with “extrinsic” explanations. He claims that all mathematical explanations are extrinsic and that for every extrinsic explanation of some target, there is a superior, intrinsic explanation of that very target (Field 1980, 43–44; see Marcus 2013). The explanations championed by Colyvan, Baker and others suggest that it is not clear that a mathematical explanation is always extrinsic or that a non-mathematical explanation that is intrinsic is superior in all respects. Consider again the non-causal explanation of the impossibility of traversing the bridges of Königsberg or the evolutionary explanation of the prime periods of the cicada. While some non-mathematical derivation of these targets is surely available, this does not settle whether or not these derivations should count as explanations or what their explanatory virtues might be.

Perhaps the most promising defense of premise 2′ would be to provide a positive account of distinctively mathematical explanations that would clarify how endorsing such explanations commits one to the existence of some mathematical objects. The recent literature on this issue again seems to lead to a kind of standoff. Consider, for example, Baron’s “Pythagorean” proposal for these explanations (Baron forthcoming). Baron defines a Pythagorean to be someone who not only believes in mathematical objects as abstract entities, but who claims that some of the intrinsic properties of these abstract entities are also possessed by concrete entities. This is possible because the salient intrinsic properties of the mathematical entities are structural properties that are found in the concrete world whenever the concrete entities are arranged in the right structure. These shared, structural properties and their necessary mathematical relations thus enable mathematical truths to explain features of physical systems such as the bridges or cicadas. In addition, Baron is clear that “Structural properties on my account make indispensable reference to abstract objects” (Baron forthcoming, 25). So one defense of premise 2′ involves adopting Baron’s Pythagoreanism.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1

by providing a positive account of distinctively mathematical explanations that could necessitate the existence of mathematical objects. This defense, which relies on Baron's Pythagorean proposal, might provide a compelling way to frame mathematical explanations as reliant on mathematical objects.</p><p>Field had suggested that all mathematical explanations were "extrinsic" and could be replaced by superior "intrinsic" explanations that didn't involve mathematical objects. This perspective asserts that mathematical entities are not needed to explain physical phenomena - any explanation involving mathematical entities can be replaced by a non-mathematical one that is superior in all respects. However, this perspective has been challenged with examples of mathematical explanations, such as the Königsberg bridge problem or the cicada's life-cycle, which don't seem to have obvious superior intrinsic explanations.</p><p>In contrast, Baron suggests a Pythagorean perspective where mathematical objects, as abstract entities, share certain intrinsic properties with concrete entities. The structural properties of these mathematical objects can also be found in the physical world, provided the concrete entities are arranged in the right structure. This view allows mathematical truths to explain features of physical systems and implies that the properties of these systems are essentially related to the properties of abstract mathematical entities.</p><p>This defense of the indispensability argument is built on the idea that the shared, necessary mathematical relations between abstract and concrete entities mean that certain mathematical entities must exist to explain the features of these physical systems. If this viewpoint is correct, it strengthens the indispensability argument and supports the conclusion that we should be ontologically committed to mathematical entities due to their role in our best scientific explanations.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">entire area of mathematics or it might aim at providing explanatory proofs for specific theorems. The variety of these mathematical explanatory activities has been investigated in D’Alessandro (2020), Hafner and Mancosu (2005), Lange (2018b), and Sandborg (1997, Ch. 1).

Amongst these different explanatory activities, most of the attention has been focused on proofs which not only prove that a theorem is true, but also show why it is true. While there might not be agreement on specific instances, many mathematicians often claim that certain proofs have an explanatory power and that others do not. These claims are found throughout the history of mathematics and the philosophy of mathematics (see Lange 2015c, 2016, 2017 (Ch. 7–9) and Mancosu 2001). In the words of Bouligand:

Many theorems can be given different demonstrations. The most instructive are of course those that let one understand the deep reasons of the results that one is establishing.

the realm of mathematical proofs and their explanatory power. There are various ways mathematical explanations may function. For example, they can give insight into an entire area of mathematics or provide explanatory proofs for specific theorems.</p><p>Most attention, however, is focused on proofs that do more than just prove a theorem to be true; they also show why it is true. There is a recognition in the mathematical community, and throughout its history, that some proofs are more explanatory than others. The more explanatory proofs are often deemed the most instructive because they allow one to understand the underlying principles that make a mathematical result hold true.</p><p>This idea is nicely encapsulated in a quote from Bouligand, a French mathematician. He argued that while there might be multiple proofs available for a theorem, the most valuable are those that reveal the "deep reasons" behind the result. This notion captures the importance of explanations in mathematics and how they contribute to our understanding of mathematical truths.</p><p>So, while the concept of mathematical explanation may initially appear counter-intuitive—since mathematical proof, by itself, is often seen as the epitome of certainty and precision—it becomes clear that explanations in mathematics can indeed enhance understanding by providing insights into why a theorem is true, not just proving that it is.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">This article was Mathematical Explanation

(SEP) on the topic of Mathematical Explanation. The SEP is a well-respected online encyclopedia of philosophy that is maintained by experts in the field and is a good resource for comprehensive, peer-reviewed information on a wide range of philosophical topics.</p><p>The article on Mathematical Explanation explores the complex and multifaceted relationship between mathematics and the notion of explanation. It delves into how mathematics can be used to explain various phenomena, whether physical, theoretical, or otherwise, and the philosophical implications and debates surrounding these explanations.</p><p>The wide range of topics covered in the passages you've shared—from ontological commitments to mathematical entities, to the explanatory power of mathematical proofs, and the challenges of mathematical explanations in the context of scientific realism—underscores the intricate interplay between mathematics and philosophy in the quest to understand our world.</p><p>It should be noted that this is a dense and complex topic that requires a good understanding of both mathematics and philosophy to fully comprehend. If you have any specific questions about the concepts discussed in the article, I'd be more than happy to try and help you understand them better.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

conversation, we've touched on quite a few topics and themes. Here is a list summarizing them:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Mathematical Explanation:</strong> We delved into the complex relationship between mathematics and explanation. How mathematical models and theories can serve to explain various phenomena, and the philosophical implications of these explanations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unification and Explanation in Science:</strong> We discussed the tension between unification and explanation in scientific theories. For instance, Newton's Principia unified terrestrial and celestial phenomena but left out causal explanations for the mechanism of gravity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Models and Representations in Science:</strong> We touched upon how scientific models represent targets and their explanatory roles, and how these models may contain falsehoods without necessarily losing their explanatory power.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mathematical Operations in Explanations:</strong> We explored Robert Batterman's challenge to traditional models of explanation, emphasizing the role of mathematical operations in scientific explanation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Essential Idealizations in Mathematical Models:</strong> We examined the debate over whether certain idealizations (like infinite-depth oceans or point-particle planets) are essential to certain explanations, or whether they can be removed without sacrificing explanatory power.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ontological Commitment to Mathematical Entities:</strong> The discussion centered around the philosophical debate about whether the explanatory power of mathematics implies that we should believe in the existence of mathematical objects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE) and Abstract Objects:</strong> We talked about the role of IBE in deciding what entities we should believe in, including the controversial category of abstract mathematical objects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fictionalism vs Realism in Mathematical Explanations:</strong> We explored the positions of mathematical fictionalism and realism. The former argues mathematical explanations do not need to rely on the existence of mathematical objects, while the latter upholds the idea that mathematical entities exist independently of human thought.</p></li><li><p><strong>Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Explanations:</strong> We discussed the claim that mathematical explanations are always extrinsic and that there is always a superior, intrinsic explanation. This is contrasted with the view that mathematical explanations can be intrinsic and valuable in their own right.</p></li><li><p><strong>Proofs in Mathematics as Explanations:</strong> Lastly, we looked at the notion that some mathematical proofs not only show that a theorem is true, but also explain why it is true.</p></li></ol><p>These are high-level overviews and each topic can be expanded upon further.

Dynamics in Action:&nbsp;Intentional Behavior as a Complex System

What is the difference between a wink and a blink? The answer is important not only to philosophers of mind, for significant moral and legal consequences rest on the distinction between voluntary and involuntary behavior. However, "action theory"—the branch of philosophy that has traditionally articulated the boundaries between action and non-action, and between voluntary and involuntary behavior—has been unable to account for the difference.

Alicia Juarrero argues that a mistaken, 350-year-old model of cause and explanation—one that takes all causes to be of the push-pull, efficient cause sort, and all explanation to be prooflike—underlies contemporary theories of action. Juarrero then proposes a new framework for conceptualizing causes based on complex adaptive systems. Thinking of causes as dynamical constraints makes bottom-up and top-down causal relations, including those involving intentional causes, suddenly tractable. A different logic for explaining actions—as historical narrative, not inference—follows if one adopts this novel approach to long-standing questions of action and responsibility.

From the influential author of&nbsp;Dynamics in Action, how the concepts of constraints provide a way to rethink relationships, opening the way to intentional, meaningful causation.

Grounding her work in the problem of causation, Alicia Juarrero&nbsp;challenges previously held beliefs that only forceful impacts are causes. Constraints, she claims, bring about effects as well, and they enable the emergence of coherence. In&nbsp;Context Changes Everything, Juarrero shows that coherence is induced by enabling constraints, not forceful causes, and that the resulting coherence is then maintained by constitutive constraints. Constitutive constraints, in turn, become governing constraints that regulate and modulate the way coherent entities behave. Using the tools of complexity science, she offers a rigorously scientific understanding of identity, hierarchy, and top-down causation, and in so doing, presents a new way of thinking about the natural world.

Juarrero argues that personal identity, which has been thought to be conferred through internal traits (essential natures), is grounded in dynamic interdependencies that keep coherent structures whole. This challenges our ideas of identity, as well as the notion that stability means inflexible rigidity. On the contrary, stable entities are brittle and cannot persist. Complexity science, says Juarrero, can shape how we meet the world, how what emerges from our interactions finds coherence, and how humans can shape identities that are robust and resilient. This framework has significant implications for sociology, economics, political theory, business, and knowledge management, as well as psychology, religion, and theology. It points to a more expansive and synthetic philosophy about who we are and about the coherence of living and nonliving things alike.

"Dynamics in Action: Intentional Behavior as a Complex System" and "Context Changes Everything: How Constraints Create Coherence" propose a revolutionary perspective on the concepts of causation, action, and coherence.</p><p>The connections between our previous discussion and Juarrero's ideas are multi-layered. Here are a few key points of connection:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Complexity and Explanatory Power:</strong> Both our discussion and Juarrero's work deal with the nature and power of explanation. Juarrero, like Robert Batterman, seems to argue for a type of explanation that is not reductionistic but instead captures the complexity and dynamism of real-world systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Causality and Constraints:</strong> Our conversation touched upon the complexity of the cause-effect relationship in scientific models, and this is also a central theme in Juarrero's work. She posits that constraints, not just forceful causes, create effects, providing a different perspective on how causality functions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Identity and Coherence:</strong> The notion of identity emerged when we discussed the existence and ontological commitment to mathematical entities. Juarrero also speaks about identity, but from the perspective of dynamic interdependencies maintaining the coherence of complex systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Non-reductionist Explanation:</strong> In our discussion, Batterman's approach proposed a challenge to traditional reductionist models of explanation, focusing on mathematical operations. Juarrero's proposal can be seen as a similar challenge to reductionist views. Instead of focusing solely on efficient (push-pull) causality, she presents a framework based on complex adaptive systems, which includes constraints and context.</p></li><li><p><strong>Top-down Causation and Hierarchy:</strong> Juarrero's work introduces the concept of top-down causation, which challenges the simplistic notion of cause-effect relationships and allows for a more nuanced understanding of systems and their behavior. This idea aligns with some of the concepts we discussed, like the idea of essential idealizations in mathematical models and the intricate hierarchy in models and representations in science.</p></li></ol><p>These connections highlight the inter-disciplinary nature of these themes, bridging philosophy, mathematics, and complexity science. They also highlight the need for more nuanced models of explanation and causation that can capture the complexity of real-world phenomena.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Connections with the following: analog attractors autocatalytic become behavior

and complex systems, as well as to Alicia Juarrero's work. Here's how:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Analog Attractors:</strong> This term can refer to the states towards which a dynamical system tends to evolve. In our conversation, it could relate to how mathematical explanations or models guide our understanding of complex phenomena.</p></li><li><p><strong>Autocatalytic:</strong> This refers to a reaction where the product itself promotes or accelerates the reaction. In the context of mathematical explanations, one could think of autocatalysis as a metaphor for how certain explanations can spark new insights and theories, further propelling scientific discovery.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bénard cells:</strong> Bénard cells are a classic example of pattern formation in a fluid due to convection. They provide a physical illustration of emergent phenomena, which is a key issue in understanding mathematical explanations of complex systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Biological Brain Buffers:</strong> This could refer to biological mechanisms in the brain that help maintain stability or homeostasis. It relates to our discussion on the complexity and robustness of systems, and how mathematical models help us understand these systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Causal Cell Changes:</strong> This could allude to how cause-effect relationships can bring about changes at the cellular level. This again connects to the overarching theme of understanding complex biological phenomena through mathematical models.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chapter Closure Cognitive Coherence-making:</strong> This could refer to the process of creating coherence in our cognitive understanding of complex phenomena, which is essentially what mathematical models aim to do.</p></li><li><p><strong>Coherent Dynamics:</strong> Coherence in dynamics could refer to the consistency or orderly behavior of a system over time. Both our discussion and Juarrero's work emphasize the importance of understanding the coherent behavior of complex systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Complex Systems Components:</strong> These are the individual elements that make up complex systems. Our conversation revolved around understanding these systems through mathematical modeling and explanation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Constitutive Constraints:</strong> In Juarrero's work, she proposes that constitutive constraints help maintain the coherence of systems. This directly ties into our discussion about the role of constraints and idealizations in mathematical models.</p></li><li><p><strong>Constrained Interactions:</strong> This might refer to interactions within a system that are restricted or guided by certain rules or conditions. It's another aspect of understanding complex systems, which was a central theme in our discussion.</p></li></ol><p>Remember, these connections can be interpreted in multiple ways depending on the specific context of your study or interest.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Connections with the following: constraint regime context context-

enrich our previous discussion about mathematical explanation, complex systems, and Alicia Juarrero's work:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Constraint Regime:</strong> This term could refer to a particular set of rules or constraints governing a system or process. It aligns with our discussions about the role of constraints in mathematical models.</p></li><li><p><strong>Context and Context-dependent Constraints:</strong> These terms refer to conditions or limitations that vary based on the circumstances or environment. They emphasize the importance of context in interpreting mathematical models and understanding complex systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Contextual Constraints:</strong> Similar to context-dependent constraints, these are limitations that depend on the specific situation or conditions. Again, they highlight the role of context in mathematical models and complex systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Coordination Dynamics:</strong> This term often refers to the study of coordination patterns, which emerge from the interaction of components in a system. It ties into our discussion about the complexity of systems and how mathematical models can help elucidate these patterns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cosmic Expansion:</strong> This term refers to the ongoing expansion of the universe, a complex phenomenon often modeled and explained using mathematics. It underlines the scope of mathematical modeling in understanding the universe's complexity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dependent Described Distinct Effects:</strong> This phrase might refer to the unique outcomes that depend on particular conditions or variables. It underscores how mathematical models can capture the dependencies and nuances within complex systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Efficient Causes:</strong> This term originates from Aristotle's four causes and typically refers to the immediate causes or triggers of an event. It's relevant to our discussion about how causes are conceptualized and handled in mathematical models and explanations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Embedded, Embody:</strong> These terms could refer to the idea that complex systems, such as biological organisms, embody or are embedded within even larger systems, creating multi-level, nested structures. This ties into our discussion on the complexity of systems and how mathematical models help us understand them.</p></li><li><p><strong>Emergent Properties:</strong> These are properties that arise from the interaction of simpler components in a system, but cannot be predicted from the properties of the individual components themselves. This concept is central to the study of complex systems and was a recurring theme in our discussion.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Connections with the following: enabling and governing enabling constraints enact

constraints and interactions play within these systems:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Enabling and Governing:</strong> These terms could refer to the different roles that constraints or rules play in a system. Some constraints enable certain behaviors or interactions, while others govern or regulate the dynamics of the system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enabling Constraints:</strong> This term could refer to constraints within a system that, counterintuitively, enable or facilitate particular behaviors, patterns, or dynamics.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enact and Energy Flow:</strong> These could refer to how agents in a system act or enact behaviors and how energy flows within a system—both key considerations in understanding complex systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Entrenched Constraints:</strong> These may be deeply embedded or hard-to-change constraints in a system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Epigenetic and Epigenetic Landscapes:</strong> These terms relate to changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself. The landscape metaphor visualizes the dynamic process of development influenced by epigenetic factors, forming a topography of potential developmental paths.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evolve, Example, Feedback Loops, Function, and Gene:</strong> These terms all point to key aspects of biological systems, underlining how such systems evolve, how genes function, and how feedback loops contribute to the system's complexity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Governing Constraints:</strong> This could refer to constraints that regulate or control the behavior of a system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gradients, Heterarchies, Hierarchy, Holarchies, Holons, and Homeostasis:</strong> These terms all point to various ways in which complex systems can be organized or structured, from hierarchical arrangements to heterarchies (networks of elements where each element shares the same "horizontal" position of power and authority) to holarchies (systems that are simultaneously whole and part, holons).</p></li><li><p><strong>Individual, Integration, Interactional Types, Interlocking Constraints, Landscape, and Living Things:</strong> These terms highlight different elements within complex systems—from individual agents to the types of interactions they can have, from the landscape of potential system states to the overall integration of parts within the living system.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

into the complexity of systems and their dynamics:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Many-to-One:</strong> This could refer to many-to-one mappings in systems, where multiple inputs can yield the same output.</p></li><li><p><strong>Matter, Mental Events, Mereological:</strong> These terms span the range of phenomena in complex systems, from physical (matter) to mental (mental events), and how parts relate to wholes (mereology).</p></li><li><p><strong>Metastability:</strong> A state of unstable equilibrium in a dynamic system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Modules, Molecules:</strong> Components of systems, whether biological (molecules) or designed (modules).</p></li><li><p><strong>Multiple Constraint, Multiply Realizable:</strong> Constraints can be multiple, acting at various levels or in different dimensions. A function or property is said to be multiply realizable if it can be implemented in different ways or by different types of systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Natural, Networks, Neurons:</strong> References to natural systems, such as networks (neural or otherwise), and the neurons that make up part of those networks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nonequilibrium:</strong> A state where a system is not in equilibrium, often leading to dynamic behaviors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Novel Order Parameters:</strong> New or emerging characteristics that help describe the order or structure of a system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Output Patterns, Persistence:</strong> The patterns that emerge from system dynamics, and the persistence of these patterns over time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Phase Transitions, Phenotypes:</strong> Changes in the state or phase of a system, and the observable traits of organisms (phenotypes).</p></li><li><p><strong>Philosophers, Physical:</strong> References to those who study complex systems (philosophers), and the physical properties of these systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Possibility Space:</strong> The space of all potential states or configurations of a system.</p></li><li><p><strong>Primary, Properties, Processes, Qualia:</strong> Basic or primary features, properties or characteristics of a system, the processes that drive system dynamics, and the subjective elements of experience (qualia).</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

and the discussion on the epistemology of mathematics are connected in several interesting ways.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Complexity and Explanation:</strong> Both discussions highlight the complexity inherent in systems and how understanding these complexities can lead to deeper explanations. Juarrero's work emphasizes how enabling and governing constraints in complex systems can explain how these systems behave. Similarly, the debate about the epistemology of mathematics seeks to explain how abstract mathematical concepts and principles can have real-world explanatory power.</p></li><li><p><strong>Constraints and Mathematical Entities:</strong> Juarrero talks about how constraints within complex systems allow for certain behaviors and outcomes. In a way, mathematical entities can be viewed as constraints within physical and theoretical systems that guide or determine outcomes. For instance, the properties of mathematical objects might constrain the way a physical system can behave.</p></li><li><p><strong>Abstraction and Reality:</strong> Both discussions grapple with the relationship between abstract concepts and reality. In Juarrero's work, this takes the form of complex system dynamics that originate from simple rules or constraints but can have tangible, real-world impacts. In the epistemology of mathematics, this tension is evident in the debate about whether abstract mathematical entities truly "exist" and how they can affect the physical world.</p></li><li><p><strong>Causality:</strong> Both discussions deal with the concept of causality. Juarrero challenges the traditional view of causality as a push-pull, forceful impact process, proposing instead that causes can be viewed as dynamic constraints in complex systems. On the other hand, in mathematical epistemology, mathematical entities are proposed to have explanatory, and arguably causal, power in the natural world, a notion that is deeply tied to ontological commitment to these entities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Emergence:</strong> Both discussions touch upon the concept of emergence. Juarrero's work emphasizes how complex behavior can emerge from systems with simple underlying rules or constraints. Similarly, the explanatory power of mathematics is often seen as emergent from its abstract principles and entities, revealing novel insights about the physical world.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><img alt="User" loading="lazy" width="38" height="38" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="rounded-sm" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" style="color: transparent;"></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">And connections with this: recursion relations response scaffolds second law selection

Juarrero's work on complexity and system dynamics, the discussion on the epistemology of mathematics, and the concepts you've just provided all interrelate in various ways.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Recursion and Mathematical Epistemology:</strong> The concept of recursion is fundamental to many branches of mathematics and is often tied to the idea of proof, which is critical in mathematical epistemology. It's also an essential feature in complex systems where small, simple rules or processes are repeated over and over to give rise to complex behaviors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stability and Constraints:</strong> Stability, a concept critical to the functioning of complex systems as per Juarrero's work, can be considered an outcome of certain mathematical, physical, or biological constraints. The same can be said for structures which can emerge as stable configurations within certain constraint regimes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Self-organization, Selection, and Mathematical Explanation:</strong> These concepts are crucial in explaining how systems can evolve or change over time, whether in biology, physics, or social systems. The idea that abstract mathematical entities can have explanatory power may be applicable here, as they often provide the framework for understanding these complex, dynamic processes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Supervenience, Unity of Type, and Mathematical Entities:</strong> Supervenience is a concept from philosophy, particularly philosophy of mind and metaphysics, that can be applied to understanding the relationships between different levels of description in a system. Unity of type can be viewed as an abstract concept that can have tangible impacts on the real world, which aligns with the debate about the ontological commitment to mathematical entities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Temporal Constraints and Dynamics in Action:</strong> Time is an essential constraint in both Juarrero's work and in many mathematical models. Understanding how systems evolve over time and the role of temporal constraints in shaping system dynamics are common themes in both areas.</p></li></ol><p>Remember, the connections drawn here are interpretive and rely on the assumption that all these concepts are being understood in their standard academic contexts. If you have specific definitions or contexts for these terms in mind, the connections could change.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

covered a broad range of topics and themes, including:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Epistemology of Mathematics:</strong> Discussed ontological commitment to mathematical entities, explained through the works of Colyvan and Quine.</p></li><li><p><strong>Indispensability Argument:</strong> This philosophical argument posits that we should believe in the existence of mathematical entities due to their indispensability to our best scientific theories.</p></li><li><p><strong>Explanatory Power of Mathematics:</strong> This was discussed through the works of Baker, with a focus on the inference to the best explanation (IBE) principle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mathematical Fictionalism and Non-Platonistic Views:</strong> Explored the positions of Yablo, Leng, and Field that argue against the necessity of mathematical objects for explanatory purposes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Distinctively Mathematical Explanations:</strong> Analyzed how endorsing such explanations may commit one to the existence of some mathematical objects, as per Baron's Pythagorean proposal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Explanatory Proofs:</strong> Addressed the distinction between proofs that merely show a theorem to be true and those that provide an explanation for its truth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Complex Systems and Causation:</strong> Explored Alicia Juarrero's work on complex systems and her proposed new framework for understanding causes based on these systems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Constraints and Coherence:</strong> In Juarrero's 'Context Changes Everything', the concepts of constraints were highlighted as a way to rethink relationships and causation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Key Concepts and Themes in Juarrero's Work:</strong> Covered several themes and concepts in Juarrero's work, such as recursion, stability, self-organization, supervenience, temporal constraints, and unity of type.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interdisciplinary Connections:</strong> Connections were drawn between Juarrero's work on complexity and system dynamics, the discussion on the epistemology of mathematics, and a list of provided concepts.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

primarily been a detailed exploration of the epistemology of mathematics, the existence and necessity of mathematical entities, and the explanatory power of mathematics, along with a discussion of Alicia Juarrero's work on complex systems and causation.</p><p>Initially, the conversation focused on the indispensability argument, which posits the necessity of believing in the existence of mathematical entities because they are indispensable to our best scientific theories. This argument was discussed in the context of Colyvan's and Quine's work, with Quine's naturalistic approach asserting that beliefs about what exists should be shaped by the best scientific theories.</p><p>The conversation then moved towards mathematical fictionalism and non-Platonistic views, represented by thinkers like Yablo, Leng, and Field. These perspectives argue that mathematical explanations of physical phenomena do not need to presuppose the existence of mathematical objects.</p><p>Subsequently, the conversation touched upon distinctively mathematical explanations, especially those proofs that not only demonstrate the truth of a theorem but also provide reasons for its truth. The need for such explanations, according to some philosophers, commits one to the existence of mathematical objects.</p><p>In addition, Alicia Juarrero's work on complex systems and causation was discussed. Juarrero challenges traditional models of cause and explanation and offers a new framework that considers causes as dynamic constraints in complex adaptive systems.</p><p>Furthermore, the conversation explored Juarrero's concept of constraints and coherence, as detailed in her book 'Context Changes Everything'. She asserts that coherence is induced by enabling constraints, which then become governing constraints that regulate the behavior of coherent entities.</p><p>Finally, the conversation identified interdisciplinary connections between Juarrero's work, the philosophy of mathematics, and various key concepts, suggesting potential intersections for further exploration and understanding.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

entities like points, lines, squares, cubes, tesseracts, and so on are abstract, idealized concepts.

Driven by Compression Progress: A Simple Principle Explains Essential Aspects of Subjective Beauty, Novelty, Surprise, Interestingness, Attention, Curiosity, Creativity, Art, Science, Music, Jokes
Juergen Schmidhuber

I argue that data becomes temporarily interesting by itself to some self-improving, but computationally limited, subjective observer once he learns to predict or compress the data in a better way, thus making it subjectively simpler and more beautiful. Curiosity is the desire to create or discover more non-random, non-arbitrary, regular data that is novel and surprising not in the traditional sense of Boltzmann and Shannon but in the sense that it allows for compression progress because its regularity was not yet known. This drive maximizes interestingness, the first derivative of subjective beauty or compressibility, that is, the steepness of the learning curve. It motivates exploring infants, pure mathematicians, composers, artists, dancers, comedians, yourself, and (since 1990) artificial systems.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

Schmidhuber presents a perspective on interest, beauty, and curiosity that is based on the idea of compression progress. According to this perspective, something becomes interesting when we find a new way to understand or predict it, thereby compressing the information it contains and making it subjectively simpler. This perspective ties closely with the concept of parsimony mentioned in our previous discussions, as parsimony involves seeking the simplest explanation that requires the fewest assumptions.</p><p>There is a clear connection between this idea and the debates on mathematical explanation and the ontological commitment to mathematical entities that we discussed earlier. In mathematics, a proof or a theorem becomes interesting when it provides a simpler, more elegant, or more powerful way to understand certain mathematical structures or relationships, which can be viewed as a form of compression progress.</p><p>Similarly, the abstract mathematical entities we discussed, like points, lines, and squares, can be seen as compression tools that allow us to encode and understand complex spatial relationships in a simpler and more efficient way. This can also be related to Juarrero's work on constraints and the creation of coherence in complex systems, as mathematical concepts can serve as constraints that help bring coherence to our understanding of the world.</p><p>On the other hand, Schmidhuber's theory also sheds light on the subjective and contextual aspects of mathematical beauty and interest. What is interesting or beautiful to one mathematician might not be to another, depending on their previous knowledge, their ability to compress the information, and the context in which they are working. This echoes Juarrero's emphasis on context-dependent constraints and the idea that context changes everything.</p><p>So, there are multiple ways in which Schmidhuber's ideas about compression progress and interestingness intersect with the philosophical and scientific topics we've discussed.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

Both art and science can be seen as pursuits of finding patterns and making predictions, which are forms of data compression. These activities help us make sense of the world by condensing complex phenomena into simpler, more manageable forms.</p><p>In science, this is often done through creating theories or models that describe patterns in empirical data. These theories allow us to predict future observations and compress a wide range of observations into a set of fundamental principles or equations.</p><p>In art, artists might create works that express, explore, or challenge certain patterns of human experience, emotion, or perception. A piece of art can be seen as a form of data compression in the sense that it condenses complex ideas, feelings, or experiences into a visual, auditory, or other sensory form that others can experience and interpret.</p><p>In both cases, the drive for compression progress - for finding new, more efficient, or more powerful ways to encode and understand data - can be a major source of creativity, discovery, and aesthetic or intellectual satisfaction.</p><p>This view aligns with a broader trend in cognitive science and philosophy of mind that sees perception, cognition, and action as fundamentally prediction- and compression-oriented processes. The brain is often described as a prediction machine that constantly tries to minimize the discrepancy between its predictions and the incoming sensory data, which can be viewed as a form of ongoing data compression.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

The use of higher-dimensional spaces is a common technique in many fields of mathematics and physics, precisely because it can make certain problems easier to solve. This is particularly true for problems involving complex numbers, but it's also the case in areas like linear algebra, quantum mechanics, and data analysis.</p><p>For example, in linear algebra, working in higher-dimensional spaces can make it easier to find solutions to systems of linear equations. In quantum mechanics, higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces are used to describe the state of a quantum system. And in data analysis, it's often useful to project data into a higher-dimensional space to make patterns or clusters more apparent, a technique known as kernel trick.</p><p>These examples illustrate the power of abstract mathematical thinking. By using concepts like higher-dimensional spaces and complex numbers, we can solve problems that might be very difficult or even impossible to solve using only the tools of ordinary, three-dimensional geometry. And in many cases, the solutions we find in these abstract spaces can be projected back into lower-dimensional spaces to give us insights about the real world.</p><p>This echoes one of the key themes of our conversation so far: the power of abstraction and mathematical reasoning to give us insights about the physical world, even if the objects of our reasoning (like points, lines, and higher-dimensional spaces) don't have a direct physical counterpart. This is one of the ways in which mathematics can be both indispensable and yet non-empirical, as we discussed earlier in connection with the philosophy of mathematics.</p></div></div></div><div

The process of solving complex problems, including mathematical problems, often involves a trajectory where things appear to get more complicated before they eventually get simplified.</p><p>In the context of "compression" as discussed in Schmidhuber's work, it may seem counterintuitive that a problem might need to be expanded or projected into a higher-dimensional space before it can be "compressed" or solved more efficiently. But this kind of 'expand to simplify' process is common in many areas of problem-solving.</p><p>This may occur because the original formulation of the problem obscures certain symmetries or structures that become more apparent in a higher-dimensional or more complex space. Once these structures are recognized, they can often be used to simplify the problem or to develop more efficient algorithms for its solution.</p><p>So, even though there might be a stage where the problem appears to get more complicated, this added complexity can be an important step in the overall process of finding a simpler or more efficient solution. This reflects a kind of meta-level "compression," where the complexity of the problem-solving process itself is reduced.</p><p>This insight is not only relevant to mathematics and computation but also to creativity and innovation more broadly, where initial exploration and diversification often precede the convergence on a simpler, more elegant solution or idea.</p></div></div></div><div

explanation</li><li>The indispensability argument for mathematical realism</li><li>The debates around the existence of mathematical objects</li></ul></li><li><p>Mathematical Explanation:</p><ul><li>The distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic mathematical explanations</li><li>The concept of mathematical proofs that not only demonstrate a theorem is true, but also show why it is true</li></ul></li><li><p>Alicia Juarrero's Work:</p><ul><li>The difference between voluntary and involuntary behavior</li><li>The concept of constraints and their role in complex adaptive systems</li><li>The idea that coherence in a system is induced by enabling constraints and maintained by constitutive constraints</li><li>The argument that personal identity is grounded in dynamic interdependencies rather than internal traits</li></ul></li><li><p>Juergen Schmidhuber's Theory:</p><ul><li>The idea that data becomes temporarily interesting once it can be better predicted or compressed</li><li>The concept of curiosity as the desire to create or discover more non-random, regular data that allows for compression progress</li></ul></li><li><p>Mathematical Abstractions:</p><ul><li>The idea that mathematical entities like points, lines, squares, etc., are abstract concepts that exist only in an idealized world</li><li>The utility of these abstractions in practical applications and their role in advancing scientific understanding</li></ul></li><li><p>Pattern Seeking and Prediction in Art and Science:</p><ul><li>The role of pattern seeking and prediction (or 'compression') in both art and science</li><li>The suggestion that this common process may explain certain similarities between artistic and scientific creativity</li></ul></li><li><p>Complex Problem Solving:</p><ul><li>The strategy of projecting a problem into higher-dimensional space to solve it more efficiently</li><li>The insight that problem-solving often involves a stage where the problem appears to get more complicated before it is eventually simplified.</li></ul></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

condensed summary of our conversation:</p><p>We delved into the epistemology of mathematics, exploring the role of mathematical objects in scientific explanation. We discussed the indispensability argument for mathematical realism, along with debates around the existence of mathematical objects and the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic mathematical explanations.</p><p>We explored Alicia Juarrero's work on the difference between voluntary and involuntary behavior and her innovative concept of constraints in complex adaptive systems. Juarrero posits that system coherence is induced and maintained by enabling and constitutive constraints, respectively. Her arguments challenge traditional notions of personal identity, proposing that it's grounded in dynamic interdependencies rather than internal traits.</p><p>We also discussed Juergen Schmidhuber's theory that data becomes temporarily interesting when it can be better predicted or compressed. His concept of curiosity is framed as a desire to create or discover more non-random, regular data that allows for compression progress.</p><p>The discussion then moved to the nature of mathematical abstractions, considering them as idealized concepts that hold utility in practical applications and scientific understanding. We also noted the role of pattern seeking and prediction (or 'compression') in both art and science, potentially explaining some similarities between artistic and scientific creativity.</p><p>Finally, we touched on problem-solving strategies in higher-dimensional spaces, recognizing that solutions often involve a stage where the problem may appear to become more complicated before it's simplified.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="h-32 md:h-48 flex-shrink-0"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full border-t md:border-t-0 dark:border-white/20 md:border-transparent md:dark:border-transparent md:bg-vert-light-gradient bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 md:!bg-transparent dark:md:bg-vert-dark-gradient pt-2 md:pl-2 md:w-[calc(100%-.5rem)]"><form class="stretch mx-2 flex flex-row gap-3 last:mb-2 md:mx-4 md:last:mb-6 lg:mx-auto lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl"><div class="relative flex h-full flex-1 items-stretch md:flex-col" role="presentation"><div class="flex flex-col w-full py-[10px] flex-grow md:py-4 md:pl-4 relative border border-black/10 bg-white dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:text-white dark:bg-gray-700 rounded-xl shadow-xs dark:shadow-xs"><textarea id="prompt-textarea" tabindex="0" data-id="request-:r0:-14" rows="1" placeholder="Send a message" class="m-0 w-full resize-none border-0 bg-transparent p-0 pr-10 focus:ring-0 focus-visible:ring-0 dark:bg-transparent md:pr-12 pl-3 md:pl-0" style="max-height: 200px;
