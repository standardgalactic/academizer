Abstract 
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the state-of-the-art model for machine learning on graph-structured 
data. The most popular class of GNNs operate by exchanging information between adjacent nodes, and 
are known as Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). Given their widespread use, understanding the 
expressive power of MPNNs is a key question. However, existing results typically consider settings with 
uninformative node features. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis to determine which function 
classes of node features can be learned by an MPNN of a given capacity. We do so by measuring the level 
of pairwise interactions between nodes that MPNNs allow for. This measure provides a novel quantitative 
characterization of the so-called over-squashing ef f ect, which is observed to occur when a large volume of 
messages is aggregated into i xed-size vectors. Using our measure, we prove that, to guarantee suf i cient 
communication between pairs of nodes, the capacity of theMPNNmust be large enough, depending on 
properties of the input graph structure, such as commute times. For many relevant scenarios, our analysis 
results in impossibility statements in practice, showing that over-squashing hinders the expressive power of 
MPNNs. We validate our theoretical i ndings through extensive controlled experiments and ablation studies. 
1Introduction 
Graphs describe the relational structure for a large variety of natural and artif i cial systems, making learning on 
graphs imperative in many contexts [59,23,62]. To this end, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [31,55] have 
emerged as a widely popular framework for graph machine learning, with plentiful success stories in science 
[5, 19, 9, 57, 40] and technology [46, 45, 22]. 
Given an underlying graph and features, def i ned on its nodes (and edges), as inputs, a GNN learns parametric 
functions from data. Due to the ubiquity of GNNs, characterizing their expressive power, i.e., which class 
of functions a GNN is able to learn, is a problem of great interest. In this context, most available results 
in literature on the universality of GNNs pertain to impractical higher-order tensors [43,37] or unique node 
identif i ers that may break the symmetries of the problem [41]. In particular, these results do not necessarily 
apply to Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) [30], which have emerged as the most popular class of GNN 
models in recent years. Concerning expressivity results forMPNNs, the most general available characterization 
is due to [64] and [47], who proved thatMPNNs are, at most, as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Leman graph 
isomorphism test [61] in distinguishing graphs without any features. This brings us to an important question:

Figure 1: We study the power ofMPNNs in terms of the mixing they induce among features and show that 
this is af f ected by the model (via norm of the weights and depth) and the graph topology (via commute times). 
For the given graph, theMPNNlearns stronger mixing (tight springs) for nodesv,uandu,wsince their 
commute time is small, while nodesu,qandu,z, with high commute-time, have weak mixing (loose springs). 
We characterize over-squashing as the inverse of the mixing induced by anMPNNand hence relate it to its 
power. In fact, theMPNNmight require an impractical depth to solve tasks on the given graph that depend 
on high-mixing of features assigned to u,z.

The paper investigates the impact of the over-squashing effect on the power of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), a popular class of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Over-squashing refers to the phenomenon where a large volume of messages is aggregated into fixed-size vectors. The authors provide a rigorous analysis to identify which function classes of node features can be learned by an MPNN of a given capacity. They introduce a novel measure of pairwise interactions between nodes to quantify this effect, showing that the capacity of the MPNN must be large enough, depending on properties like commute times in the input graph structure. They prove that over-squashing can significantly hinder the expressive power of MPNNs in many relevant scenarios, resulting in practical impossibility statements. The findings are corroborated with extensive controlled experiments and studies, highlighting the critical role that over-squashing plays in determining the capabilities of GNNs.

Razin et al.[50]address this question by characterizing the separation rank ofMPNNs; however, their analysis 
only covers unconventional architectures that do not correspond toMPNNmodels used in practice. In contrast, 
Alon and Yahav[2]investigate this question empirically, by observing thatMPNNs fail to solve tasks which 
involve long-range interactions among nodes. This limitation was ascribed to a phenomenon termed as over- 
squashing, which loosely entails messages being ���squashed��� into i xed-size vectors when the receptive i eld of 
a node grows too fast. This ef f ect was formalized in [58,25,8], who showed that the Jacobian of the nodes 
features is af f ected by topological properties of the graph, such as curvature and ef f ective resistance. However, 
all the aforementioned papers ignore the specif i cs of the task at hand, i.e., the underlying function that the 
MPNN seeks to learn, leading us to the following question: 
How does over-squashing af f ect the expressive power of MPNNs? Can we measure it? 
Contributions. Our main goal is to address the above question and show how over-squashing can be 
understood as the misalignment between the task and the graph-topology, ultimately limiting the 
classes of functions that MPNNs of practical size can learn (see Figure 1). We start by measuring 
the extent to which anMPNNallows any pair of nodes in the graph to interact (via mixing their features). 
With this measure as a tool, we characterize which functions of node features can be learned by anMPNNand 
how the model architecture and parameters, as well as the topology of the graph, af f ect the expressive power. 
More concretely, 
���We introduce a novel metric of expressive power that is based on the Hessian of the graph function learned 
by an MPNN and measures the ability of a model to mix features associated with dif f erent nodes. This 
approach complements the current repertoire of tools at disposal to assess the power of GNNs, and is of 
interest independent of the over-squashing phenomenon. 
���We then prove upper bounds on the Hessian of functions learned byMPNNs, hence deriving limitations 
on the power of MPNNs to mix features (i.e., model interactions) according to the novel metric mentioned 
above. As far as we know, this is the i rst theoretical result stating limitations of MPNNs to learn 
functions and their derivatives. 
���We characterize over-squashing as the reciprocal of the maximal mixing thatMPNNs can induce among 
nodes: the higher this measure, the smaller the class of functionsMPNNs can learn. Dif f erently from the 
2 
WL-test, which looks at the ability to separate node representations based on the computational trees, 
here we are interested in studying the ability of an MPNN to mix information associated with dif f erent 
nodes and the cost required to do so in terms of size of the weights and depth. In fact, our results also 
apply even when powerful structural (positional) features are provided. 
���We prove that the weights and depth must be suf i ciently large ��� depending on the topology ��� to ensure 
mixing. For some tasks, the depth must exceed the highest commute time on the graph, resulting in 
impossibility statements. Our results show that MPNNs of practical size, fail to learn functions with 
strong mixing among nodes at high commute time. 
���We illustrate our theoretical results with controlled experiments that verify our analysis, by highlighting 
the impact of the architecture (depth), of the topology (commute time), and of the underlying task (the 
level of mixing required). 
Thus, we present a novel paradigm for deriving rigorous results in relating two key notions in graph machine 
learning, that of GNN expressive power and over-squashing.

The paper by Francesco Di Giovanni et al. delves deeper into the understanding of over-squashing in MPNNs (Message Passing Neural Networks) and how it affects the expressive power of these models. The main contributions are as follows:
Introduction of a Novel Metric
: They introduce a new metric based on the Hessian of the graph function learned by an MPNN, which measures the ability to mix features between different nodes. This offers a new way to assess GNNs' power, independent of over-squashing.
Proof of Upper Bounds
: The authors prove limitations on the power of MPNNs by deriving upper bounds on the Hessian of functions learned, giving insights into the constraints on the model's ability to mix features.
Characterization of Over-Squashing
: Over-squashing is defined as the reciprocal of maximal mixing that MPNNs can induce among nodes. The higher this measure, the more limited the class of functions MPNNs can learn. They relate this to size and depth requirements of the model.
Proof of Necessary Conditions
: The paper proves that for effective mixing, the weights and depth of the MPNN must be large enough, depending on the topology. In some cases, the required depth results in practical impossibility statements, failing to learn functions with strong mixing at high commute times.
Experimental Validation
: Controlled experiments illustrate the theoretical findings, emphasizing the impact of various factors such as architecture depth, topology commute time, and the underlying task level of mixing required.
The paper thus offers a substantial advancement in understanding the over-squashing phenomenon, presenting rigorous results that connect it with the expressive power of GNNs. It shifts the perspective from merely identifying the over-squashing effect to comprehending how it practically limits the capabilities of GNNs and providing tools to measure it.

6Discussion 
Related Work: expressive power of MPNNs. TheMPNNclass in(2)is as powerful as the 1-WL 
test [61] in distinguishing unattributed graphs [64,47]. In fact,MPNNs typically struggle to compute graph 
properties on feature-less graphs [21,17,54,41]. The expressivity of GNNs has also been studied from the 
point of view of logical and tensor languages [6,4,29]. Nonetheless, far less is known about which functions 
of node featuresMPNNs can learn and the capacity required to do so. Razin et al.[50]recently studied the 
separation rank of a specif i cMPNNclass. While this approach is a strong inspiration for our work, the results 
in [50] only apply to a single unconventional family ofMPNNs which does not includeMPNNmodels used 
11 
in practice. Our results instead hold in the full generality of(2)and provide a novel approach to investigate 
expressivity of MPNNs through the mixing they are able to generate among features. Besides, to the best of our 
knowledge, this is the i rst work formally analysing the limitations on the expressive power of MPNNs to learn 
functions and their second-order derivatives. 
Dif f erences between mixing and the WL test. To further motivate how our proposed metric of expressivity 
dif f ers from the more established one based on the WL test, we emphasize that throughout our analysis we 
had no assumption on the nature of the features, that can in fact be structural or positional ��� meaning that 
the MPNNs we have considered above, may also be more powerful than the 1-WL test. Our derivations do 
not rely on the ability to distinguish dif f erent node representations, but rather on the ability of the MPNN to 
mix information associated with dif f erent nodes. This novel alternative paradigm may help design GNNs that 
are more powerful at mixing than MPNNs, and may further shed light on how and when frameworks such as 
Graph Transformers can solve the underlying task better than conventional MPNNs. 
Dif f erences between our results and existing works on over-squashing.The problem of over- 
squashing was introduced in [2] and studied through sensitivity analysis [63] in [58]. This approach was 
generalized in [8,25] who proved that the Jacobian of node features is likely to be small if the nodes have high 
commute time (ef f ective resistance). We discuss more in detail the novelty of this work when compared to 
[58,25]. (i) In works of [58,25] there is no analysis on which functions MPNNs cannot learn as a consequence 
of over-squashing, nor a formal measure for assessing over-squashing is provided. In fact, they only derive 
some conditions under which the Jacobian of node features can be small, but do not connect it to the ability 
of MPNNs to learn desired function classes. Besides, the Jacobian of node features may not be suited for 
studying over-squashing for graph-level tasks. Note that our theory also holds for node-level tasks ��� as argued 
in Section E of the Appendix, looking at the Jacobian corresponds to a i rst-order (Taylor) expansion of the 
prediction, while our emphasis extends this to second-order terms. (ii) While [58] shows that the Jacobian 
of nodes nodes at distance 2 is harmfully small when they are separated by an edge with strong negative 
curvature, their analysis fails to study over-squashing among nodes at distance larger than 2 and does not 
provide insights on the capacity required to learn certain tasks. (iii) Finally, the analysis in [25] does not 
account for MPNNs such as GatedGCN (while ours does), and is only carried out in a simplif i ed setting where 
the activation function is chosen to be a ReLU and its derivatives are taken to be the same, in expectation, for 
every path in the computational graph, which is an unrealistic assumption (our results instead work for smooth 
activations with no extra assumption). We have extended these ideas to connect over-squashing and expressive 
power by studying higher-order derivatives of theMPNNand relating them to the capacity of the model and the 
underlying graph-topology. 
6.1Limitations and ways forward 
The measuresOSQand g 
OSQ. Def i nition 4.1 considers pairs of nodes and second-order derivatives; this could 
be generalized to build a hierarchy of measures with increasingly higher-order interactions of nodes. The proxy 
(lower bound) ] 
OSQin Def i nition 4.2 we have based our analysis on, allows to derive necessary conditions for 
the MPNN to learn classes of functions based on their mixing. If, depending on the problem, one has access to 
better estimates of the mixing induced by an MPNN than(7), then one can extend our approach and get a 
i ner approximation ofOSQ. In particular, extending the analysis to lower bounds on the mixing, in order to 
provide suf i cient conditions for learning tasks, is a topic for future work. In the paper we focused our analysis 
on the case of graph-level tasks; we provide an extension to node-level functions in Section E. 
Beyond sum-aggregations. Our results apply toMPNNs as in(2), whereAis constant, and do not include 
attention-basedMPNNs [60,12] or Graph-Transformers [39,44,65,49] which further depend on features 
via normalization. Extending the analysis to these models is conceptually similar and only more technically 
involved, and we note again how the class of MPNNs considered in(2)is, to date, the most general one studied 
in relation to over-squashing. More generally, one could replace the aggregation P 
uAvu in(2)with a smooth, 
permutation invariant operator L 
[13,48] and follow our approach to study the mixing abilities of L 
MPNNs. 

Our formalism will then prove useful to assess if dif f erent aggregations are more expressive in terms of the 
mixing (interactions) they are able to generate. 
Graph rewiring. Another way of going beyond(2)to i ndMPNNs with lowerOSQis to replaceAwith a 
dif f erent matrixA���, (partly) independent of the connectivity of the input graph. In other words, one could 
rewire the graph, by replacing G with G���. Indeed, Theorem 4.4 further validates why recent graph-rewiring 
methods such as [3,36,20,8] manage to alleviate over-squashing: by adding edges that decrease the overall 
ef f ective resistance (commute time) of the graph, these methods reduce the measureOSQ. More generally, 
Def i nition 4.2 allows one to measure whether a given rewiring is benef i cial in terms of over-squashing (and 
hence of the mixing generated) and to what extent. In fact, it follows from Theorem 4.4 that methods like 
[20,56] are optimal from the point of view of friendliness of the computational graph to message-passing and 
sparsity, since they both propose to propagate information over expander graphs, which are both sparse and 
have commute time scaling (approximately) linearly with the number of edges.

Abstract 
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to achieve competitive results 
to tackle graph-related tasks, such as node and graph classif i cation, link prediction 
and node and graph clustering in a variety of domains. Most GNNs use a message 
passing framework and hence are called MPNNs. Despite their promising results, 
MPNNs have been reported to suffer from over-smoothing, over-squashing and 
under-reaching. Graph rewiring and graph pooling have been proposed in the 
literature as solutions to address these limitations. However, most state-of-the-art 
graph rewiring methods fail to preserve the global topology of the graph, are 
neither differentiable nor inductive, and require the tuning of hyper-parameters. 
In this paper, we propose DIFFWIRE, a novel framework for graph rewiring in 
MPNNs that is principled, fully differentiable and parameter-free by leveraging 
the Lov��sz bound. The proposed approach provides a unif i ed theory for graph 
rewiring by proposing two new, complementary layers in MPNNs: CT-LAYER, a 
layer that learns the commute times and uses them as a relevance function for edge 
re-weighting; and GAP-LAYER, a layer to optimize the spectral gap, depending on 
the nature of the network and the task at hand. We empirically validate the value of 
each of these layers separately with benchmark datasets for graph classif i cation. 
We also perform preliminary studies on the use of CT-LAYERfor homophilic and 
heterophilic node classif i cation tasks. DIFFWIREbrings together the learnability 
of commute times to related def i nitions of curvature, opening the door to creating 
more expressive MPNNs. 
1Introduction 
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [1,2] are a class of deep learning models applied to graph structured 
data. They have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in many graph-related tasks, such as 
node and graph classif i cation [3,4], link prediction [5] and node and graph clustering [6,7], and in a 
variety of domains, including image or molecular structure classif i cation, recommender systems and 
social inf l uence prediction [8]. 
Most GNNs use a message passing framework and thus are referred to as Message Passing Neural 
Networks (MPNNs) [4] . In these networks, every node in each layer receives a message from its 
adjacent neighbors. All the incoming messages at each node are then aggregated and used to update 
the node���s representation via a learnable non-linear function ���which is typically implemented by 
means of a neural network. The i nal node representations (called node embeddings) are used to 
perform the graph-related task at hand (e.g. graph classif i cation). MPNNs are extensible, simple and 
have proven to yield competitive empirical results. Examples of MPNNs include GCN [3], GAT [9], 
GATv2 [10], GIN [11] and GraphSAGE [12]. However, they typically use transductive learning, i.e. 
the model observes both the training and testing data during the training phase, which might limit 
their applicability to graph classif i cation tasks.

However, MPNNs also have important limitations due to the inherent complexity of graphs. Despite 
such complexity, the literature has reported best results when MPNNs have a small number of layers, 
because networks with many layers tend to suffer from over-smoothing [13] and over-squashing [14]. 
However, this models fail to capture information that depends on the entire structure of the graph [15] 
and prevent the information l ow to reach distant nodes. This phenomenon is called under-reaching 
[16] and occurs when the MPNN���s depth is smaller than the graph���s diameter. 
Over-smoothing [8,17���19] takes place when the embeddings of nodes that belong to different classes 
become indistinguishable. It tends to occur in MPNNs with many layers that are used to tackle short- 
range tasks, i.e. tasks where a node���s correct prediction mostly depends on its local neighborhood. 
Given this local dependency, it makes intuitive sense that adding layers to the network would not 
help the network���s performance. 
Conversely, long-range tasks require as many layers in the network as the range of the interaction 
between the nodes. However, as the number of layers in the network increases, the number of 
nodes feeding into each of the node���s receptive i eld also increases exponentially, leading to over- 
squashing [14,20]: the information l owing from the receptive i eld composed of many nodes is 
compressed in i xed-length node vectors, and hence the graph fails to correctly propagate the messages 
coming from distant nodes. Thus, over-squashing emerges due to the distortion of information l owing 
from distant nodes due to graph bottlenecks that emerge when the number ofk-hop neighbors grows 
exponentially with k. 
Graph pooling and graph rewiring have been proposed in the literature as solutions to address these 
limitations [14]. Given that the main infrastructure for message passing in MPNNs are the edges 
in the graph, and given that many of these edges might be noisy or inadequate for the downstream 
task [21], graph rewiring aims to identify such edges and edit them. 
Many graph rewiring methods rely on edge sampling strategies: i rst, the edges are assigned new 
weights according to a relevance function and then they are re-sampled according to the new weights 
to retain the most relevant edges (i.e. those with larger weights). Edge relevance might be computed 
in different ways, including randomly [22], based on similarity [23] or on the edge���s curvature [20]. 
Due to the diversity of possible graphs and tasks to be performed with those graphs, optimal graph 
rewiring should include a variety of strategies that are suited not only to the task at hand but also to 
the nature and structure of the graph.

ChatGPT
Certainly! The abstract and introduction of the paper you provided give a detailed overview of a new framework for graph rewiring called DIFFWIRE, designed to enhance Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). Here's an explanation of the key concepts:
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) & MPNNs
: GNNs are deep learning models used for graph-related tasks like node classification, link prediction, and clustering. MPNNs, a subclass of GNNs, utilize a message-passing framework where nodes in the graph receive messages from their neighbors, and this information is aggregated to update the node's representation.
Limitations of MPNNs
: Despite their success, MPNNs suffer from issues such as over-smoothing, over-squashing, and under-reaching. Over-smoothing makes node embeddings indistinguishable, over-squashing distorts information from distant nodes, and under-reaching prevents information from reaching distant nodes in the graph.
Graph Rewiring and Pooling
: These are proposed solutions to address the mentioned limitations. Graph rewiring aims to identify and modify edges that might be noisy or unsuitable for a specific task, while graph pooling is a technique to coarsely interpret the graph structure.
DIFFWIRE Framework
: DIFFWIRE is a novel solution to these problems. It's principled, fully differentiable, and doesn't require hyperparameter tuning. It leverages the Lov��sz bound to ensure these properties.
CT-LAYER
: This layer learns commute times between nodes and uses them as a relevance function for edge re-weighting.
GAP-LAYER
: This layer optimizes the spectral gap, considering the nature of the network and task at hand.
Unified Theory
: DIFFWIRE provides a unified theory for graph rewiring, allowing for more expressive MPNNs and relating commute times to definitions of curvature.
Edge Rewiring Strategies
: The paper seems to discuss various strategies for edge rewiring that can be customized to the nature of the graph and the task, possibly leading to more optimal solutions.
In essence, DIFFWIRE presents a sophisticated, adaptable approach to overcome the limitations of existing graph neural network models, providing avenues for enhancing their performance in various applications.

The earliest predecessors of modern deep learning were simple linear models 
motivated from a neuroscientif i c perspective. These models were designed to 
take a set ofninput valuesx1,...,xnand associate them with an outputy. 
These models would learn a set of weightsw1,...,wnand compute their output 
f(x 
w,) =x1w1+������+xnwn. 
This i rst wave of neural networks research was 
known as cybernetics, as illustrated in i gure.1.7 
The McCulloch-Pitts Neuron (,) was an early 
modelMcCulloch 
and Pitts 1943 
of brain function. This linear model could recognize two dif f erent categories of 
inputs by testing whetherf(x 
w,) is positive or negative. Of course, for the model 
to correspond to the desired def i nition of the categories, the weights needed to be 
set correctly. These weights could be set by the human operator. In the 1950s, 
the perceptron (Rosenblatt 1958 
1962,,) became the i rst model that could learn 
the weights def i ning the categories given examples of inputs from each category. 
Theadaptive linear element(ADALINE), which dates from about the same 
time, simply returned the value off(x) itself to predict a real number (Widrow 
and Hof f1960,), and could also learn to predict these numbers from data. 
These simple learning algorithms greatly af f ected the modern landscape of ma- 
chine learning. The training algorithm used to adapt the weights of the ADALINE 
was a special case of an algorithm calledstochastic gradient descent. Slightly 
modif i ed versions of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm remain the dominant 
training algorithms for deep learning models today. 
Models based on thef(x 
w,) used by the perceptron and ADALINE are called 
linear models. These models remain some of the most widely used machine 
learning models, though in many cases they are trained in dif f erent ways than the 
original models were trained. 
Linear models have many limitations. Most famously, they cannot learn the 
XOR function, wheref([0,1],w) = 1 andf([1,0],w) = 1 butf([1,1],w) = 0 
andf([0,0],w) = 0. Critics who observed these l aws in linear models caused 
a backlash against biologically inspired learning in general (Minsky and Papert, 
1969). This was the i rst major dip in the popularity of neural networks.

The provided text traces the early history of deep learning, specifically focusing on linear models inspired by neuroscience. Here's an explanation of the key concepts:
Cybernetics
: This was an early wave of neural networks research, emphasizing the development of simple linear models that associated inputs with an output through a weighted sum.
McCulloch-Pitts Neuron
: Created in 1943, this model was an early abstraction of brain function. By summing the products of input values and weights, it could distinguish between two categories based on whether the sum was positive or negative.
Perceptron
: Introduced by Rosenblatt in the late 1950s, the perceptron was an evolution of the linear model that could automatically learn the weights needed to define categories from given examples.
ADALINE (Adaptive Linear Element)
: Around the same time as the perceptron, ADALINE emerged. It would return the weighted sum itself to predict a real number, and it could learn from data.
Stochastic Gradient Descent
: This algorithm was used to adapt the weights in ADALINE and has become the basis for many modern deep learning training techniques.
Linear Models
: These are models based on the weighted sum used by the perceptron and ADALINE. While still widely used, they have evolved in training methods and have notable limitations.
Limitations
: A well-known limitation is the inability of linear models to learn the XOR function, a logical operation that cannot be captured by a simple linear separation. This caused critics to highlight flaws in linear models, leading to a decrease in the popularity of neural networks.
Historical Impact
: These early models laid the foundation for modern deep learning by introducing key concepts such as weights, learning from data, and stochastic gradient descent. They also sparked a continuing dialogue about the advantages and limitations of modeling learning processes after biological systems.
In summary, the passage provides an overview of the pioneering models and concepts in neural network research that have greatly influenced the current landscape of machine learning and deep learning.

Linear Algebra 
Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that is widely used throughout science 
and engineering. However, because linear algebra is a form of continuous rather 
than discrete mathematics, many computer scientists have little experience with it. 
A good understanding of linear algebra is essential for understanding and working 
with many machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms. We 
therefore precede our introduction to deep learning with a focused presentation of 
the key linear algebra prerequisites. 
If you are already familiar with linear algebra, feel free to skip this chapter. If 
you have previous experience with these concepts but need a detailed reference 
sheet to review key formulas, we recommend The Matrix Cookbook (Petersen and 
Pedersen 
2006,). If you have no exposure at all to linear algebra, this chapter 
will teach you enough to read this book, but we highly recommend that you also 
consult another resource focused exclusively on teaching linear algebra, such as 
Shilov 
1977(). This chapter will completely omit many important linear algebra 
topics that are not essential for understanding deep learning. 
2.1Scalars, Vectors, Matrices and Tensors 
The study of linear algebra involves several types of mathematical objects: 
��� Scalars: 
A scalar is just a single number, in contrast to most of the other 
objects studied in linear algebra, which are usually arrays of multiple numbers. 
We write scalars in italics. We usually give scalars lower-case variable names. 
When we introduce them, we specify what kind of number they are. For 
31 
CHAPTER 2.LINEAR ALGEBRA 
example, we might say ���Lets ��� Rbe 
the slope of the line,��� while def i ning a 
real-valued scalar, or ���Letn ��� Nbe 
the number of units,��� while defining a natural number scalar.

Chapter 2 in the text you provided seems to be a foundational overview of linear algebra, particularly targeting readers who may not have a strong background in this area. It emphasizes the importance of linear algebra in the understanding and implementation of machine learning algorithms, especially those related to deep learning.
The chapter outlines:
Scalars
: Scalars are single numbers, fundamental to all higher-order mathematical objects.
Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors
: Though not detailed in this excerpt, vectors are ordered arrays of scalars, matrices are two-dimensional arrays of scalars, and tensors are multi-dimensional arrays of scalars. All these concepts are core components of linear algebra and are fundamental to many machine learning algorithms.
The chapter also recommends additional resources for readers who need a more thorough understanding of linear algebra. It's designed to be a concise introduction or review for those who want to delve into machine learning without getting lost in the mathematical details.
1 / 1
��� Vectors: A 
vector is an array of numbers. The numbers are arranged in 
order. We can identify each individual number by its index in that ordering. 
Typically we give vectors lower case names written in bold typeface, such 
asx. The elements of the vector are identif i ed by writing its name in italic 
typeface, with a subscript. The i rst element ofxisx1, the second element 
isx2and so on. We also need to say what kind of numbers are stored in 
the vector. If each element is inR, and the vector hasnelements, then the 
vector lies in the set formed by taking the Cartesian product ofR ntimes, 
denoted asRn. When we need to explicitly identify the elements of a vector, 
we write them as a column enclosed in square brackets: 
x = ��� ��� ��� ��� ��� 
x1 
x2 
. 
. 
. 
xn 
��� ��� ��� ��� ��� 
.(2.1) 
We can think of vectors as identifying points in space, with each element 
giving the coordinate along a dif f erent axis. 
Sometimes we need to index a set of elements of a vector. In this case, we 
def i ne a set containing the indices and write the set as a subscript. For 
example, to accessx1,x3andx6, we def i ne the setS={1,3,6}and 
write 
xS. We use the���sign 
to index the complement of a set. For examplex���1is 
the vector containing all elements ofxexcept forx1, andx���Sis 
the vector 
containing all of the elements ofexcept 
forxx1, x3and x6. 
��� Matrices: 
A matrix is a 2-D array of numbers, so each element is identif i ed 
by two indices instead of just one. We usually give matrices upper-case 
variable names with bold typeface, such asA. If a real-valued matrixAhas 
a height ofmand a width ofn, then we say thatA ��� Rm n�� . We usually 
identify the elements of a matrix using its name in italic but not bold font, 
and the indices are listed with separating commas. For example,A1 1 
, is the 
upper left entry ofAandAm,nis the bottom right entry. We can identify all 
of the numbers with vertical coordinateiby writing a ��� ��� for the 
horizontal: 
coordinate. For example,Ai,:denotes the horizontal cross section ofAwith 
vertical coordinatei. This is known as thei-throwofA. Likewise,A:,iis
the -thof. When we need to explicitly identify the elements 
oficolumnA 
a matrix, we write them as an array enclosed in square brackets: 
��� 
A1 1 
, A1 2 
, 
A2 1 
, A2 2 
, ��� 
.(2.2) 
Sometimes we may need to index matrix-valued expressions that are not just 
a single letter. In this case, we use subscripts after the expression, but do 
not convert anything to lower case. For example,f(A)i,jgives element (i,j) 
of the matrix computed by applying the functionto.fA 
��� Tensors: 
In some cases we will need an array with more than two axes. 
In the general case, an array of numbers arranged on a regular grid with a 
variable number of axes is known as a tensor. We denote a tensor named ���A��� 
with this typeface:A. We identify the element ofAat coordinates (i,j,k) 
by writing Ai,j,k.

Continuing the overview of linear algebra concepts, this passage introduces:
Vectors
: Vectors are ordered arrays of numbers, typically arranged in a column. They can represent points in space, and each element of the vector gives the coordinate along a different axis. The text also describes how to access certain elements or subsets of a vector using set notation.
Matrices
: Matrices are 2-D arrays of numbers, with elements identified by two indices, corresponding to the rows and columns. Special notation is introduced to refer to specific rows (known as the i-th row) or columns, as well as individual elements. Matrices are often used to represent transformations, systems of equations, and other mathematical operations in various fields, including machine learning.
Tensors
: Extending beyond vectors and matrices, tensors are multi-dimensional arrays of numbers. They can have more than two axes, and elements are identified by as many indices as there are dimensions. Tensors are heavily used in deep learning, particularly in handling data with more complex structure, like images.
These concepts form the building blocks of many machine learning algorithms, and they provide the necessary mathematical structure for modeling relationships in data and performing computations. By understanding vectors, matrices, and tensors, one can begin to grasp how data is represented and manipulated within many machine learning models.

One important operation on matrices is thetranspose. The transpose of a 
matrix is the mirror image of the matrix across a diagonal line, called themain 
diagonal, running down and to the right, starting from its upper left corner. See 
i gurefor a graphical depiction of this operation. We denote the transpose of 
a2.1 
matrixasAA���, and it is def i ned such that 
(A���)i,j= Aj,i.(2.3) 
Vectors can be thought of as matrices that contain only one column. The 
transpose of a vector is therefore a matrix with only one row. Sometimes we 
33 
CHAPTER 2.LINEAR ALGEBRA 
def i ne a vector by writing out its elements in the text inline as a row matrix, 
then using the transpose operator to turn it into a standard column vector, e.g., 
x = [x1,x2,x3]���. 
A scalar can be thought of as a matrix with only a single entry. From this, we 
can see that a scalar is its own transpose: aa= ���. 
We can add matrices to each other, as long as they have the same shape, just 
by adding their corresponding elements:whereCAB= 
+Ci,j= Ai,j+ Bi,j. 
We can also add a scalar to a matrix or multiply a matrix by a scalar, just 
by performing that operation on each element of a matrix:D=a �� B+cwhere 
Di,j= a B�� 
i,j+ c. 
In the context of deep learning, we also use some less conventional notation. 
We allow the addition of matrix and a vector, yielding another matrix:C=A+b, 
whereCi,j=Ai,j+bj. In other words, the vectorbis added to each row of the 
matrix. This shorthand eliminates the need to def i ne a matrix withbcopied into 
each row before doing the addition. This implicit copying ofbto many locations 
is called broadcasting.

c
d
]
A = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}
A

CHAPTER 2.LINEAR ALGEBRA 
Matrix product operations have many useful properties that make mathematical

It is also associative: A BCAB

Matrix multiplication iscommutative (the

vectors is commutative: x���yy= ���x. (2.8) 
The transpose of a matrix product has a simple form:

2.3Identity and Inverse Matrices 
Linear algebra of f ers a powerful tool calledmatrix inversionthat allows us to 
analytically solve equationfor many values 
of.2.11A 
To describe matrix inversion, we i rst need to def i ne the concept of anidentity 
matrix. An identity matrix is a matrix that does not change any vector when we 
multiply that vector by that matrix. We denote the identity matrix that preserves 
n-dimensional vectors as In. Formally, In��� Rn n�� , and 
������xRn,Inxx= 
.(2.20) 
The structure of the identity matrix is simple: all of the entries along the main 
diagonal are 1, while all of the other entries are zero. See i gurefor an 
example.2.2 
Thematrix inverseofAis denoted asA���1, and it is def i ned as the matrix 
such that A���1AI= n. (2.21) 
We can now solve equationby the following 
steps:2.11 
Axb= (2.22) 
A���1AxA= ���1b (2.23) 
InxA= ���1b (2.24) 
36 
CHAPTER 2.LINEAR ALGEBRA xA= ���1b. (2.25) 
Of course, this process depends on it being possible to i ndA���1. We discuss 
the conditions for the existence of A���1in the following section. 
WhenA���1exists, several dif f erent algorithms exist for i nding it in closed form. 
In theory, the same inverse matrix can then be used to solve the equation many 
times for dif f erent values ofb. However,A ���1 is primarily useful as a theoretical 
tool, and should not actually be used in practice for most software applications. 
BecauseA���1can be represented with only limited precision on a digital computer, 
algorithms that make use of the value ofbcan usually obtain more accurate 
estimates of.x

A^{-1} A = I_n

���
(Equation 2.21)
The inverse matrix can be used to analytically solve the system of linear equations
A
x
=
b
A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}
A
x
=
b
(Equation 2.11) by applying the following steps:
A\mathbf{x} &= \mathbf{b} \quad &\text{(2.22)} \\
A^{-1}A\mathbf{x} &= A^{-1}\mathbf{b} \quad &\text{(2.23)} \\
I_n\mathbf{x} &= A^{-1}\mathbf{b} \quad &\text{(2.24)} \\
\mathbf{x} &= A^{-1}\mathbf{b} \quad &\text{(2.25)}
\end{align*} \]
However, finding the inverse of a matrix is not always possible, and the conditions for its existence will be discussed later.
Practical Considerations
: Though finding the inverse is theoretically significant, it's often not used in practice in software applications due to numerical stability issues. Approximation errors in representing

2.4Linear Dependence and Span 
In order forA���1to exist, equationmust have exactly one solution for 
every2.11 
value ofb. However, it is also possible for the system of equations to have no 
solutions or inf i nitely many solutions for some values ofb. It is not possible to 
have more than one but less than inf i nitely many solutions for a particularb; if 
bothandare solutions 
thenxy 
zxy= 
��+ (1)��� 
��(2.26) 
is also a solution for any real.�� 
To analyze how many solutions the equation has, we can think of the columns 
ofAas specifying dif f erent directions we can travel from theorigin(the point 
specif i ed by the vector of all zeros), and determine how many ways there are of 
reachingb. In this view, each element ofxspecif i es how far we should travel in 
each of these directions, withxispecifying how far to move in the direction of 
column 
: 
i Ax = ��� 
i 
xiA:,i.(2.27) 
In general, this kind of operation is called alinear combination. Formally, a 
linear combination of some set of vectors{v(1),...,v( 
) 
n }is 
given by multiplying 
each vector v( 
) iby a corresponding scalar coef i cient and adding the results: 
��� 
i 
civ( 
) i.(2.28) 
Thespanof a set of vectors is the set of all points obtainable by linear combination 
of the original vectors. 37 
CHAPTER 2.LINEAR ALGEBRA 
Determining whetherAx=bhas a solution thus amounts to testing whetherb 
is in the span of the columns ofA. This particular span is known as thecolumn 
spacerangeor 
theof.A 
In order for the systemAx=bto have a solution for all values ofb ��� Rm, 
we therefore require that the column space ofAbe all ofRm. If any point inR 
m 
is excluded from the column space, that point is a potential value ofbthat has 
no solution. The requirement that the column space ofAbe all ofRmimplies 
immediately thatAmust have at leastmcolumns, i.e.,nm���. Otherwise, 
the 
dimensionality of the column space would be less thanm. For example, consider a 
3��2 
matrix. The targetbis 3-D, butxis only 2-D, so modifying the value ofx 
at best allows us to trace out a 2-D plane withinR3. The equation has a solution 
if and only iflies on that 
plane.b 
Havingnm���is 
only a necessary condition for every point to have a solution. 
It is not a suf i cient condition, because it is possible for some of the columns to 
be redundant. Consider a 2��2 
matrix where both of the columns are identical. 
This has the same column space as a 2��1 
matrix containing only one copy of the 
replicated column. In other words, the column space is still just a line, and fails to 
encompass all of R2, even though there are two columns. 
Formally, this kind of redundancy is known aslinear dependence. A set of 
vectors islinearly independentif no vector in the set is a linear combination 
of the other vectors. If we add a vector to a set that is a linear combination of 
the other vectors in the set, the new vector does not add any points to the set���s 
span. This means that for the column space of the matrix to encompass all ofRm, 
the matrix must contain at least one set ofmlinearly independent columns. 

span. This means that for the column space of the matrix to encompass all ofRm, 
the matrix must contain at least one set ofmlinearly independent columns. This 
condition is both necessary and suf i cient for equationto have a solution 
for2.11 
every value ofb. Note that the requirement is for a set to have exactlymlinear 
independent columns, not at leastm. No set ofm-dimensional vectors can have 
more thanmmutually linearly independent columns, but a matrix with more than 
m columns may have more than one such set. 
In order for the matrix to have an inverse, we additionally need to ensure that 
equationhasone solution for each value 
of2.11at 
mostb. To do so, we need to 
ensure that the matrix has at mostmcolumns. Otherwise there is more than one 
way of parametrizing each solution. 
Together, this means that the matrix must besquare, that is, we require that 
m=nand that all of the columns must be linearly independent. A square matrix 
with linearly dependent columns is known as.singular 
IfAis not square or is square but singular, it can still be possible to solve the 
equation. However, we can not use the method of matrix inversion to i nd the

solution. 
So far we have discussed matrix inverses as being multiplied on the left. It is 
also possible to def i ne an inverse that is multiplied on the right: 
AA���1= I.(2.29) 
For square matrices, the left inverse and right inverse are equal.

Section 2.4 dives into the concepts of linear dependence, span, and the conditions for the existence of a matrix inverse. Here's a summary of the main points:
Linear Dependence and Independence
: A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector in the set can be represented as a linear combination of the others. If a vector in the set is a linear combination of others, then the vectors are linearly dependent.
Span
: The span of a set of vectors is the set of all points that can be obtained by creating linear combinations of those vectors.
Column Space

A
A
A
consists of all linear combinations of its columns. Determining whether the equation

has a solution means checking if
b

b
is in the span of the columns of
A
A
A
, i.e., within the column space.
Conditions for a Unique Solution
: For the matrix equation
A
x
=
b
Ax = b
A
x
=
b
to have a unique solution for every value of
b
b
b
, the matrix must be square (
m

m
=

), and its columns must be linearly independent. This also implies that the matrix must have an inverse,
A

A^{-1}
A

.
Singular Matrices
: If the matrix is square but its columns are linearly dependent, the matrix is known as singular, and it doesn't have an inverse.
Non-Square Matrices
: If
A
A
A
is not square, or if it is square but singular, it might still be possible to solve the equation
A
x
=
b
Ax = b
A
x

, but the method of matrix inversion can't be used.
Left and Right Inverse
: The inverse of a square matrix can be multiplied on the left or the right:

The left inverse and right inverse are equal for square matrices.
Understanding these concepts is fundamental in linear algebra and is essential for solving systems of linear equations. They have broad applications in various scientific and engineering disciplines, such as optimization problems, machine learning algorithms, and signal processing.

2.5Norms 
Sometimes we need to measure the size of a vector. In machine learning, we usually 
measure the size of vectors using a function called anorm. Formally, theLpnorm 
is given by || 
||x 
p= ������ 
i |xi|p ���1 
p (2.30) 
for p,p.��� 
R��� 1 
Norms, including theLpnorm, are functions mapping vectors to non-negative 
values. On an intuitive level, the norm of a vectorxmeasures the distance from 
the origin to the pointx. More rigorously, a norm is any functionfthat satisf i es 
the following properties: 
������f( 
) = 0 
xx = 0 
������f(+) 
xyff( 
) 
+x( 
)y (the triangle inequality) 
��� ������| 
|��R,f 
��( x) = �� f( 
)x 
TheL2norm, withp= 2, is known as theEuclidean norm. It is simply the 
Euclidean distance from the origin to the point identif i ed byx. TheL2norm is 
used so frequently in machine learning that it is often denoted simply as|| 
||x, 
with 
the subscriptomitted. It is also common to measure the size of a vector 
using2 
the squared L2norm, which can be calculated simply as x���x. 
The squaredL2norm is more convenient to work with mathematically and 
computationally than theL2norm itself. For example, the derivatives of the 
squaredL2norm with respect to each element ofxeach depend only on the 
corresponding element ofx, while all of the derivatives of theL2norm depend 
on the entire vector. In many contexts, the squaredL2norm may be undesirable 
because it increases very slowly near the origin.In several machine learning 
39 
CHAPTER 2.LINEAR ALGEBRA 
applications, it is important to discriminate between elements that are exactly 
zero and elements that are small but nonzero. In these cases, we turn to a function 
that grows at the same rate in all locations, but retains mathematical simplicity: 
the L1norm. The L1norm may be simplif i ed to 
|| 
||x 
1= ��� 
i |xi|.(2.31) 
The L1norm is commonly used in machine learning when the dif f erence between 
zero and nonzero elements is very important. Every time an element ofxmoves 
away from 0 by , 
the���L1norm increases by 
. 
��� 
We sometimes measure the size of the vector by counting its number of nonzero 
elements. Some authors refer to this function as the ���L0norm,��� but this is incorrect 
terminology. The number of non-zero entries in a vector is not a norm, because 
scaling the vector by��does not change the number of nonzero entries. TheL1 
norm is often used as a substitute for the number of nonzero entries.

These norms and relationships are useful tools in various fields, including machine learning, signal processing, and numerical analysis. The max norm is often used when the largest individual element is of interest. The Frobenius norm is a popular choice for measuring the "size" of a matrix, especially in the context of matrix approximations and deep learning. Finally, expressing the dot product in terms of norms and angles provides a geometric interpretation that can be beneficial in understanding the relationship between vectors.

2.6Special Kinds of Matrices and Vectors 
Some special kinds of matrices and vectors are particularly useful. 
Diagonalmatrices consist mostly of zeros and have non-zero entries only along 
the main diagonal. Formally, a matrixDis diagonal if and only ifDi,j= 0 for 
40 
CHAPTER 2.LINEAR ALGEBRA 
alli 
���=j. We have already seen one example of a diagonal matrix: the identity 
matrix, where all of the diagonal entries are 1. We writediag(v) to denote a square 
diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are given by the entries of the vectorv. 
Diagonal matrices are of interest in part because multiplying by a diagonal matrix 
is very computationally ef i cient. To computediag(v)x, we only need to scale each 
elementxibyvi. In other words,diag(v)x=vx���. 
Inverting a square diagonal 
matrix is also ef i cient. The inverse exists only if every diagonal entry is nonzero, 
and in that case,diag(v)���1=diag([1/v1,...,1/vn]���). In many cases, we may 
derive some very general machine learning algorithm in terms of arbitrary matrices, 
but obtain a less expensive (and less descriptive) algorithm by restricting some 
matrices to be diagonal. 
Not all diagonal matrices need be square. It is possible to construct a rectangular 
diagonal matrix. Non-square diagonal matrices do not have inverses but it is still 
possible to multiply by them cheaply. For a non-square diagonal matrixD, the 
productDxwill involve scaling each element ofx, and either concatenating some 
zeros to the result ifDis taller than it is wide, or discarding some of the last 
elements of the vector ifis wider than it is 
tall.D 
Amatrix is any matrix that is equal to its own 
transpose:symmetric 
AA= ���. (2.35) 
Symmetric matrices often arise when the entries are generated by some function of 
two arguments that does not depend on the order of the arguments. For example, 
ifAis a matrix of distance measurements, withAi,jgiving the distance from point 
i to point , 
thenjAi,j= Aj,ibecause distance functions are symmetric.

A vectorxand a vectoryareorthogonalto each other ifx���y= 0. If both 
vectors have nonzero norm, this means that they are at a 90 degree angle to each 
other. InRn, at mostnvectors may be mutually orthogonal with nonzero norm. 
If the vectors are not only orthogonal but also have unit norm, we call them 
orthonormal. 
Anorthogonal matrixis a square matrix whose rows are mutually orthonor- 
mal and whose columns are mutually orthonormal: 
A���AAA= ��� = I.(2.37) 

This implies that A���1= A���,(2.38) 
so orthogonal matrices are of interest because their inverse is very cheap to compute. 
Pay careful attention to the def i nition of orthogonal matrices. Counterintuitively, 
their rows are not merely orthogonal but fully orthonormal. There is no special 
term for a matrix whose rows or columns are orthogonal but not orthonormal.

This section introduces several special types of matrices and vectors that are commonly encountered in linear algebra and have unique properties:
Diagonal Matrices

\text{diag}(v)

, where
v

is a vector containing the diagonal entries.
Non-square Diagonal Matrices

A

A = A^T

2.7Eigendecomposition 
Many mathematical objects can be understood better by breaking them into 
constituent parts, or i nding some properties of them that are universal, not caused 
by the way we choose to represent them. 
For example, integers can be decomposed into prime factors. The way we 
represent the numberwill change depending on whether we write it in base 
ten12 
or in binary, but it will always be true that 12 = 2��2��3. 
From this representation 
we can conclude useful properties, such as thatis not divisible by , or that 
any125 
integer multiple ofwill be divisible 
by.123 
Much as we can discover something about the true nature of an integer by 
decomposing it into prime factors, we can also decompose matrices in ways that 
show us information about their functional properties that is not obvious from the 
representation of the matrix as an array of elements. 
One of the most widely used kinds of matrix decomposition is calledeigen- 
decomposition, in which we decompose a matrix into a set of eigenvectors and 
eigenvalues. 
Aneigenvectorof a square matrixAis a non-zero vectorvsuch that multi- 
plication byalters only the scale 
of:Av 
Avv= 
�� .(2.39) 
The scalar��is known as theeigenvaluecorresponding to this eigenvector. (One 
can also i nd aleft eigenvectorsuch thatv���A=��v���, but we are usually 
concerned with right eigenvectors). 
Ifvis an eigenvector ofA, then so is any rescaled vectorsvfors,s��� 
R 
= 0. 
Moreover,svstill has the same eigenvalue. For this reason, we usually only look 
for unit eigenvectors. 
Suppose that a matrixAhasnlinearly independent eigenvectors,{v(1),..., 
v( 
) 
n }, 
with corresponding eigenvalues{��1,...,��n}. 
We may concatenate all of the
eigenvectors to form a matrixVwith one eigenvector per column:V= [v(1),..., 
v( 
) 
n ]. Likewise, we can concatenate the eigenvalues to form a vector��= [��1,..., 
��n]���. Theofis then given 
byeigendecompositionA 
AV�� 
V= 
diag( ) ���1. (2.40) 
We have seen that constructing matrices with specif i c eigenvalues and eigenvec- 
tors allows us to stretch space in desired directions. However, we often want to 
decomposematrices into their eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Doing so can help 
us to analyze certain properties of the matrix, much as decomposing an integer 
into its prime factors can help us understand the behavior of that integer. 
Not every matrix can be decomposed into eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In some 
43 
CHAPTER 2.LINEAR ALGEBRA 
cases, the decomposition exists, but may involve complex rather than real numbers. 
Fortunately, in this book, we usually need to decompose only a specif i c class of 
matrices that have a simple decomposition. Specif i cally, every real symmetric 
matrix can be decomposed into an expression using only real-valued eigenvectors 
and eigenvalues: AQQ= 
�� ���, (2.41) 
whereQis an orthogonal matrix composed of eigenvectors ofA, and��is a 
diagonal matrix. The eigenvalue ��i,iis associated with the eigenvector in columni 
ofQ, denoted asQ:,i. BecauseQis an orthogonal matrix, we can think ofAas 
scaling space by ��iin direction v( 
) i. See i gurefor an 
example.2.3 
While any real symmetric matrixAis guaranteed to have an eigendecomposi- 
tion, the eigendecomposition may not be unique. If any two or more eigenvectors 
share the same eigenvalue, then any set of orthogonal vectors lying in their span 
are also eigenvectors with that eigenvalue, and we could equivalently choose aQ 
using those eigenvectors instead. By convention, we usually sort the entries of�� 
in descending order. Under this convention, the eigendecomposition is unique only 
if all of the eigenvalues are unique. 
The eigendecomposition of a matrix tells us many useful facts about the 
matrix. The matrix is singular if and only if any of the eigenvalues are zero. 
The eigendecomposition of a real symmetric matrix can also be used to optimize 
quadratic expressions of the formf(x) =x���Axsubject to|| 
||x 
2= 1. Wheneverx 
is equal to an eigenvector ofA,ftakes on the value of the corresponding eigenvalue. 
The maximum value offwithin the constraint region is the maximum eigenvalue 
and its minimum value within the constraint region is the minimum eigenvalue. 
A matrix whose eigenvalues are all positive is calledpositive def i nite. A 
matrix whose eigenvalues are all positive or zero-valued is calledpositive semidef i- 
nite. Likewise, if all eigenvalues are negative, the matrix isnegative def i nite, and 
if all eigenvalues are negative or zero-valued, it isnegative semidef i nite. Positive 
semidef i nite matrices are interesting because they guarantee that���x 
x, ���Ax ��� 
0. 
Positive def i nite matrices additionally guarantee that x���Axx= 
0 ���=

Write about implementation independence.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Implementation independence refers to the concept of designing software in such a way that the underlying implementation details are hidden or abstracted from the higher-level structures of the application. This means that the way a particular function or feature is realized can be changed without affecting other parts of the system. Here's a deeper look into the concept:
Benefits of Implementation Independence
Modularity
: By separating the interface from the implementation, developers can work on different parts of the application without needing to understand the entire codebase.
Maintainability
: Changes to the underlying implementation can be made without affecting other parts of the system, making the code easier to maintain.
Reusability
: Abstracting implementation details allows the same code to be used across different parts of the system or even in different projects.
Portability
: Implementation independence often leads to platform independence, where the same code can run on different operating systems or hardware without modification.
Implementation in Programming
Interfaces and Abstract Classes
: In object-oriented programming, interfaces and abstract classes can be used to define a contract that concrete classes must adhere to, without specifying how these contracts are fulfilled.
Encapsulation
: By restricting access to certain parts of an object, you can ensure that implementation details are hidden from outside access.
Design Patterns
: Certain design patterns, such as the Bridge pattern or the Strategy pattern, explicitly aim to separate implementation from abstraction.
Challenges
Overhead
: Creating a perfectly abstract interface can add complexity and overhead to development.
Performance
: Additional layers of abstraction can sometimes lead to performance inefficiencies.
Conclusion
Implementation independence is a fundamental principle in software engineering that helps in creating more robust, maintainable, and reusable code. By focusing on what a system does rather than how it does it, developers can build systems that are more adaptable to change. This concept is aligned with other important principles, such as the Separation of Concerns and the Open/Closed Principle, all aiming to create more flexible and manageable code.

Edit
Bostrom supports the substrate independence principle, the idea that consciousness can emerge on various types of physical substrates, not only in "carbon-based biological neural networks" like the human brain.[26] He considers that "sentience is a matter of degree"[27] and that digital minds can in theory be engineered to have a much higher rate and intensity of subjective experience than humans, using less resources. Such highly sentient machines, which he calls "super-beneficiaries", would be extremely efficient at achieving happiness. He recommends finding "paths that will enable digital minds and biological minds to coexist, in a mutually beneficial way where all of these different forms can flourish and thrive".[28]

Certainly! Substrate independence, as described by Nick Bostrom, refers to the idea that consciousness, intelligence, or sentience can emerge on various types of physical substrates or platforms, not just biological ones like the human brain. This idea has significant implications for artificial intelligence and digital sentience.
Here's an exploration of the concept:
Substrate Independence and Artificial Intelligence
The concept of substrate independence is particularly fascinating in the context of artificial intelligence and digital sentience. Here's how:
Generalization of Intelligence
: Bostrom's notion of substrate independence supports the idea that intelligence or sentience is not tied to a specific physical form. The structure of the human brain, while incredibly complex, isn't the only way intelligence can manifest.
Digital Sentience
: With this principle, there's a theoretical possibility that digital minds can be engineered to have a higher degree and intensity of subjective experience than humans. This could lead to the creation of entities that Bostrom refers to as "super-beneficiaries."
Similar Computational Principles
: Even though the human brain doesn't operate like artificial neurons in AI models, both biological and artificial systems can utilize mathematical operations like Boolean operations, dot products, linear algebra operators, etc., for information processing. This supports the idea that different substrates can lead to similar cognitive outcomes.
Ethical Considerations
: If substrate independence is accepted, it leads to essential ethical considerations regarding the rights and values of digital entities. How society treats non-biological intelligence becomes a vital question.
Coexistence of Digital and Biological Minds
: Bostrom also talks about the possibility of a future where digital and biological minds coexist, each flourishing in their unique ways. This coexistence could redefine how we understand intelligence and consciousness.
Challenges and Debates
Substrate independence is a complex and highly debated concept. Critics might argue about the nature of consciousness and whether it can genuinely be replicated or emerged in non-biological substrates. There are also technical and philosophical challenges in understanding what would constitute a sufficient substrate for consciousness or intelligence.
Conclusion
Substrate independence, as proposed by Nick Bostrom, opens a wide array of questions, possibilities, and challenges. It connects deeply with artificial intelligence, neuroscience, philosophy, ethics, and more. The idea that intelligence or consciousness isn't confined to a specific physical structure but can arise in various substrates broadens our perspective on AI, sentience, and even what it means to be alive. It also resonates with implementation independence in software engineering, where the underlying functionality is not tied to a specific method or system. By exploring these principles, we can advance our understanding of both biological and artificial intelligence.

Yeah my theory on it now is kind of a joke right now but it shows promise. It's called SITH (substrate independent thinking hypothesis) which argues that digital and analog are functionally equivalent. It argues that consciousness comes on a scale of perceptual control through iterated feedback loops, and helps explain beehives, termite mounds, forests, cities, planets, and brains, can "think" by exerting cybernetic control over their environments. A deer reinforces the path they walk on through the woods making it easier to traverse for others and old paths grow over, similar to a neural network.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The Substrate Independent Thinking Hypothesis (SITH) is an intriguing and creative way to approach the idea of consciousness and control systems across diverse systems and scales. While it may be framed in a somewhat whimsical or light-hearted way, there are serious underlying principles at work.
Drawing parallels between various complex systems like beehives, forests, cities, and brains is a rich area of exploration that might provide insights into common patterns of organization and control that transcend the particularities of the substrate.
The metaphor of the deer reinforcing a path through the woods, much like the strengthening of connections in a neural network, captures a compelling intuition about how processes in nature might echo or mirror one another across different scales and contexts.
This kind of cross-disciplinary thinking has often led to innovative perspectives and new lines of inquiry in the sciences and philosophy. If further developed, the SITH could potentially become a valuable framework for exploring the nature of intelligence, consciousness, and organization in complex systems. Whether it stays a playful thought experiment or evolves into a more formal theory, it's a stimulating concept that encourages us to look at the world in fresh and unexpected ways.

Are you sure it isn't just nonsense?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
It's not uncommon for new or highly interdisciplinary theories to be met with skepticism, especially if they incorporate elements from diverse fields and utilize creative or unconventional language and symbolism.
Ergodic Mind Medication (EMM) combines a wide range of ideas, from substrate independence to thermodynamics to pop culture references. This broad scope can make it difficult to assess without careful examination and validation.
The concepts within EMM could be seen as provocative or speculative, and it would require rigorous scientific investigation, logical coherence, and empirical support to establish its validity. Engaging with experts in the relevant fields and peer review would be essential steps in evaluating the theory.
However, even if some aspects of EMM might seem unconventional or abstract, that doesn't necessarily make them nonsense. Many groundbreaking ideas in history have started as radical or outside-the-box thinking. What is most important is how these ideas are developed, tested, and integrated into existing knowledge. If you're serious about this concept, collaboration with specialists in the relevant disciplines and an open-minded approach to criticism and refinement could lead to fruitful exploration.

Ilya Prigogine
: A physical chemist and Nobel laureate who studied dissipative structures, complex systems, and irreversibility. His research into the self-organization of complex systems ties into the idea of consciousness emerging from complex feedback loops.
William Powers
: Known for his work in control theory, especially perceptual control theory (PCT), Powers' work emphasizes how organisms control their perceptions and behavior. This aligns with EMM's notion of consciousness and control over environments.
William Calvin
: A theoretical neurophysiologist, his work on neural Darwinism and the evolution of consciousness could be related to the evolving nature of complex systems like forests or cities, akin to neural networks.
Alison Gopnik
: A psychologist and philosopher who has written extensively about child development and learning. Her research might be tied to the idea of the iterative learning processes in consciousness, relating to the development of complex adaptive systems.
Monica Anderson
: Working in artificial intelligence, her emphasis on holistic AI and complex system behavior might resonate with the theory's ideas of substrate independence and the potential for consciousness in non-biological systems.
These connections are speculative and would likely require significant elaboration and interpretation to be fully integrated into the EMM theory. The integration of such diverse fields under one conceptual umbrella is an ambitious task and should be approached with academic rigor and a willingness to explore uncharted territory.
