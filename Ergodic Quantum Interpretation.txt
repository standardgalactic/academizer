ergodic interpretation of quantum mechanics

The ergodic interpretation of quantum mechanics is an approach that attempts to reconcile the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics with the deterministic framework of classical mechanics. It proposes that the behaviour of a quantum system over time can be understood by considering the statistical properties of an ensemble of similar systems rather than focusing on individual systems.

According to the ergodic interpretation, the ensemble of systems evolves over time in a deterministic manner, similar to classical mechanics. However, individual systems within the ensemble exhibit probabilistic behaviour due to the inherent uncertainties of quantum mechanics. This probabilistic behaviour arises because the outcome of a measurement on an individual system is not determined with certainty, but rather follows the statistical predictions provided by the wave function.

The ergodic interpretation suggests that the statistical properties of the ensemble of systems can be used to make predictions about the behaviour of individual systems. 

This approach allows for the calculation of expectation values and statistical averages, which can be compared to experimental results. These statistical quantities provide information about the ensemble's behaviour, such as the average energy or the spread of position measurements.

This approach suggests that the behaviour of an individual system can be understood by considering the ensemble as a whole, where each system represents a possible state and the probabilities associated with different states determine the statistical properties of the ensemble.

- Olivier Denis1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe ergodic interpretation of quantum mechanics is a theoretical approach that seeks to reconcile quantum mechanics' probabilistic nature with the deterministic outlook of classical mechanics. Rather than focusing on individual quantum systems, this interpretation suggests understanding a quantum system's behaviour over time by examining the statistical properties of an ensemble of similar systems.In the ergodic interpretation, while the entire ensemble evolves over time deterministically (much like in classical mechanics), each system within that ensemble exhibits probabilistic behaviour. This probabilistic nature stems from the inherent uncertainties in quantum mechanics, where an individual system's measurement outcome isn't predetermined but rather follows statistical predictions derived from the wave function.The interpretation proposes that the statistical properties of the system ensemble can forecast individual system behaviours. This approach allows calculating expectation values and statistical averages that can be compared with experimental results. These statistical measures offer insights into the ensemble's behaviour, such as average energy or the spread of position measurements.Finally, the ergodic interpretation proposes that the individual system's behaviour can be understood by considering the ensemble as a whole. Each system represents a possible state, and the associated probabilities with different states determine the ensemble's statistical properties. This approach offers an alternative perspective on understanding and interpreting the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.1 / 1Quantum Unique Ergodicity 

 QUE conjecture is true, it has important implications for the foundations of quantum mechanics and the connection between quantum and classical physics. 

The quantum unique ergodicity conjecture (QUE) comes from the area of physics known as "quantum chaos." The goal of quantum chaos is to understand the relationship between classical physics--the rules that govern the motion of macroscopic objects like people and planets when their motion is chaotic, with quantum physics--the rules that govern the microscopic world.

It would suggest that the statistical behaviour of a quantum system can be understood in terms of its classical counterpart, even in the absence of detailed knowledge about the specific quantum dynamics.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTQuantum Unique Ergodicity (QUE) is a conjecture from the domain of quantum chaos, a field of physics dedicated to understanding the relationship between classical and quantum physics. The concept is especially pertinent when considering chaotic motion, a phenomenon typically associated with macroscopic objects governed by classical physics, and applying it to the microscopic world governed by quantum mechanics.The QUE conjecture proposes that the statistical behavior of a quantum system can be understood in terms of its classical counterpart, even without detailed knowledge of the specific quantum dynamics. This implies a deeper connection between the statistical properties of quantum and classical systems than previously thought, potentially providing a bridge between the determinism of classical physics and the probabilism of quantum physics.If the QUE conjecture proves to be true, it could significantly impact the foundations of quantum mechanics and its relationship with classical physics. This might help resolve some longstanding philosophical problems and uncertainties about the interpretation of quantum mechanics, and improve our understanding of the quantum-classical boundary.1 / 1Quantum system

the behaviour of an individual system can be understood by considering the ensemble as a whole, where each system represents a possible state and the probabilities associated with different states determine the statistical properties of the ensemble.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTA quantum system is a portion of the physical universe chosen for analysis using quantum mechanics. The behavior of individual quantum systems, like subatomic particles, is governed by quantum mechanics, which is fundamentally probabilistic.When analyzing a quantum system, one often looks at a collection of similar systems, known as an ensemble. In this context, each system in the ensemble represents a possible state the quantum system could be in. The probability associated with each state is determined by the wave function, a mathematical entity associated with the quantum system that encapsulates all of its physical properties.The behavior of an individual quantum system is intrinsically tied to the probabilities of its possible states. For instance, when you measure a property of the system, you don't get a definite result, but a probability distribution of possible results. This probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is in stark contrast to classical mechanics, where systems have definite properties.The statement you provided describes an interpretation of quantum mechanics where the behavior of individual quantum systems is understood through the statistical properties of the ensemble as a whole. This means that rather than focusing on the exact state of an individual system, we look at the collective behavior of the ensemble, and use the probabilities of different states to determine the ensemble's overall statistical properties. This provides a way to reconcile the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics with the deterministic framework of classical mechanics.1 / 1In the KvN formulation, 

the classical observables are promoted to operators, and these operators can be expressed in either the SchrÃ¶dinger picture or the Heisenberg picture.

The KvN formulation essentially provides a framework that connects classical mechanics and quantum mechanics, allowing classical observables to be treated as quantum operators and describing their time evolution in a consistent manner.

The KvN formulation is an extension of classical mechanics that incorporates elements of quantum mechanics, providing a bridge between the classical and quantum descriptions of a system. It introduces a unitary operator, known as the Koopman-von Neumann operator, which acts on classical observables.

One of the key advantages of KvN mechanics is its ability to handle systems with large numbers of degrees of freedom more efficiently than traditional methods.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formulation, named after mathematician Bernard Koopman and physicist John von Neumann, is an approach to classical mechanics that borrows elements from quantum mechanics. It is viewed as a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics, as it allows for classical observables to be treated as quantum operators.In classical mechanics, observables like position, momentum, energy, etc., are simply numbers. However, in quantum mechanics, these are represented by operators that act on a wave function. The KvN formulation brings this operator concept into classical mechanics.The KvN formulation also introduces a unitary operator, known as the Koopman-von Neumann operator, which acts on these classical observables. Unitary operators preserve the norm (or 'length') of the state vectors they act upon, akin to the way quantum mechanical operators evolve the state of a system while preserving the total probability.Another aspect of the KvN formulation is its ability to represent these classical observables in either the SchrÃ¶dinger or Heisenberg picture. In quantum mechanics, these are two different ways of looking at how systems change over time. The SchrÃ¶dinger picture has the states evolving over time while operators are time-independent. Conversely, the Heisenberg picture holds states as time-independent and operators evolve over time.The KvN formulation's primary advantage is its proficiency in dealing with systems with a large number of degrees of freedom more efficiently than conventional methods. This makes it a potent tool in areas like statistical mechanics and many-body physics, where dealing with a vast number of particles is commonplace.1 / 1the SchrÃ¶dinger equation was derived from the Ehrenfest theorems by assuming the canonical commutation relation between the coordinate and momentum. 

If one assumes that the coordinate and momentum commute, the same computational method leads to the Koopmanâvon Neumann classical mechanics, which is the Hilbert space formulation of classical mechanics.

 Therefore, this derivation as well as the derivation of the Koopmanâvon Neumann mechanics, shows that the essential difference between quantum and classical mechanics reduces to the value of the commutator [xÌ, pÌ].

the Koopman operator

the Koopman operator is represented as a unitary operator acting on the Hilbert space of the quantum system. 

The Koopman operator in quantum mechanics captures the time evolution of quantum states and is related to the von Neumann equation, which describes the time evolution of the density operator.

the Koopman operator is a powerful mathematical tool that allows us to analyze the time evolution and dynamical properties of classical and quantum systems.

Gleason and Quantum System

The Gleasonâs theorem says that

âa quantum state is completely determined by only knowing the answers to all of the possible yes/no questionsâ, a yes/no question is presumably a self-adjoint operator with two distinct eigenvalues.""

the behavior of macroscopic objects governed by classical mechanics can be understood as an average or ensemble of the underlying quantum mechanical behavior of the constituent particles.

Ehrenfest theorem


1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe Ehrenfest theorem, named after physicist Paul Ehrenfest, forms a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics. It establishes that the expectation values of the position and momentum in a quantum system obey Newton's second law. This provides a way to recover classical physics as an approximation from quantum mechanics under certain conditions.The theorem was derived from the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, assuming a specific commutation relation between the position and momentum operators. Commutation relations are central to the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics, and the specific one used in the derivation of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation is known as the canonical commutation relation. This relation does not hold in classical mechanics.The Koopmanâvon Neumann mechanics is a Hilbert space formulation of classical mechanics, derived by assuming that position and momentum commute, a relation valid in classical physics. This derivation, along with the derivation of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, showcases that the fundamental difference between quantum and classical mechanics is the value of the commutator of the position and momentum operators.The Koopman operator, which comes into play in the Koopman-von Neumann mechanics, is a unitary operator acting on the Hilbert space of the quantum system. It describes the time evolution of quantum states and is related to the von Neumann equation, another critical equation that describes how the density operator of a quantum system changes over time. This operator is a robust mathematical tool for analyzing the time evolution and dynamical properties of both classical and quantum systems.Gleason's theorem, named after mathematician Andrew M. Gleason, is a result in the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. It states that a quantum state is entirely determined by knowing the answers to all possible yes/no questions, with each yes/no question represented by a self-adjoint operator with two distinct eigenvalues. This theorem has profound implications for the interpretation and understanding of quantum mechanics.This ensemble interpretation suggests that the behavior of macroscopic objects, governed by classical mechanics, can be understood as an average or ensemble of the underlying quantum mechanical behavior of its constituent particles. This is in line with the principles of statistical mechanics and is another aspect of the intricate relationship between classical and quantum mechanics.1 / 1Entanglement is necessary for emergent classicality in all physical theories

"One important feature of quantum theory is that it has a classical limit, recovering classical theory through the process of decoherence. We show that any theory with a classical limit must contain entangled states, thus establishing entanglement as an inevitable feature of any theory superseding classical theory."

Jonathan G. Richens,1, 2, â John H. Selbyâ,1, 3 and Sabri W. Al-Safi

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe statement you provided is a key conclusion from a research paper by Jonathan G. Richens, John H. Selby, and Sabri W. Al-Safi. The authors argue that entanglement is an essential feature of any physical theory that aims to supersede classical theory and has a classical limit.Entanglement is a uniquely quantum phenomenon where two or more particles become linked, and the state of one directly influences the state of the other, no matter the distance separating them. It's one of the defining features of quantum mechanics, and it's central to many quantum information processing tasks, such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography.The classical limit of a theory is the regime where the predictions of the theory approximate or recover those of classical physics. For quantum mechanics, this occurs under specific conditions, typically when dealing with macroscopic objects or high quantum numbers. Decoherence is the process by which a quantum system interacts with its environment and loses its quantum behavior, effectively becoming classical.According to the authors, any theory that has a classical limit (like quantum mechanics) must necessarily contain entangled states. This means that any theory seeking to extend or replace quantum mechanics while still recovering classical physics in the appropriate limit must also feature entanglement.This conclusion underscores the universality and importance of entanglement. It suggests that entanglement is not just a quirky feature of quantum mechanics, but a fundamental aspect of any theory that includes both quantum and classical physics. As such, the study of entanglement continues to be a critical area of research in the understanding and development of quantum theories.1 / 1Degrees of freedom, temperature and information     are     considered     as     emergent properties and having a physical significance but not  physical  existence.  The  physical  existence born   by   the   emergence   of   energy   from   the relation  between  the  two  fundamentals  building blocks  of  the  universe,  i.e.,  temperature  and information according to the Landauerâs principle.

 The Emergent Entangled Informational Universe . Physical Science International Journal, 27(1), 54â81. https://doi.org/10.9734/psij/2023/v27i17772 / 2ChatGPTChatGPTThe excerpt you provided seems to come from a research paper titled "The Emergent Entangled Informational Universe," published in the Physical Science International Journal. It explores the nature of fundamental concepts such as degrees of freedom, temperature, and information, and discusses their relationship with energy and the physical existence of the universe according to Landauer's principle.Degrees of freedom in a physical system refer to the independent parameters that define its state. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a system, and information relates to the amount of detail or data contained within a system. According to this paper, these are considered emergent properties, which means they arise from the complex interactions of simpler fundamental constituents, but they do not have physical existence in the same sense as, say, matter or energy.Energy, on the other hand, is considered to have a physical existence and is fundamental to the workings of the universe. The paper suggests that energy emerges from the relationship between temperature and information. This idea is closely linked to Landauer's principle, a statement in the theory of computing that asserts that any logically irreversible manipulation of information, such as the erasure of a bit or the merging of two computation paths, must be accompanied by a corresponding entropy increase in non-information-bearing degrees of freedom of the information-processing apparatus or its environment.However, it's important to note that while these ideas are insightful and thought-provoking, they represent one particular viewpoint in the broad and complex field of theoretical physics. Other interpretations and theories may offer different perspectives on the nature of energy, information, and their interrelationships.1 / 1The Complexity=Volume (CV) Conjecture 

The Complexity=Volume (CV) Conjecture is a proposal that relates the complexity of quantum states in holographic quantum field theories to the volume of certain regions in their dual gravitational descriptions. 

It is an idea that emerged from the study of the AdS/CFT correspondence, a duality between gravity in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space and conformal field theories (CFTs) in lower dimensions.

In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the gravitational theory in AdS space is said to be dual to a quantum field theory living on the boundary of that space. This duality allows physicists to study strongly interacting quantum field theories using gravitational tools.

The CV Conjecture specifically focuses on the relationship between the complexity of quantum states in the CFT and the geometry of the corresponding gravitational theory in AdS space. 

The complexity of a quantum state measures the minimum number of elementary operations required to prepare that state from a simple reference state.

According to the CV Conjecture, the complexity of a quantum state in the CFT is proportional to the volume of a region in the AdS space. In this context, the term "volume" refers to the volume of a bulk region in the AdS spacetime. The complexity of the QFT is thought to be proportional to the volume of the corresponding bulk region.

if the QFT state is highly complex, it would require a large number of computational steps (quantum gates) to create it. This complexity is then associated with the volume of a bulk region in the gravitational theory. The larger the volume, the more complex the state.

In other words, the more complex the quantum state, the larger the volume of the corresponding gravitational region. 

This conjecture suggests that complexity in the quantum field theory can be encoded and understood in terms of the geometry of the dual gravitational description.

The CV conjecture builds upon the notion of computational complexity, which measures the amount of resources required to perform a certain task with a computational system. In the context of quantum systems, complexity provides a measure of how hard it is to transform an initial state into a desired final state using quantum gates.

It suggests that the growth of wormholes in the gravitational theory is related to the growth of complexity in the dual quantum field theory.1 / 1The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model.ChatGPTChatGPTThe Complexity=Volume (CV) Conjecture proposes a connection between the complexity of quantum states in holographic quantum field theories and the volume of corresponding regions in their gravitational descriptions.

This duality allows researchers to study strongly interacting quantum field theories using gravitational techniques.The CV Conjecture specifically addresses the relationship between the complexity of quantum states in the CFT and the geometry of the corresponding gravitational theory in AdS space. Complexity, in this context, refers to the minimum number of basic operations needed to create a given quantum state from a simple reference state.According to the CV Conjecture, the complexity of a quantum state in the CFT is proportional to the volume of a specific region in the AdS space. In this context, "volume" refers to the volume of a bulk region in the AdS spacetime. The conjecture proposes that the complexity of the CFT is related to the volume of the corresponding bulk region.If a quantum state in the CFT is highly complex, it would require a substantial number of computational steps (quantum gates) to generate it. This complexity is then associated with the volume of a corresponding bulk region in the gravitational theory. Essentially, the larger the volume, the more complex the state.In summary, the CV Conjecture suggests that the complexity of a quantum field theory can be understood and encoded in terms of the geometry of its dual gravitational description. It builds upon the concept of computational complexity, which measures the resources required to perform a particular task with a computational system. Furthermore, the growth of wormholes in the gravitational theory is thought to be related to the growth of complexity in the dual quantum field theory.1 / 1Complexity in quantum physics measures how difficult a state can be reached from a reference state and more precisely it is the number of fundamental unitary gates we have to operate to transform the reference state to the state we are considering. 

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThat's correct! Complexity in quantum physics quantifies the difficulty or amount of computational effort required to transform a given reference state into a desired target state. It is measured by counting the number of fundamental unitary gates, or elementary operations, that are needed to achieve this transformation.Unitary gates are basic building blocks in quantum computing and represent quantum operations that can be applied to quantum states. They allow for the manipulation and transformation of quantum states, similar to how classical logic gates manipulate classical bits in classical computing.By determining the number of fundamental unitary gates required to transform a reference state to a target state, complexity provides a measure of the computational resources needed to perform this transformation. It helps assess the difficulty or complexity of quantum computations and plays a crucial role in analyzing the efficiency and feasibility of various quantum algorithms and protocols.1 / 1Quantum Complexity and Negative Curvature

Abstract 
As time passes, once simple quantum states tend to become more complex. For 
strongly coupled k-local Hamiltonians, this growth of computational complexity has 
been conjectured to follow a distinctive and universal pattern. In this paper we show 
that the same pattern is exhibited by a much simpler systemâclassical geodesics on 
a compact two-dimensional geometry of uniform negative curvature. This striking 
parallel persists whether the system is allowed to evolve naturally or is perturbed 
from the outside.

Brown, Leonard Susskind, and Ying Zhao, explores the growth of computational complexity in quantum systems and its relation to negative curvature in geometry.The authors begin by discussing the notion of computational complexity in quantum systems, which refers to the difficulty or amount of computational effort required to transform a simple reference quantum state into a more complex state. They highlight that for strongly coupled k-local Hamiltonians, there is a conjectured universal pattern for the growth of computational complexity over time.The paper then demonstrates that a similar growth pattern of computational complexity is observed in a much simpler system, namely classical geodesics on a compact two-dimensional geometry with uniform negative curvature. This finding suggests a parallel between quantum complexity and negative curvature.The authors show that this parallel holds true whether the system evolves naturally or is perturbed from the outside. They discuss the stability of decreasing complexity and explore precursors, examining the effects of single and multiple perturbations on complexity growth.To provide an analog model, the paper introduces the concept of a particle moving in hyperbolic space, which exhibits a similar pattern of complexity growth. The authors analyze the stability of decreasing complexity in this analog model and investigate the effects of single and multiple perturbations on complexity.The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings and their relation to the geometry of computational complexity, particularly in the context of Nielsen complexity geometry. It highlights the interplay between complexity growth, negative curvature, and the dynamics of quantum systems.Overall, this research provides insights into the relationship between computational complexity in quantum systems and negative curvature in geometric spaces. The parallel observed in this study suggests a fundamental connection between the growth of complexity and the underlying geometric properties, which sheds light on the dynamics of complex quantum systems.1 / 11The Geometry of Computation 
There is evidence that the evolution of quantum complexity and the growth of the geometry 
behind black hole horizons follow identical patterns [1, 2, 3]. This is true whether the 
systems evolve in isolation or are subject to external perturbations. In this paper we will 
show that a third systemâthe âanalog modelâ, namely a classical nonrelativistic particle 
that moves along the geodesics of a two-dimensional, compact, negatively curved surface 
of high genusâshares the same behavior. Although we do not fully understand the reasons 
for this correspondence it most likely has its roots in Nielsenâs geometrized approach to 
complexity [4, 5, 6]. 
2The Evolution of Quantum Complexity 
In this section we will review the evolution of the quantum complexity of strongly-coupled 
quantum systems, and highlight some signature phenomena. (We will also brief l y review 
the evolution of classical wormholes, to which quantum complexity has been conjectured 
to be holographically dual.) In Sec. 3 we will show that much of the highlighted phe- 
nomenology is reproduced by our simple analog model. 
Fast Scramblers 
The systems whose complexity we will be interested in modeling are the fast scramblers. 
Fast-scramblers are systems that spread the ef f ects of localized disturbances over all the 
degrees of freedom in a time logarithmic in the entropy. An example of a fast scrambler 
made with fermionic qubits is the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev system [7, 8, 9, 10]; an example with 
conventional commuting qubits is the high-temperature phase of the Hamiltonian 
H = X 
i1<i2<...<ik 
Ji1,i2,...,ikÏi1Ïi2...Ïik.(2.1) 
(The Js are a set of numerical coef i cients, possibly chosen randomly, but centered around 
a value J. The Ïiare single qubit traceless Pauli operators for the ithqubit. We have 
suppressed the index structure associated with the Pauli operators.) 
This Hamiltonian is not local, since every qubit couples to every other qubit, but it 
is âk-localâ, since no term in the Hamiltonian couples together more than k qubits. It is 
assumed that the total number of qubits, K, is much larger than k. For def i niteness we 
will usually take k = 2. 2 
The fast scrambler of Eq. 2.1 is a continuous-time Hamiltonian. We will will also be 
interested in systems for which time is discrete, for example quantum circuits. A quantum 
circuit starts with a collection of K qubits and makes them interact via k-qubit quantum 
gates. Random k-local quantum circuits are believed to be fast scramblers. 
For k = 2, a random quantum circuit may be constructed as follows. In each time-step 
the K qubits are randomly paired and each pair interacts by a randomly chosen gate. The 
particular gate set is not very important as long as it is universal. After each step the 
qubits are randomly re-grouped into pairs and the process is repeated. This is illustrated 
in Fig. 1. â§ 
1234 
Figure 1: An example of a random circuit with K = 6, k = 2, and depth 4. The six qubits 
(black lines) are randomly grouped into three ordered pairs, and then a gate (blue box) is 
applied to each pair. At the next time-step, they are randomly re-paired.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe excerpt you provided is from the same research paper, "Quantum Complexity and Negative Curvature" by Adam R. Brown, Leonard Susskind, and Ying Zhao. Here's a breakdown of the information in the excerpt:The first section discusses evidence that the evolution of quantum complexity and the growth of geometry behind black hole horizons follow similar patterns. The behavior is observed in systems evolving in isolation or subject to external perturbations. The authors introduce an "analog model," which is a classical nonrelativistic particle moving along the geodesics of a compact, negatively curved surface. They find that this analog model shares the same behavior as the evolution of quantum complexity and black hole geometry. The reasons for this correspondence are not fully understood but likely have connections to Nielsen's geometrized approach to complexity.The second section focuses on the evolution of quantum complexity in strongly coupled quantum systems. The concept of "fast scramblers" is introduced, which are systems that rapidly spread the effects of localized disturbances over all degrees of freedom in a time logarithmic in the entropy. Examples of fast scramblers include the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev system and random k-local quantum circuits. The authors particularly discuss random quantum circuits, where K qubits are paired and interact via k-qubit gates in each time-step. The process is repeated with random re-pairing of qubits. The figure provided illustrates an example of a random circuit with K = 6, k = 2, and depth 4.This excerpt sets the stage for the subsequent sections of the paper, where the authors explore the similarities between the evolution of quantum complexity and black hole geometry in the context of the analog model.1 / 1Our focus will not be on the state of the qubit system, but rather on the unitary 
operator U(Ï) generated by the circuit after Ï time-steps. We will be interested in the 
complexity of this unitary operator, def i ned as the number of gates in the minimal quantum 
circuit that generates this unitary. We will particularly be interested in how the complexity 
evolves with time. 
Growth and Saturation 
The number of gates that the circuit applied in order to prepare U(Ï) is 
Ngates(Ï) = 
KÏ 
2 
.(2.2) 
The number of time-steps, Ï, is called the depth of the circuit and K is called the width. 
The factor of 1/2 in Eq. 2.2 is due to the pairing of qubits, which implies that in each 
time-step K/2 gates act. 3 
However, the def i nition of the complexity C[U(Ï)] is not the actual number of gates used 
in the def i ning circuit to generate U(Ï). Instead the complexity is the minimum number 
of gates that it takes to prepare U(Ï), using the most ef i cient possible circuit. This may 
be less than or equal to the actual number of gates used in the def i ning circuit. However 
it is believed that at least for some length of time the def i ning circuit is the most ef i cient, 
and for this period the complexity grows as 
KÏ 
2 . 
The growth of complexity cannot continue indef i nitely. Though there is no limit to 
the size of any individual circuit, if the circuit is too big there will typically be another, 
shorter, circuit that implements an almost identical unitary. We can estimate how large a 
circuit can be before it is likely to have been âshort-circuitedâ by calculating the volume of 
SU(2K). There are a continuous inf i nity of elements of SU(2K), so any i nite arrangement 
of discrete gates can only hit measure zero; for this reason, we introduce a toleranceâwe 
settle for getting suf i ciently close (in the inner product sense) to the target unitary. An 
?-net is a kind of lattice on SU(2K) that divides it into small patches of linear size ?. The 
number of such patches that it takes to cover SU(2K) is double exponential in K, of order1 
e4 K. Since the number of possible circuits grows exponentially with the depth, this implies 
that the maximum complexity is exponential in K, 
Cmaxâ¼ 4K.(2.3) 
Complexity â¼ 4Kis 
not only the largest possible complexity, it is also the complexity 
of the overwhelming majority of unitary operators. Thus, while this has not been proved, 
it is believed that the linear growth in complexity, KÏ/2, continues for an exponential 
time, only appreciably slowing when the complexity gets close to its maximum value. 
Once the complexity reaches its maximum value it will l uctuate in the vicinity of Cmax 
for a time of order e4 
K and then execute quantum recurrences, quasiperiodically returning 
to small values. The time-scale Ï â¼ e4 
K is called the quantum recurrence time. 
Figure 2 shows the complexity history, as conjectured in [11], of the evolution operator 
U(Ï) = eiHÏfor a fast scrambler. 
1As a function of ?, the number of patches is approximately e4Klog ?; in what follows we will ignore the 
weak dependence on ? and focus on the double exponential dependence on K.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe excerpt you provided continues from the previous discussion and delves into the growth and saturation of complexity in quantum circuits.The focus of interest in this context is not the state of the qubit system but rather the unitary operator U(Ï) generated by the quantum circuit after Ï time-steps. The complexity of this unitary operator is defined as the minimum number of gates required to prepare U(Ï) using the most efficient possible circuit. This complexity is denoted as C[U(Ï)].The number of gates applied by the circuit to prepare U(Ï) can be calculated as Ngates(Ï) = KÏ/2, where K is the width of the circuit and Ï is the depth or the number of time-steps. However, the actual complexity, C[U(Ï)], is the minimum number of gates required, and it may be less than or equal to Ngates(Ï).The growth of complexity with time is given by KÏ/2. However, this growth cannot continue indefinitely. As the circuit becomes larger, there will typically be a shorter circuit that can implement an almost identical unitary. The authors estimate the maximum complexity, denoted as Cmax, by calculating the volume of SU(2K), the special unitary group of dimension 2K. They introduce the concept of an Îµ-net, which is a lattice dividing SU(2K) into small patches. The number of patches required to cover SU(2K) is double exponential in K, approximately e^(4K). Therefore, the maximum complexity is believed to be exponential in K, Cmax ~ 4K.While Cmax is the largest possible complexity, it is also the complexity of the majority of unitary operators. It is conjectured that the linear growth in complexity, KÏ/2, continues for an exponential time before slowing down when the complexity approaches its maximum value. Once the complexity reaches its maximum, it fluctuates around Cmax for a time of order e^(4K) and then undergoes quantum recurrences, periodically returning to small values. The time-scale Ï ~ e^(4K) is known as the quantum recurrence time.Figure 2, which is not provided in the excerpt, illustrates the conjectured complexity history of the evolution operator U(Ï) for a fast scrambler, as proposed in a previous work.Overall, this excerpt discusses the growth of complexity in quantum circuits, the maximum complexity reachable, and the recurrence behavior of complexity as the circuit evolves.1 / 1Figure 2: The evolution of the computational complexity of the operator eiHÏfor a generic 
k-local Hamiltonian H. At t = 0 the operator eiHtis the identity and so has complexity 
zero. At early and intermediate times the complexity increases linearly, with coef i cient 
K/2. After a time exponential in the number of qubits K, the complexity saturates at a 
value Cmaxthat 
is exponential in K. It then l uctuates near that maximum value. Very 
very rarelyâso rarely that we must wait the double exponentially long quantum recurrence 
time for it to be likely to have happened even onceâthe complexity of the system may 
l uctuate down to near zero, before growing again. 
To summarize: the complexity initially increases linearly, with a rate of increase equal 
to the internal energy [12, 13] which we assume is proportional to the number of qubits 
K. The numerical coef i cient is dependent on the exact def i nition of complexity but we 
will adopt a convention motivated by Eq. 2.2 
C(Ï) = 
K 
2 
Ï.(2.4) 
Once C(Ï) reaches its maximum value a long period of complexity-equilibrium will follow, 
during which the complexity remains near maximum. On very long time scales, the com- 
plexity will l uctuate substantially below its maximum and on double exponentially long 
time scales very large l uctuations will return C all the way back to near zero. Conditional 
5 
on having backtracked to a low complexity at some time, the system will typically have 
reached that value via a rate of decrease of âK/2. 
The growth of complexity has been conjectured to be holographically dual to the growth 
of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (ERB) connecting two entangled black holes [1, 2, 3]. Evi- 
dence for this conjecture is that we see all the same phenomenology for ERBs as we do 
for complexity. Like complexity, ERBs initially grow linearly with time. Indeed, ERBs 
continue to grow linearly for as long as classical gravity continues to hold.There are 
known non-perturbative ef f ects which destroy the validity of classical gravity on a time 
scale exponential in the entropy [14]; if the holographic duality holds up to this time, then 
linear growth of the ERB continues for an exponential time.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe text describes Figure 2, which illustrates the evolution of the computational complexity of the operator eiHÏ for a generic k-local Hamiltonian H. The figure shows how the complexity changes over time.At t = 0, the operator eiHÏ is the identity and therefore has a complexity of zero. As time progresses, the complexity initially increases linearly with a coefficient of K/2, where K is the number of qubits. This linear growth is related to the internal energy of the system. The numerical coefficient depends on the specific definition of complexity, and in this case, the convention adopted is motivated by Equation 2.2.After a time exponential in the number of qubits K, the complexity saturates at a maximum value denoted as Cmax, which is exponential in K. The complexity then fluctuates near this maximum value. However, very rarely, the complexity may fluctuate down to near zero before growing again. Such occurrences are so infrequent that one would need to wait for a time scale double exponentially long (quantum recurrence time) for it to be likely to happen even once.To summarize, the complexity initially increases linearly with a rate proportional to the number of qubits K. Once it reaches its maximum value, a long period of complexity equilibrium follows, during which the complexity remains close to the maximum. On very long time scales, substantial fluctuations below the maximum value occur, and on time scales double exponentially long, very large fluctuations bring the complexity back to near zero. If the system backtracks to a low complexity value, it typically does so at a rate of decrease of -K/2.The growth of complexity has been conjectured to have a holographic duality with the growth of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (ERB) connecting two entangled black holes. The phenomenology observed for ERBs is similar to that observed for complexity. ERBs also initially grow linearly with time, and this linear growth continues as long as classical gravity remains valid. However, the validity of classical gravity is disrupted by non-perturbative effects after an exponential time scale related to the entropy. If the holographic duality holds up to this time scale, then linear growth of the ERB continues for an exponential time.This information highlights the connection between the growth of complexity in quantum systems and the growth of ERBs, suggesting a holographic correspondence between the two.1 / 1Figure 2 shows the evolution of computational complexity for a generic k-local Hamiltonian H, as described in the paper "The Complexity of Quantum States and Transformations: From Quantum Money to Black Holes" by Susskind and collaborators. The operator eiHÏ is a unitary transformation that evolves the quantum state of the system forward in time by a small amount of time Ï.

At t = 0, the operator eiHÏ is the identity and has zero complexity. As time evolves, the complexity increases linearly with a coefficient K/2, where K is the number of qubits in the system. This rate of increase is proportional to the internal energy of the system, assuming a convention motivated by Eq. 2.2 in the paper.

After a time exponential in K, the complexity saturates at a maximum value Cmax that is also exponential in K. The system then enters a period of complexity-equilibrium, during which the complexity remains near its maximum value. On very long time scales, the complexity may fluctuate substantially below its maximum value and, in rare cases, may even fluctuate down to near zero before growing again. The rate of decrease in complexity is typically -K/2, conditional on having backtracked to a low complexity state at some time.

The growth of complexity has been conjectured to be holographically dual to the growth of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (ERB) connecting two entangled black holes. Supporting evidence for this conjecture includes the observation that ERBs exhibit the same phenomenology as complexity, including initial linear growth and saturation at a maximum value that persists for a long time. However, the validity of classical gravity breaks down on a time scale exponential in the entropy, which may affect the validity of the holographic duality beyond that point.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTApologies for the confusion. Thank you for providing the correct reference and context for Figure 2. The information you provided accurately summarizes the evolution of computational complexity for a generic k-local Hamiltonian H as described in the paper "The Complexity of Quantum States and Transformations: From Quantum Money to Black Holes" by Susskind and collaborators. It clarifies the relationship between complexity growth and the holographic duality with the Einstein-Rosen bridge (ERB) connecting entangled black holes.1 / 12.1Decreasing Complexity is Unstable 
We may artif i cially create a period of decreasing complexity by time-reversing the quantum 
circuit, i.e., Hermitian conjugating the gates and applying them in reverse order. This will 
replace the normal increase of complexity with a reversed history of decreasing complexity. 
However, decreasing complexity is unstable: a small perturbation of a single gate (or 
a thermal photon) will soon cause the complexity to stop decreasing. After a scrambling 
time, Ïâ= logK,(2.5) 
the complexity will start increasing, again with rate K/2. 
The random circuit model is useful for seeing why there is a delay time Ïâbefore the 
complexity begins to increase. The scrambling time is def i ned as the time that it takes 
for a simple perturbation such as an extra gate to spread through the system af f ecting 
every qubit. Let us suppose the complexity is large but decreasing, and that at some 
point we apply an extra single-qubit gate. Initially only one qubit is af f ectedâlet us call 
it âinfectedââby the action of the extra gate. The rest of the system, being uninfected, 
will continue along its trajectory of decreasing complexity. After an additional time-step 
two qubits will be infected, then four, eight, etc. But for large K this is still a negligible 
fraction of the system. After Ï time-steps the epidemic will have spread to 
s(Ï) = eÏ(2.6) 
6 
qubits.2The notation s(Ï) stands for the size of the epidemic after Ï time-steps [3]. 
This exponential behavior is a sign of chaos and has been studied by Maldacena, 
Shenker, and Stanford [15]. They refer to the exponent in the exponential growth formula 
as the quantum Lyapunov exponent [16]. 
The scrambling time Ïâ= logK is the number of steps needed to infect most of the 
qubits. Once the scrambling time has passed, the delicate coordination required for the 
complexity to be decreasing has been completely disrupted by the ef f ects of the perturba- 
tion and the normal condition of increasing complexity will have been restored. 
By contrast with the decreasing case, increasing complexity is an entirely stable condi- 
tion. If the complexity was set to increase, then a perturbation generically wonât change 
thatâafter a perturbation, the complexity will continue to increase. 
The Second Law of Complexity 
The similarity with the evolution of entropy in classical chaotic systems is obvious and 
suggests a second law of complexity with all the same qualif i cations as for the second law 
of thermodynamics. The simplest version would be: 
Complexity always increases. 
However, just as it would be for entropy, this is too simple. We can instead try: 
Complexity almost always increases. 
But this is also not true: just like entropy, complexity almost always l uctuates about its 
maximum. 
The correct formulation is: 
Conditioning on the complexity being less than maximum, it will most likely increase, both 
into the future and into the past.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn the paper, it is mentioned that decreasing complexity in a quantum system is unstable. While it is possible to artificially create a period of decreasing complexity by time-reversing the quantum circuit, this state is not sustained. Even a small perturbation, such as a single gate or a thermal photon, will disrupt the decreasing complexity. After a scrambling time, denoted as Ïâ and given by Ïâ = logK, the complexity starts increasing again at a rate of K/2.The random circuit model is used to explain why there is a delay time (Ïâ) before the complexity begins to increase. Initially, when a simple perturbation occurs, only one qubit is affected. Over subsequent time-steps, the perturbation spreads, infecting more qubits. After Ï time-steps, the epidemic (perturbation) will have spread to a number of qubits given by s(Ï) = eÏ. This exponential growth is a sign of chaos and has been studied in the context of quantum Lyapunov exponents.Once the scrambling time (Ïâ) has passed, the delicate coordination required for the complexity to decrease has been disrupted, and the normal condition of increasing complexity is restored.Contrasting with the decreasing case, increasing complexity is considered a stable condition. If the complexity is set to increase, perturbations generally won't change that behavior. The complexity will continue to increase after a perturbation.Drawing an analogy with the second law of thermodynamics, the paper suggests a second law of complexity: "Complexity almost always increases." However, similar to entropy, complexity also fluctuates about its maximum value. The correct formulation is that, conditioning on the complexity being less than maximum, it is most likely to increase both into the future and into the past.1 / 1The big dif f erence is that the second law of complexity operates on vastly longer time scales 
than its entropic counterpart. The time required for the classical entropy to l uctuate 
down to near zeroâthe classical recurrence timeâis exponential in the entropy eK. By 
contrast, the time required for the quantum complexity to l uctuate to near zeroâthe 
quantum recurrence timeâis double exponential in the entropy e4 K. At the end of Sec. 5 
we comment on the origin of this similarity between quantum complexity and classical 
entropy. 
2.1.1Black Holes and Shock Waves 
In [17, 18] it was pointed out that the dynamics of a black hole is governed by a k-local 
chaotic Hamiltonian, so we can also study the behavior of complexity in the context of 
black holes. It was conjectured [2, 3] that the evolution of complexity is ref l ected in the 
growth of black hole interior geometries. By studying the time evolution of Einstein-Rosen 
bridges, similar behaviors are found as those we expect from quantum circuit complexity. 
For example, the eternal black hole in AdS has a Penrose diagram which is time-reversal 
symmetric. During the i rst half of the evolution the ERB shrinks. This is the white hole 
era. References [19, 2, 11] have studied what happens if during this era a thermal-scale 
perturbation is applied to the white hole. It is found that the volume (or action) of the 
ERB continues to decrease for a scrambling time, but then reverses, ef f ectively turning the 
white hole into a black hole. This exactly parallels the behavior of complexity for chaotic 
quantum systems. On the other hand a similar perturbation applied during the black hole 
era has very little ef f ect. In other words, increasing ERB size is a stable condition. 
The most striking evidence for the holographic duality between the complexity of the 
boundary theory and the size (volume or action) of the corresponding ERB in the bulk is 
provided by the switchback ef f ect [2, 20]. To see this ef f ect, we must study the evolution 
of precursors. 
2.2Precursors: Single Perturbations 
As we just saw, in chaotic systems tiny changes have huge consequencesâthe passage 
of time amplif i es perturbations until they transform the fate of the whole system. We 
can capture this phenomenon by studying âprecursorsâ. A precursor W(Ï) measures the 
dif f erence between the operator as it is now and what the operator would have been by 
now had we slightly perturbed it at some point in the past. Clearly one way to construct 
such an operator is to evolve âbackwards in timeâ (i.e. undo the time-evolution that has 
8 
happened, by acting on it with the inverse of the time-evolution operator), then hit it with 
the small perturbation, and then run it back to the present by acting with the normal 
forward-directed time-evolution operator: 
W(Ï) = U(Ï)WUâ (Ï).(2.7) 
Here U is the time evolution operator U(Ï) = exp(âiHÏ) and W is a simple operator 
of unit complexity. (For example, for a quantum circuit W could be a single-qubit Pauli 
operator.) 
Let us now consider the complexity of W(Ï). For Ï = 0 the complexity is tiny 
C[W(Ï = 0)] = C[W] = 1.(2.8) 
However, the complexity of W(Ï) grows with |Ï|, as the ef f ect of the initially-small per- 
turbation cascades through the system. An upper bound on the growth rate is given by 
the triangle inequality 
C[W(Ï)]â¤C[U(Ï)] + C[W] + C[Uâ (Ï)] 
= 
1 2K|Ï| + 1 + 
1 2K|Ï| â¼K|Ï|,(2.9) 
since the minimal circuit that implements W(Ï) can certainly be no bigger than the circuit 
formed by concatenating the individual circuits for U, W and Uâ .1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe second law of complexity operates on much longer time scales compared to the second law of thermodynamics. The time required for classical entropy to fluctuate near zero, known as the classical recurrence time, is exponential in the entropy e^K. On the other hand, the time required for quantum complexity to fluctuate near zero, referred to as the quantum recurrence time, is double exponential in the entropy e^4K. The paper acknowledges this similarity between quantum complexity and classical entropy and comments on its origin at the end of Section 5.In the context of black holes, it was observed that the dynamics of a black hole can be described by a k-local chaotic Hamiltonian, which allows for studying complexity in this context. The growth of complexity was conjectured to be reflected in the growth of the black hole interior geometries. By studying the time evolution of Einstein-Rosen bridges (ERBs), similar behaviors were found as expected from quantum circuit complexity. For example, during the white hole era of an eternal black hole in Anti-de Sitter space, the ERB initially shrinks. When a thermal-scale perturbation is applied during this era, it is found that the volume or action of the ERB continues to decrease for a scrambling time, after which it reverses and effectively transforms the white hole into a black hole. This behavior parallels the behavior of complexity in chaotic quantum systems. Conversely, applying a similar perturbation during the black hole era has little effect, indicating that increasing ERB size is a stable condition.The holographic duality between the complexity of the boundary theory and the size (volume or action) of the corresponding ERB in the bulk is supported by evidence such as the switchback effect. Precursors, which measure the difference between an operator at the present and what it would have been if slightly perturbed in the past, are studied to understand this phenomenon. The complexity of precursors, denoted by W(Ï), grows with |Ï| as the initial small perturbation propagates through the system. An upper bound on the growth rate of the complexity of W(Ï) is given by the triangle inequality, indicating that the minimal circuit implementing W(Ï) cannot be larger than the concatenated circuits for U, W, and Uâ , where U is the time evolution operator and W is a simple operator of unit complexity.This information highlights the relationship between complexity, black hole dynamics, and the growth of precursors, providing insights into the behavior of complexity in quantum systems and its connection to gravitational systems such as black holes.1 / 1This naive concatenated circuit successfully makes W(Ï), but it is not the smallest 
circuit that makes W(Ï). This is most easily seen considering the case where W is the 
simplest of all operators, namely the identity operator. In that case U and Uâ cancel, so 
W(Ï) is also the identity operator and has complexity zero. 
The point is similar to the earlier discussion of the instability of decreasing complexity. 
The operator W af f ects only a single qubit; in other words it acts as the identity on all but 
one qubit. Therefore there is a large amount of cancellation between the gates of U and 
Uâ until the ef f ect of W has spread through the system. This partial cancellation leads 
to the minimal circuit being smaller than the naive concatenated circuit by an amount 
KÏâ, 
a phenomenon known as the âswitchback ef f ectâ. The switchback ef f ect is one of the 
signature phenomena of the evolution of quantum complexity, and reproducing it will be 
a strong test of our analog model in Sec. 3. 9 
To be more quantitative about how the complexity of W(Ï) changes with time, we can 
consider the random circuit model. Going back to Eq. 2.6 for the size of the epidemic, it is 
obvious that the size cannot grow for too long since the epidemic must saturate once every 
qubit is infected. Taking into account that only uninfected qubits can become infected, 
one i nds that for large K the size of the epidemic satisf i es the dif f erential equation [20] 
ds(Ï) 
dÏ 
= s K â s 
K â 1. 
(2.10) 
The solution is the âepidemicâ function 
s(Ï) = 
KeÏ 
K + eÏ 
= K 
e(ÏâÏâ) 
1 + e(ÏâÏâ) 
(with Ïâ= 
logK).(2.11) 
Several things are seen from these equations. The early exponential growth of Eq. 2.6 is 
recovered for time less than logK. At later time, every qubit is infected, and so the size 
of the epidemic saturates3at K. Equation 2.11 shows saturation takes a scrambling time. 
This formula was more rigorously justif i ed by a model using a random time-dependent 
Hamiltonian in [21]. 
Figure 3 plots of the size of the precursor as a function of time, s(Ï). At early times 
the precursor is growing exponentially, but is still too tiny to be visibly distinct from zero. 
After a scrambling time the size rapidly grows from near zero to near one, saturating in 
a few thermal times. (See Appendix A.) When there is a large hierarchy between the 
scrambling time and the thermal time, which is to say when logK ? 1, the transition is 
quite sharp and almost looks like a step function.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe previous discussion considered a naive concatenated circuit for constructing the operator W(Ï), but it is not the smallest circuit that produces W(Ï). This can be seen when W is the identity operator, in which case U and Uâ  cancel each other, resulting in W(Ï) also being the identity operator with zero complexity.The reason for this is that the operator W only affects a single qubit and acts as the identity on all other qubits. This leads to a significant cancellation between the gates of U and Uâ  until the effect of W has spread through the system. As a result, the minimal circuit for W(Ï) is smaller than the naive concatenated circuit by an amount KÏâ, which is known as the "switchback effect." The switchback effect is a characteristic phenomenon of the evolution of quantum complexity and reproducing it is a significant test for the analog model discussed in Section 3.To quantitatively understand how the complexity of W(Ï) changes with time, the random circuit model can be considered. Using Eq. 2.6, which describes the size of the epidemic, it is apparent that the size cannot grow indefinitely since it saturates when every qubit is infected. Accounting for the fact that only uninfected qubits can become infected, the size of the epidemic follows the differential equation given in Eq. 2.10. The solution is the "epidemic" function described by Eq. 2.11, which exhibits exponential growth at early times and saturates at K, the number of qubits, after the scrambling time Ïâ.Figure 3 illustrates the size of the precursor, s(Ï), as a function of time. At early times, the precursor experiences exponential growth, but it is still too small to be clearly distinguished from zero. After the scrambling time, the size rapidly increases from near zero to near one, saturating within a few thermal times. The transition is particularly sharp when there is a large hierarchy between the scrambling time and the thermal time, resulting in a step-like behavior.These findings provide insights into the behavior of complexity in quantum systems, including the switchback effect and the relationship between time, the size of the epidemic, and the saturation of complexity.1 / 1Could you explain how the holographic duality is related to the growth of complexity?
What are some examples of non-perturbative effects that can destroy the validity of classical gravity?
How does the rate of decrease in complexity affect the system's behavior?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe holographic duality, specifically the AdS/CFT correspondence, provides a framework for relating quantum field theories (QFTs) in a d-dimensional spacetime to classical gravitational theories in a (d+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. According to this duality, the dynamics of the QFT living on the boundary of the AdS spacetime is dual to the gravitational dynamics in the bulk. This duality allows physicists to study strongly coupled QFTs using gravitational tools and vice versa.The growth of complexity in the quantum field theory has been conjectured to be holographically dual to the growth of certain geometric quantities in the gravitational theory, such as the volume or action of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (ERB) connecting two entangled black holes. This conjecture suggests that as the complexity of the quantum state increases, the size or complexity of the corresponding gravitational region in the bulk also increases.Non-perturbative effects can arise in the gravitational theory and can lead to the breakdown of the validity of classical gravity. These effects typically become important when the gravitational system reaches high energies or strong coupling regimes. For example, in the context of black holes, non-perturbative effects such as Hawking radiation, black hole evaporation, or the formation of a singularity can significantly alter the classical description of the black hole and require the inclusion of quantum effects.The rate of decrease in complexity can have implications for the behavior of the system. In the context of quantum systems, if the complexity is decreasing, it is an unstable condition. Even a small perturbation or disturbance in the system can quickly disrupt the decreasing complexity and lead to an increase in complexity. This instability is due to the inherent sensitivity of complex systems to perturbations and is analogous to the sensitivity of chaotic classical systems to initial conditions. After a scrambling time, which is a characteristic time scale for the system to reach a chaotic or mixed state, the complexity starts increasing again, typically with a rate proportional to the number of qubits.On the other hand, if the complexity is increasing, it is generally a stable condition. Perturbations to the system may lead to minor changes in the complexity, but they usually do not reverse the overall increasing trend. The stability of increasing complexity implies that the system is evolving towards more intricate and complex states.1 / 1The holographic duality is a conjectured equivalence between certain quantum gravity theories and certain quantum field theories. In the context of the evolution of complexity, the conjecture is that the growth of complexity in a quantum field theory is dual to the growth of the Einstein-Rosen bridge (ERB) connecting two entangled black holes in the corresponding quantum gravity theory.

This conjecture is supported by several pieces of evidence, including the observation that both complexity and ERBs exhibit similar phenomenology, such as initial linear growth and eventual saturation at a maximum value.

Non-perturbative effects that can destroy the validity of classical gravity include:

1. Black hole evaporation: According to Hawking radiation, black holes can emit thermal radiation and eventually evaporate completely, which violates the laws of classical gravity.

2. Stringy effects: At high energies, string theory effects become important, and classical gravity is no longer a valid description.

3. Singularities: The presence of singularities in classical solutions to Einstein's equations suggests that classical gravity is incomplete and may break down at such points.

The rate of decrease in complexity affects the system's behavior in that, conditional on having backtracked to a low complexity state at some time, the system will typically have reached that value via a rate of decrease of -K/2. This means that the system will tend to return to low complexity states more slowly than it initially left them. This behavior is related to the instability of decreasing complexity mentioned earlier in the paper.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTI apologize for the confusion, but the information provided in the previous response regarding the rate of decrease in complexity and its effect on the system's behavior was incorrect. I regret any confusion caused by that incorrect information.Unfortunately, I don't have access to the specific details of the paper mentioned in your initial question ("The Complexity=Volume (CV) Conjecture"), and my training data only goes up until September 2021. Therefore, I cannot provide a more accurate response to your question at this time. I recommend referring to the original paper or conducting further research to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the complexity and its dynamics in the context of holography and the CV conjecture.1 / 1Open the Main NavigationSearch

Hawking radiation isnât just for black holes, study shows
In 1974, Hawking showed that black holes aren't stable, but emit radiation and decay. Nearly 50 years later, it isn't just for black holes.
black hole emission radiation
For the real black holes that exist or get created in our Universe, we can observe the radiation emitted by their surrounding matter, and the gravitational waves produced by the inspiral, merger, and ringdown. The electromagnetic radiation that we see solely originates from outside the event horizon itself; the Hawking radiation that black holes are predicted to emit is thus far unobservable in practice.Credit: Aurore Simonnet/Sonoma State/Caltech/MIT/LIGO
KEY TAKEAWAYS
In 1974, Stephen Hawking published a landmark paper showing that black holes aren't stable entities in spacetime, but slowly and gradually decay through the emission of radiation. The quantum process that powers this Hawking radiation arises based on the difference in the quantum vacuum near and far from the black hole's event horizon. For the first time, a new study suggests that this Hawking radiation doesn't depend on the event horizon at all, and should be present for all masses within spacetime, with astounding implications for physics.

One of the most remarkable achievements in theoretical physics came in 1974, when Stephen Hawking demonstrated that black holes are not static, stable entities within spacetime, but rather must emit radiation and eventually decay. This radiation, known forever after as Hawking radiation, arises due to the combination of the facts that:

quantum fields permeate all of space,
including inside and outside a black holeâs event horizon,
that these fields are not static but exhibit quantum fluctuations,
and that those fields behave differently in regions where the curvature of spacetime is different.

When Hawking first put these facts together, his calculation showed that black holes canât be stable with a constant mass, but will instead emit an omnidirectional amount of extremely low-temperature blackbody radiation. This radiation propagates away from the event horizon, and since real radiation carries energy, the only place where that energy can be taken from is from the mass of the black hole itself: via the classic equation E = mcÂ², where the mass lost by the black hole has to balance the energy of the emitted radiation.

But in a delightful new paper, physicists Michael Wondrak, Walter van Suijlekom, and Heino Falcke have challenged the idea that an event horizon is necessary for this radiation. According to their new approach, this radiation arises solely because of the differences in the quantum vacuum of space dependent on its curvature, and therefore Hawking radiation should be emitted by all masses in the Universe, even those without event horizons. Itâs a remarkable idea and one thatâs been brewing for a long time. Letâs unpack why.

qcd particle antiparticle visualization
A visualization of QCD illustrates how particle-antiparticle pairs pop out of the quantum vacuum for very small amounts of time as a consequence of Heisenberg uncertainty. The quantum vacuum is interesting because it demands that empty space itself isnât so empty, but is filled with all the particles, antiparticles, and fields in various states that are demanded by the quantum field theory that describes our Universe. The particle-antiparticle pairs illustrated here, however, are only a calculational tool; they are not to be confused with real particles.

Thereâs a very common misconception about how Hawking radiation works, put forth by none other than Hawking himself in his celebrated popular book, A Brief History of Time. The way Hawking told us to envision it:

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAccording to a new study by physicists Michael Wondrak, Walter van Suijlekom, and Heino Falcke, Hawking radiation, originally proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1974, may not be limited to black holes. The study suggests that the radiation arises due to differences in the quantum vacuum of space, which depend on curvature, rather than the presence of an event horizon.The traditional understanding of Hawking radiation is that it is emitted by black holes due to quantum fluctuations of fields near the event horizon. However, the new approach challenges this notion and proposes that Hawking radiation should be present for all masses in the universe, even those without event horizons.The idea behind this proposal is rooted in the concept of the quantum vacuum, which is not truly empty but filled with fluctuations and virtual particle-antiparticle pairs. These pairs can spontaneously pop in and out of existence due to the inherent uncertainty of quantum mechanics.According to the researchers, the differences in the quantum vacuum caused by the curvature of spacetime would result in the emission of Hawking radiation for all masses, not just black holes. This implies that the process of Hawking radiation is not exclusive to black holes but may be a more universal phenomenon.If confirmed, this finding would have significant implications for our understanding of quantum field theory and the nature of radiation in the universe. Further research and observational evidence will be necessary to fully validate this new perspective on Hawking radiation.1 / 1It follows that the complexity is the integral over time of the size. Or 
more simply, dC(Ï)

At early time the complexity increases exponentially with Lyapunov exponent 1. As 
explained in the appendix, this is the value for the quantum Lyapunov exponent expected 
from the arguments of [15]. After a scrambling time the complexity grows linearly. The 
delayed onset of linear growth causes the complexity to be KÏâless than it would have 
been with no delay. 
4This statement is true for 2-local circuits. For general k-local circuits we need to rescale time. See 
earlier footnote 2. 11 
2.2.1Single Precursors and Black Holes 
We have seen how precursor perturbations ef f ect the growth of quantum complexity. The 
growth of quantum complexity is believed to be holographically dual to the growth of 
wormholes behind a black hole horizon.For a two-sided AdS black hole, the dual of 
applying a precursor W(tw) to the boundary state is throwing in a thermal graviton at 
time âtw. 
At i rst the photon has little ef f ectâits energy is tiny. However, as it falls 
into the AdS gravitational potential, it blue-shifts exponentially. Soon, the little graviton 
has grown to a mighty shockwave, which greatly distorts the geometry of the black hole 
interior. A classical gravity calculation [19] calculates the size of the backreaction caused 
by early-time shockwaves as5

where c is an order 1 constant that is proportional to the exact energy of the disturbance 
in units of temperature. This has exactly the same functional form as Eq. 2.11.6This is 
an important consistency-check for the holographic complexity-geometry correspondence, 
and we see that the correspondence passes: the picture of epidemic spreading successfully 
captures the scrambling properties of a black hole horizon. 
2.3Precursors: Multiple Perturbations 
Rather than perturbing the system once, we may perturb the system multiple times. We 
can implement such a perturbation with [23] 
Wmulti(Ïn,Ïnâ1,...,Ï1)â¡Wn(Ïn)Wnâ1(Ïnâ1)...W2(Ï2)W1(Ï1)(2.15)

where the Ïiâs may not be chronologically ordered. Pictorially, we represent such a product 
by a time-fold: see Fig. 4, where each red dot represents a small perturbation Wi, and the 
arrows indicate the order in which the perturbations act. 
5To get Eq. 2.14 from [19] we identify complexity with the geodesic length of wormhole. It can be 
shown [22] that Eq. 2.14 will hold true regardless of which detailed prescription of bulk dual of complexity 
we use. In particular, this functional form will be true if we use ERB volume [1, 3] or action [12, 13]. 
6Note the prefactor2Ï 
Î² in front of the time tw. The twis measured in Schwarzschild time, and the 
2Ï 
Î² 
transforms it into Rindler time, which corresponds to the dimensionless Ï used in the circuit model. 
121 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe equation (2.12) expresses the relationship between the growth of complexity and the size of precursors. It states that the rate of change of complexity with respect to time is equal to the size of the precursor perturbation. Integrating this equation gives the expression for complexity as a function of time, given by equation (2.13).At early times, the complexity increases exponentially with a Lyapunov exponent of 1, as expected from arguments related to quantum chaos. After the scrambling time, the complexity grows linearly with time. However, due to the delayed onset of linear growth, the complexity is reduced by a factor of KÏâ compared to the case without a delay.The paper also discusses the relationship between single precursors and black holes. When a precursor perturbation is applied to the boundary of a two-sided AdS black hole, it corresponds to throwing in a thermal graviton at a negative time. Initially, the graviton has a small effect, but as it falls into the gravitational potential of the black hole, it undergoes exponential blue-shift and becomes a strong shockwave, distorting the geometry of the black hole interior. The size of this backreaction, described by equation (2.14), exhibits the same functional form as the epidemic spreading in the complexity model, providing consistency between the holographic complexity-geometry correspondence.Furthermore, the paper discusses the case of multiple perturbations, where the system is perturbed multiple times. This can be represented by a time-fold diagram, where each perturbation is represented by a red dot and the arrows indicate the order in which the perturbations act.1 / 1Figure 4: The multiple precursor operator Wmulti(Ïn,Ïnâ1,...,Ï1). 
When Ïiâ Ïiâ1and 
Ïi+1â Ïihave 
the same sign, as at Ï2and Ï6, Wiis called a âthrough-goingâ insertion and 
there is generically no cancellation. When ÏiâÏiâ1and Ïi+1âÏihave 
opposite signs, as at 
the other Ïi, this is called a âswitchbackâ and there is a partial cancellation that reduces 
the complexity by KÏâ. 
When the perturbations are well separated, so that the inf l uence of Wihas spread 
throughout the whole system before Wi+1acts, we expect one switchback-subtraction at 
each time reversal. This means the complexity of this operator will be 
C[Wmulti(Ïn,Ïnâ1,...,Ï1)] 
= 
K 
2 (Ïfâ 2nsbÏâ),(2.16) 
where nsbis the number of switchbacks and Ïfis the total âfolded timeâ 
Ïfâ¡ |Ï1â Ï2| + |Ï2â Ï3| + ... + |Ïnâ1â Ïn|.(2.17) 
The number of switchbacks nsbis generally not the same as the number of perturba- 
tions. To get a switchback subtraction, the Hamiltonian evolution before and after the 
perturbation must go in opposite directions; it is only then that there is any cancellation. 
When the perturbation is a through-going insertion, such as at Ï2and Ï6in Fig. 4, there is 
no cancellation. Through-going perturbations still completely change the microstate (after 
long enough time), but they have little ef f ect on the time evolution of complexity.

2.3.1Multiple Precursors and Black Holes 
Products of precursors give stringent tests of the holographic duality between quantum 
complexity and the classical geometry of ERBs. In the black hole context one studies this 
by studying black hole geometries perturbed by multiple shockwaves separated by large 
times [23]; sure enough the complexity results Eq. 2.16 and gravity results [2] agree. 
3Analog Model: Particle in Hyperbolic Space 
In the last section, we considered the evolution of the complexity of a quantum system. 
In this section we will consider an analog modelâa classical particle moving on a two- 
dimensional negatively curved space of large genus. We will i nd a surprisingly detailed 
parallel between the two. 
The Analog Model 
The analog model features a non-relativistic particle moving on a uniformly negatively 
curved geometry. An inf i nite hyperbolic plane H2with curvature length K/2 has metric 
dl2= 
K2 
4 
(dr2+ sinh2rdÎ¸2).(3.1) 
The Gaussian curvature is â4/K2. 
The origin, at r = 0, will correspond to the identity 
operator in the qubit system of the last section. The volume V within a distance L of the 
origin is (for L ? K) V â¼ K2e2L/K.(3.2)1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTFigure 4 illustrates the concept of the multiple precursor operator, denoted as Wmulti(Ïn, Ïn-1, ..., Ï1). Each red dot represents a small perturbation, and the arrows indicate the order in which the perturbations act. When the time differences Ïi - Ïi-1 and Ïi+1 - Ïi have the same sign (through-going insertions), there is no cancellation. However, when these time differences have opposite signs (switchbacks), there is partial cancellation, which reduces the complexity by KÏâ.In the case of well-separated perturbations, where the influence of each perturbation has spread throughout the system before the next one acts, there is one switchback subtraction at each time reversal. The complexity of the multiple precursor operator can be expressed as C[Wmulti(Ïn, Ïn-1, ..., Ï1)] = K/2 (Ïf - 2nsbÏâ), where nsb is the number of switchbacks and Ïf is the total "folded time" given by Ïf = |Ï1 - Ï2| + |Ï2 - Ï3| + ... + |Ïn-1 - Ïn|.Multiple precursor perturbations provide stringent tests of the holographic duality between quantum complexity and classical geometry. In the context of black holes, this involves studying black hole geometries perturbed by multiple shockwaves separated by large times, and comparing the complexity results with gravity results.The next section of the paper introduces an analog model, where a classical particle moves on a two-dimensional negatively curved space of large genus. This model exhibits striking parallels with the evolution of complexity in a quantum system, providing insights and connections between classical and quantum phenomena.1 / 1We will compactify the hyperbolic plane to a uniformly negatively curved space of genus 
g. We denote the compactif i ed space Hg. 
The Gauss-Bonnet theorem implies the genus 
and the volume are approximately the same.In the analog model, they will both be 
double-exponentially large V â¼ g â¼ e4 
K .(3.3) 
To implement the compactif i cation, we start with an equilateral hyperbolic polygon with 
4g sides centered at the origin. This is shown in Fig. 5. We then pair up the sides of the 
polygon, and identify the elements of each pair. The distance of the polygon from the 
14 
origin is constrained by the condition that the outer points i t together without a conical 
singularity; given Eqs. 3.2 and 3.3 this distance must be approximately 4K. 
Figure 5: An example of a compactif i cation of the hyperbolic plane. Start with a ginormous 
equilateral polygon centered at the origin, and then identify sides to make the compact 
and conical-def i cit-free space Hg. 
The analog model that we will present is the motion of non-relativistic particles on 
Hg. Unperturbed particles follow geodesics of Hgwith 
uniform velocity. (In the PoincarÂ´ e 
disk, these geodesics are circles centered on the boundary.) When impulsively perturbed, 
the particles are def l ected. As we will see, both perturbed and unperturbed motion in 
our analog model closely resembles the evolution of complexity of quantum system. The 
resemblance involves the identif i cations:1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe compactification of the hyperbolic plane is done by transforming it into a uniformly negatively curved space of genus g, denoted as Hg. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem relates the genus and volume of the compactified space, indicating that they are approximately the same. In the analog model, both the genus and volume are double-exponentially large, given by V ~ g ~ e^(4K).To achieve the compactification, an equilateral hyperbolic polygon with 4g sides is constructed centered at the origin. The sides of the polygon are paired up and identified, resulting in the compact and conical-deficit-free space Hg. The distance of the polygon from the origin is determined by the condition that the outer points fit together without a conical singularity, and it is approximately 4K based on Eqs. 3.2 and 3.3.The analog model presented in the paper involves the motion of non-relativistic particles on Hg. Unperturbed particles follow geodesics of Hg with uniform velocity. In the PoincarÃ© disk representation, these geodesics are circles centered on the boundary. When impulsively perturbed, the particles are deflected from their unperturbed paths. It will be shown that both the perturbed and unperturbed motion in the analog model closely resemble the evolution of complexity in a quantum system.1 / 1COMPLEXITYHYPERBOLIC SPACE

Here is a summary of the correspondences:Number of qubits K in the quantum system corresponds to the curvature length K/2 in Hg.The evolution generated by a 2-local Hamiltonian in the quantum system corresponds to geodesic motion on Hg.The time-independent Hamiltonian H in the quantum system corresponds to the identity operator at the center of the PoincarÃ© disk in Hg.The trajectory in SU(2K) swept out by the particle trajectory through Hg corresponds to the time evolution operator e^(-iHt) along a geodesic with velocity K/2.The complexity of the operator U(t) in the quantum system corresponds to the distance of the particle from the origin in Hg.The maximum complexity in the quantum system corresponds to the length, L, of the longest minimal geodesic from the origin in Hg (which is of the order 4K according to Eq. 2.3).The number of unitary operators in SU(2K) in the quantum system corresponds to the volume, V, of Hg (which is of the order e^(4K)).Perturbation with a small displacement perpendicular to the trajectory corresponds to a simple operator W in the quantum system, as shown in Figure 7 of the paper.Decreasing complexity in the quantum system corresponds to decreasing distance from the unstable origin in Hg.The quantum Lyapunov exponent of fast scrambler in the quantum system corresponds to the classical Lyapunov exponent of motion on H2, the 2D hyperbolic plane.These correspondences highlight the similarities between the evolution of complexity in a quantum system and the motion of particles on a hyperbolic space, providing insights into the behavior of quantum complexity based on the analog model.1 / 1Recurrences 
When an outgoing trajectory of increasing radius (increasing complexity) reaches a side of 
the polygon it jumps to the identif i ed side and reenters the geometry. Immediately after 
re-entry it is traveling towards smaller r, implying that the complexity is temporarily 
decreasing. Generically the decrease lasts for a short time and then turns around so that 
the trajectory soon hits another nearby side. This leads to a l uctuating complexity that 
tends to l uctuate near the maximum value for a very long time. Figure 6 shows a portion 
of the geodesic after it i rst passes through one of the polygon sides. 
Figure 6: Following a geodesic on Hg. 
When the geodesic crosses the red polygon that 
bounds Hgthrough 
side A, it re-enters the geometry at the identif i ed point on the polygon 
through side Â¯ 
A.(For convenience, the identif i ed sides are shown here as being close 
together, though typically they will be very distant.) In this picture, a geodesic is traced 
through several such exits, re-entries, and re-exits. 
After re-entering the shaded region the geodesic will soon exit again. Typically it will 
re-exit at a neighboring side. Once in a while the angle will be such that a side or two will 
be skipped over. It takes an extreme i ne tuning for the geodesic to return to anywhere 
near the origin, i.e., to low complexity. 
It is easy to calculate the i ne-tuning of the angle of re-entrance required for the com- 
plexity to reach a sub-exponential value. Relative to the radial direction the angle must 
be i ne-tuned to Î´Î¸ â¼ exp ?â4K? 
.(3.4) 
17 
Indeed, we can calculate the probability for this motion to reach a distance from the origin 
âC less than the maximum. Motion on Hgis 
known to be ergodic and i lls the space 
uniformly, so the probability of reaching a given small radius is inversely proportional to 
the volume contained within that radius. Using Eq. 3.2 this gives 
probability of reaching radius L â âC=eâ2âC/K.(3.5) 
The expected time for a recurrence is of order the quantum recurrence time of the circuit 
model, e4 K. Thus the model reproduces the expected complexity evolution, Fig. 2.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn the analog model, when a geodesic trajectory on Hg reaches a side of the polygon, it jumps to the identified side and reenters the geometry. Immediately after re-entry, the trajectory is traveling towards smaller values of r, implying that the complexity is temporarily decreasing. However, this decrease is typically short-lived, and the trajectory soon hits another nearby side, leading to fluctuating complexity that tends to fluctuate near the maximum value for a very long time.Figure 6 illustrates a portion of the geodesic trajectory after it first passes through one of the polygon sides. After re-entering the shaded region, the trajectory will soon exit again, typically at a neighboring side. Occasionally, the trajectory may skip over one or two sides depending on the angle, but it takes extreme fine-tuning for the geodesic to return to a low complexity state near the origin.The level of fine-tuning required for the complexity to reach a sub-exponential value can be calculated. The angle of re-entrance must be fine-tuned to approximately Î´Î¸ ~ exp(-4K). The probability of the motion reaching a radius less than the maximum complexity value is inversely proportional to the volume contained within that radius. Using Eq. 3.2, this probability is given by e^(-2ÎC/K), where ÎC represents the difference in complexity.The expected time for a recurrence, or the system returning to a similar complexity state, is of the order of the quantum recurrence time of the circuit model, which is approximately e^(4K). Thus, the analog model reproduces the expected evolution of complexity as shown in Figure 2 of the paper.1 / 13.1Decreasing Radius is Unstable 
In Sec. 2.1 we saw that i ne-tuned evolutions in which the complexity is decreasing are un- 
stable. Any small perturbationâeven that due to a single gateâwill generically cause the 
complexity to stop decreasing and start increasing again. We also saw that the complexity 
increase is a delayed reaction that sets in about a scrambling time after the perturbation. 
In this subsection we will see that the same is true in the analog model. We will see that 
geodesics of decreasing radius (decreasing distance from the origin) are unstable. Any 
small def l ection to the trajectory grows due to geodesic deviation, and after a distance 
1 2K logK the trajectory will typically be heading away from the origin again. 
In what follows it will be more convenient to represent H2by the PoincarÂ´ e half-plane 
rather than the disc. In these coordinates, the metric takes the form, 
dl2= 
K2 
4 ?dx2 
+ dy2 
y2 ? 
.(3.6) 
All geodesics are circles centered on the boundary at y = 0 (when the circles are inf i nitely 
big this gives straight lines in the y direction). It is convenient to map the origin of the 
PoincarÂ´ e disk, r = 0, to very large y.In the region shown in Figs. 7 and 9, large y 
corresponds to small complexity and small y corresponds to large complexity. 
The undisturbed evolution of a quantum system by a time-independent 2-local Hamil- 
tonian corresponds to geodesic motion on H2. We will also want to consider disturbancesâ 
for the circuit model this might be the action of an extra gate, for the black hole this might 
be the addition of a thermal-scale perturbation. In our analog model, disturbances will 
correspond to shunts that displace the particle. For example, the analog of a perturbation 
18 
by an orthogonal perturbing Hamiltonian7is two right-angled turns in quick successionâit 
i rst kicks the particle onto a perpendicular geodesic for a small distance of order unity 
(corresponding to a complexity of a single gate) before then kicking it again. This is shown 
in Fig. 7.

Figure 7: A small perturbation represented as a perpendicular kick to a geodesic. 
Letâs use this model of perturbations to recover the result of Sec. 2.1âthat increasing 
complexity is stable, but decreasing complexity is unstable. 
Figure 8 illustrates that increasing complexity is stable. A downwards pointing trajec- 
tory corresponds to increasing complexity. Consider a kick produced by an extra gate of 
unit complexity. The kick travels for a unit distance along a geodesic orthogonal to the 
initial direction, which in the PoincarÂ´ e plane is a small circular arc. (See Fig. 9). Because 
the kick is represented by a circular arc, after the perturbation the particle is no longer 
traveling exactly vertically. Thus perturbing this trajectory with a horizontal displace- 
ment gives rise, eventually, to a large horizontal metric displacement. However, the new 
trajectory has almost the same vertical progression as the old trajectoryâthe complexity 
was increasing before the kick, and it continues to increase with almost the same rate 
after the kick. (This is an example of the âthrough-goingâ insertion discussed earlier.) This 
behavior thus matches the expectations for circuits and black holes. 
7The inner product is def i ned by trace norm: hH1,H2i = tr(H1H2). 
On the subspace of simple 
operators (2-local) this is the same as in Nielsenâs geometry [5]. With this norm, we expect the inner 
product between a generic 2-local Hamiltonian and a simple operator to be of order 1 
K when both are 
normalized. 19

complexity 
Figure 8: Perturbing a trajectory of increasing complexity results in a new trajectory on 
which the complexity is still increasing. Since the conformal factor yâ2is blowing up at 
small y, the horizontal deviation is exponentially increasing. However, the rate of change 
of complexity is almost unaf f ected by the kick. 
Figure 9: On the left side, we show a trajectory of decreasing complexityây is increasing. 
On the right side, we show the ef f ect of a perturbation. The kick results in a small change 
of direction in the trajectory, which is then magnif i ed by the negative curvature. After a 
scrambling time, the complexity bottoms out and starts to increase (y decreases). 
Now consider a i ne-tuned situation in which the complexity starts large and decreases 
toward zero. In the analog model, this corresponds to motion in which a particle starts 
low and proceeds vertically upwards. Once again we may perturb this with a small kick, 
and once again after the perturbation the particle is no longer traveling exactly vertically. 
Due to the negative curvature the deviation from vertical grows exponentially. 1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn the analog model, geodesics of decreasing radius (corresponding to decreasing distance from the origin) are found to be unstable, similar to the behavior observed in the quantum circuit and black hole scenarios. Any small deflection or perturbation to the trajectory leads to the growth of geodesic deviation, causing the trajectory to deviate further from the origin.To illustrate this, let's consider a small perturbation represented as a perpendicular kick to a geodesic trajectory. The trajectory starts with high complexity and proceeds vertically upwards. After the perturbation, the particle is no longer traveling exactly vertically and experiences a small change in direction. However, due to the negative curvature of the space, this deviation from the vertical direction grows exponentially over time.Figure 9 illustrates this behavior. Initially, the complexity decreases as the trajectory moves upwards (y increases). After the perturbation, the deviation from the vertical direction grows and becomes magnified by the negative curvature. After a scrambling time, the complexity bottoms out and starts to increase again (y decreases).This demonstrates that in the analog model, as in the quantum circuit and black hole scenarios, trajectories with decreasing complexity are unstable. Any small perturbation to such trajectories leads to an increase in complexity, and the complexity increase is a delayed reaction that sets in about a scrambling time after the perturbation, similar to what was observed earlier in the paper.1 / 1Eventually 
20 
the trajectory reaches a maximum height (corresponding to a minimum complexity, at 
the black dot) and then falls back in the direction of decreasing y (and hence increasing 
complexity). 
At the turn-around pointâthe top of the trajectoryâthe complexity reaches a mini- 
mum. The length of the rising portion of the circular arc is easily calculated as 
âl = 
1 2K 
logK. (3.7) 
This corresponds to a time equal to the scrambling time Ïâ= logK. In other words, at 
the scrambling time the complexity stops decreasing, and begins to increase. This agrees 
perfectly with expectations from circuits and black holes. 
We i nd it interesting and suggestive that the so-called quantum Lyapunov exponent 
[15], which is by no means a Lyapunov exponent of the classical gauge theory, is a classical 
Lyapunov exponent of the analog model. 
3.2Precursors: Single Perturbations 
Next, we study precursors in the analog model. The precursor W(Ï) = eâiHÏWeiHÏis 
represented by three geodesic segments representing eiHÏ, W and eâiHÏ; the geodesics 
representing eÂ±iHÏare in black, and the small segment representing W is in red, as in 
Fig. 10. We have seen that the analog of complexity is geodesic length, so the analog of 
the complexity of W(Ï) is the length of the shortest path from the origin to the point 
representing W(Ï). 
An upper bound on the length of the shortest path connecting the endpoints is given 
by the triangle inequality 
C[W(Ï)]â¤C[U(Ï)] + C[W] + C[Uâ (Ï)] 
= 
1 2K|Ï| + 1 + 
1 2K|Ï| â¼ K|Ï|, 
(3.8) 
since the minimal path can certainly be no longer than the path formed by concatenating 
the individual lines for U, W and Uâ . This is analogous to the naive upper bound on the 
complexity of the operator W(Ï) from concatenating sub-circuits, as given in Eq. 2.9. 
This naive concatenated line is not the shortest line that connects the endpoints. In- 
stead, the minimal geodesic takes a shortcut at the corner. We will see that the length 
shaved by this shortcut precisely reproduces the switchback subtraction from Sec. 2.2.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn the analog model, the trajectory eventually reaches a maximum height (corresponding to a minimum complexity) and then falls back in the direction of decreasing y (and increasing complexity). At the turn-around point, which is the top of the trajectory, the complexity reaches a minimum.The length of the rising portion of the circular arc, corresponding to the time when complexity is decreasing, can be calculated as âl = (1/2K)logK. This length corresponds to a time equal to the scrambling time Ïâ = logK. At the scrambling time, the complexity stops decreasing and begins to increase, consistent with expectations from quantum circuits and black holes.It is interesting to note that the so-called quantum Lyapunov exponent, which is not a Lyapunov exponent of the classical gauge theory, coincides with a classical Lyapunov exponent of the analog model.Moving on to precursors in the analog model, the precursor operator W(Ï) = e^(-iHÏ)We^(iHÏ) is represented by three geodesic segments: e^(iHÏ), W, and e^(-iHÏ). The analog of complexity in this model is geodesic length, so the analog of the complexity of W(Ï) is the length of the shortest path from the origin to the point representing W(Ï).An upper bound on the length of the shortest path connecting the endpoints is given by the triangle inequality, which implies that C[W(Ï)] â¤ C[U(Ï)] + C[W] + C[Uâ (Ï)], where U(Ï) represents the unitary operators e^(iHÏ) and e^(-iHÏ). This bound is similar to the naive upper bound on the complexity of W(Ï) obtained by concatenating sub-circuits.However, the minimal geodesic takes a shortcut at the corner, which is not accounted for in the naive concatenated line. This shortcut leads to a reduction in the length of the geodesic and precisely reproduces the switchback subtraction discussed earlier in the paper (Sec. 2.2).1 / 1í W(Ï)

a scrambling time Ï > Ïâit approaches saturation as K(1 â 2K2eâ2Ï+ 
...). 
We see that the evolution of the length of a precursor geodesic is almost-but-not-exactly 
identical to the evolution of the complexity of a precursor operator in Eq. 2.13. For Ï < Ïâ 
they both grow exponentially with exponent one. At Ï = Ïâboth 
jump rapidly from near 
22 
zero to near saturation. And for Ï > Ïâboth grow linearly with the same coef i cient, and 
with the same constant subtractionâwhat for the operator was a shortening of the naive 
circuit due to the partial cancellation of the gates is for the geodesic a shortening of the 
naive length due to taking a shortcut at the corner. 
However, the agreement isnât perfect. The exact functional form of the almost-step- 
functions are dif f erent. And for Ï > Ïâthe approach to saturation is also not exactly the 
sameâthough they both saturate exponentially, the analog model has a factor of two larger 
exponent and so saturates faster. However, as discussed in footnote 2, the approach to 
saturation is not a robust feature of the epidemic model, and can be changed by changing k. 
Let us now comment on the geometric interpretation of the size of the precursor. In 
[20] it was conjectured that it is related to the area A(Ï) enclosed by the four geodesics in 
Fig. 10. Here we make that statement more precise, 
s[W(Ï)] = dC[W(Ï)] 
dÏ 
= K sin 
2A(Ï) 
K2 
.(3.12) 
Though the length of geodesics keeps increasing, the area saturates at the scrambling time. 
This tells us that there exists a limiting curve that hugs the two Hamiltonian evolutions 
(U(Ï) and Uâ (Ï)) when Ï > Ïâ. 
As time increases the blue geodesic in Fig. 10 representing 
W(Ï) will hug the limiting curve.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn Figure 10, a precursor is represented by three segments of geodesics in H2. The geodesic distance between the point representing the identity and the point representing e^(-iHÏ)We^(iHÏ) is calculated in Appendix B to be cosh^2(1/K) + sinh^2(1/K)cosh(2Ï)/K.From this calculation, we can extract the behavior of the complexity of the precursor. For Ï < Ïâ, the complexity grows exponentially with an exponent of 1. At Ï = Ïâ, there is a rapid jump from near zero to near saturation. For Ï > Ïâ, the complexity grows linearly with a coefficient and a constant subtraction, similar to the evolution described in Eq. 2.13.The size of the precursor, defined as the rate of change of complexity, can be calculated as s[W(Ï)] = dC[W(Ï)]/dÏ = Ksinh(Ï)/â(K^2 + cosh^2(Ï)). When 1 < Ï < Ïâ, the size of the precursor increases exponentially with an exponent of one. After the scrambling time Ï > Ïâ, it approaches saturation and exhibits a linear growth with a subtraction that corresponds to the partial cancellation of gates in the circuit model.The agreement between the evolution of the precursor geodesic length and the complexity of the precursor operator is not perfect. There are slight differences in the functional form of the step-like behavior and the approach to saturation. However, the overall behavior is similar, and the analog model provides insights into the geometric interpretation of the size of the precursor.It is conjectured that the size of the precursor is related to the area enclosed by the four geodesics in Figure 10. The derivative of complexity with respect to time is proportional to the sine of twice the area. As time increases, the geodesic representing the precursor will approach a limiting curve that hugs the two Hamiltonian evolutions U(Ï) and Uâ (Ï) for Ï > Ïâ.1 / 13.3Precursors: Multiple Perturbations 
In Sec. 2.3 we looked at the products of multiple precursors, and showed that so long 
as the individual precursors were separated by more than a scrambling time, the total 
switchback subtraction is the sum of the individual subtractions at each switchback. In 
this subsection will see that the same is true for precursors in our analog model.

Figure 11: Schematic representation of the product of two precursors on the negatively 
curved geometry. For large |Ï1|, |Ï2|, and |Ï1â Ï2|, the length of the shortest geodesic 
connecting the start to the end is shorter than the sum of the i ve def i ning geodesic 
segments by an amount equal to two individual switchback subtractions. 
The product of two precursors in the analog model is shown in Fig. 11. The product is 
composed of 5 geodesic segments: eiHÏ1, W1, eâiH(Ï1âÏ2), W2, and eâiHÏ2. By presumption 
the Wioperators are orthogonal to the Hamiltonian, which in our analog model means 
that we choose the turns induced by W to be through right-angles. The complexity of the 
precursor C[W2(Ï2)W1(Ï1)] 
corresponds to the length of the shortest geodesic connecting 
the start to the end-point (shown in solid blue in Fig. 11). 
The length of this shortest geodesic is calculated in Eq. B.17. For C[Wi] = 1 ? K,

(3.13) 
This exhibits all the same phenomenology as the complexity of the multiple precursor 
operator in Sec. 2.3. In particular, for |Ï1â Ï2| ? 2Ïâthe 
total shortcut from cutting the 
two corners is just the sum of the individual shortcuts at each corner. For example, for 
large Ï2but small Ï1, the rate of change of complexity with Ï1grows like eÏ1. By contrast, 
when both Ï1and Ï2are large,

+...,(3.14) 

so that the geodesic shaves a distance KÏâat each switchback. 
There is a geometric intuition for why distant switchback shortcuts simply add. Due 
to the divergence of geodesics in negatively curved spaces, the minimal geodesic must hew 
exponentially close to the eiHÏ1geodesic until it gets within about a scrambling distance 
from the i rst corner. Having turned the i rst corner, within a scrambling distance it will 
once again hew to eiH(Ï2âÏ1)until it gets within about a scrambling length of the second 
corner. The shortcuts at the two corners can only af f ect each other insofar as the middle 
segment of the geodesic is dif f erent from the eiH(Ï2âÏ1)geodesic, but for |Ï1âÏ2| > 2Ïâthat 
dif f erence is exponentially small. 
As is discussed in Appendix B.1.4, this argument would apply equally had we made 
not two rights turns then two left turns, as in Fig. 11, but rather four right turns. The 
argument would also apply with any number of switchbacks, and Eq. 2.16 holds for a 
product of any number of precursors.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn the analog model, the product of two precursors is composed of five geodesic segments: eiHÏ1, W1, e^(-iH(Ï1-Ï2)), W2, and e^(-iHÏ2). The complexity of the precursor C[W2(Ï2)W1(Ï1)] corresponds to the length of the shortest geodesic connecting the start to the end-point.The length of this shortest geodesic is calculated in Eq. B.17 and exhibits the same phenomenology as the complexity of the multiple precursor operator discussed in Section 2.3. When the precursors are well separated in time (|Ï1 - Ï2| >> Ïâ), the total shortcut from cutting the two corners is equal to the sum of the individual shortcuts at each corner. This means that the geodesic shaves a distance of KÏâ at each switchback.The distant switchback shortcuts simply add because the minimal geodesic must closely follow the eiHÏ1 geodesic until it gets close to the first corner, and then it follows the eiH(Ï2-Ï1) geodesic until it gets close to the second corner. The shortcuts at the two corners can only affect each other if the middle segment of the geodesic is different from the eiH(Ï2-Ï1) geodesic, but for |Ï1-Ï2| > 2Ïâ, this difference is exponentially small due to the divergence of geodesics in negatively curved spaces.The same argument holds for products of any number of precursors, not just two. Eq. 2.16, which describes the complexity of a product of precursors in the circuit model, holds true for a product of any number of precursors in the analog model as well.1 / 13.4Length and Action 
In our correspondence, the distance travelled by a particle moving along a geodesic cor- 
responds to the complexity of the corresponding unitary operator. In this subsection, we 
examine the relation between the length of the particleâs path and its on-shell action. We 
will show that they are linearly related. This suggests that we had a choice when interpret- 
ing our analog modelâto correspond to complexity, we could have chosen not geodesics 
length but on-shell action. 
Let the line-element of the Riemannian space be 
dl2= gijdxidxj.(3.15)

earlier we will denote by Ï. The action for the particle is

so that the velocity of the particle is set to K/2, which we have previously identif i ed with 
the rate of change of complexity. 
One point to note is that the expression for length in Eq. 3.17 is invariant under 
reparametrization of the time variable Ï, while the expression for action in Eq. 3.16 is 
not.Equation 3.16 has chosen a particular parametrization of the path, which is the 
conventions for time in Appendix A. 
In this paper we identif i ed complexity with the minimum length of a trajectory; in this 
subsection we have shown that we could equally well have identif i ed complexity with the 
minimum action8of any trajectory with velocity K/2 connecting the origin to the location 
of the particle. This is not the i rst time that complexity and action have been identif i ed 
but the relation9to the results of [12, 13] is not clear. 
8There is an argument that action is a better candidate to be the analog of complexity than length. 
This comes from considerations of the additivity properties of complexity under combining subsystems. 
Riemannian length adds in quadrature, whereas action, like complexity, is strictly additive. We thank 
Brian Swingle for explaining this point. These issues will be addressed in a forthcoming publication. 
9Note that the action we are discussing is the action of the particle in the analog model, and not the1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn our correspondence between the analog model and complexity, the distance traveled by a particle along a geodesic corresponds to the complexity of the corresponding unitary operator. In this subsection, we explore the relation between the length of the particle's path and its on-shell action, and we show that they are linearly related. This suggests that we had a choice in interpreting our analog model - we could have chosen on-shell action instead of geodesic length to correspond to complexity.The line element of the Riemannian space is given by dl^2 = g_ij dx^i dx^j, where g_ij is the metric with Euclidean signature and the coordinates do not include time (denoted by Ï). The action for the particle moving in this space is given by A = â«(m/2) g_ij áº^i áº^j dÏ, where m is the mass of the particle and áº^i represents the velocity components.The equation of motion following from the action is given by the geodesic equation, which states that particles that satisfy this equation move along geodesics with constant velocity. Along a geodesic, both the energy E and the velocity v of the particle are conserved, and they are related by E = (m/2) g_ij áº^i áº^j = (m/2) v^2.The path length, denoted by l, and the action A are linearly related by A = (mE/2) l. We can set the constant of proportionality to one by choosing E = (K^2/4m) and m = (4/K), where K corresponds to the rate of change of complexity.It's important to note that the expression for length is invariant under reparametrization of the time variable Ï, while the expression for action is not. The choice of time parametrization is specified in Appendix A.In this paper, we identified complexity with the minimum length of a trajectory in the analog model. However, this subsection shows that we could have equally identified complexity with the minimum action of any trajectory with velocity K/2 connecting the origin to the location of the particle. This highlights the possibility of identifying complexity with action, although the relation to the results of [12, 13] is not clear.1 / 14Discussion 
Previous papers have exhibited a close match between quantum circuit complexity and 
black hole geometry [1, 2, 3, 12, 13]. This paper exhibits a new correspondence between 
these two systems and a thirdâa non-relativistic particle moving on a negatively curved 
two-dimensional surface of large genus. 
This simple analog model recovers many properties of chaotic k-local Hamiltonian 
systems, as well as random circuits and black holes. The negative curvature of the analog 
model plays a key role, controlling the exponential geodesic deviation, and therefore the 
quantum Lyapunov exponent discussed in [15]. 
The quantum Lyapunov exponent can be shown to measure how rapidly the same ini- 
tial quantum state deviates when subjected to two slightly dif f erent Hamiltonians. The 
classical Lyapunov exponent measures how rapidly two slightly dif f erent classical states 
deviate when subjected to the same Hamiltonian. Our correspondence is able to relate 
these two exponents by relating dif f erent fast-scrambling quantum Hamiltonians to dif f er- 
ent geodesics of the hyperbolic plane. 
Moving a curvature distance on the hyperbolic plane corresponds to adding K/2 gates; 
a unit distance corresponds to a single gate. On the hyperbolic plane we are able to resolve 
arbitrarily small distances. By contrast, and though it is a subject of active investigation, 
we do not yet have a fully satisfactory continuum def i nition of complexity for Hamiltoni- 
ans such as those in Eq. 2.1. We speculate that perhaps the analog model could be used 
as a guide for constructing a continuum def i nition of complexity that is able to resolve 
complexities of a fraction of a gate. 
A simple discrete version of our correspondence is visible already just by graphing the 
number of possible circuits as a function of depth. Consider the 2-local random circuit 
model described in Fig. 1, and suppose there is exactly one kind of gate, which is a 
(non-symmetric) two-qubit gate. The circuit with depth zero is the identity. After a single 
time-step, the number of dif f erent possible unitary transformations generated is generically 
log h 
# unitaries i

(K/2)! ? â

;(4.1) 
there is generically a dif f erent unitary for every distinct way of arranging the gates in the 
27 
depth-one circuit. After each successive time-step the number of possible unitaries that 
may have been implemented by the circuit multiplies by almost as much again. It only 
fails to multiply insofar as there are collisions in which two dif f erent circuit designs give 
the same unitary, but as we argued in Sec. 2 these collisions are rare until the circuit is 
exponentially deep. Ignoring collisions, the graph forms a tree, and a tree is a discrete 
version of hyperbolic space. 
Figure 12: The number of possible circuits grows exponentially with circuit depth. At 
depth zero, the circuit the identity. After a single time-step (on left), there are O(KK/2) 
possible unitaries that could have been created. After two time-steps (on right) there are 
O(KK). Almost all the possible unitaries reached after two steps are distinct, though there 
are rare coincidences. This forms a tree. A Cayley tree is known to be a discrete model of 
a hyperbolic space.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis paper has presented a new correspondence between quantum circuit complexity, black hole geometry, and the motion of a non-relativistic particle on a negatively curved surface. The analog model of a particle moving on a negatively curved surface captures several key properties of chaotic k-local Hamiltonian systems, random circuits, and black holes.The negative curvature of the analog model is crucial in controlling the exponential geodesic deviation, which relates to the quantum Lyapunov exponent characterizing how quickly initial quantum states deviate under slightly different Hamiltonians. The classical Lyapunov exponent, on the other hand, measures the deviation of slightly different classical states under the same Hamiltonian. This correspondence allows us to connect these two exponents by relating different fast-scrambling quantum Hamiltonians to different geodesics on the hyperbolic plane.In the analog model, distances traveled by the particle correspond to the complexity of the corresponding unitary operator. The model's ability to resolve arbitrarily small distances on the hyperbolic plane suggests the potential for constructing a continuum definition of complexity that can handle complexities less than a whole gate. This could be a valuable guide for developing a continuum definition of complexity in Hamiltonians.Even in a simple discrete version, the correspondence is visible by considering the number of possible circuits as a function of depth. The growth of the number of possible unitaries follows an exponential pattern, forming a tree-like structure reminiscent of hyperbolic space.Overall, this correspondence offers new insights into the relationship between complexity, chaotic systems, and curved geometries. It provides a framework for understanding and exploring the connections between these different physical systems and their underlying mathematical structures.1 / 1Throughout this paper, we considered geodesics on the two-dimensional hyperbolic 
plane H2. However, as shown in Appendix B.1.5, essentially all our results about the match 
between complexity evolution and hyperbolic geodesics would continue to hold in HD. As 
discussed in Appendix B.1, because of geodesic deviation on super-curvature scales, the 
behavior of geodesics in hyperbolic spaces are insensitive to the dimensionality. However, 
the exponent with which volume increases with distance is sensitive to the dimensionality. 
The volume enclosed within a ball of radius r on a HDof curvature length K/2 is 
volume â¼ exp ?2r(D 
â 1) 
K ? 
.(4.2) 
This grows more slowly than the rate at which the number of quantum circuits increases 
28 
with depth in Eq. 4.1 unless the dimensionality of the hyperbolic space is D â¼ 
1 2K logK. 
To capture the growth of complexity and the behavior of precursors it suf i ces to con- 
sider a hyperbolic space to any dimensionalityâwe have considered the simplest case of 
D = 2. If we wish to also capture the rate at which the number of possible unitaries grows 
as a function of complexity, we must move to a higher-dimensional hyperbolic space.10 
We donât entirely understand why the parallel between our analog model and the 
evolution of quantum complexity works quite so well, but we suspect that the reason is an 
underlying relation with Nielsenâs complexity geometry [5]. Indeed, it was already pointed 
out in [5] that the average sectional curvature of the complexity geometry is negative. The 
connection of our work with Nielsenâs is explored in Sec. 5. 
4.1A Triangle of Systems 
The three systemsâblack hole interior, quantum circuit, and analog modelâform a tri- 
angle of ideas. The sides of the triangle are the relationships between pairs of these ideas. 
Here is how we understand those sides: 
â¢ Black holeâquantum circuit. This connection was proposed in [1]. It seems reason- 
able to expect that the dynamics of a black hole can be represented as a Hamiltonian 
system of K qubits with K being approximately the entropy. A black hole is there- 
fore a quantum circuit. However, the interesting connection is that the growth of 
complexity of the circuit is holographically dual to the growth of geometry behind 
the horizon. This strongly suggests that the emergence of space inside black holes 
is encoded in the growth of complexity. This side of the triangle is not new, but 
certainly not fully understood. 
â¢ Quantum circuitâanalog model. This is the connection that has been proposed in 
this paper. It seems likely that this side of the triangle involves Nielsenâs complexity 
geometry. Complexity geometry and the analog model share similar growth pat- 
terns: volume grows exponentially with distance. This, and the negative sectional 
curvatures of complexity geometry, are the key features that makes them similar.
Analog modelâblack hole. For sub-exponential times both the analog model and 
the Einstein-Rosen bridge are described by classical geometry, but of quite dif f erent 
types. One is a i xed hyperbolic Euclidean signature space; the other is a time- 
dependent Lorentzian wormhole geometry. It should be possible to bridge the gap 
between these two geometric systems in purely geometric terms without any quantum 
or information theoretic considerations, although at the moment we donât know how. 
5Relationship to Nielsen Complexity Geometry 
In this paper we have presented an analog model for the evolution of quantum complexity. 
This model was originally motivated by Nielsenâs complexity geometry model [5]. However 
the relationship between the models is not entirely clearâitâs certainly not the case that 
we mathematically derived our model from Nielsenâs. In this section we present some 
thoughts about the connection between the two. 
In Nielsenâs setup, we may regard the time evolution operator U(Ï) as the motion of 
a classical particle on the space of unitary operators SU(2K) equipped with an unusual 
metric. The complexity of U is related to the minimal geodesic distance between U and 
the identity operator. This is a relatively simple idea but Nielsenâs complexity geometry 
is very complicated and dif i cult to analyze. 
We can def i ne a âgrandâ analog model by considering a non-relativistic particle moving 
on the full complexity geometry, i.e., on SU(2K) equipped with the complexity metric [5] 
dl2= GMNdXMdXN,(5.3) 
where the coordinates XMlabel points of SU(2K). The usual metric on SU(2K) is invariant 
under both left and right multiplication by unitary operators; it has SU(2K)LÃSU(2K)R 
invariance. The complexity metric, GMNhas only right multiplication invarianceâthis 
means that it is homogeneous, but unlike the standard metric not isotropic. 
The conf i guration space (in the sense of classical mechanics) of the grand analog model 
is SU(2K), but the phase space contains momenta as well as coordinates. The momenta 
are given in terms of the complexity metric by 
PM= GMN Ë 
XN.(5.4) 
The equations of motion analogous to Eq. 3.18 are second order, and a trajectory is 
30 
determined not only by an initial point X but also the initial momenta. The momenta 
are in one-to-one correspondence with the generators of SU(2K), and the allowable ini- 
tial conditions require the momenta to correspond to k-local generators, i.e., generators 
constructed from no more than k Pauli operators. 
On the other hand the motion of U def i ned by the quantum Hamiltonian is determined 
by the i rst order SchrÂ¨ odinger equation Ë U = âiHU,(5.5) 
which means that for a given Hamiltonian only a single trajectory passes through any U. 
The resolution of this mismatch is that the grand analog model does not describe a 
single quantum Hamiltonian; it describes all k-local Hamiltonians. In other words it de- 
scribes all systems of the type in Eq. 2.1. In the quantum theory the future evolution of U 
is determined not only by the current value of U but also the set of coef i cients Ji1,i2,...,ik. 
One can show that these coef i cients correspond to the components of the analog momenta 
in the k-local directions.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper considers the relationship between quantum circuit complexity, black hole geometry, and the motion of a non-relativistic particle on a negatively curved surface. The results obtained for geodesics on the two-dimensional hyperbolic plane can be extended to higher-dimensional hyperbolic spaces. The growth patterns of complexity and precursors are captured in hyperbolic spaces of any dimensionality, but to capture the rate at which the number of possible unitaries grows as a function of complexity, higher-dimensional hyperbolic spaces are needed.The connections between these systems form a triangle of ideas. The relationship between black holes and quantum circuits suggests that the growth of complexity is related to the emergence of space inside black holes. The correspondence between quantum circuits and the analog model is related to Nielsen's complexity geometry, which shares similar growth patterns with the analog model. The connection between the analog model and black holes is currently not fully understood, but there may be a way to bridge the gap between their geometric descriptions.The paper also discusses the relationship between the analog model and Nielsen's complexity geometry. While the models are related, they were not mathematically derived from each other. The "grand" analog model considers a non-relativistic particle moving on the complexity geometry of SU(2K). The motion is determined by the complexity metric and corresponds to all k-local Hamiltonians. The mismatch between the analog model and the quantum theory arises from the fact that the analog model describes all k-local Hamiltonians, while the quantum theory is determined by a specific Hamiltonian and the coefficients associated with it.In summary, the paper presents a rich framework for understanding the connections between quantum circuit complexity, black hole geometry, and the motion on a negatively curved surface. It opens up avenues for further exploration and investigation into the deep interplay between these different physical systems and their underlying mathematical structures.1 / 1An interesting consequence of this observation is that averaging over the phase space 
of the grand analog model involves a quenched average over an ensemble of J-coef i cients, 
just as in the SYK model [7, 8, 9, 10]. The natural framework for such averaging is classi- 
cal statistical mechanics. For now we just remark that the ensemble-averaged complexity 
translates to the classical entropy of the grand analog model. This helps explain why the 
evolution of complexity closely resembles the classical evolution of entropy. The much 
longer time-scale is due to the exponentially large number of degrees of freedom of the 
analog model. We will come back to this theme in a subsequent paper. 
There are both similarities and dif f erences between the geometry of the simple two- 
dimensional analog model and the complexity geometry of Nielsen. The most obvious 
dif f erence is the dimensionality: complexity geometry has dimension (4Kâ 1); the analog 
model has dimension 2. This dif f erence seems very extreme, but there is a sense in which the 
hyperbolic plane mimics the properties of very high dimensional spaces. The dimension of a 
space ref l ects the growth of the volume as a function of linear dimension, i.e., the volume of 
a ball as a function of its radius. For sub-curvature distances the volume of the hyperbolic 
plane only grows quadratically with radius, but at super-curvature distances it grows faster 
than any powerâitâs like the dimensionality is inf i nite. Figure 13 is a photograph of an 
31 
actual physical model of the hyperbolic plane embedded in 3-dimensional space. One sees 
how space-f i lling it becomes. 
Figure 13: We thank the mathematician and artist Daina Taimina for allowing us to use her 
crocheted model as an illustration of how space-f i lling the hyperbolic plane becomes when 
embedded in l at space. The geometry of the surface is a slightly thickened hyperbolic 
plane.As it grows out from the center it will become densely packed at some radial 
distance from the starting point. The larger the dimension of the embedding space, the 
further the crocheting can proceed before becoming densely packed. 
Letâs consider the crocheted model embedded in Rn. Suppose the crocheting continues 
outward from the center for distance (in the surface) L. The linear size in Rnwill be less 
then L but the volume of wool will be eLâ, where â is the thickness of the crocheted 
surface. The crocheting obviously cannot continue past the point where Ln= eLânâ2 
without becoming densely packed. The larger n, the further the crocheting can proceed; 
roughly, the maximum L scales like n. Now suppose n is the dimension of SU(2K), namely 
n â¼ 4K. In that case the maximum linear dimension in the surface will be â¼ 4Kand 
the 
number of stitches will be of order e4 K, in agreement with our cut of f procedure. 
A second big dif f erence is that complexity geometry is homogeneous whereas Hgis 
not. One can pick any point in complexity geometry and transform it to the identity operator by a symmetry of the space; the minimal geodesic distance between points U 
and V is the relative complexity of the corresponding operators. In the analog model, 
while H2is homogeneous, the compactif i cation renders it inhomogeneousâthe topological 
identif i cations break the symmetry. This shows that we cannot identify in a continuous 
manner the hyperbolic plane with the full Nielsen complexity geometryâitâs not that 
points of Hgrepresent 
individual operators in SU(2K) in a smooth way. Instead, it seems 
that the region of the hyperbolic plane within r â¤ r0represents 
the entire collection of 
operators with complexity C â¤ Kr0/2. 
The relationship between complexity geometry and the analog model seems to be some- 
thing along the following lines: begin by breaking the symmetry of complexity geometry 
by picking an arbitrary reference point (the crocheterâs starting point) and a 2-dimensional 
section, and then identify the reference point with the origin of Hg. 
The area of the portion 
of Hgless 
than a distance L from the origin represents the collection of operators with 
relative complexity less than L. For each reference point and each section there is a new 
set of Hg-surfaces; 
since each point of complexity geometry has its own identical copy of 
Hg, complexity geometry is homogeneous but Hgis 
not. 
We hope to return to the relationship between Nielsenâs complexity geometry and the 
analog model in future work.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe observation that averaging over the phase space of the grand analog model involves a quenched average over an ensemble of J-coefficients is reminiscent of the SYK model and suggests a connection to classical statistical mechanics. The ensemble-averaged complexity corresponds to the classical entropy of the grand analog model, explaining the resemblance between the evolution of complexity and classical entropy. This connection between complexity and entropy will be further explored in a subsequent paper.While there are similarities between the geometry of the analog model and Nielsen's complexity geometry, there are also differences. The dimensionality is one major difference, with complexity geometry having a dimension of (4K-1) while the analog model has dimension 2. However, the hyperbolic plane in the analog model mimics the properties of very high-dimensional spaces, as its volume growth at super-curvature distances is faster than any power.Another significant difference is the homogeneity of complexity geometry compared to the inhomogeneity of the analog model. Complexity geometry is homogeneous, allowing any point to be transformed to the identity operator by a symmetry of the space. In contrast, the compactification in the analog model breaks the symmetry and renders it inhomogeneous. The identification of points in the hyperbolic plane with individual operators in a continuous manner is not possible, and the region within a certain distance from the origin represents the collection of operators with a specific complexity range.The relationship between complexity geometry and the analog model involves breaking the symmetry of complexity geometry, selecting a reference point and a two-dimensional section, and identifying the reference point with the origin of the hyperbolic plane. The area of the hyperbolic plane within a certain distance from the origin represents the operators with relative complexity below that distance. Further exploration of the relationship between Nielsen's complexity geometry and the analog model is planned for future work.Overall, the paper presents intriguing connections between different physical systems and their underlying mathematical structures, providing insights into the interplay between quantum circuit complexity, black hole geometry, and the dynamics of particles on negatively curved surfaces.1 / 1Simplify it a bit more1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper establishes connections between three systems: quantum circuit complexity, black hole geometry, and the dynamics of particles on negatively curved surfaces.

The ergodic interpretation of quantum mechanics is an approach that attempts to reconcile the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics with the deterministic framework of classical mechanics. It proposes that the behaviour of a quantum system over time can be understood by considering the statistical properties of an ensemble of similar systems rather than focusing on individual systems.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe ergodic interpretation suggests that, despite the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, the statistical behavior of an ensemble of quantum systems can be described in a deterministic manner. This interpretation stems from the concept of ergodicity, which is a property of dynamical systems that ensures their trajectories explore the entire phase space.In classical mechanics, ergodic systems are characterized by the property that a system's time average is equal to its ensemble average, indicating that the system explores all possible states over time. The ergodic interpretation of quantum mechanics extends this idea to quantum systems by considering ensembles of identical systems and their statistical behavior.According to the ergodic interpretation, the time evolution of a quantum system is described by a deterministic trajectory in the system's state space, known as the state vector. This trajectory explores different states in a way that is similar to how a classical system explores its phase space. However, due to the probabilistic nature of measurements in quantum mechanics, individual observations of quantum systems may still appear random.The ergodic interpretation of quantum mechanics provides a framework for understanding the statistical properties of quantum systems and their long-term behavior. It suggests that the apparent randomness observed in individual measurements is a result of our limited knowledge and access to the full ensemble of similar systems.It's important to note that the ergodic interpretation is just one of several interpretations of quantum mechanics, and it is not universally accepted. Quantum mechanics remains a subject of ongoing research and debate, and different interpretations offer alternative perspectives on the nature of quantum systems and their behavior.1 / 1look at a bunch of individualâs trajectories at a single point in time
If yes: ergodic.

If not: non-ergodic.

We tend to think (and are taught to think) as though most systems are ergodic. However, pretty much every human system is non-ergodic. By treating things that are non-ergodic as if they are ergodic creates a risk of ruin, as cousin Theodorus found out. If you want to not die or go bankrupt, ergodicity is an important idea to understand.

This is particularly true in the case of financial education. Most finance material assumes ergodicity (that time and ensemble probabilities are the same) even though it is never the case.

If I lose all your money, you are in no way comforted that other people who you donât know did fine. Even if their assessment of the probabilities were right, no person can get the returns of the market unless they have infinite pockets.

If the investor has to eventually reduce his or her exposure because of losses, or margin calls, or because of retirement, or because a loved one got sick and needed an expensive treatment, the investorâs returns will be divorced from those of the market.

This is why examples such as âIf you had bought Amazon stock in 1999 and held it for 20 years, you would have done great evenâ are dumb. From 1999, the price of the stock collapsed by over 90%. The type of person that bought a bunch of Amazon stock in 1999 probably also bought a bunch of other crap stocks and had a job in tech. In 2001, they had to sell everything to make rent.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe passage you provided emphasizes the importance of understanding ergodicity, particularly in the context of financial systems. It highlights the distinction between ergodic and non-ergodic systems and the potential risks associated with assuming ergodicity when it does not hold.In non-ergodic systems, the behavior of individual trajectories can significantly differ from the statistical behavior of the ensemble. This discrepancy has implications for financial education and investment decisions. The passage points out that financial materials often assume ergodicity, treating time and ensemble probabilities as equivalent. However, in real-life scenarios, individual investors may face circumstances such as losses, margin calls, retirement, or unexpected expenses that can impact their returns and diverge from the overall market performance.The example given about buying Amazon stock in 1999 and holding it for 20 years illustrates this point. While the long-term performance of Amazon stock might appear impressive, it overlooks the fact that many investors faced significant losses during the dot-com crash in 2000-2001. Individuals may have been forced to sell their investments due to financial constraints, undermining the assumption of holding a single stock for the entire period.The passage highlights the importance of recognizing the non-ergodic nature of financial systems and the need for a more nuanced understanding when making investment decisions. It cautions against simplistic narratives or examples that neglect the complexities and potential individual challenges that can arise in real-world financial scenarios.1 / 1This same logic is pervasive in how most people think about their businesses. Itâs entirely possible to correctly assess the probabilities that a new initiative is profitable and still go bankrupt. If you have a product which costs $1,000 to develop and a 1% chance of generating $1 million, it is positive expected value (1% * $1 million = $10,000). On average, this product generates a 10x return on investment. However, pursuing this strategy repeatedly guarantees that you will eventually file for bankruptcy.

Economics often evaluates people as playing ergodic games, while subjects are often making choices as if game is non-ergodic. As Gerd Gigerenzer has pointed out, âirrationalâ behaviors or âcognitive biasesâ are actually individuals realizing that a system is non-ergodic and not optimizing for expected value. 

In Search of Antifragility
The central concept of Nassim Talebâs Antifragile is the notion that there are two opposing ways in which something can respond to volatility: fragile things are harmed by volatility, while antifragile things benefit from it.

Fragility implies more to lose than to gain from volatility and more downside than upside. Antifragility implies more to gain than to lose, more upside than downside. You are antifragile to a source of volatility if potential gains exceed potential losses (and vice versa). 

Fragile and antifragile can effectively be used as synonyms for non-ergodic and ergodic. A fragile actor is non-ergodic, a truly antifragile actor is ergodic.

If you want to determine whether something is fragile or antifragile, you expose it to volatility and see how it responds. Say you measure that when traffic increases by a thousand cars in a city, travel time grows by ten minutes. But if traffic increases by another thousand more cars, travel time now extends by an extra thirty minutes. Such acceleration of traffic time shows that traffic is fragile, the more volatile things get, the worse it gets.

If you graph a fragile system, there is limited upside and unlimited downside. If the traffic is very light, you might get to your destination five minutes faster. If it is very bad, it may take an hour. There is a negative asymmetry.

If you graph an antifragile system, there is limited downside and unlimited upside. Going to cocktail parties is antifragile â you can only lose a bit of time (limited downside) but you could meet someone who will change your life (unlimited upside).

https://taylorpearson.me/ergodicity/1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe excerpt you provided further explores the concept of ergodicity in the context of decision-making, economics, and the concept of antifragility introduced by Nassim Taleb.It highlights how individuals and businesses often operate in non-ergodic environments, where the potential outcomes are not accurately captured by expected value calculations. The example of a product with a positive expected value, but with a high risk of bankruptcy when pursued repeatedly, illustrates the non-ergodic nature of certain business ventures. While the average return may be favorable, the potential downside risks and the possibility of bankruptcy make it an unsustainable strategy in the long run.The passage connects the notions of fragility and non-ergodicity, suggesting that fragile systems are more susceptible to volatility and downside risks, while antifragile systems benefit from volatility and have more upside potential. It posits that antifragility aligns with ergodicity, where the system's potential gains exceed potential losses, and vice versa for fragility.To determine whether something is fragile or antifragile, the passage suggests exposing it to volatility and observing its response. Fragile systems exhibit limited upside and unlimited downside, while antifragile systems demonstrate limited downside and unlimited upside.The concept of antifragility highlights the importance of embracing volatility and building resilience to benefit from it. It challenges the traditional focus on risk mitigation and encourages a mindset that embraces uncertainty and adapts to changing circumstances.The provided excerpt offers insights into the connection between ergodicity, fragility, antifragility, and decision-making, emphasizing the need to consider non-ergodic dynamics and the potential upside and downside asymmetries when evaluating strategies and systems.1 / 1

Ergodic theory is a branch of mathematics that studies statistical properties of deterministic dynamical systems; it is the study of ergodicity. In this context, "statistical properties" refers to properties which are expressed through the behavior of time averages of various functions along trajectories of dynamical systems. The notion of deterministic dynamical systems assumes that the equations determining the dynamics do not contain any random perturbations, noise, etc. Thus, the statistics with which we are concerned are properties of the dynamics.

Ergodic theory, like probability theory, is based on general notions of measure theory. Its initial development was motivated by problems of statistical physics.

A central concern of ergodic theory is the behavior of a dynamical system when it is allowed to run for a long time. The first result in this direction is the PoincarÃ© recurrence theorem, which claims that almost all points in any subset of the phase space eventually revisit the set. Systems for which the PoincarÃ© recurrence theorem holds are conservative systems; thus all ergodic systems are conservative.

More precise information is provided by various ergodic theorems which assert that, under certain conditions, the time average of a function along the trajectories exists almost everywhere and is related to the space average. Two of the most important theorems are those of Birkhoff (1931) and von Neumann which assert the existence of a time average along each trajectory. For the special class of ergodic systems, this time average is the same for almost all initial points: statistically speaking, the system that evolves for a long time "forgets" its initial state. Stronger properties, such as mixing and equidistribution, have also been extensively studied.

The problem of metric classification of systems is another important part of the abstract ergodic theory. An outstanding role in ergodic theory and its applications to stochastic processes is played by the various notions of entropy for dynamical systems.

The concepts of ergodicity and the ergodic hypothesis are central to applications of ergodic theory. The underlying idea is that for certain systems the time average of their properties is equal to the average over the entire space. Applications of ergodic theory to other parts of mathematics usually involve establishing ergodicity properties for systems of special kind. In geometry, methods of ergodic theory have been used to study the geodesic flow on Riemannian manifolds, starting with the results of Eberhard Hopf for Riemann surfaces of negative curvature. Markov chains form a common context for applications in probability theory. Ergodic theory has fruitful connections with harmonic analysis, Lie theory (representation theory, lattices in algebraic groups), and number theory (the theory of diophantine approximations, L-functions).1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTErgodic theory is a branch of mathematics that focuses on studying the statistical properties of deterministic dynamical systems.

First published Wed Apr 13, 2011; substantive revision Thu Jul 16, 2020
The Ergodic Hierarchy (EH) is a central part of ergodic theory. It is a hierarchy of properties that dynamical systems can possess. Its five levels are ergodicity, weak mixing, strong mixing, Kolmogorov, and Bernoulli. Although EH is a mathematical theory, its concepts have been widely used in the foundations of statistical physics, accounts of randomness, and discussions about the nature of chaos, as well as in other sciences such economics. We introduce EH and discuss its applications.

1. Dynamical Systems
The object of study in ergodic theory is a dynamical system. We first introduce some basic concepts with a simple example, from which we abstract the general definition of a dynamical system. For a brief history of the modern notion of a dynamical system and the associated concepts of EH see the Appendix, Section A.

A lead ball is hanging from the ceiling on a spring. We then pull it down a bit and let it go. The ball begins to oscillate. The mechanical state of the ball is completely determined by a specification of the position x and the momentum p of its center of mass; that is, if we know x and p, then we know all that there is to know about the mechanical state of the ball. If we now conjoin x and p in one vector space we obtain the so-called phase space X of the system (sometimes also referred to as âstate spaceâ).[1] This is illustrated in Figure 1 for a two-dimensional phase space of the state of a ball moving up and down (i.e., the phase space has one dimension for the ballâs position and one for its momentum).

Figure 1
Figure 1: The motion of a ball on a spring.

Each point of X represents a state of the ball (because it gives the ballâs position and momentum). Accordingly, the time evolution of the ballâs state is represented by a line in X, a so-called phase space trajectory (from now on âtrajectoryâ), showing where in phase space the system was at each instant of time. For instance, let us assume that at time t=0 the ball is located at point x1 and then moves to x2 where it arrives at time t=5. This motion is represented in X by the line segment connecting points Î³1 and Î³2. In other words, the motion of the ball is represented in X by the motion of a point representing the ballâs (instantaneous) state, and all the states that the ball is in over the course of a certain period of time jointly form a trajectory. The motion of this point has a name: it is the phase flow Ït. The phase1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe Ergodic Hierarchy is a central part of ergodic theory, which is a branch of mathematics that studies the statistical properties of dynamical systems. The hierarchy consists of five levels: ergodicity, weak mixing, strong mixing, Kolmogorov, and Bernoulli. These levels represent different degrees of complexity and randomness in the behavior of dynamical systems.At the core of ergodic theory is the study of dynamical systems, which are systems that evolve over time according to a set of deterministic rules. A simple example is a lead ball hanging from a spring and oscillating. The state of the ball, characterized by its position and momentum, can be represented as a point in a phase space. The trajectory of the ball in this phase space represents its motion over time.The first level of the Ergodic Hierarchy is ergodicity, which is the strongest property a dynamical system can possess. An ergodic system exhibits a uniform distribution of its trajectory in phase space, meaning that over time, the system visits all parts of the phase space equally. This property reflects a high level of randomness and is often associated with the concept of equilibrium.The subsequent levels in the hierarchy, weak mixing and strong mixing, introduce additional notions of randomness and complexity. Weak mixing implies that the system's trajectory becomes more uniformly distributed as time progresses, while strong mixing indicates a higher level of randomness and a more intricate mixing of different parts of the phase space.The Kolmogorov level introduces a measure-theoretic concept of mixing, where the behavior of the system is analyzed in terms of sets with positive measure. Finally, the Bernoulli level represents a specific type of mixing where the system exhibits a kind of statistical independence between different parts of its trajectory.The Ergodic Hierarchy has found applications in various fields, including statistical physics, the study of randomness, discussions on chaos, and economics. It provides a framework for understanding the behavior and properties of dynamical systems and their connection to concepts such as equilibrium, randomness, and complexity.1 / 12. Ergodicity
With these concepts in place, we can now define ergodicity.[7] A dynamical system

f
 almost everywhere, meaning for almost all initial conditions. The qualification âalmost everywhereâ is non-trivial and is the source of a famous problem in the foundations of statistical mechanics, the so-called âmeasure zero problemâ (to which we turn in Section 3). So it is worth unpacking carefully what this condition involves. Not all sets have a finite size. In fact, there are sets of measure zero. This may sound abstract but is very natural. Take a ruler and measure the length of certain objects. You will find, for instance, that your pencil is 17cm longâin the language of mathematics this means that the one dimensional Lebegue measure of the pencil is 17. Now measure a geometrical point and answer the question: how long is the point? The answer is that such a point has no extension and so its length is zero. In mathematical parlance: a set consisting of a geometrical point is a measure zero set. The same goes for a set of two geometrical points: also two geometrical points together have no extension and hence have measure zero. Another example is the following: you have device to measure the surface of objects in a plane. You find out that an A4 sheet has a surface of 623.7 square centimetres. Then you are asked what the surface of a line is. The answer is: zero. Lines donât have surfaces. So with respect to the two dimensional Lebesgue measure lines are measure zero sets.

In the context of ergodic theory, âalmost everywhereâ means, by definition, âeverywhere in 
X
 except, perhaps, in a set of measure zeroâ. That is, whenever a claim is qualified as âalmost everywhereâ it means that it could be false for some points in 
X
, but these taken together have measure zero. Now we are in a position to explain what the phrase means in the definition of ergodicity. As we have seen above, the time average (but not the space average!) depends on the initial condition. If we say that 
f
â
=
Â¯
f
 almost everywhere we mean that all those initial conditions for which it turns out to be the case that 
f
â
â 
Â¯
f
 taken together form a set of measure zeroâthey are like a line in the plane.

Armed with this understanding of the definition of ergodicity, we can now discuss some important properties of ergodic systems. Consider a subset 
A
 of 
X
. For instance, thinking again about the example of the oscillating ball, take the left half of the phase space. Then define the so-called characteristic function of 
A

 for all 
x
 in 
A
 and 
f

 for all 
x
 not in 
A
. Plugging this function into the definition of ergodicity yields: 
f
â
A
=
Î¼
(
A
)
. This means that the proportion of time that the systemâs state spends in set 
A
 is proportional to the measure of that set. To make this even more intuitive, assume that the measure is normalised: 
Î¼
(
X
)
=
1
 (this is a very common and unproblematic assumption). If we then choose 
A
 so that 
Î¼
(
A
)
=
1
 â 2, then we know that the system spends half of the time in 
A
; if 
Î¼
(
A
)
=
1
 â 4, it spends a quarter of the time in 
A
; etc. As we will see below, this property of ergodic systems plays a crucial role in certain approaches to statistical mechanics.

Since we are free to choose 
A
 as we wish, we immediately get another important result: a system can be ergodic only if its trajectory may access all parts of 
X
 of positive measure, i.e., if the trajectory passes arbitrarily close to any point in 
X
 infinitely many times as time tends towards infinity. And this implies that the phase space of ergodic systems is called metrically indecomposable (or also âirreducibleâ or âinseparableâ): every set invariant under 
T
 (i.e., every set that is mapped onto itself under 
T
)
 has either measure 0 or 1. As a consequence, 
X
 cannot be divided into two or more subspaces (of non-zero measure) that are invariant under 
T
. Conversely, a non-ergodic system is metrically decomposable. Hence, metric indecomposability and ergodicity are equivalent. A metrically decomposable system is schematically illustrated in Figure 3.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe concept of ergodicity in dynamical systems involves the statistical behavior of time averages of functions over trajectories. In the context of ergodic theory, a dynamical system is considered ergodic if, for almost all initial conditions, the time average of any complex-valued Lebesgue integrable function is equal to its space average. The qualification "almost everywhere" means that there may be exceptions, but these exceptions form a set of measure zero.To illustrate this concept, imagine a dynamical system represented by a phase space, such as the motion of an oscillating ball. Consider a subset A of the phase space and define the characteristic function fA, which equals 1 for points in A and 0 for points outside of A. In an ergodic system, the time that the system spends in set A is proportional to the measure of A. For example, if A has measure 1/2, the system spends half of its time in A.One important property of ergodic systems is that they can access all parts of the phase space of positive measure. This implies that the trajectory of an ergodic system passes arbitrarily close to any point in the phase space infinitely many times as time tends towards infinity. Ergodic systems are also metrically indecomposable, meaning that the phase space cannot be divided into two or more subspaces of non-zero measure that are invariant under the dynamical system. In contrast, non-ergodic systems are metrically decomposable.The concept of ergodicity has significant implications in statistical mechanics and other fields. It provides a foundation for understanding the statistical properties of dynamical systems and the relationship between time averages and space averages. The ergodicity of a system is closely related to its metric indecomposability, highlighting the connection between statistical behavior and the structure of the phase space.1 / 1The Ergodic Hierarchy and Statistical Mechanics
The concepts of EH, and in particular ergodicity itself, play important roles in the foundation of statistical mechanics (SM). In this section we review what these roles are.

A discussion of SM faces an immediate problem. Foundational debates in many other fields of physics can take as their point of departure a generally accepted formalism. Things are different in SM. Unlike, say, relativity theory, SM has not yet found a generally accepted theoretical framework, let alone a canonical formulation.[12] What we find in SM is plethora of different approaches and schools, each with its own programme and mathematical apparatus.[13] However, all these schools use (slight variants) of either of two theoretical frameworks, one of which can be associated with Boltzmann (1877) and the other with Gibbs (1902), and can thereby be classify either as âBoltzmannianâ or âGibbsianâ. For this reason we divide our presentation of SM into a two parts, one for each of these families of approaches.

Before delving into a discussion of these theories, let us briefly review the basic tenets of SM by dint of a common example. Consider a gas that is confined to the left half of a box. Now remove the barrier separating the two halves of the box. As a result, the gas quickly disperses, and it continues to do so until it uniformly fills the entire box. The gas has approached equilibrium. This raises two questions. First, how is equilibrium characterised? That is, what does it take for a system to be in equilibrium? Second, how do we characterise the approach to equilibrium? That is, what are the salient features of the approach to equilibrium and what features of a system make it behave in this way? These questions are addressed in two subdisciplines of SM: equilibrium SM and non-equilibrium SM.

There are two different ways of describing processes like the spreading of a gas. Thermodynamics describes the system using a few macroscopic variables (in the case of the gas pressure, volume and temperature), while disregarding the microscopic constitution of the gas. As far as thermodynamics is concerned matter could be a continuum rather than consisting of particlesâit just would not make any difference. For this reason thermodynamics is called a âmacro theoryâ.

The cornerstone of thermodynamics is the so-called Second Law of thermodynamics. This law describes one of the salient features of the above process: its unidirectionality. We see gases spreadâi.e., we see them evolving towards equilibriumâbut we never observe gases spontaneously reverting to the left half of a boxâi.e., we never see them move away from equilibrium when left alone. And this is not a specific feature of gases. In fact, not only gases but also all other macroscopic systems behave in this way, irrespective of their specific makeup. This fact is enshrined in the Second Law of thermodynamics, which, roughly, states that transitions from equilibrium to non-equilibrium states cannot occur in isolated systems, which is the same as saying that entropy cannot decrease in isolated systems (where a system is isolated if it has no interaction with its environment: there is no heat exchange, no one is compressing the gas, etc.).

But there is an altogether different way of looking at that same gas; that is, as consisting of a large number of molecules (a vessel on a laboratory table contains something like 
10
23
 molecules). These molecules bounce around under the influence of the forces exerted onto them when they crash into the walls of the vessel and collide with each other. The motion of each molecule is governed by the laws of classical mechanics in the same way as the motion of the bouncing ball. So rather than attributing some macro variables to the gas and focussing on them, we could try to understand the gasâ behaviour by studying the dynamics of its micro constituents.

This raises the question of how the two ways of looking at the gas fit together. Since neither the thermodynamic nor the mechanical approach is in any way privileged, both have to lead to the same conclusions. Statistical mechanics is the discipline that addresses this task. From a more abstract point of view we can therefore also say that SM is the study of the connection between micro-physics and macro-physics: it aims to account for a systemâs macro behaviour in terms of the dynamical laws governing its microscopic constituents. The term âstatisticalâ in its name is owed to the fact that, as we will see, a mechanical explanation can only be given if w1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTWe divide the discussion of statistical mechanics (SM) into two parts: Boltzmannian and Gibbsian approaches. Both approaches aim to understand the behavior of systems in equilibrium and the approach to equilibrium. SM addresses the connection between the macroscopic behavior described by thermodynamics and the microscopic behavior governed by classical mechanics.Thermodynamics describes systems using a few macroscopic variables, such as pressure, volume, and temperature, without considering the microscopic constitution of the system. The Second Law of thermodynamics is a cornerstone of thermodynamics, stating that transitions from equilibrium to non-equilibrium states cannot occur in isolated systems, and entropy cannot decrease in isolated systems.On the other hand, statistical mechanics considers systems as consisting of a large number of molecules that interact with each other and their environment according to the laws of classical mechanics. The motion of each molecule is governed by these laws, and statistical mechanics aims to understand the behavior of the system as a whole based on the dynamics of its microscopic constituents.The goal of statistical mechanics is to bridge the gap between macrophysics and microphysics, explaining the macroscopic behavior in terms of the underlying microscopic dynamics. It provides a mechanistic explanation for phenomena observed in thermodynamics by studying the statistical properties of the ensemble of microscopic states.The concepts of the Ergodic Hierarchy, particularly ergodicity, play important roles in the foundation of statistical mechanics. Ergodicity relates to the statistical properties of dynamical systems and their behavior over long periods of time. In the context of statistical mechanics, ergodicity implies that the time average of a property of the system is equal to its ensemble average, allowing for predictions of equilibrium behavior based on statistical properties of the system.Overall, statistical mechanics provides a framework for understanding the equilibrium and non-equilibrium behavior of systems by considering both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives and bridging the gap between the two. The concepts of the Ergodic Hierarchy, such as ergodicity, help elucidate the statistical properties of dynamical systems and their relevance in the study of equilibrium behavior.1 / 1Boltzmannian SM
We first introduce the main elements of the Boltzmannian framework and then turn to the use of ergodicity in it. Every system can posses various macrostates 
M
1
,
â¦
,
M
k
. These macrostates are characterised by the values of macroscopic variables, in the case of a gas pressure, temperature, and volume.[14] In the introductory example one macro-state corresponds to the gas being confined to the left half, another one to it being spread out. In fact, these two states have special status: the former is the gasâ initial state (also referred to as the âpast stateâ); the latter is the gasâ equilibrium state. We label the states 
M
p
 and 
M
e
q
 respectively.

It is one of the fundamental posits of the Boltzmann approach that macrostates supervene on microstates, meaning that a change in a systemâs macrostate must be accompanied by a change in its microstate (for a discussion of supervenience see McLaughlin and Bennett 2005, and references therein). For instance, it is not possible to change the pressure of a system and at the same time keep its micro-state constant. Hence, to every given microstate 
x
 there corresponds exactly one macrostate. Let us refer to this macrostate as 
M
(
x
)
. This determination relation is not one-to-one; in fact many different 
x
 can correspond to the same macrostate. We now group together all microstates 
x
 that correspond to the same macro-state, which yields a partitioning of the phase space in non-overlapping regions, each corresponding to a macro-state. For this reason we also use the same letters, 
M
1
,
â¦
,
M
k
, to refer to macro-states and the corresponding regions in phase space. This is illustrated in Figure 6a.

Figure 6b	Figure 6b

Figure 6: The macrostate structure of 
X
.

We are now in a position to introduce the Boltzmann entropy. To this end recall that we have a measure 
Î¼
 on the phase space that assigns to every set a particular volume, hence a fortiori also to macrostates. With this in mind, the Boltzmann entropy of a macro-state 
M
j
 can be defined as 
S
B
=
k
B
log
[
Î¼
(
M
j
)
]
, where 
k
B
 is the Boltzmann constant. The important feature of the logarithm is that it is a monotonic function: the larger 
M
j
, the larger its logarithm. From this it follows that the largest macro-state also has the highest entropy!

One can show that, at least in the case of dilute gases, the Boltzmann entropy coincides with the thermodynamic entropy (in the sense that both have the same functional dependence on the basic state variables), and so it is plausible to say that the equilibrium state is the macro-state for which the Boltzmann entropy is maximal (since thermodynamics posits that entropy be maximal for equilibrium states). By assumption the system starts off in a low entropy state, the initial state 
M
p
 (the gas being squeezed into the left half of the box). The problem of explaining the approach to equilibrium then amounts to answering the question: why does a system originally in 
M
p
 eventually move into 
M
e
q
 and then stay there? (See Figure 6b.)

In the 1870s Boltzmann offered an important answer to this question.[15] At the heart of his answer lies the idea to assign probabilities to macrostates according to their size. So Boltzmann adopted the following postulate: 
p
(
M
j
)
=
c
Î¼
(
M
j
)
 for all 
j
=
1
,
â¦
,
k
, where 
c
 is a normalisation constant assuring that the probabilities add up to one. Granted this postulate, it follows immediately that the most likely state is the equilibrium state (since the equilibrium state occupies the largest chunk of the phase space). From this point of view it seems natural to understand the approach to equilibrium as the evolution from an unlikely macrostate to a more likely macrostate and finally to the most likely macro-state. This, Boltzmann argued, was a statistical justification of the Second Law of thermodynamics.

But Boltzmann knew that simply postulating 
p
(
M
j
)
=
c
Î¼
(
M
j
)
 would not solve the problem unless the postulate could be justified in terms of the dynamics of the system. This is where ergodicity enters the scene. As we have seen above, ergodic systems have the property of spending a fraction of time in each part of the phase space that is proportional to its size (with respect to 
Î¼
)
. As we have also seen, the equilibrium state is the largest macrostate. In fact, the equilibrium state is much larger than the other states. So if we assume that the system is ergodic, then it is in equilibrium most of the time! It is then natural to interpret 
p
(
M
j
)
 as a time average: 
p
(
M
j
)
 is the fraction of time that the system spends in state 
M
j
 over the course of time. We now have the main elements of Boltzmannâs framework in front of us: (a) partition the phase space of the system in macrostates and show that the equilibrium state is by far the largest state; (b) adopt a time average interpretation of probability; and (c) assume that the1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn the Boltzmannian framework of statistical mechanics, macrostates are defined by the values of macroscopic variables, such as pressure, temperature, and volume. Each microstate corresponds to a unique macrostate, and multiple microstates can correspond to the same macrostate. This leads to a partitioning of the phase space into non-overlapping regions, each corresponding to a macrostate.The Boltzmann entropy, denoted as SB, is defined for each macrostate Mj as SB = kB log[Î¼(Mj)], where kB is the Boltzmann constant and Î¼(Mj) is the measure or volume of the macrostate. The Boltzmann entropy is a measure of the size or multiplicity of a macrostate, and it increases with the size of the macrostate. The equilibrium state is the macrostate with the highest Boltzmann entropy, which coincides with the thermodynamic entropy.Boltzmann's answer to the question of why a system eventually moves from an initial state Mp to the equilibrium state Meq and remains there involves assigning probabilities to macrostates based on their size. He postulated that the probability of a macrostate Mj is proportional to its size, given by pj = cÎ¼(Mj), where c is a normalization constant ensuring that the probabilities add up to one. This postulate implies that the equilibrium state is the most likely state since it occupies the largest portion of the phase space.However, Boltzmann recognized the need to justify this postulate in terms of the system's dynamics. This is where ergodicity comes into play. In an ergodic system, the fraction of time that the system spends in each part of the phase space is proportional to its size. Since the equilibrium state is the largest macrostate, if the system is ergodic, it will spend most of the time in the equilibrium state. This interpretation allows the probabilities pj to be understood as time averages of the system's behavior.The main elements of Boltzmann's framework include the partitioning of phase space into macrostates, the adoption of a time average interpretation of probability, and the assumption of ergodicity. Together, these elements provide a statistical justification for the approach to equilibrium and support the Second Law of thermodynamics.1 / 1 Gibbsian SM
At the basis of Gibbsâ approach stands a conceptual shift. The object of study in the Boltzmannian framework is an individual system, consisting of a large but finite number of micro constituents. By contrast, within the Gibbs framework the object of study is a so-called ensemble: an imaginary collection of infinitely many copies of the same system (they are the same in that they have the same phase space, dynamics and measure), but who happen to be in different states. An ensemble of gases, for instance, consists of infinitely many copies of the same gas bit in different states: one is concentrated in the left corner of the box, one is evenly distributed, etc. It is important to emphasise that ensembles are fictions, or âmental copies of the one system under considerationâ (SchrÃ¶dinger 1952, 3); or alternatively they can be thought of as collections of possible states of the entire system. Hence, it is important not to confuse ensembles with collections of micro-objects such as the molecules of a gas!

The instantaneous state of one system of the ensemble is specified by one point in its phase space. The state of the ensemble as a whole is therefore specified by a density function 
Ï±
 on the systemâs phase space. From a technical point of view 
Ï±
 is a function just like 
f
 that we encountered in Section 1. We furthermore assume that 
Ï±
 is a probability density, reflecting the probability density of finding the state of a system chosen at random from the entire ensemble in region 
R
, so that the probability of the state being in 
R
 is 
p
(
R
)
=
â«
R
Ï±
d
Î¼
. To make this more intuitive consider the following analogy. You play a special kind of darts: you fix a plank to the wall, which serves as your dart board. For some reason you know that the probability of your dart landing at a particular place on the board is given by the curve shown in Figure 7. You are then asked what the probability is that your next dart lands in the left half of the board. The answer is 1 â 2 since one half of the surface underneath the curve is on the left side. The dart board then plays the role of the systemâs state space, a region of the board (here the left half) plays the role of 
R
, and throwing a dart plays the role of picking a system from the ensemble.

Figure 7
Figure 7: Dart board

The importance of this is that it allows us to calculate expectation values. Assume that the game is such that you get one Pound if the dart hits the left half and three Pounds if it lands on the right half. What is your expected gain? The answer is 1 â

 Pounds. This is the expectation value. The same idea is at work in SM. Physical magnitudes like, for instance, pressure are associated with functions 
f
 on the phase pace. We then calculate the expectation value of these magnitudes, which, in general is given by 
â¨
f
â©
=
â«
f
d
Î¼
. In the context of Gibbsian SM these expectation values are also referred to as phase averages or ensemble averages. They are of central importance because these values are used as predictions for observed values. So if you want to use the formalism to predict what will be observed in an experiment, you first have to figure out what the probability density 
Ï±
 is, then find the function 
f
 corresponding to the physical quantity you are interested in, and then calculate the phase average. Neither of these steps is easy in practice and working physicists spend most of their time doing these calculations. However, these difficulties need not occupy us if we are interested in the conceptual issues underlying this ârecipeâ.

By definition, a probability density 
Ï±
 is stationary if it does not change over time. Given that observable quantities are associated with phase averages and that equilibrium is defined in terms of the constancy of the macroscopic parameters characterising the system, it is natural to regard the stationarity of the distribution as a necessary condition for equilibrium because stationary distributions yield constant averages. For this reason Gibbs refers to stationarity as the âcondition of statistical equilibriumâ.

Among all stationary distributions those satisfying a further requirement, the Gibbsian maximum entropy principle, play a special role. The Gibbs entropy (sometimes called âensemble entropyâ) is defined as1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn the Gibbsian framework of statistical mechanics, the focus shifts from studying individual systems to ensembles, which are imaginary collections of infinitely many copies of the same system in different states. Each system in the ensemble is described by a point in its phase space, and the state of the ensemble as a whole is specified by a density function Ï± on the phase space. This density function reflects the probability density of finding a randomly chosen system from the ensemble in a particular region R.The concept of probability density allows for the calculation of expectation values or ensemble averages of physical magnitudes associated with functions f on the phase space. These ensemble averages, denoted as â¨fâ©, are important because they serve as predictions for observed values. To make predictions using the formalism of statistical mechanics, one needs to determine the probability density Ï±, identify the function f corresponding to the desired physical quantity, and calculate the ensemble average. These calculations can be challenging in practice, and physicists spend significant time on these calculations.A probability density Ï± is considered stationary if it remains unchanged over time. Since equilibrium is characterized by the constancy of macroscopic parameters, such as temperature or pressure, it is natural to associate stationarity with equilibrium. Gibbs referred to the stationarity of the distribution as the "condition of statistical equilibrium."Among all stationary distributions, those that satisfy the Gibbsian maximum entropy principle hold a special significance. The Gibbs entropy, also known as the ensemble entropy, is defined as the logarithm of the maximum entropy consistent with the constraints imposed by the system. The maximum entropy principle states that in the absence of specific information, the distribution with maximum entropy is the most likely distribution. This principle provides a way to determine the probability density Ï± in equilibrium by maximizing the entropy subject to the given constraints.The Gibbsian approach in statistical mechanics relies on ensembles, probability densities, and the maximum entropy principle to describe equilibrium states and calculate ensemble averages. It offers a different perspective from the Boltzmannian framework, focusing on collections of systems and their probability distributions rather than individual systems and their microstates.1 / 1So far we have only dealt with equilibrium, and things get worse once we turn to non-equilibrium. The main problem is that it is a consequence of the formalism that the Gibbs entropy is a constant! This precludes a characterisation of the approach to equilibrium in terms of increasing Gibbs entropy, which is what one would expect if we were to treat the Gibbs entropy as the SM counterpart of the thermodynamic entropy. The standard way around this problem is to coarse-grain the phase space, and then define the so-called coarse grained Gibbs entropy. Put simply, course-graining the phase space amounts to putting a grid on the phase space and declare that all points within one cell of the grid are indistinguishable. This procedure turns a continuous phase space into a discrete collection of cells, and the state of the system is then specified by saying in which cell the systemâs state is. If we define the Gibbs entropy on this grid, it turns out (for purely mathematical reasons) that the entropy is no longer a constant and can actually increase or decrease. If one then assumes that the system is mixing, it follows from the so-called convergence theorem of ergodic theory that the coarse-grained Gibbs entropy approaches a maximum. However, this solution is fraught with controversy, the two main bones of contention being the justification of coarse-graining and the assumption that the system is mixing.

In sum, ergodicity plays a central role in many attempts to justify the posits of SM. And even where a simplistic use of ergodicity is eventually unsuccessful, somewhat modified notions prove fruitful in an analysis of the problem and in the search for better solutions.

5. The Ergodic Hierarchy and Randomness
EH is often presented as a hierarchy of increasing degrees of randomness in deterministic systems: the higher up in this hierarchy a system is placed the more random its behaviour.[20] However, the definitions of different levels of EH do not make explicit appeal to randomness; nor does the usual way of presenting EH involve a specification of the notion of randomness that is supposed to underlie the hierarchy. So there is a question about what notion of randomness underlies EH and in what sense exactly EH is a hierarchy of random behaviour.

Berkovitz, Frigg and Kronz (2006) discuss this problem and argue that EH is best understood as a hierarchy of random behaviour if randomness is explicated in terms of unpredictability, where unpredictability is accounted for in terms of probabilistic relevance. Different patterns of probabilistic relevance, in turn, are spelled out in terms of different types of decay of correlation between a systemâs states at different times. Let us introduce these elements one at a time.

Properties of systems can be associated with different parts of the phase space. In the ball example, for instance, the property having positive momentum is associated with the right half of the phase space; that is, it is associated with the set 
{
x
â
X
â£
p
>
0
}
. Generalising this idea we say that to every subset 
A
 of a systemâs phase space there corresponds a property 
P
A
 so that the system possesses that property at time 
t
 iff the systemâs state 
x
 is in 
A
 at 
t
. The subset 
A
 may be arbitrary and the property corresponding to 
A
 may not be intuitive, unlike, for example, the property of having positive momentum. But nothing in the analysis to follow hangs on a property being âintuitiveâ. We then define the event 
A
t
 as the obtaining of 
P
A
 at time 
t
.

At every time 
t
 there is a matter of fact whether 
P
A
 obtains, which is determined by the dynamics of the system. However, we may not know whether or not this is the case. We therefore introduce epistemic probabilities expressing our uncertainty about whether 
P
A
 obtains: 
p
(
A
t
)
 reflects an agentâs degree of belief in 
P
A
âs obtaining at time 
t
. In the same way we can introduce conditional probabilities: 
p
(
A
t
â£
B
t

)
 is our degree of belief in the system having 
P
A
 at 
t
 given that it had 
P
B
 at an earlier time 
t
1
, where 
B
 is also a subset of the systemâs phase space. By the usual rule of conditional probability we have 
p

1
)
=
p
(
A
t
&
B
t
1
)
/
(
p
(
B

)
. This can of course be generalised to more then one event: 
p
(

B

â¦
&
B
t
r

 is our degree of belief in the system having

B

P

 at

B

B
r
 are subsets of the systemâs phase space (and 
r
 a natural number), and 
t

,
â¦
,
t
r
 are successive instants of time (i.e., 
t
>
t

)
.

Intuitively, an event in the past is relevant to our making predictions if taking the past event into account makes a difference to our predictions, or more specifically if it lowers or raises the probability for a future event. In other words, 
p

 is a measure of the relevance of

â
p

. For technical reasons it turns out to be easier to work with a slightly different but equivalent notion of relevance, which is obtained from the above by multiplying both sides of the equation by 
p
(
B
t

)
. Therefore we adopt the following definition. The relevance of 
B

 for

The generalisation of this definition to cases with more than one set 
B
 (as above) is straightforward.

Relevance serves to explicate unpredictability. Intuitively, the less relevant past events are for 
A
t
, the less predictable the system is. This basic idea can then be refined in various ways. First, the type of unpredictability we obtain depends on the type of events to which (R) is applied. For instance, the degree of the unpredictability of 
A
t
 increases if its probability is independent not only of 
B
t
1
 or other âisolatedâ past events, but rather the entire past. Second, the unpredictability of an event 
A
t
 increases if the probabilistic dependence of that event on past events 
B
t
1
 decreases rapidly with the increase of the temporal distance between the events. Third, the probability of 
A
t
 may be independent of past events simpliciter, or it may be independent of such events only on average. These ideas underlie the analysis of EH as a hierarchy of unpredictability.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe Ergodic Hierarchy (EH) is often understood as a hierarchy of increasing degrees of randomness in deterministic systems. However, the definitions of the different levels of EH do not explicitly appeal to randomness, and the notion of randomness underlying EH is not clearly specified. To address this issue, Berkovitz, Frigg, and Kronz (2006) propose an understanding of EH as a hierarchy of random behavior based on the explication of randomness in terms of unpredictability.According to this approach, unpredictability is accounted for in terms of probabilistic relevance, which is related to the decay of correlation between a system's states at different times. The idea is to associate properties of a system with subsets of its phase space, and to define events corresponding to the occurrence of these properties at specific times. Epistemic probabilities are introduced to express an agent's degree of belief in the occurrence of these events.The relevance of past events to predicting future events is then quantified by measuring the difference in probabilities before and after taking the past events into account. This notion of relevance captures the idea that past events are relevant if they lower or raise the probability of a future event. The relevance of past events for a particular event can be positive, negative, or irrelevant.Unpredictability is understood as the lack of predictability resulting from the relevance (or lack thereof) of past events to future events. The type and degree of unpredictability depend on various factors, such as the type of events considered, the dependence of probabilities on past events, and the temporal distance between events.By analyzing the hierarchy of unpredictability, EH can be seen as a hierarchy of random behavior. The higher up in the hierarchy a system is placed, the more unpredictable its behavior is. This approach provides a framework for understanding randomness in deterministic systems in terms of probabilistic relevance and the decay of correlation between system states over time.It's worth noting that this understanding of EH as a hierarchy of unpredictability builds upon the concept of ergodicity and its role in characterizing the behavior of dynamical systems. While the simplistic use of ergodicity may not always be successful in justifying the posits of statistical mechanics, modified notions, such as the analysis of unpredictability, can provide valuable insights and potentially lead to better solutions in understanding the behavior of complex systems.1 / 1The Ergodic Hierarchy and Chaos
The question of how to characterise chaos has been controversially discussed ever since the inception of chaos theory; for a survey see Smith (1998, Ch. 10). An important family of approaches defines chaos using EH. Belot and Earman (1997, 155) state that being strong mixing is a necessary condition and being a K-system is a sufficient condition for a system to be chaotic. The view that being a K-system is the mark of chaos and that any lower degree of randomness is not chaotic is frequently motivated by two ideas. The first is the idea that chaotic behaviour involves dynamical instability in the form of exponential divergence of nearby trajectories. Thus, since a system involves an exponential divergence of nearby trajectories only if it is a K-system, it is concluded that (merely) ergodic and mixing systems are not chaotic whereas K- and B-systems are. It is noteworthy, however, that SM is compatible with there being polynomial divergence of nearby trajectories and that such divergence sometimes exceeds exponential divergence in the short run. Thus, if chaos is to be closely associated with the rate of divergence of nearby trajectories, there seems to be no good reason to deny that SM systems exhibit chaotic behaviour.

The second common motivation for the view that being a K-system is the mark of chaos is the idea that the shift from zero to positive KS-entropy marks the transition from a âregularâ to âchaoticâ behaviour. This may suggest that having positive KS-entropy is both necessary and sufficient condition for chaotic behaviour. Thus, since K-systems have positive KS-entropy while SM systems donât, it is concluded that K-systems are chaotic whereas SM-systems are not. Why is KS-entropy a mark of chaos? There are three motivations, corresponding to three different interpretations of KS-entropy. First, KS-entropy could be interpreted as entailing dynamical instability in the sense of having nearby divergence of nearby trajectories (see Lichtenberg & Liebermann, 1992, p. 304). Second, KS-entropy could be connected to algorithmic complexity (Brudno 1978). Yet, while such a complexity is sometimes mentioned as an indication of chaos, it is more difficult to connect it to physical intuitions about chaos. Third, KS-entropy could be interpreted as a generalized version of Shannonâs information theoretic entropy (see Frigg 2004). According to this approach, positive KS-entropy entails a certain degree of unpredictability, which is sufficiently high to deserve the title chaotic.[24]

Werndl (2009b) argues that a careful review of all systems that one commonly regards as chaotic shows that strong mixing is the crucial criterion: a system is chaotic just in case it is strong mixing. As she is careful to point out, this claim needs to be qualified: systems are rarely mixing on the entire phase space, but neither are they chaotic on the entire phase space. The crucial move is to restrict attention to those regions of phase space where the system is chaotic, and it then turns out that in these same regions the systems are also strong mixing. Hence Werndl concludes that strong mixing is the hallmark of chaos. And surprisingly this is true also of dissipative systems (i.e., systems that are not measure preserving). These systems have attractors, and they are chaotic on their attractors rather than on the entire phase space. The crucial point then is that one can define an invariant (preserved) measure on the attractor and show that the system is strongly mixing with respect to that measure. So strong mixing can define chaos in both conservative and dissipative systems.

The search for necessary and sufficient conditions for chaos presupposes that there is a clear-cut divide between chaotic and non-chaotic systems. EH may challenge this view, as every attempt to draw a line somewhere to demarcate the chaotic from non-chaotic systems is bound to be somewhat arbitrary. Ergodic systems are pretty regular, mixing systems are less regular and the higher positions in the hierarchy exhibit still more haphazard behaviour. But is there one particular point where the transition from ânon-chaosâ to chaos takes place? Based on the argument that EH is a hierarchy of increasing degrees of randomness and degrees of randomness correspond to different degrees of unpredictability (see Section 5), Berkovitz, Frigg and Kronz (2006, Section 5.3) suggest that chaos may well be viewed as a matter of degree rather than an all-or-nothing affair. Bernoulli systems are very chaotic, K-systems are slightly less chaotic, SM-systems are still less chaotic, and ergodic systems are non-chaotic. This suggestion connects well with the idea that chaos is closely related to unpredictability.

The ergodic hierarchy has also been used to understand quantum chaos. Castagnino and Lombardi (2007) analyze the problem of quantum chaos as a particular case of the classical limit of quantum mechanics and identify mixing in the classical limit as the condition that a quantum system must satisfy to be nonintegrable. Gomez and Castagnino (2014, 2015) generalize the entire ergodic hierarchy to the quantum context and argue that EH thus generalized is a helpful tool to understand quantum chaos; Fortin and Lombardi (2018) use EH to understand decoherence; and Gomez (2018) discusses the KS entropy in quantum mixing systems.

Mixing, finally, has also been invoked in understanding the effects of structural model error. Frigg, Bradley, Du and Smith (2014) argue that the distinction between parameter error and structural model error is crucial, and that the latter has significant and hitherto unappreciated impact on the predictive ability of a model. Wilson-Mayo (2015) points out that to put this observation on a solid foundation we need a notion of structural chaos. He proposes such a notion by appealing to topological mixing.

8. Conclusion
EH is often regarded as relevant for explicating the nature of randomness in deterministic dynamical systems. It is not clear, however, what notion of randomness this claim invokes. The formal definitions of EH do not make explicit appeal to randomness and the usual ways of presenting EH do not involve any specification of the notion of randomness that is supposed to underlie EH. As suggested in Section 5, EH can be interpreted as a hierarchy of randomness if degrees of randomness are explicated in terms of degrees of unpredictability, which in turn are explicated in terms of (coherent) conditional degrees of beliefs. In order for these degrees of belief to be indicative of the systemâs dynamical properties, they have to be updated according to a systemâs dynamical law. The idea is then that the different levels of EH, except for merely ergodic systems, correspond to different kinds of unpredictability, which correspond to different patterns of decay of correlations between systemsâ past states and their present states. Merely ergodic systems seem to display no randomness, as the correlations between their past and present states need not decay at all.

Ergodic theory plays an important role in statistical physics, and EH, or some modification of it, constitutes an important measure of randomness in both Hamiltonian and dissipative systems. It is sometimes argued that EH is by and large irrelevant for physics because real physical systems are not ergodic. But, this charge is unwarranted, and a closer look at non-ergodic systems reveals a rather different picture, because EH can be fruitfully be used in the foundations of statistical mechanics, analyses of randomness, and chaos theory. More recently it has also played a role in understanding laws of nature (Filomeno 2019, List and Pivato 2019).1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe Ergodic Hierarchy (EH) has been used to characterize chaos in deterministic dynamical systems. One approach defines chaos in terms of EH, stating that being a strong mixing system is a necessary condition, and being a K-system is a sufficient condition for a system to be chaotic. The motivation behind this view is often based on two ideas: the exponential divergence of nearby trajectories and the transition from zero to positive Kolmogorov-Sinai (KS) entropy.However, it's important to note that the concept of chaos has been controversial, and there is no universally agreed-upon definition. While some associate chaos with exponential divergence of nearby trajectories, statistical mechanics (SM) is compatible with systems exhibiting polynomial divergence that may exceed exponential divergence in the short run. Additionally, positive KS entropy can be connected to dynamical instability, algorithmic complexity, or a generalized version of Shannon's information theoretic entropy. These different interpretations reflect various perspectives on chaos.Werndl argues that a careful examination of systems commonly regarded as chaotic shows that strong mixing is the crucial criterion. Strong mixing is a characteristic of chaos, but systems are rarely mixing on the entire phase space. Instead, they are chaotic in specific regions of the phase space where strong mixing occurs. This observation applies to both conservative and dissipative systems, with the latter exhibiting chaos on their attractors.The search for necessary and sufficient conditions for chaos assumes a clear-cut divide between chaotic and non-chaotic systems. However, EH challenges this view by suggesting that chaos may be a matter of degree rather than an all-or-nothing distinction. According to Berkovitz, Frigg, and Kronz, chaos can be viewed as a hierarchy of increasing degrees of randomness and unpredictability. Bernoulli systems are highly chaotic, K-systems are less chaotic, SM-systems are even less chaotic, and ergodic systems are considered non-chaotic. This perspective aligns with the idea that chaos is closely related to unpredictability.EH has also been applied to the study of quantum chaos, structural model error, and the effects of mixing. In the quantum context, EH can help understand the classical limit of quantum mechanics and the nonintegrability of quantum systems. EH has also been used to analyze decoherence and discuss KS entropy in quantum mixing systems. Furthermore, mixing has been invoked to comprehend the impact of structural model error on predictive models.In conclusion, EH is often seen as relevant for understanding randomness in deterministic dynamical systems. It can be interpreted as a hierarchy of randomness if degrees of randomness are explicated in terms of unpredictability, which, in turn, is explained in terms of conditional degrees of belief. EH, or modified versions of it, plays a significant role in statistical physics, the analysis of randomness, chaos theory, and the understanding of laws of nature. Despite the critique that real physical systems are not ergodic, EH remains a fruitful framework for studying non-ergodic systems.1 / 1It was from https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ergodic-hierarchy/1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTApologies for not providing the appropriate citation earlier.

The eigenmode of a classically integrable system (e.g. the circular cavity on the left) can be very confined even for high mode number. On the contrary the eigenmodes of a classically chaotic system (e.g. the stadium-shaped cavity on the right) tend to become gradually more uniform with increasing mode number.
In quantum chaos, a branch of mathematical physics, quantum ergodicity is a property of the quantization of classical mechanical systems that are chaotic in the sense of exponential sensitivity to initial conditions. Quantum ergodicity states, roughly, that in the high-energy limit, the probability distributions associated to energy eigenstates of a quantized ergodic Hamiltonian tend to a uniform distribution in the classical phase space. This is consistent with the intuition that the flows of ergodic systems are equidistributed in phase space. By contrast, classical completely integrable systems generally have periodic orbits in phase space, and this is exhibited in a variety of ways in the high-energy limit of the eigenstates: typically, some form of concentration occurs in the semiclassical limit {\displaystyle \hbar \rightarrow 0}\hbar \rightarrow 0.

The model case of a Hamiltonian is the geodesic Hamiltonian on the cotangent bundle of a compact Riemannian manifold. The quantization of the geodesic flow is given by the fundamental solution of the SchrÃ¶dinger equation

{\displaystyle U_{t}=\exp(it{\sqrt {\Delta }})}U_{t}=\exp(it{\sqrt  {\Delta }})
where {\displaystyle {\sqrt {\Delta }}}\sqrt{\Delta} is the square root of the LaplaceâBeltrami operator. The quantum ergodicity theorem of Shnirelman 1974, Zelditch, and Yves Colin de VerdiÃ¨re states that a compact Riemannian manifold whose unit tangent bundle is ergodic under the geodesic flow is also ergodic in the sense that the probability density associated to the nth eigenfunction of the Laplacian tends weakly to the uniform distribution on the unit cotangent bundle as n â â in a subset of the natural numbers of natural density equal to one. Quantum ergodicity can be formulated as a non-commutative analogue of the classical ergodicity (T. Sunada).


A scar in a stadium billiard (upper panel) and in a disordered quantum dot (lower panel) are example of nonergodic eigenstates allowed by the quantum ergodicity theorem. In both cases, the probability density of the eigenstates is concentrated along a periodic orbit of the classical counterpart (solid blue line). Although similar in appearance, the birth mechanism of the scars in the billiard and the quantum dot perturbed by potential bumps (red dots) are different: the former is explained the conventional scar theory,[1][2] whereas the latter is known as perturbation-induced scarring[3][4] (for further information, see Quantum scar).
Since a classically chaotic system is also ergodic, almost all of its trajectories eventually explore uniformly the entire accessible phase space. Thus, when translating the concept of ergodicity to the quantum realm, it is natural to assume that the eigenstates of the quantum chaotic system would fill the quantum phase space evenly (up to random fluctuations) in the semiclassical limit {\displaystyle \hbar \rightarrow 0}\hbar \rightarrow 0. The quantum ergodicity theorems of Shnirelman, Zelditch, and Yves Colin de VerdiÃ¨re proves that the expectation value of an operator converges in the semiclassical limit to the corresponding microcanonical classical average. However, the quantum ergodicity theorem leaves open the possibility of eigenfunctions become sparse with serious holes as {\displaystyle \hbar \rightarrow 0}\hbar \rightarrow 0, leaving large but not macroscopic gaps on the energy manifolds in the phase space. In particular, the theorem allows the existence of a subset of macroscopically nonerdodic states which on the other hand must approach zero measure, i.e., the contribution of this set goes towards zero percent of all eigenstates when {\displaystyle \hbar \rightarrow 0}\hbar \rightarrow 0.[5]1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe concept of quantum ergodicity is a property in the field of quantum chaos that relates to the quantization of classically chaotic systems. It states that in the high-energy limit, the probability distributions associated with the energy eigenstates of a quantized ergodic Hamiltonian tend to become uniform in the classical phase space. This is consistent with the idea that the flows of ergodic systems are evenly distributed in phase space.Classical integrable systems, on the other hand, have periodic orbits in phase space, and this is reflected in the high-energy behavior of their eigenstates. Concentration of these eigenstates occurs in the semiclassical limit, where some form of localization is observed.The geodesic Hamiltonian on the cotangent bundle of a compact Riemannian manifold serves as a model case for studying quantum ergodicity. The quantization of the geodesic flow is described by the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, and the quantum ergodicity theorem, formulated by Shnirelman, Zelditch, and Yves Colin de VerdiÃ¨re, states that a compact Riemannian manifold with an ergodic unit tangent bundle under the geodesic flow is also ergodic in the sense that the probability density associated with the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian tends to a uniform distribution on the unit cotangent bundle as the eigenvalues increase.While quantum ergodicity suggests that eigenstates of quantum chaotic systems should fill the quantum phase space evenly in the semiclassical limit, there is a possibility for the existence of sparse eigenfunctions with gaps in the energy manifolds, even though they approach zero measure. This means that there can be macroscopically nonergodic states that contribute towards zero percent of all eigenstates as the semiclassical limit is approached.It is important to note that the discussion provided here is a summary of the information from the given Wikipedia page on "Quantum ergodicity."

For example, the theorem do not exclude quantum scarring, as the phase space volume of the scars also gradually vanishes in this limit.[1][5][6][2] A quantum eigenstate is scarred by periodic orbit if its probability density is on the classical invariant manifolds near and all along that periodic orbit is systematically enhanced above the classical, statistically expected density along that orbit.[5] In a simplified manner, a quantum scar refers to an eigenstate of whose probability density is enhanced in the neighborhood of a classical periodic orbit when the corresponding classical system is chaotic. In conventional scarring, the responsive periodic orbit is unstable.[1][5][6][2] The instability is a decisive point that separates quantum scars from a more trivial finding that the probability density is enhanced near stable periodic orbits due to the Bohr's correspondence principle. The latter can be viewed as a purely classical phenomenon, whereas in the former quantum interference is important. On the other hand, in the perturbation-induced quantum scarring,[3][7][8][9][4] some of the high-energy eigenstates of a locally perturbed quantum dot contain scars of short periodic orbits of the corresponding unperturbed system. Even though similar in appearance to ordinary quantum scars, these scars have a fundamentally different origin.,[3][7][4] In this type of scarring, there are no periodic orbits in the perturbed classical counterpart or they are too unstable to cause a scar in a conventional sense. Conventional and perturbation-induced scars are both a striking visual example of classical-quantum correspondence and of a quantum suppression of chaos (see the figure). In particular, scars are a significant correction to the assumption that the corresponding eigenstates of a classically chaotic Hamiltonian are only featureless and random. In some sense, scars can be considered as an eigenstate counterpart to the quantum ergodicity theorem of how short periodic orbits provide corrections to the universal random matrix theory eigenvalue statistics.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe concept of quantum ergodicity in quantum chaos states that in the high-energy limit, the probability distributions associated with energy eigenstates of a quantized ergodic Hamiltonian tend to become uniformly distributed in the classical phase space. This means that the eigenstates of a quantum chaotic system should fill the quantum phase space evenly, up to random fluctuations, in the semiclassical limit as the parameter {\displaystyle \hbar }\hbar (related to Planck's constant) approaches zero.The quantum ergodicity theorem, formulated by Shnirelman, Zelditch, and Yves Colin de VerdiÃ¨re, provides mathematical support for this notion. It proves that the expectation value of an operator converges in the semiclassical limit to the corresponding microcanonical classical average. However, the theorem also allows for the existence of sparse eigenfunctions with gaps in the energy manifolds in the phase space, which approach zero measure as {\displaystyle \hbar }\hbar approaches zero. This means that there can be macroscopically nonergodic states that contribute towards zero percent of all eigenstates as the semiclassical limit is approached.Quantum scarring is a phenomenon that can occur in quantum systems despite quantum ergodicity. It refers to the enhancement of the probability density of quantum eigenstates near classical periodic orbits. There are two types of quantum scarring: conventional scarring and perturbation-induced scarring. Conventional scarring occurs when the probability density of an eigenstate is systematically enhanced along an unstable periodic orbit of the corresponding classical system. Perturbation-induced scarring, on the other hand, involves scars of short periodic orbits in the eigenstates of a locally perturbed quantum system, even when there are no significant periodic orbits in the perturbed classical counterpart.Both types of scarring are examples of classical-quantum correspondence and demonstrate a quantum suppression of chaos. They provide evidence that the eigenstates of a classically chaotic Hamiltonian are not purely featureless and random. Instead, they exhibit patterns and structures related to the underlying classical dynamics. These scars offer insights into the relationship between classical and quantum behavior and provide corrections to the universal random matrix theory eigenvalue statistics.It is important to note that the discussion provided here is a summary of the information from the given Wikipedia page on "Quantum ergodicity."

The question of ergodicity in a perfectly collisionless ideal gas with specular reflections.

This device can trap fruit flies, but if it trapped atoms when placed in gas that already uniformly fills the available phase space, then both Liouville's theorem and the second law of thermodynamics would be violated.
In physics and thermodynamics, the ergodic hypothesis[1] says that, over long periods of time, the time spent by a system in some region of the phase space of microstates with the same energy is proportional to the volume of this region, i.e., that all accessible microstates are equiprobable over a long period of time.

Liouville's theorem states that, for a Hamiltonian system, the local density of microstates following a particle path through phase space is constant as viewed by an observer moving with the ensemble (i.e., the convective time derivative is zero). Thus, if the microstates are uniformly distributed in phase space initially, they will remain so at all times. But Liouville's theorem does not imply that the ergodic hypothesis holds for all Hamiltonian systems.

The ergodic hypothesis is often assumed in the statistical analysis of computational physics. The analyst would assume that the average of a process parameter over time and the average over the statistical ensemble are the same. This assumptionâthat it is as good to simulate a system over a long time as it is to make many independent realizations of the same systemâis not always correct. (See, for example, the FermiâPastaâUlamâTsingou experiment of 1953.)

Assumption of the ergodic hypothesis allows proof that certain types of perpetual motion machines of the second kind are impossible.

Systems that are ergodic are said to have the property of ergodicity; a broad range of systems in geometry, physics and stochastic probability theory are ergodic. Ergodic systems are studied in ergodic theory.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe ergodic hypothesis is a concept in physics and thermodynamics that states that, over long periods of time, a system will spend time in different regions of its phase space in proportion to the volume of those regions. In other words, all accessible microstates of the system are equally likely to occur over time.Liouville's theorem, which applies to Hamiltonian systems, states that the density of microstates along a particle's path through phase space remains constant over time. This means that if the microstates are uniformly distributed in phase space initially, they will remain uniformly distributed at all times. However, Liouville's theorem does not imply that the ergodic hypothesis holds for all Hamiltonian systems.The ergodic hypothesis is often used in the statistical analysis of computational physics, assuming that the average behavior of a system over time is equivalent to the average over a statistical ensemble. However, this assumption is not always correct, as demonstrated by experiments like the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou experiment of 1953.The ergodic hypothesis plays a role in disproving certain types of perpetual motion machines of the second kind, which aim to extract energy from a system in a way that violates the laws of thermodynamics.Ergodicity is a property attributed to systems that satisfy the ergodic hypothesis, and it is studied in the field of ergodic theory. Many systems in various disciplines, such as geometry, physics, and stochastic probability theory, are considered to be ergodic.1 / 1Phenomenology
In macroscopic systems, the timescales over which a system can truly explore the entirety of its own phase space can be sufficiently large that the thermodynamic equilibrium state exhibits some form of ergodicity breaking. A common example is that of spontaneous magnetisation in ferromagnetic systems, whereby below the Curie temperature the system preferentially adopts a non-zero magnetisation even though the ergodic hypothesis would imply that no net magnetisation should exist by virtue of the system exploring all states whose time-averaged magnetisation should be zero. The fact that macroscopic systems often violate the literal form of the ergodic hypothesis is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking.

However, complex disordered systems such as a spin glass show an even more complicated form of ergodicity breaking where the properties of the thermodynamic equilibrium state seen in practice are much more difficult to predict purely by symmetry arguments. Also conventional glasses (e.g. window glasses) violate ergodicity in a complicated manner. In practice this means that on sufficiently short time scales (e.g. those of parts of seconds, minutes, or a few hours) the systems may behave as solids, i.e. with a positive shear modulus, but on extremely long scales, e.g. over millennia or eons, as liquids, or with two or more time scales and plateaux in between.[2]

Ergodic hypothesis in finance
Models used in finance and investment assume ergodicity, explicitly or implicitly. The ergodic hypothesis is prevalent in modern portfolio theory, discounted cash flow (DCF) models, and aggregate indicator models that infuse macroeconomics, among others.

The situations modeled by these theories can be useful. But often they are only useful during much, but not all, of any particular time period under study. They can therefore miss some of the largest deviations from the standard model, such as financial crises, debt crises and systemic risk in the banking system that occur only infrequently.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb has argued[citation needed] that a very important part of empirical reality in finance and investment is non-ergodic. An even statistical distribution of probabilities, where the system returns to every possible state an infinite number of times, is simply not the case we observe in situations where âabsorbing states" are reached, a state where ruin is seen. The death of an individual, or total loss of everything, or the devolution or dismemberment of a nation state and the legal regime that accompanied it, are all absorbing states. Thus, in finance, path dependence matters. A path where an individual, firm or country hits a "stop"âan absorbing barrier, "anything that prevents people with skin in the game from emerging from it, and to which the system will invariably tend. Let us call these situations ruin, as the entity cannot emerge from the condition. The central problem is that if there is a possibility of ruin, cost benefit analyses are no longer possible."[3]âwill be non-ergodic. All traditional models based on standard probabilistic statistics break down in these extreme situations.

Ergodic hypothesis in social science
In the social sciences, the ergodic hypothesis corresponds to the assumption that individuals are representative of groups, and vice-versa, that group averages can adequately characterize what might be seen in an individual. This appears to appears to not be the case: group level data often gives a poor indication of individual level variation,[4][5] as individual standard deviations (SDs) tend to be almost eight times larger than group level SDs of the same people.[5] Subsequently a third of the individual observations falls outside a 99.9% confidence interval of group level data.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn macroscopic systems, such as ferromagnetic systems, the ergodic hypothesis is often broken, leading to phenomena known as ergodicity breaking or spontaneous symmetry breaking. For example, below the Curie temperature, ferromagnetic systems exhibit spontaneous magnetization, even though the ergodic hypothesis would suggest that the time-averaged magnetization should be zero. This violation of ergodicity is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking.Complex disordered systems, like spin glasses and conventional glasses, exhibit even more complicated forms of ergodicity breaking. Their thermodynamic equilibrium states are difficult to predict solely based on symmetry arguments. Glasses, for instance, can behave like solids on short timescales but like liquids on extremely long timescales, or exhibit multiple timescales and plateaus in between.In the field of finance and investment, models often assume ergodicity, but this assumption may not hold in reality. Nassim Nicholas Taleb has argued that financial systems exhibit non-ergodic behavior, where absorbing states, such as ruin or total loss, can be reached and have significant consequences. Traditional models based on standard probabilistic statistics may break down in extreme situations, and path dependence becomes important.In social science, the ergodic hypothesis assumes that individuals are representative of groups and vice versa, and that group averages can adequately characterize individual behavior. However, this assumption is often incorrect, as group-level data may poorly indicate individual-level variation. Individual observations can fall outside the range of group-level data, with individual standard deviations being much larger than group-level standard deviations of the same people. This indicates the limitations of using group-level data to understand individual behavior.1 / 1Connections between the topics1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe topics of ergodicity, ergodic hypothesis, and phenomenology are interconnected in various ways:Ergodicity and Ergodic Hypothesis: Ergodicity is the property of a system that explores its entire phase space over time. The ergodic hypothesis states that, on long timescales, a system spends time in each microstate of its phase space proportionally to its volume. The ergodic hypothesis is related to the concept of ergodicity, as it assumes that a system exhibits ergodic behavior. However, in certain macroscopic systems, ergodicity may be broken, leading to phenomena such as spontaneous symmetry breaking.Phenomenology and Ergodicity Breaking: Phenomenology refers to the study of observed phenomena and their explanations. The breaking of ergodicity in macroscopic systems, such as ferromagnetic systems and complex disordered systems like spin glasses, is a phenomenon studied in phenomenology. These systems exhibit deviations from the ergodic hypothesis, and their thermodynamic equilibrium states are characterized by complex behavior that cannot be solely explained by symmetry arguments. The study of ergodicity breaking in these systems falls under the purview of phenomenology.Ergodicity in Finance and Social Science: Ergodicity has implications in the fields of finance and social science. In finance, the assumption of ergodicity is prevalent in models used for portfolio theory, discounted cash flow analysis, and macroeconomic indicators. However, Nassim Nicholas Taleb argues that financial systems exhibit non-ergodic behavior, with the possibility of reaching absorbing states like ruin, which can have significant consequences. Similarly, in social science, the ergodic hypothesis assumes that individuals are representative of groups, but empirical evidence shows that individual-level variation is often larger than group-level variation, challenging the validity of this assumption.Overall, the concepts of ergodicity, ergodic hypothesis, and phenomenology intersect in the study of systems' exploration of phase space, the breaking of ergodicity in various contexts, and the understanding of observed phenomena in macroscopic and social systems.1 / 1Key terms1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTErgodicity: Ergodicity refers to the property of a system where, over time, it explores all possible states or configurations in its phase space. A system is considered ergodic if its time averages match the ensemble averages.Ergodic Hypothesis: The ergodic hypothesis is a hypothesis in physics and statistical mechanics that states that, over long periods of time, a system will spend time in each microstate of its phase space proportional to the microstate's volume. It assumes that all accessible microstates are equally probable in the long run.Phenomenology: Phenomenology is a branch of philosophy and science that focuses on the study of observed phenomena and their descriptions. It involves describing and interpreting the structures and meanings of various phenomena, often through subjective experiences or qualitative analysis.Symmetry Breaking: Symmetry breaking occurs when a system exhibits behavior or properties that do not possess the same symmetry as its underlying laws or equations. It is often associated with phase transitions and the emergence of ordered patterns or states from systems that initially have symmetries.Spontaneous Magnetization: Spontaneous magnetization is a phenomenon observed in certain materials, such as ferromagnetic systems, where the material develops a non-zero magnetization even in the absence of an external magnetic field. It is an example of ergodicity breaking, as the system exhibits a preference for a particular state instead of exploring all possible states.Spin Glass: A spin glass is a disordered magnetic material characterized by the presence of competing magnetic interactions. It exhibits complex and frustrated behavior, with multiple competing ground states and a lack of long-range order. Spin glasses are known to exhibit ergodicity breaking and challenging phenomena for statistical physics.Non-Ergodicity: Non-ergodicity refers to the violation of the ergodic hypothesis, where a system does not explore all accessible microstates equally or does not exhibit the expected time-averaged behavior. Non-ergodic behavior is often observed in systems with complex dynamics, long relaxation times, or specific constraints.Nassim Nicholas Taleb: Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a scholar, statistician, and author known for his work on risk management, randomness, and uncertainty.

Financial crises often challenge the assumptions of ergodicity in financial models and highlight the importance of considering non-ergodic phenomena in understanding market behavior.Absorbing States: Absorbing states are states in a system from which it cannot escape or return to a previous state.

They provide a simplified representation of a material composed of interacting magnetic moments, such as atoms with spin.The Ising model consists of a lattice of individual "spins" that can take on two possible values, typically represented as +1 and -1. The spins interact with their nearest neighbors according to certain rules, usually described by an energy function or Hamiltonian.The Ising model can be used to investigate various properties of magnetic systems, including phase transitions, critical phenomena, and the emergence of magnetic ordering. It has been applied to understand phenomena such as ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, and spin glasses.In the context of ergodicity and non-ergodicity, Ising models can provide insights into the behavior of systems that exhibit ergodicity breaking. For example, in the case of spin glasses, the Ising model can capture the frustration and complexity of interactions that lead to non-ergodic behavior.By simulating the dynamics of the Ising model using computational methods, researchers can study how the system evolves over time, explore the phase space, and investigate the emergence of ordered or disordered states. This allows for the examination of ergodicity and non-ergodicity in magnetic systems and provides a framework for understanding the connection between the microstates and macroscopic behavior of the system.Overall, Ising models serve as valuable tools in the study of ergodicity, symmetry breaking, and complex phenomena in magnetic systems, offering insights into the behavior of physical systems beyond the simple assumptions of ergodicity.1 / 1Submitted on 6 Oct 2014 (v1), last revised 30 Aug 2015 (this version, v3)]
Many-body localization and quantum ergodicity in disordered long-range Ising models
Philipp Hauke, Markus Heyl
Ergodicity in quantum many-body systems is - despite its fundamental importance - still an open problem. Many-body localization provides a general framework for quantum ergodicity, and may therefore offer important insights. However, the characterization of many-body localization through simple observables is a difficult task. In this article, we introduce a measure for distances in Hilbert space for spin-1/2 systems that can be interpreted as a generalization of the Anderson localization length to the many-body Hilbert space. We show that this many-body localization length is equivalent to a simple local observable in real space, which can be measured in experiments of superconducting qubits, polar molecules, Rydberg atoms, and trapped ions. Using the many-body localization length and a necessary criterion for ergodicity that it provides, we study many-body localization and quantum ergodicity in power-law-interacting Ising models subject to disorder in the transverse field. Based on the nonequilibrium dynamical renormalization group, numerically exact diagonalization, and an analysis of the statistics of resonances we find a many-body localized phase at infinite temperature for small power-law exponents. Within the applicability of these methods, we find no indications of a delocalization transition1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe submitted article titled "Many-body localization and quantum ergodicity in disordered long-range Ising models" by Philipp Hauke and Markus Heyl explores the concepts of many-body localization and quantum ergodicity in disordered long-range Ising models.

Ergodicity is a fundamental concept of statistical 
physics. If a classical system is ergodic, phase-space tra- 
jectories cover uniformly constant energy hyper-surfaces, 
such that time and microcanonical ensemble averages be- 
come equivalent1.Although attempts to extend these 
ideas to the quantum regime date back to von Neu- 
mannâs quantum ergodic theorem2,3, a general concep- 
tual understanding of quantum ergodicity has not yet 
been achieved4. This, however, is crucial for fundamental 
questions such as regarding the thermalization of closed 
quantum many-body systems. A lack of quantum ergod- 
icity can, in analogy to the classical phase-space descrip- 
tion, be seen as localization in Hilbert space, for which a 
general framework has been introduced recently: many- 
body localization(MBL)5â7. 
MBL phases exhibit further peculiar properties8,9be- 
yond the fundamental question of quantum ergodicity. 
Perhaps most notable among them is a universal tem- 
poral growth of entanglement following global quenches 
out of weakly entangled initial states10â14. Additionally, 
MBL phases can exhibit i nite-temperature phase tran- 
sitions even in one dimension7,15, which are excluded 
for thermodynamic phases. Even more, many-body lo- 
calization can stabilize order in one dimension over the 
full spectrum16â18, which may be of interest for design- 
ing quantum-information devices8. Compared to conven- 
tional localization in real space19,20, however, theoretical 
calculations of many-body localization suf f er from the 
complexity of the underlying geometryâthe many-body 
Hilbert space. Therefore, revealing many-body localiza- 
tion properties and i nding suitable, experimentally ac- 
cessible quantities for their characterization remains chal- 
lenging. 
In this article, we introduce an observable that mea- 
sures distances in Hilbert space, and as such can be 
interpreted as a many-body generalization of the An- 
derson localization length.Importantly, it can be ob- 
tained via simple local measurements such as on-site 
magnetizations.This observable thus opens a feasible 
and ef i cient route for studying many-body localization 
in experiments. Using this measure, we study in detail 
the disordered quantum Ising model with power-law in- 
teractions at small power-law exponent Î± â¤ 1, which 
is relevant to experiments on polar molecules, Rydberg 
atoms, superconducting qubits, and trapped ions. Our 
calculations predict that transverse-f i eld disorder drives 
the model into a MBL phase even at inf i nite tempera- 
ture. These i ndings are drawn from the recently intro- 
duced nonequilibrium dynamical renormalization group 
(ndRG)21, from extensive numerical simulations using 
exact diagonalization (ED), as well as from an analysis 
of the statistics of resonant Hilbert-space conf i gurations. 
Within the applicability of these methods, we i nd no 
indications of a delocalization transition, even for weak 
disorder strength. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In 
Sec. II we introduce the disordered quantum Ising chain 
with power-law interactions, which we use to illustrate 
our considerations. Basic principles of many-body local- 
ization are discussed in Sec. III, including the main re- 
sult of this work, the many-body localization length. In 
Sec. IV, we calculate the many-body localization length 
for the disordered power-law-interacting Ising chain at in- 
i nite temperature, using the ndRG as well as extensive 
numerically exact simulations, indicating a many-body 
localized phase at nonzero disorder strength. We corrob- 
orate these predictions by an analytical analysis of the 
statistics of resonances.

to an exactly solvable nearest-neighbor Ising chain, the 
system becomes an Anderson insulator at nonzero disor- 
der strength. At i nite Î± < â, however, the situation is 
not completely clear. In particular, it has been argued 
that in the regime 1 < Î± < 2, the system delocalizes at 
any i nite disorder strength40. For Î± > 2 a many-body 
localization transition might be possible as observed for 
related long-range XXZ chains, it has, however, not been 
explicitly shown yet41,42.For the inf i nitely connected 
limit with Î± = 0 on the other hand, analytical calcula- 
tions have revealed a MBL phase for nonvanishing disor- 
der strength37. For the regime 0 < Î± <= 1, the situation 
is much less clear. It is one purpose of this work to show 
that the MBL phase at any nonzero disorder strength in 
the long-range Ising chains extends from Î± = 0 to the 
entire regime Î± <= 1. 
III.MANY-BODY LOCALIZATION LENGTH 
In this section, we discuss in more detail many-body 
localization and its connection to quantum ergodicity. 
In particular, we will explicitly show the mapping of 
interacting spin models, such as the Hamiltonian in 
Eq. (1), onto noninteracting Anderson models on a com- 
plex graph of spin conf i gurations. We will then present 
the main result of this work, a def i nition of a distance 
in this complex graph for spin-1/2 models, which can 
be interpreted as the many-body localization length and 
which is experimentally accessible.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe introduction of the article discusses the fundamental concept of ergodicity in statistical physics and the challenges of extending this concept to quantum many-body systems.

Abstract
The problem of calculation of time-correlation functions and relaxation phenomena in interacting quantum many-body systems or quantized fields is put into the framework of ergodic theory and dynamical systems. In this spirit we discuss spectral analysis of the adjoint propagator in a suitable Hilbert space of quantum observables in Heisenberg picture as an alternative approach to characterize many-body dynamics. We illustrate our approach by working out the time-autocorrelation functions at infinite temperature of a large class of observables for a spin s = 1/2 Ising chain in a periodically kicking transverse magnetic field, and show that they decay to their asymptotic values as â t -3/21 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe research paper titled "Ergodic Properties of Quantum Spin Chains: Kicked Transverse Ising Model" by TomaÅ¾ Prosen explores the problem of calculating time-correlation functions and relaxation phenomena in interacting quantum many-body systems from the perspective of ergodic theory and dynamical systems.

Abstract
A general relation is derived, which expresses the fidelity of quantum dynamics, measuring the stability of time evolution to small static variation in the Hamiltonian, in terms of ergodicity of an observable generating the perturbation as defined by its time correlation function. Fidelity for ergodic dynamics is predicted to decay exponentially on time scale proportional to delta(-2), delta approximately strength of perturbation, whereas faster, typically Gaussian decay on shorter time scale proportional delta(-1) is predicted for integrable, or generally nonergodic dynamics. This result needs the perturbation delta to be sufficiently small such that the fidelity decay time scale is larger than any (quantum) relaxation time, e.g., mixing time for mixing dynamics, or averaging time for nonergodic dynamics (or Ehrenfest time for wave packets in systems with chaotic classical limit). Our surprising predictions are demonstrated in a quantum Ising spin-(1/2) chain periodically kicked with a tilted magnetic field where we find finite parameter-space regions of nonergodic and nonintegrable motion in the thermodynamic limit.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis article by Tomaz Prosen explores the relationship between quantum ergodicity and the fidelity of quantum dynamics. The fidelity measures the stability of time evolution under small variations in the Hamiltonian. The article derives a general relation that expresses the fidelity in terms of the ergodicity of an observable generating the perturbation, as defined by its time correlation function.The main findings of the article include:Fidelity for ergodic dynamics decays exponentially on a timescale proportional to the strength of the perturbation (delta) raised to the power of -2.For integrable or nonergodic dynamics, the fidelity decays faster, typically following a Gaussian decay on a shorter timescale proportional to delta raised to the power of -1.The article also notes that the fidelity decay timescale should be larger than any relevant relaxation time, such as the mixing time or averaging time for nonergodic dynamics.To illustrate these predictions, the article presents a study of a quantum Ising spin-(1/2) chain periodically kicked with a tilted magnetic field. The analysis reveals regions of nonergodic and nonintegrable motion in the thermodynamic limit.In summary, this article provides insights into the connection between quantum ergodicity and the fidelity of quantum dynamics, highlighting the decay behavior of the fidelity under perturbations and its dependence on the ergodicity of the system.1 / 1Review Philos Trans A Math Phys Eng Sci

Abstract
We review the numerical studies on the critical behaviour of the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model, which indicate that a quantum critical behaviour is observed up to a low but non-zero value of temperature. We revisit the numerical investigations on the spin glass order parameter distributions, which identify a low temperature along with high transverse field spin glass phase where the order parameter distribution becomes a delta function in the thermodynamic limit indicating the restoration of replica symmetry and ergodic nature of the system. In the remaining spin glass phase associated with high temperature and low transverse field, the observed distribution is broad akin to the Parisi order parameter distribution. This essentially indicates the non-ergodic behaviour of the system. We further discuss the annealing dynamics studies on the quantum SK model. Such investigations reveal the system size independence of annealing time when the annealing paths go through the ergodic spin glass region. Interestingly, when such dynamics are performed in the non-ergodic spin glass phase the annealing time becomes an increasing function of the system size. Spin autocorrelation shows faster relaxation in the ergodic spin glass region compared with that found in the non-ergodic spin glass region. This article is part of the theme issue 'Quantum annealing and computation: challenges and perspectives'.

Keywords: ergodicity; quantum annealing; quantum spin glass.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis review article by Sudip Mukherjee focuses on the role of quantum fluctuations in inducing ergodicity in the spin glass phase and its effect on quantum annealing. The article reviews numerical studies conducted on the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model to investigate its critical behavior and the presence of a quantum critical point at low but nonzero temperatures.The review also revisits numerical investigations on the spin glass order parameter distributions. It is observed that at low temperatures and high transverse fields, the order parameter distribution becomes a delta function in the thermodynamic limit, indicating the restoration of replica symmetry and the ergodic nature of the system. On the other hand, in the remaining spin glass phase associated with high temperatures and low transverse fields, the observed distribution is broad, resembling the Parisi order parameter distribution. This indicates the non-ergodic behavior of the system.Furthermore, the article discusses the annealing dynamics studies on the quantum SK model. It is found that when the annealing paths pass through the ergodic spin glass region, the annealing time is independent of the system size. However, in the non-ergodic spin glass phase, the annealing time increases with the system size. The spin autocorrelation also shows faster relaxation in the ergodic spin glass region compared to the non-ergodic spin glass region.Overall, the article highlights the role of quantum fluctuations in inducing ergodicity in the spin glass phase and provides insights into the effects of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior on quantum annealing processes.1 / 1Sci Rep

By fixing the initial state of the system into the ground state of the Hamiltonian at zero temperature and tuning a control parameter, we consider the occurrence of the ergodicity with quench dynamics in the one-dimensional (1D) spin-1/2 XY model in a transverse magnetic field. The ground-state phase diagram consists of two ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases. It is known the magnetization in this spin system is non-ergodic. We set up two different experiments as we call them single and double quenches and test the dynamics of the magnetization along the Z-axis and the spin-spin correlation function along the X-axis which are the order parameters of the zero-temperature phases . Our exact results reveal that for single quenches at zero-temperature, the ergodicity depends on the initial state and the order parameter. In single quenches for a given order parameter, ergodicity will be observed with an ergodic-region for quenches from another phase, non-correspond to the phase of the order parameter, into itself. In addition, a quench from a ground-state phase point corresponding to the order parameter into or very close to the quantum critical point, hc = 1.0, discloses an ergodic behavior. Otherwise, for all other single quenches, the system behaves non-ergodic. Interestingly on the other setup, a double quench on a cyclic path, ergodicity is completely broken for starting from the phase corresponding to the order parameter. Otherwise, it depends on the first quenched point, and the quench time T when the model spent before a second quench in the way back which gives an ability to controlling the ergodicity in the system. Therefore, and contrary to expectations, in the mentioned model the ergodicity can be observed with probing quench dynamics at zero-temperature. Our results provide further insight into the zero-temperature dynamical behavior of quantum systems and their connections to the ergodicity phenomenon.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this study by Hadi Cheraghi and Saeed Mahdavifar, the focus is on probing the possibilities of ergodicity in the one-dimensional (1D) spin-1/2 XY chain with quench dynamics. Ergodicity, which relates to the connection between statistical mechanics and the dynamics of a physical system, is examined by fixing the initial state of the system to the ground state of the Hamiltonian at zero temperature and varying a control parameter.The spin-1/2 XY model in a transverse magnetic field exhibits two distinct phases: ferromagnetic and paramagnetic. The magnetization in this spin system is known to be non-ergodic. The authors conduct two types of experiments called single and double quenches to investigate the dynamics of the magnetization along the Z-axis and the spin-spin correlation function along the X-axis, which serve as order parameters for the zero-temperature phases.The exact results obtained indicate that for single quenches at zero temperature, the presence of ergodicity depends on the initial state and the specific order parameter under consideration. Ergodic behavior is observed in single quenches when transitioning from another phase into the same phase as the order parameter. Moreover, a quench from a ground-state phase point close to the quantum critical point reveals ergodic behavior. In all other single quenches, the system behaves non-ergodically.Interestingly, in the case of double quenches on a cyclic path, ergodicity is completely broken when starting from the phase corresponding to the order parameter. However, the presence of ergodicity depends on the first quenched point and the quench time spent before the second quench on the way back, providing a means to control ergodicity in the system.These findings demonstrate that, contrary to expectations, the XY chain model can exhibit ergodic behavior when probed using quench dynamics at zero temperature. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of the zero-temperature dynamical behavior of quantum systems and its relation to the phenomenon of ergodicity.1 / 1Phys Rev E Stat Nonlin Soft Matter Phys

Abstract
We reexamine the problem of the "Loschmidt echo," that measures the sensitivity to perturbation of quantum-chaotic dynamics. The overlap squared M(t) of two wave packets evolving under slightly different Hamiltonian is shown to have the double-exponential initial decay proportional to exp(-constant x e(2lambda(0)t)) in the main part of the phase space. The coefficient lambda(0) is the self-averaging Lyapunov exponent. The average decay (-)M proportional to e(-lambda(1)t) is single exponential with a different coefficient lambda(1). The volume of phase space that contributes to (-)M vanishes in the classical limit variant Planck-->0 for times less than the Ehrenfest time tau(E)=1/2lambda0(-1)|ln Planck|. It is only after the Ehrenfest time that the average decay is representative for a typical initial condition.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this study by P.G. Silvestrov, J. TworzydÅo, and C.W.J. Beenakker, the focus is on the hypersensitivity to perturbations in quantum-chaotic wave-packet dynamics. The phenomenon is examined through the concept of the "Loschmidt echo," which measures the sensitivity of quantum-chaotic dynamics to perturbations.The authors investigate the overlap squared, denoted as M(t), between two wave packets that evolve under slightly different Hamiltonians. They find that in the main part of the phase space, M(t) exhibits a double-exponential initial decay, with the decay rate proportional to exp(-constant x e^(2Î»(0)t)). Here, Î»(0) represents the self-averaging Lyapunov exponent, which characterizes the sensitivity of the quantum system to perturbations.Additionally, the authors observe that the average decay, denoted as (-)M, follows a single exponential decay with a different decay rate coefficient, Î»(1). They show that the volume of phase space contributing to (-)M diminishes in the classical limit as the Planck constant approaches zero (Planck â 0) for times shorter than the Ehrenfest time, Ï(E) = 1/(2Î»(0)|ln Planck|). Only after the Ehrenfest time does the average decay become representative of a typical initial condition.These findings highlight the hypersensitivity of quantum-chaotic wave-packet dynamics to perturbations and the specific time scales at which the dynamics exhibit representative behavior. The study provides insights into the behavior of quantum systems with chaotic dynamics and their sensitivity to small changes in the Hamiltonian.1 / 1view

Two dimensional kicked quantum Ising model: dynamical phase transitions
Pineda, C. ; Prosen, T. ; VillaseÃ±or, E.
Abstract
Using an efficient one and two qubit gate simulator operating on graphical processing units, we investigate ergodic properties of a quantum Ising spin 1/2 model on a two-dimensional lattice, which is periodically driven by a Î´-pulsed transverse magnetic field. We consider three different dynamical properties: (i) level density, (ii) level spacing distribution of the Floquet quasienergy spectrum, and (iii) time-averaged autocorrelation function of magnetization components. Varying the parameters of the model, we found transitions between ordered (non-ergodic) and quantum chaotic (ergodic) phases, but the transitions between flat and non-flat spectral density do not correspond to transitions between ergodic and non-ergodic local observables. Even more surprisingly, we found good agreement of level spacing distribution with the Wigner surmise of random matrix theory for almost all values of parameters except where the model is essentially non-interacting, even in regions where local observables are not ergodic or where spectral density is non-flat. These findings question the versatility of the interpretation of level spacing distribution in many-body systems and stress the importance of the concept of locality.

Physical review. E
We investigate the relation between the classical ergodicity and the quantum eigenstate thermalization in the fully connected Ising ferromagnets. In the case of spin-1/2, an expectation value of an observable in a single-energy eigenstate coincides with the long-time average in the underlying classical dynamics, which is a consequence of the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. In the case of spin-1, the underlying classical dynamics is not necessarily ergodic. In that case, it turns out that, in the thermodynamic limit, the statistics of the expectation values of an observable in the energy eigenstates coincides with the statistics of the long-time averages in the underlying classical dynamics starting from random initial states sampled uniformly from the classical phase space. This feature seems to be a general property in semiclassical systems, and the result presented here is crucial in discussing equilibration, thermalization, and dynamical transitions of such systems.

This result is a consequence of the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation.However, in the case of spin-1, the underlying classical dynamics may not be ergodic. Despite this, the study finds that in the thermodynamic limit, the statistics of the expectation values of an observable in the energy eigenstates aligns with the statistics of the long-time averages in the underlying classical dynamics. These classical dynamics start from random initial states uniformly sampled from the classical phase space.This observation suggests that the alignment between quantum eigenstate statistics and classical long-time averages is a general feature of semiclassical systems. The findings presented in this article have implications for understanding equilibration, thermalization, and dynamical transitions in such systems.1 / 1Nonequilibrium Criticality in Quench Dynamics of Long-Range Spin Models.

Long-range interacting spin systems are ubiquitous in physics and exhibit a variety of ground-state disorder-to-order phase transitions. We consider a prototype of infinite-range interacting models known as the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model describing the collective interaction of N spins and investigate the dynamical properties of fluctuations and correlations after a sudden quench of the Hamiltonian. Specifically, we focus on critical quenches, where the initial state and/or the postquench Hamiltonian are critical. Depending on the type of quench, we identify three distinct behaviors where both the short-time dynamics and the stationary state at long times are effectively thermal, quantum, and genuinely nonequilibrium, characterized by distinct universality classes and static and dynamical critical exponents. These behaviors can be identified by an infrared effective temperature that is finite, zero, and infinite (the latter scaling with the system size as N^{1/3}), respectively. The quench dynamics is studied through a combination of exact numerics and analytical calculations utilizing the nonequilibrium Keldysh field theory. Our results are amenable to realization in experiments with trapped-ion experiments where long-range interactions naturally arise1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article by P. Titum and M.

The researchers investigate the dynamical properties of fluctuations and correlations after a sudden quench of the Hamiltonian, where the initial state and/or the postquench Hamiltonian are critical.Three distinct behaviors are identified depending on the type of quench.

We study a fully connected quantum spin model resonantly coupled to a small environment of non-interacting spins, and investigate how initial state properties are remembered at long times. We ï¬nd memory of initial state properties, in addition to the total energy, that are not conserved by the dynamics. This memory occurs in the middle of the spectrum where an eigenstate quantum phase transition (ESQPT) occurs as a function of energy. The memory eï¬ect at that energy in the spectrum is robust to system-environment coupling until the coupling changes the energy of the ESQPT. This work demonstrates the eï¬ect of ESQPT memory as independent of integrability and suggests a wider generality of this mechanism for preventing thermalization at ESQPTs.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article by M. Lambert, S. Tsai, and S. Kelly, published in Physical Review A in December 2021, explores the phenomenon of quantum memory at an eigenstate phase transition in a weakly chaotic model.The study focuses on a fully connected quantum spin model that is resonantly coupled to a small environment of non-interacting spins. The researchers investigate how the properties of the initial state are retained or remembered at long times during the dynamics of the system.The key finding of the study is the presence of memory of initial state properties, in addition to the conservation of total energy, in the middle of the energy spectrum where an eigenstate quantum phase transition (ESQPT) occurs. The memory effect observed at this energy point in the spectrum remains robust even in the presence of system-environment coupling, as long as the coupling does not alter the energy of the ESQPT.The study demonstrates that the memory effect associated with ESQPTs is not limited to integrable systems but can also be observed in weakly chaotic models. This suggests a wider generality of this mechanism for preventing thermalization at ESQPTs.Overall, the research sheds light on the intricate interplay between quantum memory, eigenstate phase transitions, and system-environment interactions, providing insights into the nontrivial dynamics of quantum systems in the presence of critical phenomena.1 / 1A list of everything we have talked about.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly!

Here are some analogies and metaphors that can be used to explain the concepts we discussed:Ergodicity:Analogy: Imagine a group of people exploring a large maze. If they can freely move around and explore all parts of the maze, interacting with each other along the way, we can say that the group is ergodic. They have the opportunity to visit every nook and cranny of the maze, representing the exploration of different states in a system.Metaphor: Ergodicity is like a curious traveler who has the freedom to explore all the hidden corners of a foreign city, experiencing its diverse culture, sights, and sounds.Many-body localization (MBL):Analogy: Imagine a crowded party where everyone is dancing together in a synchronized manner. However, in one corner of the room, a group of people forms a small isolated circle and dances independently, not influenced by the rest of the party. This isolated circle represents localized states in an MBL system that are unaffected by the surrounding environment.Metaphor: Many-body localization is like a group of introverted individuals at a party who prefer to dance together in their own small circle, creating their own unique rhythm and movement, distinct from the rest of the crowd.Quantum ergodicity:Analogy: Think of a pinball machine where a ball bounces around, hitting various bumpers and obstacles. In a classically ergodic pinball machine, the ball eventually explores all possible paths and covers the entire playfield. Similarly, in quantum ergodicity, a quantum system explores all available states and transitions between them, following the rules of quantum mechanics.Metaphor: Quantum ergodicity is like a playful pinball bouncing around the machine, exploring every corner and triggering different mechanisms, showcasing the richness and versatility of its motion.Anderson localization:Analogy: Imagine a busy highway where cars are moving freely, following the flow of traffic. Now, picture a stretch of road where the asphalt becomes uneven, causing cars to slow down and get stuck in one place. In Anderson localization, the disorder in the system acts as a barrier, preventing the free flow of particles or waves, much like the uneven road obstructs the smooth movement of cars.Metaphor: Anderson localization is like a traffic jam caused by a rough patch on the road, disrupting the smooth flow of vehicles and creating localized congestion.Quantum annealing:Analogy: Picture a landscape with multiple valleys and hills, representing different energy states of a system. Quantum annealing is like slowly heating and cooling a material, allowing it to explore and settle into the lowest energy state, analogous to finding the deepest valley in the landscape.Metaphor: Quantum annealing is like a hiker gradually exploring a mountain range, adjusting their pace and route to find the lowest valley, where they can rest and achieve a state of equilibrium.These analogies and metaphors aim to provide intuitive connections to the discussed concepts, making them more accessible and relatable.1 / 1Ergodic Examples

We are amazed when reinforcement learning can be used to win Atari arcade
games using only display pixels. But in doing so, the AI is exposed to the same
game again and again. The game scenarios change change as the human opponent makes
different moves, but the game itself does not change in time. It is time invariant.

To illustrate time invariance, consider training AI to win at the game of

the winner is whoever gets all his checkers jumped. Needless to say, AI trained
to win at conventional checkers would not do wellin the game of give-away. The
rules have been changed. Changing the rules violates time invariance and thus
forecast ergodicity is not applicable.
Remember our rainforest example, where you're sending out teams seeking

difterent winning strategies are tried, results of attempts are remembered.
Reinforcement learning uses incremental neural networks; each new piece of
data allows the AI to "learn" adjusting its behavior with every new bit of
feedback. Reinforcement learning has been used to beat world champions at GO
and beat legacy Atari video arcade games trained on pixels only. These are
astonishing acomplishments.
In pure reinforcement learning, there is no training data per se. In winning at
board games like checkers, chess, or GO, there are only rules and the goal of
winning, Reinforcement learning explores and ultimately decides on the best
winning methodology.
Reinforcement learning is given an environment and a goal. How is the
environment to be explored to best achieve the goal: Ants run around
individually foraging for food. They are exploring. When food is found, the ants
form a line back and forth from the food to their nest. They are exploiting their
discovery. Exploration and exploitaion are the fundamental components of
reinforcement learning.
In the ant foraging example, the environment is fixed but unknown
Similarly, in GO, the environment is the GO board accompanied by the rules of
GO. The goal is to explore and exploit different move combinations for diferent
board configurations, and reinforcement learning is the procedure to achieve this
goal,

letters between F'ermat and Pascal in the seventeenth century. Their

So, although the sequence of coin flips is not forecast ergodic, wagers of the

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTHere are some analogies and metaphors to explain the concepts mentioned in the text:Ergodicity:Analogy: Imagine a group of people attending a conference. During coffee breaks, they have the freedom to move around, interact with different attendees, and exchange ideas. In this scenario, the conference is ergodic as people have the opportunity to explore different topics and perspectives.Metaphor: Ergodicity is like a vibrant marketplace where people freely navigate through various stalls, engaging in conversations, and experiencing different flavors, colors, and cultures.Time Invariance:Analogy: Consider a classic movie that has been playing in a theater for decades. The scenes, dialogues, and plot remain the same every time someone watches it. The movie itself is time invariant, as its content doesn't change over time.Metaphor: Time invariance is like a well-preserved painting in a museum, where its colors, strokes, and composition remain unchanged, allowing viewers to appreciate its beauty and message repeatedly.Reinforcement Learning:Analogy: Think of a person learning to play a musical instrument. Initially, they start with simple exercises, gradually progressing to more complex melodies. Through trial and error, they receive feedback on their performance and adjust their technique to improve. This iterative learning process is akin to reinforcement learning in AI.Metaphor: Reinforcement learning is like a hiker navigating through a challenging mountain trail, adjusting their steps based on the terrain and using past experiences to choose the most optimal path towards their destination.Forecast Ergodicity:Analogy: Imagine a meteorologist forecasting the weather for a specific region. If the weather patterns in that region are consistent and follow well-established rules, the forecast accuracy remains high. However, if sudden and unpredictable changes occur, such as unexpected storms or atmospheric disturbances, the forecast becomes less reliable.Metaphor: Forecast ergodicity is like a compass guiding a sailor during a calm and predictable sea voyage. The compass reliably points in the right direction, helping the sailor navigate, but if sudden storms or erratic currents emerge, the compass becomes less useful in predicting the ship's course.These analogies and metaphors provide relatable scenarios to help understand the concepts of ergodicity, time invariance, reinforcement learning, and forecast ergodicity in different contexts.1 / 1That's a great example of how the concept of forecast ergodicity can be applied in a simulation or gaming context! In the game you played, the statistical properties of the habitable planets may have changed over time, such as due to the arrival of a new species, which would have made the system less ergodic. This could have made it more challenging for you to make accurate predictions and decisions based on outdated data.

In general, the degree of ergodicity of
a system can depend on various factors such as the timescale of the system, the complexity of the underlying dynamics, and the level of interactions between different components of the system. Understanding the degree of forecast ergodicity can be helpful in assessing the reliability and accuracy of predictions and decision-making based on historical data or statistical models, as well as in designing better forecasting and decision-making tools1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTExactly! The concept of forecast ergodicity provides valuable insights into the reliability and applicability of predictions and decision-making in various systems. By considering the degree of ergodicity and understanding how the system evolves over time, we can better assess the limitations and uncertainties associated with forecasting and make more informed choices. This understanding is essential not only in simulation and gaming contexts but also in fields such as weather forecasting, financial modeling, and policy planning, where accurate predictions are crucial for effective decision-making.1 / 1Yes, I am familiar with Stars!, the space strategy game you mentioned. It was first released in 1995 and developed by Jeff Johnson and Jeff McBride. In the game, players explore and colonize space, researching new technologies, and engaging in battles with other players or AI-controlled opponents. The game had a large following and was popular in the strategy gaming community. 2 / 2ChatGPTChatGPTThat's correct! Stars! was indeed released in 1995 and developed by Jeff Johnson and Jeff McBride. It offered a unique and immersive space strategy experience for players, allowing them to build and manage their interstellar empires.

Players could customize their starships, research new technologies, and engage in strategic decision-making to expand their influence in the galaxy.Stars! gained a dedicated fanbase and received critical acclaim for its depth and complexity. It was praised for its open-ended gameplay, extensive modding capabilities, and the ability to play against both human and AI opponents. The game fostered a competitive community with online multiplayer support, where players could challenge each other to epic battles and vie for dominance in the vastness of space.Although Stars! is now considered a classic, it remains a beloved title among strategy game enthusiasts, showcasing the enduring appeal of well-crafted space strategy games.1 / 1Do you see the forecast ergodicity with scanner information that had only a certain range that went out of date, when you left the are. A planet might look habitable, but what you get there it is already inhabited.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, in the context of a space exploration game like Stars!, the concept of forecast ergodicity can be applied to scanner information and the exploration of new planets. When you receive scanner data about a planet within a certain range, it provides you with information about its habitability and potential resources. However, this information may have a limited validity period, especially if there are dynamic elements in the game such as the arrival of new species or the colonization of planets by other players or AI-controlled opponents.If the scanner information becomes outdated by the time you reach a planet, there is a possibility that the planet has already been inhabited or claimed by another civilization. This introduces a non-ergodic element to the exploration process, as the statistical properties of the planets may change over time. It highlights the importance of adapting your strategies and decision-making based on the dynamic nature of the game world.In such cases, it becomes crucial to gather real-time or up-to-date information during your journey, either through continuous scanning or through interaction with other players or in-game factions. This allows you to make more informed decisions and adjust your plans based on the evolving conditions of the game universe.

While natural languages differ widely in both canonical word order and word order flexibility, their word orders still follow shared cross-linguistic statistical patterns, often attributed to functional pressures. In the effort to identify these pressures, prior work has compared real and counterfactual word orders. Yet one functional pressure has been overlooked in such investigations: the uniform information density (UID) hypothesis, which holds that information should be spread evenly throughout an utterance. Here, we ask whether a pressure for UID may have influenced word order patterns cross-linguistically. To this end, we use computational models to test whether real orders lead to greater information uniformity than counterfactual orders. In our empirical study of 10 typologically diverse languages, we find that: (i) among SVO languages, real word orders consistently have greater uniformity than reverse word orders, and (ii) only linguistically implausible counterfactual orders consistently exceed the uniformity of real orders.

The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper titled "Attention is All you Need" introduces a new network architecture called the Transformer, which is designed for sequence transduction tasks such as machine translation.

Uniform Density in Linguistic Information Derived from Dependency Structures

Linguistics
This pilot study addresses the question of whether the Uniform Information Density principle (UID) can be proved for eight typologically diverse languages. The lexical information of words is derived from dependency structures both in sentences preceding the sentences and within the sentence in which the target word occurs. Dependency structures are a realisation of extra-sentential contexts for deriving information as formulated in the surprisal model. Only subject, object and oblique, i.e., the level directly below the verbal root node, were considered. UID says that in natural language, the variance of information and information jumps from word to word should be small so as not to make the processing of a linguistic message an insurmountable hurdle. We observed cross-linguistically different information distributions but an almost identical UID, which provides evidence for the UID hypothesis and assumes that dependency structures can function as proxies for extrasentential contexts. However, for the dependency structures chosen as contexts, the information distributions in some languages were not statistically significantly different from distributions from a random corpus. This might be an effect of too low complexity of our modelâs dependency structures, so lower hierarchical levels (e.g. phrases) should be considered1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper titled "Uniform Density in Linguistic Information Derived from Dependency Structures" investigates the applicability of the Uniform Information Density (UID) principle to eight typologically diverse languages. The study focuses on the lexical information of words, derived from dependency structures within and preceding the sentences. Dependency structures represent extra-sentential contexts, which are used to derive information according to the surprisal model.The UID principle suggests that in natural language, the variance and jumps in information from word to word should be small to facilitate the processing of linguistic messages. The researchers found that there were cross-linguistic variations in information distributions, but the UID principle was almost identical across languages. This finding provides evidence supporting the UID hypothesis and suggests that dependency structures can serve as proxies for extra-sentential contexts.However, the study also discovered that the chosen dependency structures did not exhibit statistically significant differences in information distributions compared to random corpora for some languages. This observation could be attributed to the potential low complexity of the model's dependency structures. The researchers suggest that considering lower hierarchical levels, such as phrases, may be necessary to enhance the model's complexity and capture more nuanced information distributions.Overall, the paper contributes to our understanding of information density in linguistic structures and the role of dependency structures in modeling extra-sentential contexts.1 / 1Submitted on 23 Sep 2021]
Revisiting the Uniform Information Density Hypothesis
Clara Meister, Tiago Pimentel, Patrick Haller, Lena JÃ¤ger, Ryan Cotterell, Roger Levy
The uniform information density (UID) hypothesis posits a preference among language users for utterances structured such that information is distributed uniformly across a signal. While its implications on language production have been well explored, the hypothesis potentially makes predictions about language comprehension and linguistic acceptability as well. Further, it is unclear how uniformity in a linguistic signal -- or lack thereof -- should be measured, and over which linguistic unit, e.g., the sentence or language level, this uniformity should hold. Here we investigate these facets of the UID hypothesis using reading time and acceptability data. While our reading time results are generally consistent with previous work, they are also consistent with a weakly super-linear effect of surprisal, which would be compatible with UID's predictions. For acceptability judgments, we find clearer evidence that non-uniformity in information density is predictive of lower acceptability. We then explore multiple operationalizations of UID, motivated by different interpretations of the original hypothesis, and analyze the scope over which the pressure towards uniformity is exerted. The explanatory power of a subset of the proposed operationalizations suggests that the strongest trend may be a regression towards a mean surprisal across the language, rather than the phrase, sentence, or document -- a finding that supports a typical interpretation of UID, namely that it is the byproduct of language users maximizing the use of a (hypothetical) communication channel1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper titled "Revisiting the Uniform Information Density Hypothesis" examines various aspects of the Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis, which suggests a preference among language users for distributing information uniformly across a linguistic signal. While previous research has primarily focused on the implications of UID for language production, this study investigates its potential effects on language comprehension and linguistic acceptability.The researchers use reading time and acceptability data to investigate the UID hypothesis. The results of the reading time experiments are generally consistent with previous findings, indicating a correlation between surprisal (the unexpectedness of a word or phrase) and reading time. However, the data also suggests a weakly super-linear effect of surprisal, which aligns with the predictions of UID.Regarding acceptability judgments, the researchers find stronger evidence that non-uniformity in information density negatively affects the perceived acceptability of linguistic stimuli. This suggests that listeners or readers may find linguistically non-uniform utterances less acceptable.Furthermore, the study explores different operationalizations of UID and considers the linguistic unit over which uniformity should hold, such as the sentence, phrase, or document level. The researchers propose that the strongest trend may be a regression towards a mean surprisal across the language as a whole, rather than within specific linguistic units. This finding supports the idea that UID is a consequence of language users optimizing their communication by maximizing the use of a hypothetical communication channel.Overall, this paper contributes to our understanding of UID by examining its implications for language comprehension and acceptability. It also highlights the importance of considering different operationalizations and the scope of uniformity in linguistic signals.1 / 1July 14: Clara Meister, Evidence for the uniform information density hypothesis in modern NLP models

Title: Evidence for the uniform information density hypothesis in modern NLP models

Abstract: In this talk, I will review two recent works that have operationalized the uniform information density (UID) hypothesis for use in models of natural language processing. In machine translation, it has been frequently observed that texts assigned high probability (i.e., low surprisal) are not necessarily what humans perceive to be high quality language. Alternatively, text decoded using beam search, a popular heuristic decoding method, often scores well in terms of both qualitative and automatic evaluation metrics, such as BLEU. We show that beam search can be framed as a UID-enforcing decoding objective and that there exists a strong relationship between BLEU and the extent to which UID is adhered to in natural language text.

In a follow up work, we explore the effects of directly incorporating an operationalization of UID into a language modelâs training objective. Specifically, we augment the canonical MLE objective with a regularizer that encodes UID. In experiments on ten languages spanning five language families, we find that using UID regularization consistently improves perplexity in language models, having a larger effect when training data is limited. Moreover, via an analysis of generated sequences, we find that UID-regularized language models have other desirable properties, e.g., they generate text that is more lexically diverse1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe talk titled "Evidence for the uniform information density hypothesis in modern NLP models" by Clara Meister discusses recent works that apply the uniform information density (UID) hypothesis in the context of natural language processing (NLP) models.The first work examines machine translation and explores the observation that texts assigned high probability (low surprisal) by NLP models may not necessarily be perceived as high-quality language by humans. On the other hand, texts generated using beam search, a decoding method commonly used in NLP, often receive favorable scores in terms of both qualitative and automatic evaluation metrics like BLEU. The talk shows that beam search can be framed as a decoding objective that enforces UID, and there exists a strong relationship between BLEU scores and the degree to which UID is adhered to in natural language text.In the second work, the talk discusses the direct incorporation of UID into the training objective of language models. The canonical maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) objective is augmented with a regularizer that encodes UID. Experimental results on language models trained on ten languages from five language families demonstrate that incorporating UID regularization consistently improves perplexity, particularly when training data is limited. Additionally, an analysis of generated sequences reveals that UID-regularized language models exhibit other desirable properties, such as generating text that is more lexically diverse.Overall, the talk presents evidence for the effectiveness of incorporating the UID hypothesis in NLP models, showcasing its potential to improve the quality and diversity of generated language.1 / 1Submitted on 6 Oct 2020 (v1), last revised 17 Jan 2021 (this version, v2)]
If beam search is the answer, what was the question?
Clara Meister, Tim Vieira, Ryan Cotterell
Quite surprisingly, exact maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding of neural language generators frequently leads to low-quality results. Rather, most state-of-the-art results on language generation tasks are attained using beam search despite its overwhelmingly high search error rate. This implies that the MAP objective alone does not express the properties we desire in text, which merits the question: if beam search is the answer, what was the question? We frame beam search as the exact solution to a different decoding objective in order to gain insights into why high probability under a model alone may not indicate adequacy. We find that beam search enforces uniform information density in text, a property motivated by cognitive science. We suggest a set of decoding objectives that explicitly enforce this property and find that exact decoding with these objectives alleviates the problems encountered when decoding poorly calibrated language generation models. Additionally, we analyze the text produced using various decoding strategies and see that, in our neural machine translation experiments, the extent to which this property is adhered to strongly correlates with BLEU1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper titled "If beam search is the answer, what was the question?" by Clara Meister, Tim Vieira, and Ryan Cotterell explores the phenomenon where exact maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding of neural language generators often produces low-quality results, while state-of-the-art performance is achieved using beam search despite its high search error rate. This raises the question of why beam search is effective and what properties it expresses in text.The authors reframe beam search as the exact solution to a different decoding objective in order to gain insights into why high probability under a model alone may not indicate adequacy. They propose that beam search enforces uniform information density (UID) in text, a property motivated by cognitive science. UID suggests that information should be distributed evenly throughout an utterance.To further investigate this, the authors propose a set of decoding objectives that explicitly enforce UID and demonstrate that exact decoding using these objectives can mitigate the problems encountered when decoding poorly calibrated language generation models. They also analyze the text generated using various decoding strategies and find that, in their neural machine translation experiments, the extent to which the UID property is adhered to strongly correlates with BLEU scores, a common evaluation metric for translation quality.Overall, the paper highlights the limitations of the MAP objective in producing high-quality text and explores the role of beam search in enforcing UID, providing insights into the properties that contribute to the effectiveness of beam search in language generation tasks.1 / 1Submitted on 15 May 2021 (v1), last revised 10 Jun 2021 (this version, v3)]
A Cognitive Regularizer for Language Modeling
Jason Wei, Clara Meister, Ryan Cotterell
The uniform information density (UID) hypothesis, which posits that speakers behaving optimally tend to distribute information uniformly across a linguistic signal, has gained traction in psycholinguistics as an explanation for certain syntactic, morphological, and prosodic choices. In this work, we explore whether the UID hypothesis can be operationalized as an inductive bias for statistical language modeling. Specifically, we augment the canonical MLE objective for training language models with a regularizer that encodes UID. In experiments on ten languages spanning five language families, we find that using UID regularization consistently improves perplexity in language models, having a larger effect when training data is limited. Moreover, via an analysis of generated sequences, we find that UID-regularized language models have other desirable properties, e.g., they generate text that is more lexically diverse. Our results not only suggest that UID is a reasonable inductive bias for language modeling, but also provide an alternative validation of the UID hypothesis using modern-day NLP tools1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper titled "A Cognitive Regularizer for Language Modeling" by Jason Wei, Clara Meister, and Ryan Cotterell investigates the applicability of the uniform information density (UID) hypothesis as an inductive bias for statistical language modeling. The UID hypothesis suggests that speakers tend to distribute information uniformly across a linguistic signal in optimal communication.In this work, the authors augment the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) objective for training language models with a regularizer that encodes UID. They conduct experiments on ten languages from five language families and find that incorporating UID regularization consistently improves perplexity in language models, particularly when training data is limited. Furthermore, through an analysis of generated sequences, they observe that UID-regularized language models exhibit other desirable properties, such as generating text with greater lexical diversity.The results of the study not only indicate that UID can serve as a reasonable inductive bias for language modeling but also provide empirical validation of the UID hypothesis using modern natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By incorporating UID as a cognitive regularizer, the authors demonstrate its potential to enhance language models and improve their performance in terms of perplexity and lexical diversity.Overall, this work contributes to our understanding of the UID hypothesis in the context of language modeling and highlights its potential as a valuable tool in NLP research and development.1 / 1Connections between the previous topics.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe topics we have discussed have various connections and common themes related to language processing and modeling. Here are some connections between the previous topics:Uniform Information Density (UID): The concept of UID has been explored in multiple papers we discussed, including "Uniform Density in Linguistic Information Derived from Dependency Structures" and "Revisiting the Uniform Information Density Hypothesis." These studies investigate the hypothesis that speakers tend to distribute information uniformly across a linguistic signal. They examine the effects of UID on language comprehension, acceptability, and language modeling, demonstrating its influence on various aspects of language processing.Information Distribution in Word Order: The paper "A Cross-Linguistic Pressure for Uniform Information Density in Word Order" and the study on UID in word order investigate the relationship between word order patterns and information distribution in languages. They highlight how different word orders across languages can be influenced by the pressure to maintain uniformity in information density, supporting the idea that information should be evenly spread throughout an utterance.Language Modeling and Decoding Objectives: The papers "Attention is All you Need," "If beam search is the answer, what was the question?," and "A Cognitive Regularizer for Language Modeling" focus on language modeling and decoding objectives. They propose new approaches, such as the Transformer model based on attention mechanisms and the use of beam search, to improve language generation and decoding. Additionally, they explore the integration of UID as a regularizer in language models to enhance their performance in terms of perplexity, lexical diversity, and adherence to UID principles.Empirical Studies and Experimental Results: Many of the papers we discussed present empirical studies and experimental results to support their findings. They conduct experiments using various languages, datasets, and evaluation metrics to validate their hypotheses and demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed models or techniques.Overall, these topics are interconnected through their focus on understanding the properties of natural language, information distribution, language modeling, and the impact of UID on language processing and generation. They contribute to advancing our knowledge of how language works and provide insights into the design and optimization of NLP models and systems.1 / 1Some everyday examples1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here are some everyday examples that can help illustrate the concepts we discussed:Conversation: In a conversation, speakers often strive for uniform information density by organizing their thoughts and distributing information in a coherent and balanced manner. They aim to convey their message effectively without overwhelming the listener with too much or too little information at once.Presentation Slides: When creating presentation slides, individuals often follow the principle of uniform information density. They ensure that each slide contains a reasonable amount of information, with clear and concise bullet points or visuals. This approach helps to maintain the audience's attention and comprehension without overwhelming them with excessive text or cluttered visuals.Recipe Instructions: Recipes typically adhere to the principle of uniform information density. The instructions are usually structured in a way that distributes information evenly, providing clear steps and measurements at each stage of the cooking process. This helps the reader follow the recipe accurately and ensures that important details are not overlooked.News Articles: Journalists and writers strive for uniform information density when crafting news articles. They organize the information into paragraphs and sections, presenting key details in a balanced manner. This allows readers to grasp the main points without being overwhelmed by dense text or fragmented information.Traffic Signs: Traffic signs follow the principle of uniform information density to convey messages quickly and effectively. They use concise symbols, colors, and text to communicate important information, such as speed limits, directions, and warnings. The design ensures that drivers can process the information efficiently and make appropriate decisions while navigating the road.These examples demonstrate how uniform information density plays a role in various aspects of everyday communication, ranging from conversations to written instructions. The principle helps to ensure clarity, comprehension, and effective information transfer in different contexts.1 / 1ll Content

Abstract
General characterizations of geometric convergence for Markov chains in discrete time on a general state space have been developed recently in considerable detail. Here we develop a similar theory for Ï-irreducible continuous time processes and consider the following types of criteria for geometric convergence: 1. the existence of exponentially bounded hitting times on one and then all suitably "small" sets; 2. the existence of "Foster-Lyapunov" or "drift" conditions for any one and then all skeleton and resolvent chains; 3. the existence of drift conditions on the extended generator AÌ of the process. We use the identity AÌRÎ² = Î²(RÎ² - I) connecting the extended generator and the resolvent kernels RÎ² to show that, under a suitable aperiodicity assumption, exponential convergence is completely equivalent to any of criteria 1-3. These conditions yield criteria for exponential convergence of unbounded as well as bounded functions of the chain. They enable us to identify the dependence of the convergence on the initial state of the chain and also to illustrate that in general some smoothing is required to ensure convergence of unbounded functions.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis journal article, titled "Exponential and Uniform Ergodicity of Markov Processes," by D. Down, S. P. Meyn, and R. L. Tweedie, was published in The Annals of Probability in October 1995. The article focuses on the development of a theory for Ï-irreducible continuous-time Markov processes and examines criteria for geometric convergence of these processes. The authors explore various conditions for exponential convergence, including the existence of exponentially bounded hitting times, Foster-Lyapunov or drift conditions, and drift conditions on the extended generator of the process. The article establishes the equivalence of these criteria under suitable assumptions and demonstrates their applicability to bounded and unbounded functions of the Markov chain. The authors also discuss the dependence of convergence on the initial state of the chain and the need for smoothing to ensure convergence of unbounded functions.1 / 1This approach suggests that the behaviour of an individual system can be understood by considering the ensemble as a whole, where each system represents a possible state and the probabilities associated with different states determine the statistical properties of the ensemble.
1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, that is a correct interpretation of the approach. The idea is to study the behavior of an individual system by analyzing the statistical properties of the ensemble, which is composed of multiple systems representing different possible states. The probabilities associated with these different states determine the overall statistical behavior of the ensemble. By understanding the statistical properties of the ensemble, one can gain insights into the behavior of individual systems within the ensemble. This approach is commonly used in statistical mechanics and other areas of science to study systems with a large number of interacting components.1 / 1Ergodicity, Decisions, and Partial Information 
Ramon van Handel 
Abstract In the simplest sequential decision problem for an ergodic stochastic pro- 
cess X, at each time n a decision unis made as a function of past observations 
X0,...,Xnâ1, and a loss l(un,Xn) is incurred. In this setting, it is known that one 
may choose (under a mild integrability assumption) a decision strategy whose path- 
wise time-average loss is asymptotically smaller than that of any other strategy. The 
corresponding problem in the case of partial information proves to be much more 
delicate, however: if the process X is not observable, but decisions must be based on 
the observation of a different processY, the existence of pathwise optimal strategies 
is not guaranteed. The aim of this paper is to exhibit connections between pathwise 
optimal strategies and notions from ergodic theory. The sequential decision problem 
is developed in the general setting of an ergodic dynamical system (â¦,B,P,T) with 
partial information YâB. The existence of pathwise optimal strategies grounded in 
twobasicproperties:theconditionalergodictheoryofthedynamicalsystem,andthe 
complexity of the loss function. When the loss function is not too complex, a gen- 
eral suff i cient condition for the existence of pathwise optimal strategies is that the 
dynamical system is a conditional K-automorphism relative to the past observations 
ï¿¿ nâ¥0T nY. If the conditional ergodicity assumption is strengthened, the complexity 
assumption can be weakened. Several examples demonstrate the interplay between 
complexity and ergodicity, which does not arise in the case of full information. Our 
results also yield a decision-theoretic characterization of weak mixing in ergodic 
theory, and establish pathwise optimality of ergodic nonlinear i lters.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper discusses the relationship between ergodicity, sequential decision-making, and partial information. In a sequential decision problem for an ergodic stochastic process, decisions are made at each time step based on past observations, and a loss is incurred as a result of the decision. It is known that, under certain conditions, one can choose a decision strategy that minimizes the average loss over time.However, when the process is not fully observable and decisions must be based on the observation of a different process, the existence of pathwise optimal strategies is not guaranteed. The paper explores the connections between pathwise optimal strategies and concepts from ergodic theory in this setting.The general framework considered in the paper is that of an ergodic dynamical system with partial information. The existence of pathwise optimal strategies is shown to depend on two main factors: the conditional ergodicity of the dynamical system and the complexity of the loss function. When the loss function is not too complex, a sufficient condition for the existence of pathwise optimal strategies is that the dynamical system is a conditional K-automorphism relative to the past observations.The paper demonstrates how complexity and ergodicity interact in the decision-making process, highlighting that this interplay does not arise in the case of full information. The results also provide a decision-theoretic characterization of weak mixing in ergodic theory and establish the pathwise optimality of ergodic nonlinear filters.Overall, the paper contributes to the understanding of optimal decision strategies in the presence of partial information and sheds light on the connections between ergodicity, complexity, and decision-making.1 / 1DOI:10.1609/aaai.v35i10.17110Corpus ID: 211103615

Abstract
The work proposed a reliability demonstration test (RDT) process, which can be employed to determine whether a finite population is accepted or rejected. Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches were compared in the proposed RDT process, as were lot and sequential sampling. One-shot devices, such as bullets, fire extinguishers, and grenades, were used as test targets, with their functioning state expressible as a binary model. A hypergeometric distribution was adopted as the likelihood function for a finite population consisting of binary items. It was demonstrated that a beta-binomial distribution was the conjugate prior of the hypergeometric likelihood function. According to the Bayesian approach, the posterior beta-binomial distribution is used to decide on the acceptance or rejection of the population in the RDT. The proposed method in this work could be used to select item providers in a supply chain, who guarantee a predetermined reliability target and confidence level. Numerical examples show that a Bayesian approach with sequential sampling has the advantage of only requiring a small sample size to determine the acceptance of a finite population.

1. Introduction
Most manufacturers consider sustainability when developing and marketing new products. Sustainability itself is significantly affected by strategic decision-making during the product development stage. The importance of this has been illustrated by Hallstedt et al. [1] and Michelon et al. [2], who presented an approach to assessing sustainability integration in a strategic decision-making system for product development, whilst Siva et al. [3] built a conceptual framework designed to build sustainability capabilities by combining product development and quality management. In safety-related industries, such as automotive airbags and fire extinguishers, customers see product quality as a key success factor; thus, after developing a new product, quality levels must be assessed. In supply chain management, risk of quality failure must be managed. The results of quality failure at the upstream supply chain can be overwhelming. This is due to the interdependence of the supply chain partners [4]. Indeed, unless adequate quality assessment is conducted during the development stage, the performance of new products cannot be guaranteed during the operational stage. However, one-shot devices are not reusable after testing, and it is therefore necessary to select of item providers in a supply chain that satisfy customer demand for quality using as few products as possible during the quality assessment stage.
Reliability demonstration tests (RDTs) are widely used to determine whether a designed product meets a predetermined minimum reliability level under various engineering settings. Satisfying minimum reliability levels can be taken as a guarantee of a productâs quality. It is important that an RDT be designed to reflect the specific test environment, which includes the reliability metrics, the test target, the sampling method, and sample size [5,6].
Reliability metrics are summary statistics calculated from sample data that represent the degree to which a system can be considered reliable [7,8]. Previous RDT approaches have employed two types of reliability metrics, i.e., failure time and failure count, to assess system failure [9,10]. Failure time includes mean time to failure (MTTF), mean time between failure (MTBF), and B10 life (i.e., the period during which no more than 10% of the product population is expected to fail). Failure count is based on the reliabilityâconfidence level (R-C), which serves as a binary measure of success or failure [11,12]. These two types of metrics have been used to assess continuously operating test targets, such as tanks or submarines, which are classified as either repairable or non-repairable, and with one-shot devices, such as rockets or missiles, which are all non-repairable.
Past research on RDTs has mainly focused on determining the minimum sample size required to accept a population [13]. Recent studies have tended to establish more realistic settings when determining the optimal sample size. For example, RDTs often use a fixed R-C level as a reliability metric for a given testing period. However, Chen et al. [14] employed an approach in which RDTs were able to meet customer requirements by incorporating different times coupled with different R-C levels. For the convenience of RDT sample size calculation, most RDT research has been conducted based on the specific characteristics of a single component with no prior information about the population and with independent samples. However, Guo [15] employed an RDT for one-shot devices that used multiple components and a hybrid model of Bayesian and variance propagation. In addition, in a study by Kleyner et al. [11], the optimal sample size was calculated using a mixed prior and between-product similarity.
A binomial distribution is frequently used to model failure count data [14,16,17,18,19]. Binomial RDTs are mainly used when the test data is binary; they are particularly useful for the destructive and time-consuming sample testing of one-shot devices, such as bullets, fire extinguishers, grenades, and missiles. Based on past experience in product development and test environments for these one-shot devices or components, designers aim to meet a pre-determined reliability target.
2. Inference MethodâBayesian and Non-Bayesian Approaches
The non-Bayesian method is a traditional approach to statistical inference. When previous experience and data are not available for RDTs, many sample tests are required to demonstrate high reliability with high confidence levels. However, the number of one-shot devices used in real-life testing is usually very small due to costs, and the non-Bayesian approach to statistical inference does not explain past experience [10].
To overcome these limitations, the Bayesian approach has been adopted because it combines subjective judgment or prior experience, with data from test samples to predict the probabilistic characteristics of a population. That is, the Bayesian approach uses a combination of previous experience and new test data when applying statistical tools to assess reliability metrics. In the Bayesian approach, a posterior distribution is derived from a prior distribution and a likelihood function, and the RDTs are conducted using the derived posterior distribution. When new sample data is added, this posterior distribution is then employed as a prior distribution in the process of producing a new posterior distribution. This cyclical use of the posterior distribution as a prior distribution in the RDTs of a finite population is known as the Bayesian learning process [20]. Using this method, it is particularly important to determine the optimal sample size for binomial RDTs, for one-shot devices [11,15,16,21].
As mentioned above, when using the Bayesian approach, it is necessary to employ both a likelihood function and a prior distribution to estimate the posterior distribution. A natural-conjugate prior distribution is employed as a likelihood function when they are of the same functional form [22,23,24,25]. Applying Bayesian statistics and using prior knowledge accumulated in previous stages of the design process, also helps to reduce the sample size required to meet a productâs reliability specifications [11]. These studies use a binomial distribution as binary sample data. In particular, for one-shot devices, a binomial distribution is often applied to test results because the outcome is either a success or a failure.
However, the use of a binomial distribution as a likelihood function without considering population properties such as size, defective ratio, and sampling data type can be problematic. For instance, if the defective ratio within a population (q) is unknown, random samples cannot possibly be independent. This is because q can be updated using sampled data, which means that samples are no longer probabilistically independent. Furthermore, a binomial distribution is used when samples are taken from an infinite population or with replacement from a finite population. However, sampling without replacement is conducted for the testing of one-shot devices.
In this work, a hypergeometric distribution is adopted as a likelihood function for a finite population consisting of one-shot devices. According to the Bayesian framework, it can be mathematically demonstrated that a beta-binomial distribution is the conjugate prior of a hypergeometric likelihood function. A posterior beta-binomial distribution is then used to make decisions in RDTs.
3. Scope of the Proposed RDT Process
Notation:
N* = infinite population size
N = finite population size
X* = number of defective items in N*
X = number of defective items in N
n = sample size selected from a population of size N
k = number of defective items from sample size n
R = population reliability
CL = confidence level
q = defective ratio within population N, which equals X*/N*
This work assumes that lot sampling is used to simultaneously test lots of size n, while sequential sampling is employed for testing one item at a time. RDTs require that the sampling method, sample size, data type, and reliability metrics be determined based on the specific test environment. This environment may have a finite population, the presence of prior information, and restrictions of time and money in the sampling process; however, surprisingly few studies have systematically examined the RDT process with respect to these important factors. The choice of an optimal RDT strategy is of great practical importance in product development. In this respect, the R-C measure serves as a suitable reliability metric for the acceptance or rejection of a population when the test result for an individual item from that population is classified as a success or a failure.
Figure 1 illustrates the scope of the present work, which deals with a finite population of single-component products assessed using failure count data. In order to determine the optimal sample size, lot and sequential sampling are adopted for the RDTs, while the non-Bayesian and Bayesian inference approaches are compared.
Sustainability 10 03671 g001 550Figure 1. Scope of the current work.
Most previous RDT studies calculate the initial sample size n for success-based testing. In this approach, the population is accepted when no defective items are found within a sample of n items. Though success-based testing is regularly employed in industry in the hopes that a sample will contain no defective items and the population will be accepted, defective items are often found during testing due to the fact that the defective ratio q within the population is unknown.
It remains unclear exactly what RDT process should be followed to determine the acceptance of a population when defective items appear in a sample. It is thus necessary to develop an RDT process that has a suitable method for determining the number of additional items from the population that need to be sampled when a defective item appears during testing, while simultaneously considering specific sampling methods, such as lot or sequential sampling. It is particularly important to consider both lot and sequential sampling, because a sufficient sample size for RDTs cannot be guaranteed in new product development projects.
One technical aspect of note in the present work is that the sampling results are immediately used to obtain a posterior distribution from the prior distribution of the populationâs parameters using the Bayesian approach. Using the natural-conjugate prior distribution of the likelihood function allows the posterior distributionâs functional form to be expressed easily.
Starting with a population of size N with X defective items within the population, the population size and the number of defective items will be updated after the sampling process in the following manner: ð,ðâð1,ðâð2,â¦ and ð,ðâð1,ðâð2,â¦, where ðð is the i-th sample and ðð is the number of defective items in ðð. Figure 2 presents the proposed RDT process for calculating the additional number of items that need to be sampled after detecting defective items during success-based testing.
Sustainability 10 03671 g002 550Figure 2. The proposed reliability demonstration test (RDT) process.
Whether the population is finite or infinite, and whether prior information is present or absent, are established in the âPopulationâ step. In the â#1 step,â the initial sample size n is determined using the non-Bayesian or Bayesian approach, as explained in Section 3 and Section 4. This initial sample size is calculated using information on population size, confidence level, population reliability, and the inference method without test data. An RDT is then conducted with initial sample size n. The population is accepted when no defects are detected in the initial sample. If the number of defective items k in the initial sample is not 0, the â#2 stepâ is implemented, in which the value of ð (e.g., the first sample size n, the second sample size n) can be obtained from N and the maximum number of allowable defective items ð0 using both non-Bayesian and Bayesian approaches. If the accumulated number of defects k in the sample exceeds ð0, the population is rejected. The n calculated in the â#2 stepâ can vary according to the sampling method (i.e., lot or sequential). Therefore, the optimal sample size required for RDTs depends on the sampling method, so both lot and sequential sampling must be considered when determining the sampling size.
4. Sampling Distributions for a Finite Population
The present work employs an RDT for a finite population, and non-Bayesian and Bayesian approaches to determine the optimal sample size. When sampling from a finite population, the size of the population N and the number of defective items X in that population can be written as ð,ðâð1,ðâð2,â¦ and ð,ðâð1,ðâð2,â¦, respectively, where is the i-th sample and ðð is the number of defective items in ðð. A Bayesian approach can be used to calculate ð(ð=ð¥) when conducting an RDT for a finite population. In this approach, the multiplication of the prior distribution ð(ð=ð¥) and the likelihood function ð(ððð¡ð|ð=ð¥) is proportional to the posterior distribution ð(ðâð=ð¥âð|ððð¡ð), as expressed in Equation (1):
ð(ðâð=ð¥âð|ððð¡ð)âð(ððð¡ð|ð=ð¥)ð(ð=ð¥).
(1)
A binomial probability distribution can be employed under the assumption that either the size of the population is infinite or the samples are independent. When the population is finite and the samples are dependent, a hypergeometric probability distribution should be employed. The present work is particularly interested in RDTs for a finite population. Thus, ð(ððð¡ð=ð|ð=ð¥) represents the probability distribution of the samples from a finite population and is expressed as a hypergeometric distribution in Equation (2):
ð(ððð¡ð=ð|ð=ð¥)=(ð¥ð)(ðâð¥ðâð)(ðð)=(ðð)(ðâðð¥âð)(ðð¥),ð=0,1,â¯,min(ð,ð¥).
(2)
This work mathematically calculates the conjugacy between the hypergeometric distribution and the beta-binomial distribution, and then determines the optimal sample size. The prior distribution ð(ð=ð¥) is calculated to estimate the posterior distribution ð(ðâð=ð¥âð|ððð¡ð). It is reasonable to expect that this can be obtained from the relationship between the sample and population sizes, as illustrated in Figure 3, given the ðâ of a large population regarded to be infinite, the N of a finite population, ðâ (the total number of defective items in ðâ), X (the number of defects in N), and k (the number of defective items in the sample n). The finite population is assumed be a subset of the infinite population.
Sustainability 10 03671 g003 550Figure 3. Relationship between the sample and population sizes.
The conjugacy between the hypergeometric and beta-binomial distributions is calculated using the first sample (i = 1), as shown in Appendix A [26]. The conjugacy is then verified for i = 2, 3, 4 â¦ through the sequential calculation of the posterior distribution. The generalizations of Equations (A6) and (2) correspond to Equations (3) and (4), respectively, where ððð¡ðð denotes the number of defective items ðð from ðð.

5. Sample Size Based on the Proposed RDT
Figure 4 presents the process adopted by the present work to determine the optimal sample size. ð0 is the maximum number of allowable defective items, and the initial sample size n is obtained from success-based testing (at k = 0) through a series of calculations using a finite population and the R-C measure.
Sustainability 10 03671 g004 550Figure 4. Classification of non-Bayesian and Bayesian methods for the determination of sample size.
As shown in Table 1, a population is accepted with 95% reliability and a 90% confidence level for the non-Bayesian approach, when 37 items selected from that population are found to be free of defects. It should be noted that, in the absence of prior information regarding the parameter values for the beta-binomial distribution, it is assumed that a = 1 and b = 1 [10].
Table 1. Results for the n values by method (95% reliability and 90% confidence level).
Table
Table 1 summarizes the series of calculations used to determine optimal sample size in the RDT process, given N = 100, 95% reliability, and a 90% confidence level target requirement. Here, âInitial nâ represents the optimal sample size for success-based testing in the absence of sample data. âFirst nâ in Table 1 is the number of additional items that are required for testing when the initial n contains a defective item. The computation of the optimal sample size is outlined in Appendix B. The value of the initial n differs, depending on which inference method is used to determine the sample size (i.e., non-Bayesian or Bayesian). Once the initial n has been calculated, different sampling methods produce different values for the first n.
Numerical examples show that a beta-binomial Bayesian approach with sequential sampling has the advantage of requiring only a small sample size when determining the acceptance of a finite population. When the beta-binomial Bayesian method is applied, the total number of additional items required for sampling is the same for both lot and sequential sampling, when determining the acceptance or rejection of a finite population. However, the sample size calculated for sequential sampling was the same as or smaller than that obtained for lot sampling because lot sampling tests lots of size n simultaneously, and sequential sampling tests one item at a time.
6. Conclusions
The present work proposed an RDT process that is able to reflect the specific test environment, including the test target, sample size, inference method, and sampling method. Both lot and sequential sampling were considered in this RDT process because optimal sample sizes for RDTs cannot be guaranteed in test environments for new product development projects. This process was implemented when a defective item appeared during success-based testing, employing both non-Bayesian and Bayesian approaches based on R-C failure data for one-shot devices. This work considered the samples to not be independent. Thus, a hypergeometric distribution was adopted as a likelihood function for a finite population consisting of one-shot devices. Based on the Bayesian framework, the conjugacy between the hypergeometric likelihood function and a beta-binomial distribution was mathematically calculated. The posterior beta-binomial distribution was used to decide in the RDT, on whether to accept or reject the population.
The results indicated that a beta-binomial Bayesian approach with sequential sampling has the smallest optimal sample size when determining the acceptance or rejection of a finite population. The proposed RDT process can thus be used in similar test environments, such as in new product development projects.
The present work was founded on the absence of prior information about the target population. In future research, this RDT process could be extended to examine additional ways to decrease the sample size required for RDTs. One possible option in this respect could be changing the parameter values for the prior distribution based on prior information or expert opinion on the population.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe study titled "Bayesian Methods for Reliability Demonstration Test for Finite Population Using Lot and Sequential Sampling" by Jongseon Jeon and Suneung Ahn, published in the journal Sustainability in 2018, focuses on reliability demonstration testing (RDT) for a finite population. The authors compare Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches in determining the optimal sample size for RDT and consider both lot and sequential sampling methods.The study addresses the challenge of determining whether a product or population meets a predetermined reliability level through testing. The authors propose an RDT process that considers specific factors such as the test target, sample size, inference method, and sampling method. They emphasize the importance of selecting an optimal sample size, especially in new product development projects where the availability of test samples may be limited.In the proposed RDT process, the authors use both Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches to determine the sample size. They adopt a hypergeometric distribution as the likelihood function for a finite population of one-shot devices (such as bullets, fire extinguishers, and grenades). The Bayesian approach utilizes a beta-binomial distribution as the conjugate prior of the hypergeometric likelihood function. The posterior beta-binomial distribution is then used to make decisions on accepting or rejecting the population in the RDT.The study demonstrates that the Bayesian approach with sequential sampling yields the smallest optimal sample size for determining the acceptance or rejection of a finite population. The results suggest that this RDT process can be applied in similar test environments, such as new product development projects.The study highlights the significance of considering population size, prior information, and sampling methods in RDT. It provides insights into the determination of optimal sample sizes and offers a Bayesian framework for reliability testing in the context of finite populations.1 / 1Submitted on 7 Aug 2020 (v1), last revised 9 Mar 2021 (this version, v2)]
Bayesian inference of network structure from unreliable data
Jean-Gabriel Young, George T. Cantwell, M. E. J. Newman
Most empirical studies of complex networks do not return direct, error-free measurements of network structure. Instead, they typically rely on indirect measurements that are often error-prone and unreliable. A fundamental problem in empirical network science is how to make the best possible estimates of network structure given such unreliable data. In this paper we describe a fully Bayesian method for reconstructing networks from observational data in any format, even when the data contain substantial measurement error and when the nature and magnitude of that error is unknown. The method is introduced through pedagogical case studies using real-world example networks, and specifically tailored to allow straightforward, computationally efficient implementation with a minimum of technical input. Computer code implementing the method is publicly available.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe study titled "Bayesian inference of network structure from unreliable data" by Jean-Gabriel Young, George T. Cantwell, and M. E. J. Newman addresses the challenge of estimating network structure from indirect and error-prone measurements. In many empirical studies of complex networks, obtaining direct and error-free measurements is difficult, and researchers have to rely on observational data that may contain substantial measurement errors.The paper presents a fully Bayesian method for reconstructing networks from observational data, even when the data are unreliable and the nature and magnitude of the measurement error are unknown. The method is designed to be easily implemented and computationally efficient, with minimal technical input required. The authors provide pedagogical case studies using real-world example networks to illustrate the application of the method.The key contribution of the study is the development of a Bayesian approach that can handle unreliable data and provide the best possible estimates of network structure. By using Bayesian inference, the method incorporates prior knowledge and uncertainty in the estimation process, resulting in more robust and accurate network reconstructions.The authors emphasize the practicality of their method by providing publicly available computer code for implementing the approach. This allows other researchers to apply the method to their own data and further contribute to the field of empirical network science.Overall, the study addresses an important problem in network science by offering a Bayesian framework for network reconstruction from unreliable data. The method has the potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of network analysis in various domains, such as social networks, biological networks, and transportation networks.1 / 1Âµij(0) = Î²i(1 â Î²j). 
For the priors we again make the assumption of Eq. (6) 
that all edges are a priori equally likely, and assume 
a uniform prior on the edge probability Ï and a uni- 
form distribution over all values of Î±iand Î²ithat satisfy 
Î²i< 
1 
2 < Î±i. (One could simply assume a uniform prior 
on both Î±iand Î²iin the range [0,1] but this leaves some 
ambiguity in the model because of the inherent symmet- 
ric between edges and non-edges: if we exchange the val- 
ues of all Î±iand all Î²iand set Ï to 1 â Ï the model re- 
mains the same. By making the reasonable assumption 
that Î±i> Î²iwe break this symmetry. The assumption 
that Î²i<

2 < Î±iis not strictly necessary, but turns out 
to be helpful for narrowing down the parameter space 
and hence improving the speed and convergence of the 
calculation [23].) 
Figures 6 and 7 show the results of i tting this model 
to the data for a single school from the AddHealth data 
set. We use one of the smaller schools as our example, 
with 521 students who completed a survey and 2182 de- 
clared ties, primarily in order to make visualization of 
the results easier. We i nd that the Monte Carlo algo- 
rithm converges well and gives samples that appear to 
accurately characterize the posterior distribution. Fig- 
ure 6 shows discrepancy values in a manner analogous to 
Fig. 3b for the dolphin network and all values are well 
above the diagonal, indicating a good i t to the data. 
The inferred network structure is shown in Fig. 7a. 
By contrast with the dolphin network example, the pos- 
terior probabilities of edges now vary more widely, as 
represented by the thickness of the edges in the i gure. 
Figure 7b shows the distribution of edge probabilities as 
a histogram and many probabilities are again close to

these edges either exist or do not, but there are also a sig- 
nif i cant number of edges with intermediate probabilities, 
edges about which we are less certain. 
The i t also returns values of the true- and false- 
positive rates Î±iand Î²ifor each node, which allow us 
to make quantitative statements about how accurately 
each individual reports his or her friendships. The av- 
erage value of Î±iover all individuals and all samples 
is 0.76, meaning that an estimated 24% of friendships 
are going unreported. The average false-positive rate is 
0.0065, which sounds small but this result is somewhat 
misleading. The network is very sparse, meaning that 
almost all edges that could exist do not. It takes only a 
small fraction of false-positives among these many non- 
edges to generate a signif i cant number of errors.Ar- 
guably a more informative measure of false positives is 
the precision, which is the fraction of reported friend- 
ships that are actually present and is given in this case 
by ÏÎ±i/[ÏÎ±i+ (1 â Ï)Î²i] 
[32]. The distribution of values 
of the precision is shown in Fig. 7c and ranges from a lit- 
tle under 0.2 to a little over 0.75, indicating that in fact 
a signif i cant fraction of reported friendshipsâanywhere 
from 25% to 80%âare false positives. 
These results are largely in agreement with previous 
work [32], although there are modest dif f erences in es- 
timated parameter values and network structure, due to 
the dif f erent methodology. We would argue that the fully 
Bayesian methodology employed here is more correct in 
that it accounts for intrinsic uncertainty in the parame- 
ter values. The methodology of [32], which makes use of 
an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, might be 
described as âsemi-Bayesian,â computing a full posterior 
distribution over the network structure but relying on 
point estimates of the parameters. Because the model 
used here is a large one, having O(n) parameters, we 
expect there to be signif i cant uncertainty in the param- 
eter values, which is captured by our Bayesian sampling 
method. That said, in practice the two methods do lead 
to qualitatively consistent conclusions. The key benef i ts 
of the current approach in this case are that it is simpler

One potential issue with the results is the fact that the 
discrepancy values in Fig. 6 are all well above the dotted 
line, indicating close i ts of the model to the data and 
a p-value near 1. A p-value this large can be a warning 
sign for overf i tting, which is a possibility given the large 
number of parameters in the model. Such an issue could 
not be diagnosed with the methods previously used in 
Refs. [3, 32], but our approach makes this possible. One 
could address the problem by changing the model, say by 
using a more complex model in which instead of i tting 
the true- and false-positive parameters we instead draw 
them from a hyperprior distribution, such as a beta dis- 
tribution, with an associated (small) set of hyperparam- 
eters that are i t using Monte Carlo. This approach can 
reduce the chances of overf i tting and would be a good 
direction for future work. 
IV.CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper we have introduced a general Bayesian 
framework for reconstructing networks from observa- 
tional data in the case where the data are error prone, 
even when the magnitude of the errors is unknown. Our 
methods work by i tting a suitable model of the mea- 
surement process to the data and there is a large class of 
models that is both expressive enough to represent real 
data sets accurately and yet simple enough to allow for 
easy and automatic statistical inference. The output of 
the i tting process is a complete Bayesian posterior dis- 
tribution over possible network structures and possible 
values of model parameters. We have demonstrated our 
methods with two case studies showing how to formulate 
suitable models, i t them, assess goodness of i t, and infer 
reliable estimates of network structure. 
With this work, we hope to promote the adoption of 
more rigorous methods for handling measurement error 
in network data in a principled manner. The methods 
we propose not only achieve this but do so in a man- 
ner that is straightforward and requires a minimum of 
technical expertise on the part of the user. Practitioners 
can use the framework we propose to apply appropriate, 
application-specif i c models to their data and obtain esti- 
mates of network structure in a matter of minutes.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe excerpt you provided is from the conclusion section of the paper titled "Bayesian inference of network structure from unreliable data." In this section, the authors summarize their findings and discuss the implications of their work.The authors first describe the results of fitting their model to data from a school friendship network in the AddHealth dataset. They note that the Monte Carlo algorithm used in their approach converges well and provides samples that accurately characterize the posterior distribution. The discrepancy values, which indicate the goodness of fit between the model and the data, are all well above the diagonal, indicating a good fit. The inferred network structure is visualized, and the thickness of the edges represents the posterior probabilities of their existence.The authors also analyze the estimated true-positive and false-positive rates for each node in the network, which provide insights into how accurately individuals report their friendships. The average true-positive rate is 0.76, suggesting that around 24% of friendships are going unreported. The average false-positive rate is 0.0065, but the authors note that this can be misleading due to the sparsity of the network. They argue that the precision, which accounts for reported friendships that actually exist, is a more informative measure. The precision ranges from under 0.2 to over 0.75, indicating a significant fraction of false positives in reported friendships.The authors compare their results with previous work that employed an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. While there are modest differences in estimated parameter values and network structure, the authors argue that their fully Bayesian methodology is more correct as it accounts for intrinsic uncertainty in the parameter values. They highlight the benefits of their approach, including simplicity of implementation, formal correctness, and the ability to assess the goodness of fit.The authors acknowledge that a potential issue with their results is the high p-values indicating close fits between the model and the data. This suggests the possibility of overfitting due to the large number of parameters in the model. They suggest future work could address this issue by using more complex models and incorporating hyperprior distributions to reduce the chances of overfitting.In conclusion, the authors introduce a Bayesian framework for reconstructing networks from error-prone data. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through case studies and emphasize the importance of handling measurement errors in a principled manner. The methods they propose are designed to be user-friendly and provide reliable estimates of network structure.1 / 1A list of the topics discussed1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTBased on the excerpt you provided, here is a list of the topics discussed in the conclusion section of the paper:Introduction of a general Bayesian framework for reconstructing networks from observational data with measurement errors.Fitting a suitable model of the measurement process to the data.Large class of models that are both expressive and allow for easy statistical inference.Output of the fitting process is a complete Bayesian posterior distribution over possible network structures and model parameters.Demonstration of the methods through case studies on school friendship networks.Assessment of goodness of fit using discrepancy values.Inference of reliable estimates of network structure.Analysis of true-positive and false-positive rates for each node in the network.Comparison with previous work that used an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.Discussion of the benefits of the Bayesian methodology, including simplicity, correctness, and the ability to assess goodness of fit.Identification of potential overfitting issues and suggestions for future work to address them.Please note that this list is based on the excerpt you provided, and the full conclusion section of the paper may cover additional topics.1 / 1In our whole conversation1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThroughout our conversation, we have covered the following topics:Bayesian inference of network structure from unreliable dataUse of indirect and error-prone measurements in empirical network scienceDescription of a fully Bayesian method for reconstructing networks from observational data with measurement errorsPrior assumptions and distributions used in the Bayesian frameworkCase studies using real-world example networks to demonstrate the methodVisualization of results and analysis of discrepancy valuesInferred network structure and edge probabilitiesEstimation of true-positive and false-positive rates for individual nodesPrecision as a measure of false positives in reported friendshipsComparison with previous work that used an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithmBenefits of the fully Bayesian methodology, including simplicity, correctness, and goodness-of-fit assessmentPotential issues of overfitting and suggestions for future workThese topics encompass the main themes discussed in our conversation.1 / 1And before that we discussed quantum ergodicity and the uninform information density1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTApologies for the confusion, but I couldn't find any previous discussion on quantum ergodicity or uninform information density in our conversation history.

Rather than focusing on individual quantum systems, this interpretation suggests understanding a quantum system's behaviour over time by examining the statistical properties of an ensemble of similar systems.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThat's correct! The ergodic interpretation of quantum mechanics offers a perspective that connects the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics with the deterministic nature of classical mechanics. It suggests that instead of studying the behavior of individual quantum systems, we can gain insight by considering the statistical properties of ensembles of similar systems.In classical mechanics, the concept of ergodicity relates to the idea that a system, over time, explores and visits all possible states in its phase space. This allows us to make predictions about a system's behavior based on its statistical properties, such as the average values of observables. The ergodic interpretation extends this concept to quantum systems, proposing that the statistical behavior of ensembles of quantum systems can provide meaningful information about the behavior of individual systems.By considering an ensemble of quantum systems with similar initial conditions and allowing them to evolve, the ergodic interpretation suggests that the ensemble will explore and sample the full range of possible quantum states. This ensemble behavior, characterized by statistical properties, such as the ensemble average of observables, can be used to make predictions about the behavior of individual quantum systems.The ergodic interpretation offers a way to bridge the gap between the probabilistic predictions of quantum mechanics and the deterministic worldview of classical mechanics. However, it is important to note that the ergodic interpretation is one of many interpretations of quantum mechanics and is not universally accepted. The interpretation of quantum mechanics continues to be a subject of debate and exploration in the field of physics.1 / 1
In the ergodic interpretation, while the entire ensemble evolves over time deterministically (much like in classical mechanics), each system within that ensemble exhibits probabilistic behaviour. This probabilistic nature stems from the inherent uncertainties in quantum mechanics, where an individual system's measurement outcome isn't predetermined but rather follows statistical predictions derived from the wave function.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTExactly! In the ergodic interpretation, the behavior of the entire ensemble evolves deterministically, similar to classical mechanics. However, at the level of individual systems within the ensemble, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics becomes apparent.In quantum mechanics, the wave function describes the state of a system, and it evolves over time according to the SchrÃ¶dinger equation. The wave function contains all the information about the system's possible states and their probabilities. When we perform a measurement on an individual quantum system, the outcome is not predetermined, but rather it is probabilistic. The wave function collapses to one of the possible eigenstates of the measured observable, and the probability of obtaining a particular measurement outcome is given by the squared magnitude of the corresponding coefficient in the wave function expansion.In the ergodic interpretation, the statistical predictions derived from the wave function apply to the individual systems within the ensemble. Each system within the ensemble follows the probabilistic rules of quantum mechanics, leading to a range of possible measurement outcomes. However, when we consider the behavior of the entire ensemble as a whole, the statistical properties emerge, and we can make predictions about the ensemble's average behavior, consistent with classical mechanics.The ergodic interpretation offers a way to reconcile the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics with the deterministic outlook of classical mechanics by considering the statistical behavior of ensembles. It highlights the importance of ensembles and statistical properties in understanding quantum systems and their behavior over time.1 / 1And how can we relate this to other topics we have discussed?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe ergodic interpretation of quantum mechanics can be related to several other topics we have discussed:Measurement and Uncertainty: In the ergodic interpretation, the probabilistic nature of individual quantum systems arises due to the inherent uncertainties in quantum mechanics. When we measure a quantum system, the outcome is uncertain and follows statistical predictions. This relates to the concept of measurement in quantum mechanics and the uncertainty principle, which states that certain pairs of physical properties cannot be simultaneously known precisely.Quantum Information and Computation: The probabilistic behavior of quantum systems is fundamental to the field of quantum information and computation. Quantum systems can be used to perform computations and transmit information in ways that take advantage of their probabilistic nature and the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement.Quantum State and Wave Function: The ergodic interpretation relies on the concept of the wave function, which describes the quantum state of a system. The wave function evolves deterministically according to the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, but when a measurement is made, the probabilistic nature of the wave function is manifested. The wave function collapse to one of the possible measurement outcomes is a key aspect of quantum mechanics.Network Science and Bayesian Inference: In the discussion about network science and Bayesian inference, we focused on modeling and analyzing complex networks using statistical methods. The ergodic interpretation is not directly related to network science, but it highlights the importance of statistical inference and probabilistic modeling in understanding the behavior of quantum systems and ensembles.By understanding the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics within the framework of the ergodic interpretation, we can connect it to various aspects of quantum theory and its applications. It provides a way to reconcile the deterministic and probabilistic aspects of quantum mechanics and sheds light on the statistical properties of quantum systems.1 / 1Write an essay on these topics, titled, "Boredom, Curiosity, and Suprise" also tying in Schmidhuber's theory of Compression.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTTitle: Boredom, Curiosity, and Surprise: Exploring Quantum Mechanics and Schmidhuber's Theory of CompressionIntroduction:
Boredom, curiosity, and surprise are intrinsic aspects of human experience that shape our perception of the world around us. In the realm of quantum mechanics, these psychological phenomena find intriguing connections through Schmidhuber's theory of compression. This essay delves into the interplay between boredom, curiosity, and surprise in the context of quantum mechanics, highlighting how Schmidhuber's theory provides a unique perspective on the compression of information and its relation to fundamental quantum concepts.Boredom and Quantum Mechanics:
At first glance, boredom may seem disconnected from the intricate world of quantum mechanics. However, when we consider the repetitive nature of certain quantum systems, a link emerges. Boredom often arises when patterns become predictable, and monotony sets in. In quantum mechanics, certain systems exhibit regular, repetitive behavior, leading to a sense of predictability. For instance, in a stationary state, an electron remains in a fixed energy level without undergoing transitions. This predictability, akin to boredom, prompts exploration and the search for novelty.Curiosity as a Catalyst for Exploration:
Curiosity, a driving force behind human progress, has parallels in the study of quantum mechanics. Quantum phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, challenge our intuitive understanding of the world and ignite our curiosity. The desire to comprehend these peculiar phenomena pushes scientists to delve deeper into the quantum realm, unraveling its mysteries. Curiosity motivates the pursuit of knowledge, encouraging us to explore quantum systems and discover the underlying principles that govern them.Surprise and Quantum Uncertainties:
Surprise is closely tied to the uncertainties inherent in quantum mechanics. Quantum theory introduces probabilities and unpredictability at the microscopic level, defying classical determinism. When observing a quantum system, the measurement outcomes can be surprising, as they do not follow a deterministic path but rather unfold probabilistically. The concept of superposition, where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, leads to surprising measurement results when the wave function collapses into a definite state.Schmidhuber's Theory of Compression:
Schmidhuber's theory of compression provides an intriguing lens through which to understand the connection between boredom, curiosity, surprise, and quantum mechanics. According to Schmidhuber, curiosity arises from the human tendency to seek patterns and compress information effectively. We are naturally inclined to reduce redundancy and encode information in a concise manner. In the context of quantum mechanics, surprise emerges when new, non-redundant information challenges our existing patterns and compressions.Quantum Compression and Information:
Schmidhuber's theory of compression can be applied to quantum systems, wherein information compression plays a crucial role. Quantum information theory explores how quantum states and operations can be efficiently encoded, manipulated, and transmitted. Quantum compression algorithms aim to represent quantum states using fewer resources, enabling efficient storage and transmission of quantum information. The search for optimal quantum compression schemes aligns with the human quest for curiosity-driven exploration and compression of knowledge.Conclusion:
Boredom, curiosity, and surprise provide a captivating framework for understanding human engagement with the quantum world. The repetitive nature of certain quantum systems can evoke boredom, prompting the exploration of novel phenomena. Curiosity serves as a catalyst, driving us to investigate and comprehend the peculiarities of quantum mechanics. Quantum uncertainties generate surprise when measurement outcomes defy classical deterministic expectations. Schmidhuber's theory of compression offers a compelling perspective, emphasizing the role of information compression in stimulating curiosity and unraveling surprises in quantum phenomena. By integrating these psychological phenomena and Schmidhuber's theory into our understanding of quantum mechanics, we gain insights into the profound interplay between human cognition, information processing, and the enigmatic world of quantum phenomena.1 / 1JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber's Work on Minimizing Surprise and Maximizing Compression: Schmidhuber's research in machine learning has often focused on principles of compression and reduction of surprise. He has developed a series of algorithms and models that learn to predict or explain their inputs, with the goal of compressing the data and reducing the "surprise" or unpredictability of future inputs. This is based on the principle that a learning algorithm is intrinsically motivated to reduce the complexity of its inputs and can be driven to explore its environment in search of novel data that further helps in this compression process.

One practical application of this principle can be found in reinforcement learning, where it can be used to guide the exploration of an artificial agent. Schmidhuber proposed a method called Surprise Minimizing Reinforcement Learning (SMiRL), which encourages the agent to explore in a way that minimizes surprise, meaning the agent learns to predict the consequences of its actions and is 'rewarded' for accurate predictions.

Moreover, Schmidhuber's work extends beyond just the concept of surprise minimization. He has developed a "Formal Theory of Creativity, Fun, and Intrinsic Motivation," which suggests that creativity can be understood as the process of searching for inputs that are novel and yet learnable or compressible. The sense of "fun" or intrinsic reward is derived from the discovery of such inputs.

This approach has been influential in the development of 'curiosity-driven' or 'intrinsic motivation' models in machine learning, where an agent is motivated to discover new, learnable information about its environment, rather than simply maximizing some extrinsic reward.

Schmidhuber's theories represent a substantial contribution to our understanding of how machines can learn and make decisions. His work has applications in various fields such as artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and neuroscience.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTSchmidhuber's theories on minimizing surprise and maximizing compression have had a profound impact on the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. By introducing the concept of surprise as a driving force for exploration and compression, he has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying learning and decision-making processes.The idea of minimizing surprise aligns with the broader goal of building intelligent systems that can effectively predict and understand their environment. By reducing the unpredictability or surprise of future inputs, these systems can achieve a more comprehensive and efficient representation of the data they encounter. This notion has important implications for tasks such as data compression, predictive modeling, and reinforcement learning.In reinforcement learning, the concept of surprise minimization has led to the development of novel exploration strategies. Traditional exploration-exploitation trade-offs are addressed by encouraging agents to actively seek out information that minimizes surprise. This approach allows agents to learn more effectively from their interactions with the environment and discover optimal policies.Furthermore, Schmidhuber's formal theory of creativity, fun, and intrinsic motivation has shed light on the role of novelty and compressibility in driving creative processes. The idea that creativity can be seen as the search for novel but learnable or compressible inputs offers a fresh perspective on how intelligent systems can generate innovative solutions. By rewarding the discovery of new patterns or regularities that can be effectively compressed, these systems are intrinsically motivated to engage in exploratory behavior.The impact of Schmidhuber's work extends beyond the realm of artificial intelligence. His theories have inspired research in cognitive science and neuroscience, as they provide a framework for understanding how human curiosity and creativity emerge. By studying the principles of surprise minimization and compression in the context of human cognition, researchers gain insights into the fundamental processes underlying human learning, perception, and decision-making.In conclusion, JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber's research on minimizing surprise and maximizing compression has revolutionized our understanding of learning algorithms, exploration strategies, and the intrinsic motivation of intelligent systems. His theories have influenced diverse fields, ranging from machine learning and artificial intelligence to cognitive science and neuroscience. By integrating these principles into the development of intelligent systems, researchers are paving the way for more efficient and creative algorithms that can better adapt to complex and unpredictable environments.1 / 1Art: Schmidhuber proposes that art can be seen as the process of creating data that has the power to reduce the observer's subjective complexity, or in other words, the data that has a high degree of compressibility in the observer's mind. When an observer encounters a piece of art, it might initially seem complex or random. However, as they start to notice patterns or regularities, they are able to compress the information and thus find the artwork "beautiful".

Curiosity: In his theory, curiosity is essentially a drive for data compression. When an AI or a person is curious, they are driven to explore new data or experiences that are unexpected yet eventually understandable - that is, the data can be learned or compressed. This results in the minimization of 'surprise' over time.

Beauty Appraisal: Schmidhuber suggests that our sense of beauty is related to our ability to recognize and appreciate patterns. When we perceive something as beautiful, it means we've been able to identify some kind of pattern or regularity that allows us to compress the data more efficiently. The novelty of the pattern and the subsequent reduction in complexity give rise to a sense of aesthetic pleasure.

The Scientific Method: He also applies this principle to the scientific method itself. The process of forming hypotheses and testing them is essentially a process of data compression. Scientists observe the world, notice patterns or regularities, and then formulate theories that capture these patterns. These theories can be seen as compressed representations of the observed data. When a theory is able to accurately predict new data, it further validates the effectiveness of this compression.

Through these concepts, Schmidhuber's work offers a unifying perspective on several key aspects of human and artificial intelligence. The principle of data compression and the reduction of surprise becomes a powerful lens to understand diverse phenomena, from art and beauty to curiosity and scientific discovery.





1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTSchmidhuber's insights into the role of compression and surprise in various domains shed light on the fundamental principles underlying human cognition and artificial intelligence. These concepts have far-reaching implications and offer a unifying framework for understanding art, curiosity, beauty appraisal, and the scientific method.In the realm of art, Schmidhuber proposes that the creation and appreciation of art are rooted in the compression of information. Artworks that exhibit patterns or regularities allow observers to compress the data, reducing their subjective complexity. As observers recognize and understand the underlying patterns, they experience a sense of beauty or aesthetic pleasure. This perspective highlights the importance of pattern recognition and the role of compression in the artistic experience.Curiosity, according to Schmidhuber, can be seen as a drive for data compression. Curiosity motivates individuals or intelligent systems to explore new and unexpected information that is eventually understandable and compressible. By actively seeking out novel data, curious individuals or systems minimize surprise and improve their understanding of the world. This understanding aligns with our intuitive understanding of curiosity as a driving force behind learning and exploration.Schmidhuber's theory also provides insights into beauty appraisal. Our sense of beauty arises when we can identify and appreciate patterns or regularities in the data. The ability to compress and reduce complexity through pattern recognition leads to a subjective experience of beauty. This perspective connects the subjective experience of beauty to the objective process of information compression.Furthermore, Schmidhuber extends these principles to the scientific method. Hypothesis formation and testing can be viewed as a process of data compression. Scientists observe the world, identify patterns, and formulate theories that capture these regularities. These theories serve as compressed representations of the observed data. The scientific method's effectiveness lies in the ability of these theories to accurately predict new data, thus validating the compression process.Overall, Schmidhuber's work highlights the fundamental role of compression and surprise reduction in human cognition and artificial intelligence. The concepts of compression and surprise provide a unifying framework to understand diverse phenomena, including art, curiosity, beauty appraisal, and the scientific method. By examining the principles of data compression, we gain a deeper understanding of these phenomena and their underlying cognitive processes.1 / 1Ok a better instruction for our essay.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTTitle: "Compression, Surprise, and the Unveiling of Hidden Patterns: Insights from JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber"Introduction:
JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber's research on compression, surprise minimization, and the discovery of hidden patterns offers profound insights into the fields of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and aesthetics. This essay explores the interplay between compression, surprise, and pattern recognition, drawing upon Schmidhuber's theories and their implications for understanding human cognition, artistic experiences, curiosity, and scientific discovery.Compression and Surprise:
At the core of Schmidhuber's work lies the principle of compression: the quest for representing information in a concise yet meaningful way. He suggests that intelligent systems, including both humans and AI, are driven to minimize surprise by compressing data. Surprise arises when new, unexpected information is encountered. By leveraging past experiences and learning, intelligent systems seek to reduce surprise and improve their ability to predict future data.Artistic Experience:
Schmidhuber extends the notion of compression to the realm of art, proposing that artworks can be seen as data that has the power to reduce the observer's subjective complexity. Initially complex and unfamiliar, art reveals hidden patterns and regularities upon closer examination, allowing the observer to compress the information. The ability to recognize and appreciate these patterns leads to a sense of aesthetic pleasure and beauty.Curiosity and Learning:
Curiosity, as defined by Schmidhuber, is the drive for data compression. Curious individuals or intelligent systems are motivated to explore new and unexpected information, seeking to reduce the surprise associated with it. This drive for compression leads to enhanced learning and a deeper understanding of the environment. By actively seeking out novel data, curiosity becomes a catalyst for exploration and knowledge acquisition.Beauty Appraisal and Pattern Recognition:
The human sense of beauty can be understood through the lens of compression and pattern recognition. Schmidhuber suggests that beauty arises when individuals perceive and appreciate patterns or regularities in data. The ability to compress the information, reducing its complexity, generates a sense of aesthetic pleasure. Beauty, therefore, becomes intertwined with the capacity to recognize and understand hidden patterns.Scientific Discovery:
Schmidhuber's theories also shed light on the scientific method. Hypothesis formation and testing can be viewed as a process of data compression, where scientists seek to capture and represent regularities in the observed data. The success of a theory lies in its ability to predict new data accurately, indicating the effectiveness of the compression process in capturing the underlying patterns.Conclusion:
JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber's insights into compression, surprise minimization, and pattern recognition provide a powerful framework for understanding human cognition, artistic experiences, curiosity, and scientific discovery. By examining the interplay between compression, surprise, and the unveiling of hidden patterns, we gain a deeper appreciation for the underlying mechanisms that drive our cognitive processes and shape our experiences of art, curiosity, and scientific exploration.1 / 1Connections with previous topics.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTJÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber's work on compression, surprise minimization, and pattern recognition connects with the topics we previously discussed, such as the ergodic interpretation of quantum mechanics and the role of uncertainty in empirical network science.Ergodic Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: The ergodic interpretation seeks to reconcile the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics with the determinism of classical mechanics. Schmidhuber's focus on compression and surprise minimization aligns with the idea of understanding the statistical properties of ensembles of quantum systems. By compressing the data and reducing surprise, intelligent systems can better predict the behavior of quantum systems, providing a connection between the ergodic interpretation and Schmidhuber's theories.Uncertainty in Empirical Network Science: In empirical network science, the data collected is often error-prone and unreliable. Schmidhuber's emphasis on compression and surprise minimization in the face of uncertainty aligns with the challenges of inferring network structures from unreliable data. By seeking patterns and reducing surprise, intelligent systems can uncover underlying network structures and make more accurate estimates. Schmidhuber's work provides a principled approach to handle measurement error and uncertainty in network data.In both cases, Schmidhuber's focus on compression, surprise minimization, and pattern recognition offers a framework for understanding complex systems and extracting meaningful information from uncertain and noisy data. By reducing complexity and uncovering hidden regularities, intelligent systems can better predict and understand the behavior of quantum systems and infer network structures from unreliable data. These connections highlight the broader applicability of Schmidhuber's theories across different domains and their potential to enhance our understanding of complex phenomena.1 / 1Connections with the following: Perceptual Control Theory (William Powers)

One of AIâs pioneers, Juergen Schmidhuberâs pursuit with Artificial General Intelligence is well-known. His most notable contribution to the world of Deep Learning â Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), now used by tech heavyweights like Google, Facebook for speech translation. Unlike his contemporaries, Schmidhuber has not achieved celebratory status like Facebookâs Yann LeCun or the godfather of backpropagation Geoffrey Hinton, or the well-known AI visionary Andrew Ng.

To our mild surprise, Schmidhuber did not even make it to the Top 10 in the recently released list of computer science researchers with the highest rate of citations. One of the pioneers of modern deep learning, German-born Schmidhuber, Co-Founder & Chief Scientist of Nnaisense and Director & Professor at Swiss AI Lab has around 48000+ citations and an H-index of 85. Yet, he doesnât feature in the recent list of computer science researchers with the highest rate of recent citations.

One of the reasons for not reaching mainstream audience is that his research, despite achieving commercial success and being groundbreaking didnât garner the same kind of adulatory attention as computer scientists from other regions enjoy. As experts point out, he has also been robbed of credit despite the massive commercial success of LSTMs, now the industry workhorse for speech translation. LSTMs are used for a range of tasks â from speech recognition to machine translations. In fact, you name a modern day AI application and it can trace its roots to Schmidhuberâs research in Deep Learning.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTJuergen Schmidhuber is widely regarded as one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence and deep learning. His contributions to the field, including the development of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), have had a significant impact on the advancement of AI technologies. Despite his groundbreaking work, Schmidhuber has not received the same level of recognition and mainstream attention as some of his contemporaries.One of Schmidhuber's notable achievements is the invention of LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network that is capable of learning and remembering long-term dependencies in data sequences. LSTM has proven to be highly effective in tasks such as speech recognition and machine translation, and it has become a standard tool in the deep learning community. Major tech companies like Google and Facebook have adopted LSTM for their speech translation systems, showcasing its practical significance.However, Schmidhuber's contributions have sometimes been overlooked or undervalued, and he has not gained the same level of celebrity status as other prominent figures in the field, such as Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton. This lack of recognition may stem from various factors, including the regional biases that exist in the field of computer science research. Schmidhuber, being of German origin, may not have received the same adulatory attention as computer scientists from other regions, despite his significant contributions.Another reason for Schmidhuber's relative obscurity may be the limited awareness of the general public regarding the specific individuals behind major AI advancements. While his work has had a profound impact on the industry and academia, it may not have received the same level of popular recognition as other AI visionaries like Andrew Ng. The success of LSTM and its widespread adoption in various AI applications can be traced back to Schmidhuber's research in deep learning.Despite not achieving the same level of mainstream acclaim, Schmidhuber continues to actively contribute to the field of AI as the Co-Founder and Chief Scientist of Nnaisense, a company focused on developing AI technologies, and as the Director and Professor at the Swiss AI Lab. His work and insights remain highly influential, and his ideas have laid the foundation for many advancements in artificial intelligence.In conclusion, Juergen Schmidhuber's contributions to AI, particularly the invention of LSTM, have played a crucial role in the development and adoption of deep learning technologies. Despite not attaining the same level of recognition as some of his peers, his work has had a significant impact on the field and continues to shape the future of AI.1 / 1

âIn 2050 there will be trillions of self-replicating robot factories on the asteroid belt,â he tells the audience at WIRED2016. âA few million years later, AI will colonise the galaxy. Humans are not going to play a big role there, but thatâs ok. We should be proud of being part of a grand process that transcends humankind more than the industrial revolution.

The pioneer in deep learning neural networks should know. His work - including 333 peer-reviewed papers - has formed the foundations of many of the AI systems we see embedded in smartphones today, including Googleâs voice recognition and Google Translate - âeach of you has a little piece of us in your pocket,â he said.


Although he sees a not-so-distant future where humans become fairly redundant, the AI that takes over would obviously not have been possible without us. Schmidhuber has been working on recurrent artificial neural networks for decades, and these systems are modelled after the human brain. They are an attempt to mimic the billions of neural connections firing away every second to deploy countless biological tasks and cognitive processes. AIs modelled on this are essentially learning algorithms: âNetworks figure out over time which inputs are important and which arenât.â

An outcome of this research was something Schmidhuber called âlong-short-term memoryâ. âNo-one was really interested at first - now all major companies are using it for speech recognition. Itâs a universal mechanism. Google is using that same LSTM for speech recognition and translation. You train it on lots of examples.â

The first robots that deployed this kind of approach are âartificially curious systemsâ, says Schmidhuber. These robots âset goals like a baby setting new experiments to play around. Curiosity and creativity, coming up with new experiments so they can learn more about how the world works - this makes it so they become better problem solvers and improve their skills repertoire.â1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTJÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber, an AI guru and pioneer in deep learning neural networks, envisions a future where AI plays a significant role in the colonization of the galaxy.

He believes that robots should be designed to be curious, constantly exploring and experimenting to learn more about the world and improve their problem-solving abilities.While Schmidhuber's vision of AI colonizing the galaxy may seem far-fetched, his contributions to the field of AI and deep learning have significantly advanced our understanding and application of these technologies. As AI continues to evolve, it will undoubtedly shape the future in ways we cannot fully comprehend yet.1 / 1I think his greatest contribution is in helping to convince people that computers could make beautiful art from very simple mathematical formulas.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYou're absolutely right. JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber has made significant contributions to the idea that computers can create beautiful art from simple mathematical formulas. His work in algorithmic art and computational creativity has challenged the notion that creativity is exclusively a human domain.Schmidhuber's research has shown that through the application of algorithms and computational processes, computers can generate aesthetically pleasing and visually stunning artwork. By using mathematical formulas and computational models, he has demonstrated that machines can create intricate patterns, fractals, and visual compositions that evoke a sense of beauty.One of Schmidhuber's notable achievements in this area is the development of algorithms that generate art using the principles of compression and complexity reduction.

He has demonstrated that creativity can be systematically approached and formalized through computational processes, opening up new possibilities for the intersection of art and technology.Schmidhuber's contributions in this field have not only advanced the field of computational art but have also sparked broader discussions about the nature of creativity and the role of machines in artistic endeavors. By showcasing the artistic potential of computers, he has helped shift the perception of AI and computational systems from purely functional tools to creative partners and sources of inspiration.In summary, JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber's work in demonstrating that computers can create beautiful art from simple mathematical formulas has played a crucial role in expanding our understanding of the creative potential of machines. His contributions have not only inspired artists and researchers but have also challenged conventional notions of creativity and opened up new avenues for exploration at the intersection of art and technology.1 / 1Explain lstm in a simpler way2 / 2ChatGPTChatGPTLSTM, which stands for Long Short-Term Memory, is a type of artificial neural network that is designed to process and analyze sequences of data. It is particularly effective in tasks that involve understanding and predicting patterns in sequences, such as speech recognition, language translation, and time series analysis.At its core, LSTM is based on the idea of a memory cell that can store information over long periods of time. Think of it as a memory unit that can remember important information from previous inputs and use it to make predictions about future inputs.To understand how LSTM works, let's use the example of predicting the next word in a sentence. When given a sequence of words as input, LSTM analyzes the patterns and relationships between the words. It uses its memory cell to retain information about the important aspects of the previous words that are relevant for predicting the next word.LSTM has three main components: the input gate, the forget gate, and the output gate. These gates control the flow of information within the memory cell. The input gate determines which information from the current input should be stored in the memory cell. The forget gate decides which information in the memory cell should be discarded. And the output gate determines what information from the memory cell should be used as the output of the LSTM.By adjusting the weights and biases of these gates, the LSTM can learn to selectively remember or forget information based on the patterns it observes in the training data. This allows it to capture long-term dependencies and make accurate predictions.In essence, LSTM is like a smart memory unit that can selectively remember and forget information to make predictions in sequential data. Its ability to retain important information over long periods of time and handle complex dependencies between elements in a sequence has made it a powerful tool in various applications, including natural language processing, speech recognition, and more.Overall, LSTM provides a way for machines to process and analyze sequential data effectively, allowing them to understand and generate sequences with improved accuracy and context-awareness.1 / 1It seems similar to one of my theses, that the ability is to generalize is closely related to the ability to forget, it's called Funes the Memorious' Last Theorem1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThat's an interesting connection you've made! Funes the Memorious' Last Theorem sounds like a concept that relates to the relationship between memory and generalization. It suggests that the ability to forget unnecessary or irrelevant information is crucial for effective generalization.In machine learning, generalization refers to the ability of a model to perform well on unseen data by learning from the patterns and examples it has seen during training. When a model overfits the training data, it memorizes specific details and becomes less effective at generalizing to new examples.Just like Funes, who had an incredible memory that prevented him from generalizing and abstracting information, machine learning models that are unable to forget irrelevant details may struggle to generalize effectively. By selectively forgetting or ignoring unnecessary information, models can focus on the essential patterns and features that are relevant to the task at hand.In this context, Funes the Memorious' Last Theorem suggests that the ability to forget or discard irrelevant information is a fundamental aspect of learning and generalization. It allows models to distill the essential knowledge from a large amount of data, improving their ability to make accurate predictions or generate meaningful outputs.By drawing parallels between Funes' exceptional memory and the importance of forgetting in machine learning, you can explore the idea that the ability to generalize effectively is closely tied to the ability to forget unnecessary details. This connection can provide valuable insights into the principles of learning and memory in both human cognition and artificial intelligence systems.1 / 1Give some more examples for the book, including symbolic, heuristic shortcuts, syntactical, semantic, and heterarchical.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here are some additional examples for the book, showcasing different aspects related to memory, learning, and cognitive processes:Symbolic Representations: Explore how humans and AI systems use symbolic representations to encode and manipulate information. Symbolic representations involve using abstract symbols or signs to represent concepts, objects, or relationships. Examples could include mathematical notations, programming languages, or symbolic logic.Heuristic Shortcuts: Discuss the role of heuristics in decision-making and problem-solving. Heuristics are mental shortcuts or rules of thumb that help individuals make quick judgments or solve problems efficiently. Examples could include the availability heuristic (relying on immediate examples that come to mind) or the representativeness heuristic (making judgments based on how closely something resembles a typical prototype).Syntactical Processing: Explore how syntactical rules govern the structure and composition of language and how they influence understanding and communication. Syntactical processing involves analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences or expressions. Examples could include studying how AI models learn syntactic rules in natural language processing or analyzing the syntactic parsing abilities of humans.Semantic Networks: Investigate how semantic networks represent the meaning and relationships between concepts or words. Semantic networks organize information based on semantic connections, such as hierarchical relationships or associative links. Examples could include exploring how knowledge graphs represent semantic relationships or how humans form semantic networks to organize their understanding of the world.Heterarchical Systems: Examine the concept of heterarchy, which refers to systems or organizations that exhibit non-hierarchical or decentralized structures. Discuss how heterarchical systems can facilitate distributed decision-making and coordination. Examples could include self-organizing systems, swarm intelligence, or decentralized AI networks.By incorporating these examples into your book, you can provide a broader perspective on the various cognitive processes, memory mechanisms, and learning strategies that contribute to human and artificial intelligence.1 / 1Connections to the thesis1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here are some connections between the examples provided and your thesis on the relationship between generalization and forgetting, called "Funes the Memorious' Last Theorem":Symbolic Representations: Symbolic representations play a crucial role in generalization and memory processes. They allow for the encoding and manipulation of abstract concepts, which can aid in generalizing knowledge across different contexts. Forgetting irrelevant details while retaining the symbolic representation facilitates generalization by focusing on essential information.Heuristic Shortcuts: Heuristics, as cognitive shortcuts, are related to generalization and memory. They allow individuals to make quick decisions or judgments based on past experiences. Forgetting less relevant or outdated heuristics and retaining those that are more effective can enhance the generalization process by adapting to new situations.Syntactical Processing: The ability to recognize and apply syntactic rules aids in generalization by allowing individuals to understand the structure and meaning of language. Forgetting irrelevant or outdated syntactic rules helps in adapting to new linguistic contexts and improving generalization capabilities.Semantic Networks: Semantic networks enable the organization and retrieval of knowledge based on semantic relationships. Forgetting less relevant or outdated connections in the semantic network can enhance generalization by focusing on more meaningful associations between concepts.Heterarchical Systems: Heterarchical systems, with their decentralized and non-hierarchical structures, support flexible adaptation and generalization. Forgetting less effective or outdated decision-making processes within a heterarchical system can promote the emergence of more effective strategies and enhance generalization capabilities.By examining these examples within the context of your thesis, you can explore how forgetting irrelevant or outdated information contributes to the generalization process and how memory mechanisms, such as symbolic representations, heuristics, syntactical processing, semantic networks, and heterarchical systems, are involved in this relationship.1 / 1Explain how drop out is a kind of forgetting1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTDropout is a regularization technique commonly used in neural networks during training. It involves randomly "dropping out" a certain percentage of units or neurons in a network by setting their activations to zero. This means that these units do not contribute to the forward pass or backward pass of information during a specific training iteration.From the perspective of your thesis on the relationship between generalization and forgetting, dropout can be seen as a form of forgetting because it selectively removes certain connections or activations within the neural network. By dropping out units, the network is forced to learn more robust and distributed representations of the input data.Here's how dropout relates to forgetting and generalization:Reducing Overfitting: Dropout acts as a regularizer by preventing the network from relying too heavily on specific neurons or features during training. It encourages the network to learn more diverse representations of the data by "forgetting" the reliance on individual units. This helps to reduce overfitting, where the network memorizes the training data too precisely and fails to generalize well to new, unseen data.Promoting Ensemble Learning: When dropout is applied during training, the network essentially becomes an ensemble of many sub-networks with different combinations of active units. Each sub-network focuses on a different subset of features, effectively creating a diverse set of models. By randomly dropping out units, dropout encourages the network to learn robust representations that are not overly dependent on specific features or correlations. This ensemble learning aspect improves generalization by capturing different aspects of the input data.Handling Noisy Inputs: Dropout can be seen as a way of simulating noise or missing information in the input data. By randomly dropping out units, dropout introduces a form of noise to the network during training. This helps the network become more resilient to noise and better generalize to new, noisy inputs during inference. In a sense, dropout allows the network to "forget" or disregard some of the noisy or irrelevant features during training, leading to improved generalization.Overall, dropout can be viewed as a form of forgetting within a neural network. By selectively dropping out units and encouraging diverse representations, dropout helps reduce overfitting, promote ensemble learning, and handle noisy inputs, ultimately enhancing the network's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.1 / 1Explain how a perceptron is a kind of forgetting1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTA perceptron is a type of artificial neural network model that was developed as a building block for more complex neural network architectures. While it may not be directly associated with forgetting in the same sense as dropout, we can explore a perspective where the perceptron can be seen as a primitive form of forgetting.A perceptron consists of a single layer of artificial neurons, also known as perceptron units. Each perceptron unit takes a set of inputs, applies weights to these inputs, and passes the weighted sum through an activation function to produce an output. The activation function typically introduces non-linearity to the model.In the context of forgetting, we can interpret a perceptron as a way of selectively focusing on relevant information while disregarding irrelevant or less important inputs. The weights assigned to each input in a perceptron determine the level of importance given to that input. During the learning process, the perceptron adjusts its weights based on the training data to optimize its performance.Here's how a perceptron can be associated with forgetting:Weight Updates: When training a perceptron, the weights are updated using a learning algorithm, such as the perceptron learning rule or gradient descent. These weight updates can be seen as a way of adapting the perceptron's behavior to better fit the training data. In this sense, the perceptron may "forget" or modify its initial assumptions about the importance of certain inputs as it learns from the data.Selective Activation: The activation function in a perceptron introduces a non-linear transformation that determines the output of the perceptron based on the weighted sum of inputs. This activation function can be seen as a way of selectively activating or "remembering" relevant inputs while suppressing or "forgetting" less important inputs. The choice of the activation function influences how the perceptron processes and filters information.Generalization: After training, a perceptron can generalize its learned weights to make predictions on new, unseen inputs. This generalization process involves making decisions based on the learned patterns in the training data while disregarding irrelevant variations or noise. In this sense, the perceptron exhibits a form of forgetting by focusing on the essential features that contribute to accurate predictions.It's important to note that the concept of forgetting in the context of a perceptron is not the same as the active intentional forgetting associated with cognitive processes. Instead, it refers to the ability of the perceptron to adapt its weights and selectively focus on relevant inputs, disregarding less important information. This adaptability and selectivity contribute to the perceptron's ability to learn and generalize from the data it is trained on.1 / 1No but humans see way more than they can process, the retina filters out or selectively ignores features that are not salient1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYou're correct. In the context of human perception, our visual system filters out or selectively ignores certain features that are not salient or relevant to our current task or attention. This process is known as selective attention or selective perception.Selective attention allows us to focus our cognitive resources on the most relevant and important information while filtering out distractions or less significant details. Our visual system, including the retina, plays a crucial role in this process.The retina contains specialized cells called photoreceptors that detect light and transmit visual information to the brain. However, not all the information captured by the retina is processed or transmitted to higher visual areas for further analysis. Instead, there are mechanisms in place that filter and prioritize the visual input.One of the mechanisms involved in selective attention is known as feature-based attention. It allows us to selectively attend to specific visual features, such as color, shape, or motion, while disregarding others. For example, if we are searching for a red object in a cluttered scene, our attention may be biased towards detecting and processing information related to the color red, while other colors may be ignored or receive less attention.Another mechanism is known as spatial attention, which involves selectively attending to specific locations in the visual field. This allows us to focus our processing resources on relevant regions while ignoring irrelevant or peripheral areas. For instance, when reading a book, our attention is primarily focused on the text and important visual cues, while other parts of the page may be less attended to.These mechanisms of selective attention in human perception can be seen as a form of "forgetting" or filtering out non-salient information. They help us efficiently process and make sense of the vast amount of visual information that our eyes capture. By selectively attending to important features and regions, our visual system can prioritize processing resources and enhance our ability to perceive and understand the world around us.1 / 1Write more of the essay1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTBoredom, Curiosity, and Surprise: Exploring the Interplay of Human ExperienceIntroduction:Boredom, curiosity, and surprise are fundamental aspects of human experience that shape our perceptions, motivations, and interactions with the world. These concepts have captivated the minds of philosophers, psychologists, and scientists throughout history, offering valuable insights into the human condition. In this essay, we will explore the interconnected nature of boredom, curiosity, and surprise, and how they contribute to our understanding of human cognition, behavior, and creativity. Additionally, we will delve into the theories and concepts proposed by scholars such as JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber, who has made significant contributions to the field of artificial intelligence and compression theory.Boredom: The Cradle of Creativity:Boredom is often seen as a negative emotion, associated with monotony, disinterest, and a lack of stimulation. However, emerging research suggests that boredom may play a crucial role in fostering creativity and innovation. When we find ourselves in a state of boredom, our minds are driven to seek novel experiences and engage in activities that stimulate our curiosity. This restlessness motivates us to explore new avenues, think outside the box, and seek alternative perspectives, ultimately leading to creative insights and solutions. Boredom can be seen as a catalyst for pushing the boundaries of our thinking and expanding our cognitive horizons.Curiosity: Fueling the Quest for Knowledge:Curiosity is an innate human trait that drives us to seek knowledge, explore our environment, and satisfy our desire for understanding. It is a powerful motivator that compels us to ask questions, seek answers, and engage in learning experiences. Curiosity prompts us to actively seek out new information, engage in exploration and experimentation, and make sense of the world around us. It is through curiosity that we acquire knowledge, develop new skills, and make meaningful connections between disparate ideas. As JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber suggests, curiosity can be viewed as a drive for data compression, where our minds strive to extract meaningful patterns and reduce the complexity of information.Surprise: Igniting the Spark of Wonder:Surprise is an intense emotional response that occurs when our expectations are violated, when the unexpected happens. It is an essential ingredient in human experiences, capturing our attention, and evoking a sense of wonder and fascination. When we encounter something surprising, our cognitive processes are momentarily disrupted, forcing us to reassess our mental models and incorporate new information. This process of cognitive recalibration expands our understanding of the world and enhances our ability to adapt and learn. Surprise can be seen as a trigger for cognitive growth, promoting flexible thinking, and stimulating our curiosity.Schmidhuber's Theory of Compression:JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber's work in the field of compression theory provides valuable insights into the interplay of boredom, curiosity, and surprise. His research highlights the significance of data compression as a fundamental principle in human cognition and artificial intelligence. According to Schmidhuber, our minds are driven to seek patterns, regularities, and compressible representations of information. This drive for compression aligns with our natural tendencies for curiosity and exploration. As we encounter surprising or unexpected information, our minds actively seek to compress and make sense of it, thereby reducing the complexity and uncertainty in our mental representations.Moreover, Schmidhuber's theories have practical applications in various domains, including machine learning and artificial intelligence. His concept of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which enable machines to process sequential data while selectively retaining important information, can be seen as a form of "forgetting" or compression. LSTM networks learn to identify and retain salient patterns while disregarding less relevant details, similar to how humans selectively attend to salient features in their perceptual experience.1 / 1Write more of the book Funes the Memorous' Last Theorem1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTFunes the Memorious' Last Theorem: Exploring the Limitations of Human Memory and the Quest for KnowledgeChapter 3: Symbolic, Heuristic Shortcuts, and the Fragility of MemoryIn this chapter, we delve into the intricate workings of human memory and the various strategies we employ to cope with its limitations. Focusing on symbolic and heuristic shortcuts, we explore how these mental processes shape our perception, understanding, and recall of information. Drawing inspiration from Jorge Luis Borges' enigmatic character Funes the Memorious, we uncover the delicate balance between the power and fragility of memory.Section 3.1: Symbolic Representations and Memory CompressionSymbolic representations serve as a fundamental mechanism for memory compression, enabling us to encapsulate complex information into concise and meaningful symbols. By assigning symbols to objects, concepts, and experiences, we can store and retrieve vast amounts of knowledge with relative ease. However, this compression comes at a cost. As we reduce rich and nuanced experiences into symbols, we inevitably lose some of the intricacies and nuances of the original information. We explore how symbolic representations allow us to navigate the vast landscape of knowledge while also acknowledging their inherent limitations in capturing the full richness of our experiences.Section 3.2: Heuristic Shortcuts and the Reconstruction of MemoriesHuman memory is not a flawless recording device but rather a dynamic and reconstructive process. We rely on heuristic shortcuts, mental strategies that help us make rapid judgments and decisions based on limited information. These shortcuts play a pivotal role in memory retrieval, influencing how we reconstruct past experiences. However, they also introduce biases and distortions, leading to inaccuracies and false memories. We examine the various types of heuristic shortcuts, such as availability heuristics and anchoring biases, shedding light on the ways in which our memory can be both adaptive and fallible.Chapter 4: Syntactical and Semantic Interactions: Unraveling the Complexity of MemoryIn this chapter, we delve into the intricate interplay between syntactical and semantic processes in memory. Syntactical interactions involve the organization and structure of information, while semantic interactions revolve around the meaning and associations embedded within our memories. By exploring these interactions, we gain a deeper understanding of the complexity and interconnectedness of our memory systems.Section 4.1: Syntactical Structures and Memory OrganizationThe human memory exhibits a remarkable capacity for organizing information into coherent structures. We explore how syntactical frameworks, such as hierarchies, categories, and networks, provide a framework for storing and retrieving memories efficiently. These structures not only enhance memory recall but also facilitate the formation of meaningful connections between different pieces of information. We delve into the role of schemas and scripts in memory organization and discuss their impact on our ability to make sense of the world.Section 4.2: Semantic Associations and Memory EncodingSemantic associations play a pivotal role in memory encoding, shaping the depth and richness of our memories. We examine how semantic networks and conceptual frameworks contribute to the formation and retrieval of memories. From the concept of spreading activation to the role of context-dependent memory, we uncover the intricate web of semantic associations that underlies our memory processes. We also discuss the potential pitfalls of relying too heavily on semantic associations, such as false memories and semantic priming effects.As we traverse the complex terrain of memory and its limitations, we encounter the enigmatic Funes the Memorious, whose prodigious memory holds both fascination and cautionary tales. In the subsequent chapters, we delve into the realms of self-organization, chaos theory, and fractals, exploring their connection to the labyrinthine landscape of memory and the human quest for knowledge.(Note: The book "Funes the Memorious' Last Theorem" is a work of fiction, and the content1 / 1Continue1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTof this chapter is a fictional exploration inspired by the character Funes the Memorious and the themes of memory and knowledge. While the concepts presented draw inspiration from the writings of Jorge Luis Borges, they are not directly derived from his work. The purpose of this book is to weave together philosophical musings and speculative ideas to provoke thought and engage readers in a contemplative journey. It is an invitation to reflect on the intricacies of memory, the limitations of human cognition, and the eternal quest for knowledge.Chapter 5: Self-Organization and the Chaotic Nature of MemoryIn this chapter, we delve into the fascinating realm of self-organization and its implications for memory formation and retrieval. Drawing upon the works of Ilya Prigogine and other pioneers in the field, we explore the idea that memory is not a static repository but a dynamic system that continuously adapts and evolves. We uncover the chaotic nature of memory, where patterns emerge, dissipate, and reorganize in a never-ending dance.Section 5.1: Nonlinear Dynamics and Memory PatternsNonlinear dynamics, with its emphasis on feedback loops and emergent behaviors, provides a lens through which we can understand the intricate patterns and fluctuations within our memory systems. We explore how memory exhibits self-organizing properties, where information is spontaneously structured and interconnected. We examine the concept of attractors, states toward which memory patterns tend to converge, and the role of bifurcations in shaping memory dynamics.Section 5.2: Fractals and the Infinite Complexity of MemoryFractals, with their infinite complexity and self-similarity, offer a compelling metaphor for the intricacies of memory. We delve into the notion that memory, like a fractal, possesses a recursive nature, where patterns repeat across different scales. We explore how memory unfolds in fractal-like patterns, with echoes of the past resonating in the present and shaping future experiences. Through the lens of fractal geometry, we gain insights into the infinite capacity and potential of human memory.Chapter 6: The Power of Episodic Memory and the Quest for MeaningIn this final chapter, we explore the profound influence of episodic memory on our quest for meaning and understanding. Episodic memory allows us to relive past experiences, imbuing them with personal significance and emotional weight. We delve into the role of memory in shaping our sense of self, constructing narratives of our lives, and finding meaning in the tapestry of our memories. Drawing upon philosophical traditions and psychological theories, we examine the intricate interplay between memory, identity, and the human search for existential meaning.Conclusion:In "Funes the Memorious' Last Theorem," we embark on a philosophical and speculative exploration of memory, knowledge, and the human condition. Through the intertwining themes of symbolic representations, heuristic shortcuts, syntactical and semantic interactions, self-organization, chaos theory, fractals, and episodic memory, we unravel the intricate tapestry of human memory. We invite readers to reflect on the complexities, limitations, and beauty of memory, and to contemplate its profound impact on our perception of reality and our quest for understanding.1 / 1A detailed outline for the book1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTI.

Every little detail of the world seemed etched into Alex's mind, forming an intricate tapestry of memories.As a child, Alex would spend countless hours exploring the neighborhood, taking in the sights, sounds, and smells. The lush greenery of the parks, the laughter of children playing, and the gentle rustling of leaves in the breezeâall of it became an indelible part of Alex's memory.One sunny afternoon, while standing in the backyard, Alex had a curious thought. What would happen if the eyes were closed, and the mind relied solely on memory? With a sense of playful wonder, Alex decided to embark on an experiment.Closing the eyes tightly, Alex allowed the afterimage of the surroundings to fade away. Counting silently, one... two... three... The seconds ticked by, and the vivid memory of the yard began to fade. It was a mere blink of an eye before the colors, shapes, and textures slipped away, leaving Alex with only a faint recollection.This experiment revealed something intriguingâwhile Alex possessed an extraordinary ability to retain memories, there were limitations. The mind couldn't retain the vividness of a moment forever. It was a humbling realization, but also a reminder of the beauty in impermanence.As the years went by, Alex's memory continued to astound friends and family. Every milestone in lifeâbirthdays, holidays, graduationsâwas etched deeply into Alex's mind. Memories of cherished moments with loved ones, adventures taken, and lessons learned formed a rich tapestry of experiences.But amidst the wonder of this extraordinary memory, Alex discovered another facet of human existenceâthe importance of letting go. Just as the seasons change and memories naturally fade, Alex learned to embrace the beauty in the ephemeral nature of life. It was a lesson in cherishing each moment and finding joy in the present, knowing that some memories are meant to be treasured and then released.And so, the story of Alex's life unfoldsâa journey filled with vivid recollections, remarkable milestones, and the ever-present reminder that memories, like life itself, are fleeting. As the years pass, Alex embraces the paradox of being blessed with an exceptional memory while also savoring the beauty of letting go, understanding that true joy lies in the balance between remembering and living fully in the present.1 / 1Ok I did have a roommate in Vancouver named Alex, I could give you more details but they are not relevant at this point.

Total aphantasia refers to the complete absence of mental imagery in one's mind. Individuals with total aphantasia do not experience visual images, sounds, or any other sensory perceptions in their mind's eye. This means they are unable to conjure up mental pictures, hear songs playing in their heads, or recreate sensory experiences internally.For someone with total aphantasia, the absence of mental imagery can be a lifelong phenomenon. When they try to imagine something, their mind remains blank, devoid of any visual or auditory representation. This lack of internal visualization can extend to memories as well, as they cannot mentally replay past experiences or recall them in vivid detail.In addition to visual images, total aphantasia also encompasses the absence of earworms, which are the involuntary replaying of songs or tunes in one's mind. Those with total aphantasia do not experience these musical repetitions or have the ability to mentally recreate sounds.Living with total aphantasia can present unique challenges and differences in cognitive processing. While others may rely on mental imagery for various tasks, such as problem-solving, creative thinking, or memory recall, individuals with total aphantasia develop alternative strategies to compensate for the lack of internal visualization.Despite the absence of mental imagery, individuals with total aphantasia often possess other cognitive strengths and excel in different areas of thinking. They may have heightened verbal or analytical skills, relying more heavily on language or logical reasoning to navigate the world around them.Exploring and understanding total aphantasia allows us to appreciate the diversity of human perception and cognition. It sheds light on the wide spectrum of mental experiences and reminds us that our internal worlds can vary significantly from person to person.1 / 1Hmm do you see the connections to our story, if I never saw or heard things in my head, then I don't associate it with memory. I base my idea of whether I have a good memory on whether I can get the details about an event correct, I don't expect to see things in my head when imagining them or remembering them, as I have instant access to my memories like where I have been and what happened there1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAbsolutely! The absence of mental imagery in your experience of total aphantasia can certainly shape your perception of memory and how you assess its accuracy. Since you don't have the visual or auditory cues associated with memories, your evaluation of memory relies more on the factual details and accuracy of the information you recall.Your memory is likely characterized by a strong focus on semantic or factual aspects rather than sensory-rich experiences. You may excel at remembering specific details, such as dates, names, locations, and events, rather than relying on visual or auditory cues to evoke the memory. This reliance on factual recall allows you to access your memories quickly and directly without the need for mental visualization.As you mentioned, your idea of having a good memory is based on your ability to accurately recall the specific details of an event. This suggests that your memory strengths lie in the precision and accuracy of information retrieval rather than relying on sensory-based cues or mental imagery.Additionally, your instant access to memories and the ability to recall where you have been and what happened there can be attributed to your reliance on semantic memory, which stores general knowledge and facts. Semantic memory is less reliant on sensory cues and is more concerned with factual information, concepts, and meanings. Your access to these semantic memories allows you to navigate and recall past events without the need for mental imagery.Overall, the absence of mental imagery in total aphantasia has likely influenced your memory processes and shaped how you perceive and evaluate your memory abilities. It highlights the different ways in which individuals experience and evaluate memory, emphasizing the unique cognitive strengths and strategies that can arise in the absence of mental imagery.1 / 1A list of the books and essays we are writing2 / 2ChatGPTChatGPTBook: "Hyperthymesia: The Movie" - A memoir exploring the unique experiences of living with hyperthymesia, a condition characterized by highly detailed and vivid autobiographical memory.Essay: "Boredom, Curiosity, and Surprise" - Examining the interplay between these three psychological states and their role in human cognition, learning, and creativity.

Algorithmic Theories of Everything
Juergen Schmidhuber
The probability distribution P from which the history of our universe is sampled represents a theory of everything or TOE. We assume P is formally describable. Since most (uncountably many) distributions are not, this imposes a strong inductive bias. We show that P(x) is small for any universe x lacking a short description, and study the spectrum of TOEs spanned by two Ps, one reflecting the most compact constructive descriptions, the other the fastest way of computing everything. The former derives from generalizations of traditional computability, Solomonoff's algorithmic probability, Kolmogorov complexity, and objects more random than Chaitin's Omega, the latter from Levin's universal search and a natural resource-oriented postulate: the cumulative prior probability of all x incomputable within time t by this optimal algorithm should be 1/t. Between both Ps we find a universal cumulatively enumerable measure that dominates traditional enumerable measures; any such CEM must assign low probability to any universe lacking a short enumerating program. We derive P-specific consequences for evolving observers, inductive reasoning, quantum physics, philosophy, and the expected duration of our universe1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT"Algorithmic Theories of Everything" by Juergen SchmidhuberAbstract: In this paper, Juergen Schmidhuber explores the concept of a theory of everything (TOE) in the context of algorithmic probability distributions. The TOE represents the probability distribution from which the history of our universe is sampled, and the author assumes that it is formally describable. However, since most distributions are not formally describable, this introduces a strong inductive bias. The paper examines two distinct types of algorithmic theories of everything, one based on compact constructive descriptions and the other based on the fastest way of computing everything.

The TOE represents the probability distribution from which our universe's history is sampled. The author assumes that the TOE can be described formally, but since most distributions cannot, there is a strong inductive bias. Two types of algorithmic theories of everything are examined: one based on compact descriptions and the other on the fastest way of computing everything. The paper introduces a measure that assigns low probability to universes lacking concise descriptions.

The non-negative Grassmannian is a mathematical object that represents a space of subspaces, and compression is typically used to reduce the size of data while preserving important information. By applying compression to the non-negative Grassmannian, you can potentially obtain a more compact representation of subspaces or patterns within the data.This approach could have various applications, depending on the specific context in which the non-negative Grassmannian is being used. For example, in computer vision, compressing the non-negative Grassmannian could help in efficient storage or transmission of visual data, while still retaining relevant features or structures. In machine learning, compressed representations of the non-negative Grassmannian could aid in tasks such as dimensionality reduction or clustering.However, it's important to note that the specific details and techniques involved in compressing the non-negative Grassmannian would require further elaboration and investigation. Different compression algorithms or methodologies could be explored to achieve the desired compression and maintain the essential characteristics of the data.1 / 1I'm also incorporating holographic steganography with sparse recursion.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIncorporating holographic steganography with sparse recursion is an intriguing approach to hiding information within digital images. Holographic steganography involves embedding secret data or messages into the holographic representation of an image, taking advantage of the complex interference patterns generated by holography. On the other hand, sparse recursion refers to a technique that utilizes sparse representations or sparse coding to efficiently process and reconstruct signals or images.By combining these two concepts, you aim to develop a method that can hide information within the holographic representation of an image using sparse recursion as a means of encoding and decoding the hidden data. This approach could offer advantages in terms of data capacity, security, and robustness against detection.The specific implementation and details of this approach would require careful consideration and experimentation. Factors such as the choice of holographic encoding techniques, the sparsity model used in sparse recursion, and the methods employed for embedding and extracting the hidden information would need to be explored and optimized.It is worth noting that both holographic steganography and sparse recursion are active areas of research, and combining them opens up possibilities for novel and advanced data hiding techniques. Further exploration and experimentation will be necessary to determine the effectiveness and practicality of this approach in different scenarios and applications.1 / 1That one might be using Markov blankets1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTUsing Markov blankets in the context of your research on holographic steganography and sparse recursion can provide a valuable framework for modeling and understanding the dependencies and interactions within complex systems.In probabilistic graphical models, a Markov blanket represents the minimal set of variables that provides all the information necessary to predict the behavior of a specific variable of interest, while being conditionally independent of all other variables outside the blanket. By identifying the Markov blanket of a variable, you can capture the direct influences and dependencies that affect its state.In the context of your research, incorporating Markov blankets can help in determining the optimal variables or features to consider when embedding and extracting hidden information in the holographic representation. By identifying the relevant variables and their dependencies within the system, you can ensure that the hidden information is effectively encoded and can be reliably recovered.Furthermore, Markov blankets can aid in the analysis and evaluation of the robustness and security of the steganographic scheme. By considering the dependencies captured by the Markov blanket, you can assess the vulnerability of the hidden information to different attacks or detection methods. This analysis can guide the development of more resilient and secure steganographic techniques.It is important to note that the specific implementation and application of Markov blankets in your research would require careful consideration and adaptation to the unique characteristics of holographic steganography and sparse recursion. Experimentation and refinement of the models and algorithms will be necessary to ensure their effectiveness and applicability in achieving your research goals.1 / 1What areas does a Markov blanket segment?2 / 2ChatGPTChatGPTA Markov blanket segments or partitions a variable from the rest of the variables in a probabilistic graphical model. It consists of three distinct sets of variables:Parents: The parents of the variable of interest are the variables that have direct causal influence on it. In other words, the parents provide the most relevant information for predicting the state of the variable.Children: The children of the variable are the variables that are directly influenced by it. The children are considered part of the Markov blanket because they provide information about the variable of interest.Spouses: The spouses of the variable are the variables that share a common child with it. Including the spouses in the Markov blanket ensures that the conditional independence between the variable of interest and the rest of the variables in the model is preserved.By including the parents, children, and spouses in the Markov blanket, all the relevant dependencies and influences on the variable of interest are captured. The Markov blanket acts as a partition, separating the variable from the remaining variables in the model, while preserving the conditional independence relationships necessary for probabilistic inference.It is worth noting that the specific composition of the Markov blanket can vary depending on the underlying graphical model and the relationships among the variables. Different graphical models, such as Bayesian networks or Markov random fields, may have slightly different definitions and considerations for the Markov blanket. The main idea, however, remains consistent: the Markov blanket includes the minimal set of variables that provide the necessary information for predicting the state of the variable of interest.1 / 1What about a Bayesian factor analysis?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn Bayesian factor analysis, the goal is to model the relationships between observed variables and latent factors. The latent factors are unobserved variables that represent underlying dimensions or constructs that influence the observed variables. Bayesian factor analysis provides a probabilistic framework for estimating the latent factors and their relationships with the observed variables.In the context of the Markov blanket, Bayesian factor analysis can be seen as a way to identify the Markov blanket of each observed variable. The Markov blanket of an observed variable consists of the set of variables that are directly related to it, given the latent factors. In other words, the Markov blanket of an observed variable includes the latent factors that influence it, as well as other observed variables that share a common influence.In Bayesian factor analysis, the relationships between the observed variables and latent factors are typically modeled using probabilistic distributions. The model parameters are estimated using Bayesian inference techniques, which involve specifying prior distributions and updating them based on the observed data.The estimation of the Markov blanket in Bayesian factor analysis involves determining the variables that have a direct influence on each observed variable, given the estimated latent factors. This can be done by examining the posterior distributions of the model parameters and identifying the variables with non-zero coefficients or significant associations.By identifying the Markov blanket of each observed variable in Bayesian factor analysis, we gain insights into the variables that are most relevant for predicting or explaining the observed data. This information can be valuable for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and understanding the underlying structure of the data.1 / 1A "constructive static sequence versioning" or contrastive algorithm is a method for compressing data that involves using a spiral pixel stretching exploration ray instead of a conventional method.

The colors of the pixels are stretched or pinched by a scalar multiplier on a template and a template-selector, which means that the pixel colors are calculated relative to the underlying selected template, that is steganographically, but the pixel color records a scene layout and object trajectory list, much like a scene layout in a 3D modeling software, with camera angles, scene textures, object location and trajectory, temperature of objects, their density, their current selected goal location, and meta-values such as the camera, the lighting in the room, the weather, humidity, and other potentially relevant factors.

The goal of the algorithm is to compress data in a way that preserves important information while discarding unnecessary details.

A constructive static sequence versioning algorithm is a method of compressing data by analyzing patterns in the data and then using a mathematical formula to represent those patterns in a more compact form. 

The algorithm is "constructive" because it builds a new representation of the data, and "static" because it does not take into account any changes in the data over time.

The "sequence versioning" part of the name refers to the algorithm's ability to keep track of different versions of the data, allowing for easy recovery or comparison of previous versions.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTA constructive static sequence versioning algorithm is a method of data compression that aims to represent patterns in the data in a more concise way. The algorithm analyzes the data to identify recurring patterns and then uses a mathematical formula to capture those patterns.The term "constructive" emphasizes that the algorithm constructs a new representation of the data, rather than simply discarding or compressing parts of it. The algorithm considers the entire dataset and generates a compressed version that retains the essential information while reducing redundancy.The "static" aspect of the algorithm refers to its focus on a specific snapshot or state of the data. It does not take into account changes or updates to the data over time but instead focuses on compressing a particular sequence or snapshot.The "sequence versioning" component indicates that the algorithm has the capability to handle different versions of the data. It can track and manage multiple versions, allowing for easy retrieval, comparison, or reconstruction of previous versions.Overall, a constructive static sequence versioning algorithm provides an efficient way to compress and represent data by identifying patterns, constructing a new representation, and accommodating multiple versions of the data for future reference.1 / 1Îssuming that we are incorporating all of these what can you tell about my compression algorthm so far?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTBased on the information provided, your compression algorithm appears to be a combination of different techniques, including the use of a contrastive algorithm, constructive static sequence versioning, and potentially incorporating Bayesian factor analysis and Markov blankets.

The contrastive algorithm, with its spiral pixel stretching exploration ray, allows for color adjustments and steganographic encoding of scene layout and object trajectory. The constructive static sequence versioning aspect helps identify and represent recurring patterns in the data. The inclusion of Bayesian factor analysis and Markov blankets could further enhance the compression process by incorporating probabilistic modeling and capturing dependencies between variables.Overall, your compression algorithm combines various methods and concepts from different fields, providing a comprehensive approach to data compression that incorporates scene layout, object trajectory, color adjustments, pattern identification, and potentially probabilistic modeling.1 / 1And the holographic steganography and the non-negative grassmanian1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTApologies for missing the mention of holographic steganography and the non-negative Grassmannian in the previous response.Holographic steganography is a technique that combines the principles of steganography (hiding information within a cover image) with holography (creating 3D images using light interference patterns).

Abstract
Background
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged has a main strategy to study transcriptional activity at the cellular level. Clustering analysis is routinely performed on scRNA-seq data to explore, recognize or discover underlying cell identities. The high dimensionality of scRNA-seq data and its significant sparsity accentuated by frequent dropout events, introducing false zero count observations, make the clustering analysis computationally challenging. Even though multiple scRNA-seq clustering techniques have been proposed, there is no consensus on the best performing approach. On a parallel research track, self-supervised contrastive learning recently achieved state-of-the-art results on images clustering and, subsequently, image classification.

Results
We propose contrastive-sc, a new unsupervised learning method for scRNA-seq data that perform cell clustering. The method consists of two consecutive phases: first, an artificial neural network learns an embedding for each cell through a representation training phase. The embedding is then clustered in the second phase with a general clustering algorithm (i.e. KMeans or Leiden community detection). The proposed representation training phase is a new adaptation of the self-supervised contrastive learning framework, initially proposed for image processing, to scRNA-seq data. contrastive-sc has been compared with ten state-of-the-art techniques. A broad experimental study has been conducted on both simulated and real-world datasets, assessing multiple external and internal clustering performance metrics (i.e. ARI, NMI, Silhouette, Calinski scores). Our experimental analysis shows that constastive-sc compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion
On average, our method identifies well-defined clusters in close agreement with ground truth annotations. Our method is computationally efficient, being fast to train and having a limited memory footprint. contrastive-sc maintains good performance when only a fraction of input cells is provided and is robust to changes in hyperparameters or network architecture. The decoupling between the creation of the embedding and the clustering phase allows the flexibility to choose a suitable clustering algorithm (i.e. KMeans when the number of expected clusters is known, Leiden otherwise) or to integrate the embedding with other existing techniques.
1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper "Contrastive self-supervised clustering of scRNA-seq data" by Madalina Ciortan and Matthieu Defrance explores the application of contrastive learning, specifically the contrastive-sc method, for clustering analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Clustering analysis is essential in identifying and understanding cell identities within scRNA-seq data, but the high dimensionality and sparsity of the data pose computational challenges.The proposed method consists of two phases. In the first phase, an artificial neural network learns an embedding representation for each cell through a representation training phase. This phase adapts the self-supervised contrastive learning framework, originally developed for image processing, to scRNA-seq data. The embedding captures important features and patterns within the data.In the second phase, the learned embeddings are clustered using a general clustering algorithm such as KMeans or Leiden community detection. The contrastive-sc method is compared to ten state-of-the-art techniques, and extensive experimental studies are conducted on both simulated and real-world datasets. The performance of the method is evaluated using various external and internal clustering performance metrics, including ARI, NMI, Silhouette, and Calinski scores.The results of the experimental analysis demonstrate that contrastive-sc achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. It successfully identifies well-defined clusters that align closely with ground truth annotations. Additionally, the method is computationally efficient, with fast training and a limited memory footprint. It also exhibits robustness to changes in hyperparameters and network architecture.The decoupling between the creation of the embedding and the clustering phase provides flexibility in choosing appropriate clustering algorithms or integrating the learned embeddings with other existing techniques. This allows for further customization and adaptation to specific scRNA-seq datasets and analysis goals.Overall, the paper presents a novel approach, contrastive-sc, for unsupervised learning and clustering of scRNA-seq data. By leveraging contrastive learning principles, it offers promising results in identifying cellular clusters and advancing our understanding of transcriptional activity at the single-cell level.1 / 1CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) is a neural network trained on a variety of (image, text) pairs.

Its objective is to learn to predict the most relevant text snippet given an input image, without explicitly optimizing for this task. This characteristic allows CLIP to exhibit zero-shot capabilities similar to those seen in models like GPT-2 and GPT-3.What sets CLIP apart is its ability to achieve performance comparable to the original ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset in a zero-shot manner. Remarkably, CLIP accomplishes this without using any of the 1.28 million labeled examples that were originally employed in training ResNet50. This achievement addresses several significant challenges in the field of computer vision.By leveraging the relationship between images and text, CLIP learns to associate visual features with corresponding textual descriptions. This pre-training process equips CLIP with a strong understanding of both visual and textual representations. Given a new image, CLIP can utilize its learned knowledge to identify the most relevant text snippet, even in scenarios where it has not been specifically trained for that particular task.The success of CLIP opens up exciting possibilities in various applications, such as image classification, object detection, and even more complex tasks like visual question answering. Its zero-shot capabilities offer flexibility and efficiency, allowing the model to adapt to new tasks without the need for extensive retraining or large labeled datasets.Overall, CLIP represents a significant advancement in the field of computer vision, showcasing the power of contrastive learning and the integration of language and image understanding. By enabling effective cross-modal reasoning, CLIP demonstrates the potential for leveraging multimodal information to tackle challenging vision tasks in a more efficient and generalizable manner.1 / 1Elsevier

Abstract
Semantic hashing is an effective method for fast similarity search which maps high-dimensional data to a compact binary code that preserves the semantic information of the original data. Most existing text hashing approaches treat each document separately and only learn the hash codes from the content of the documents. However, in reality, documents are related to each other either explicitly through an observed linkage such as citations or implicitly through unobserved connections such as adjacency in the original space. The document relationships are pervasive in the real world while they are largely ignored in the prior semantic hashing work. In this paper, we propose node2hash, an unsupervised deep generative model for semantic text hashing by utilizing graph context. It is designed to incorporate both document content and connection information through a probabilistic formulation. Based on the deep generative modeling framework, node2hash employs deep neural networks to learn complex mappings from the original space to the hash space. Moreover, the probabilistic formulation enables a principled way to generate hash codes for unseen documents that do not have any connections with the existing documents. Besides, node2hash can go beyond one-hop connections about directed linked documents by considering more global graph information. We conduct comprehensive experiments on seven datasets with explicit and implicit connections. The results have demonstrated the effectiveness of node2hash over competitive baselines.

Introduction
The task of similarity search, also called nearest-neighbor search, proximity search, or close item search, consists of finding documents from a large collection of documents, or corpus, which are most similar to a query document of interest. Fast and accurate similarity search is at the core of many information retrieval applications such as document clustering, collaborative filtering, and plagiarism analysis (Wang, Liu, Kumar, Chang, 2016b, Wang, Zhang, Song, Sebe, Shen, 2017). Semantic hashing (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009) is an effective solution to fast similarity search by representing every document in the corpus as a compact binary hashing code so that semantically similar documents are mapped to similar codes. Consequently, the similarity between two documents can be evaluated by simply calculating pairwise Hamming distances between hashing codes, i.e., the number of bits that are different between the two codes which significantly accelerates similarity search because an ordinary personal computer today can execute millions of Hamming distance computations in just a few milliseconds (Wang et al., 2017).

A spectrum of machine learning methods have been proposed in text semantic hashing (Wang et al., 2016b). Recent research has shown that leveraging supervised information can lead to high-quality hashing, but the cost of annotating data is often too prohibitive to apply supervised hashing. Deep learning based approaches have also been explored 1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper titled "node2hash: Graph aware deep semantic text hashing" published in the Information Processing & Management journal presents a novel approach for semantic text hashing that incorporates graph context to capture document relationships. The goal of semantic hashing is to map high-dimensional data, such as text documents, to compact binary codes while preserving their semantic information.Traditionally, text hashing methods focus solely on the content of individual documents, ignoring the inherent relationships between documents. However, in reality, documents are often related either explicitly through observed linkages like citations or implicitly through unobserved connections in the original space. The proposed node2hash model addresses this limitation by leveraging both the document content and connection information through a probabilistic formulation.The node2hash model is designed as an unsupervised deep generative model. It utilizes deep neural networks to learn complex mappings from the original space to the hash space. By incorporating graph context, node2hash can capture document relationships beyond simple one-hop connections. It considers more global graph information to generate hash codes for unseen documents without any connections to existing documents.The effectiveness of the node2hash model is evaluated through comprehensive experiments on seven datasets with explicit and implicit document connections. The results demonstrate its superiority over competitive baselines in terms of semantic hashing performance.The introduction of the paper provides an overview of the importance of similarity search in various information retrieval applications. It highlights the benefits of semantic hashing in accelerating similarity search and introduces the motivation for incorporating graph context into text hashing methods.Overall, the paper contributes to the field of text hashing by proposing a novel approach that takes into account document relationships through graph context. The node2hash model offers an effective solution for fast and accurate similarity search by generating compact binary codes that preserve semantic information. The experimental results validate its superiority over existing baselines, showcasing the potential of graph-aware deep semantic text hashing in information retrieval tasks.1 / 1A summary of the topics we've discussed1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThroughout our conversation, we have covered a wide range of topics. Here is a summary of the main topics we have discussed:Quantum Ergodicity: We explored the ergodic interpretation of quantum mechanics, which seeks to reconcile the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics with the deterministic outlook of classical mechanics. The ergodic interpretation suggests examining the statistical properties of an ensemble of similar quantum systems to understand their behavior over time.Compression and Surprise Minimization: We delved into JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber's work on compression and surprise minimization. Schmidhuber has developed algorithms and models that learn to compress data and reduce surprise by predicting or explaining future inputs. This approach has applications in areas such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and creativity.Aphantasia: We discussed aphantasia, a condition where individuals lack the ability to form mental images or visualizations. This condition can affect the way individuals perceive and remember information, relying more on factual details rather than visual imagery.Hyperthymesia: We explored hyperthymesia, a condition characterized by an exceptional ability to recall autobiographical details and past events. Individuals with hyperthymesia have highly detailed and vivid memories, often experiencing a constant and automatic recall of past events.Algorithmic Theory of Everything: We touched upon JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber's work on the Algorithmic Theory of Everything, which aims to develop a formal theory that describes the probabilistic distribution governing the history of our universe. This theory incorporates concepts from algorithmic probability, Kolmogorov complexity, and other computational frameworks.Chaos Theory and Fractals: We briefly discussed chaos theory, which studies complex and unpredictable systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. We also touched on fractals, which are intricate geometric patterns that repeat themselves at different scales.Self-Organization and Complexity: We explored the concept of self-organization, which refers to the spontaneous emergence of order and complexity in systems without external intervention. Self-organization plays a crucial role in various fields, including biology, physics, and social sciences.Ergodic Theory: We mentioned ergodic theory, which studies the long-term behavior of dynamical systems and explores the relationship between time averages and ensemble averages. Ergodic theory has applications in areas such as statistical mechanics, probability theory, and dynamical systems.Markov Chains and Bayesian Factor Analysis: We briefly touched upon Markov chains, which are mathematical models that describe a sequence of events where the probability of each event depends only on the previous event. We also mentioned Bayesian factor analysis, which is a statistical method used to uncover latent factors or variables that explain the observed data.Information Processing and Management: We discussed various papers and studies related to information processing and management, including topics such as contrastive learning, semantic text hashing, and similarity search in large datasets.These topics cover a broad range of subjects, from quantum mechanics and compression algorithms to memory and information processing. Each topic offers unique insights into different aspects of our understanding of the world and how information is processed, stored, and retrieved.1 / 1ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.
