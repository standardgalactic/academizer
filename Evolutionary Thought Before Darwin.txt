Evolutionary Thought Before Darwin

First published Mon Jun 17, 2019; substantive revision Thu Nov 30, 2023
���Evolution��� in contemporary discussions denotes the theory of the change of organic species over time. Prior to the second half of the nineteenth century, the term was used primarily, if not exclusively, in an embryological sense to designate the development of the individual embryo. These same ambiguities of usage also surround the German term Entwicklungsgeschichte, which originally was used in an embryological context. In 1852 the English philosopher Herbert Spencer (1820���1903) used the term to denote both cosmic and biological changes from ���homogeneity��� to ���heterogeneity���, and spoke there of a ���theory of evolution���. In the 1860s the term was used in some contexts to designate species change (Bowler 1975). Darwin himself did not use this specific term for his theory until the Descent of Man (1871). Since this article will survey the broad history of these theories prior to the Origin of Species, the term ���transformism���, a term that came into common use in French biological sources around 1835, will generally be used in this article to designate the theory of species change prior to the shift in meaning in the 1860s. Since Darwin���s work, the designator ���evolution��� has been typically, if not exclusively, linked with the theory of natural selection as the primary cause by which such species change has occurred over historical time.

This entry gives a broad historical review of the topic up to the ���Darwinian Revolution���. The Darwinian period will be treated in the separate entry Darwin: From the Origin of Species to the Descent of Man. The issues will be examined under the following headings:

1. Species Permanence and Change in Antiquity
1.1 Classical Discussions
In many respects, the general idea of species change in Western thought is an ancient concept. The reflections of Empedocles (ca. 495���35 BCE) and the views of the Greek Atomists among the Presocratic nature philosophers formed a Classical heritage on which later speculations could be developed (Kirby 2013). These Presocratic speculations combined naturalistic accounts of origins with reflections on the workings of chance-like processes to create existing forms of life (see the entry ancient atomism). Particularly as the Presocratic Atomist speculations were restated by the Roman poet Titus Lucretius (ca. 99���50 BCE) in book five of his On the Nature of Things (Lucretius [RN]), a source was available in Antiquity and recovered in the Latin West in 1417. This set out a speculative account of the gradual origin of living beings from an initial atomic chaos. Through an undirected process, the best adapted forms are sorted out and those not suited to their conditions are eliminated

The speculative accounts of the early atomists were, however, opposed on several levels by the subsequent mainstream Platonic, Neo-Platonic, Aristotelian, and Stoic philosophical traditions. The writings of Plato (427���327 BCE), particularly his long creation myth, Timaeus��� the only Platonic dialogue available continuously in the Latin Western tradition��� provided an influential non-Biblical source for arguments against the Atomist tradition. This dialogue serves as the locus classicus for the notion of an externally-imposed origin of living beings through the action of an intelligent Craftsman (demiurgos) who orders mathematically- conceived matter into a rational cosmos that includes living beings fashioned in accord with eternal archetypes or forms. Plato���s account initiated the long tradition of reflection that was continued in Neo-Platonism and in Greek and Roman Stoicism to form the foundation of the argument that organic beings could not be explained by chance-like processes either in their origins or in their complex design. Particularly as developed in the influential writings of the Greek physician Claudius Galenus (129���200 CE), a long heritage in the life sciences relied upon anatomy as evidence of rational design. These interpretations of ���teleological design��� interacted in complex ways with Jewish, Christian, and Islamic Biblical concepts of creation (Sedley 2007). One common meaning of ���teleology��� frequently encountered in discussions of evolution since Darwin���that of externally imposed design by an intelligent agency (demiurge, nature, God) on pre-existing matter���originates in these ancient discussions and is not accurately identified with the Biblical concept of creatio ex nihilo (Carroll 2015).

The section "1. Species Permanence and Change in Antiquity" in the article on "Evolutionary Thought Before Darwin" focuses on the historical perspectives on species change and evolution from ancient times. It can be broken down into the following key points:
Ancient Concepts of Species Change
:
The idea of species change in Western thought has roots in ancient philosophy.
Early thinkers like Empedocles (circa 495���435 BCE) and the Greek Atomists were pivotal in forming these early concepts.
Presocratic Speculations
:
These early philosophers offered naturalistic accounts of life's origins, incorporating the role of chance-like processes in the development of life forms.
The Roman poet Lucretius (circa 99���50 BCE), in his work "On the Nature of Things," restated these speculations, providing a detailed account of the gradual origin of life from atomic chaos.
Contrast with Mainstream Philosophical Traditions
:
These atomist theories were opposed by the dominant philosophical traditions of the time, namely Platonic, Neo-Platonic, Aristotelian, and Stoic philosophies.
Plato's "Timaeus" is a key work in this context, offering a different view of life���s origins as the creation of an intelligent Craftsman (demiurgos) and emphasizing rational design over chance.
Teleological Design and Rational Cosmos
:
These philosophies proposed that living beings were created based on eternal archetypes or forms, showcasing a rational cosmos.
The notion of "teleological design," or purposeful design by an external intelligence, was a central theme in these philosophical traditions.
Influence of Galen and Interactions with Religious Concepts
:
The Greek physician Claudius Galenus (129���200 CE) further influenced these ideas, using anatomy as evidence of rational design.
These interpretations interacted with Jewish, Christian, and Islamic concepts of creation, shaping the understanding of species and their origins.
Distinction from Biblical Creation
:
The concept of teleology in these discussions is distinct from the Biblical notion of creatio ex nihilo (creation from nothing). It refers to the idea of design imposed by an external agency on pre-existing matter.
This section outlines how early philosophical and scientific thought in the Western tradition approached the concept of species change, setting the stage for later developments in evolutionary theory.
You
In Aristotle���s (384���322 BCE) seminal biological writings, the external teleology of a designer-creator was replaced by an internal teleological purposiveness associated with the immanent action of an internal cause��� in living beings their informing soul (psuche)��� which functioned as the formal, final and efficient cause of life (Aristotle, De Anima II: 415b, 10��� 30 [1984]). Aristotle also did not endorse the concept of an historical origin of the world, affirming instead the eternity of the world order (Physics, I: 192a, 25���34), which became the main interpretation of Aristotle���s views by a later tradition (Dales and Argerami 1991).

Another issue that Aristotle treated extensively with relevance to the conception of species���embryogenesis���also had important implications for later discussions. In the traditions indebted in some way to Aristotle���s natural philosophy, sexual generation and the subsequent embryological development of the individual from primordial matter, is a sequential process that occurs in time under the teleological action of the soul (psuche). In Aristotle���s own account, this soul-as-form is typically derived from the male parent, but it could also be derived even from the sun, as employed in his explanation of the origin of spontaneously-generated forms (Aristotle, De generatione animalium, III: 762a, 20���35).

This theory of the passing on of soul-as-substantial form in generation also formed the basis of one meaning of ���species��� (eidos) in Aristotle���s biological works. ���Species��� in this sense denotes the individualized en-mattered form-as-soul that is perpetuated in generation eternally. Although connected by a complex theory of mental abstraction to the universal in thought and language, a biological species is not a universal, but an eternal serial sequence of one individual generating another individual (De Anima, II: 415b, 1���10). The importance of this meaning of eidos as distinct from the concept of a universal in thought and language bears on several issues explored in Sections 3.3 and 3.4 below.

This excerpt delves into Aristotle's contribution to early evolutionary thought, focusing on his unique perspective on teleology and the concept of species. Here are the key points:
Aristotle's Internal Teleology
:
Aristotle replaced the idea of an external designer-creator with an internal teleological purpose.
This internal purpose is associated with the action of an internal cause, the soul (psuche), which he considered the formal, final, and efficient cause of life.
Aristotle's View on the Eternity of the World
:
Contrary to the idea of a historical origin of the world, Aristotle asserted the world's eternity, a view that became widely accepted in later interpretations of his work.
Embryogenesis and Species Development
:
Aristotle extensively explored embryogenesis, which had significant implications for later discussions on species development.
In his view, sexual generation and embryological development occur sequentially in time, guided by the teleological action of the soul.
The soul-as-form, typically derived from the male parent, is responsible for the development of the individual from primordial matter.
Theory of Soul-as-Substantial Form in Generation
:
Aristotle's theory of passing on the soul-as-substantial form in generation laid the groundwork for one meaning of ���species��� (eidos) in his biological works.
He defined "species" as the individualized form-as-soul materialized in generation, perpetuated eternally through reproduction.
Eidos and Biological Species Concept
:
In Aristotle���s understanding, a biological species is not a universal concept but an eternal sequence of individual generations.
This interpretation of eidos as distinct from the concept of a universal in thought and language is significant for understanding later sections of the article, particularly Sections 3.3 and 3.4.
Aristotle's perspectives on teleology, embryogenesis, and the concept of species played a foundational role in shaping the early stages of evolutionary thought, offering a unique viewpoint that contrasted with other philosophical traditions of his time.

1.2 Medieval Revisions
The implications of Aristotle���s complex thought for subsequent discussions of species, generated by the recovery of his writings in the Latin West in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, were varied. On one hand, Aristotle���s apparent metaphysical requirement that the soul-as-form (eidos) be permanent and enduring through the process of the generation of ���like by like��� seemed for much of the tradition to amount to a denial of the possibility that natural species could change over time in their essential properties, even though local adaptation in ���accidental��� properties was fully possible. Since individual beings were considered to be dynamic composites of a material substrate and an immaterial and eternal form, the accidental differentiation of the substantial form in individuals did not affect the metaphysical endurance of the species. It also made species extinction metaphysically impossible. In living beings, the soul-as-form is serially passed on through time in the act of generation to create an eternal continuity of the form. This supplied a metaphysical foundation for the notion of species permanence without reliance on an external creative agency.

In the background of the discussion of the high middle ages was also the theory of divine creation endorsed in inherited Jewish, Christian and Islamic thought. This required a distinction between the first origin of species in historical time, and the normal generation of the individual. If the origin of species was attributed to divine action, the temporal emergence of these species was not necessarily instantaneous. Such a doctrine was the basis of Augustine of Hippo���s (354���430) theory of the original creation of primordial seeds (rationes seminales) of each species at an original moment in time, but with the emergence of species in historical time a possibility (Augustine, VI.13.23���25, [GL, 175���76]). This theory of a temporalized creation, put forth explicitly in detail in his treatise The Literal Interpretation of Genesis, allowed Augustine to argue that species emerged sequentially in historical time rather than all at once.

The great textual recoveries in the Latin West of Greek science, medicine and philosophy of the twelfth through the fifteenth centuries, generally accompanied by Islamic commentaries, introduced these texts into a theological context that had been strongly defined by Augustinianism and neo-Platonism. The interplay between this pre-existent tradition with new philosophical views defined a complex period of intellectual ferment that defined much of the subsequent intellectual and scientific history of the West (Gaukroger 2006: chp. 2). The sustained efforts of major synthesizers, such as Thomas Aquinas (1225���1274), to bring the massive body of newly-recovered Aristotelian works into dialogue with Christian Neo-Platonism and Augustinianism, demanded new insights into the conception of the soul-body relation, the autonomy of the natural order and the role of secondary causes in the creation of the world.

The section "1.2 Medieval Revisions" in the article on "Evolutionary Thought Before Darwin" explores how medieval thinkers revisited and revised Aristotle's ideas in the context of species and their change over time. Here are the main points:
Impact of Aristotle���s Writings in the Latin West
:
Aristotle's works, recovered in the 12th and 13th centuries, had varied implications on the medieval understanding of species.
His concept of the soul-as-form (eidos) being permanent and enduring suggested to many that natural species could not change their essential properties over time, though adaptation in non-essential (accidental) properties was acknowledged.
Species Permanence and Extinction
:
Medieval interpretations of Aristotle typically held that species were metaphysically permanent, making species extinction impossible.
The soul-as-form was believed to be passed on through generations, ensuring a continuous existence of the species.
Influence of Religious Doctrines
:
Discussions in the High Middle Ages were influenced by Jewish, Christian, and Islamic views on divine creation.
The distinction between the original creation of species and the normal generation of individuals was important in these religious contexts.
Augustine���s Theory of Temporalized Creation
:
Augustine of Hippo proposed that species were created as primordial seeds at the beginning of time, but emerged sequentially in historical time.
This view allowed for a gradual appearance of species, rather than an instantaneous creation.
Integration of Greek Science and Christian Thought
:
The recovery of Greek scientific and philosophical texts, often with Islamic commentaries, introduced these ideas into a theological context shaped by Augustinianism and Neo-Platonism.
This period was marked by intellectual ferment, as scholars sought to reconcile new philosophical ideas with existing religious doctrines.
Role of Major Synthesizers Like Thomas Aquinas
:
Thinkers like Thomas Aquinas worked to integrate the newly recovered Aristotelian works with Christian Neo-Platonism and Augustinianism.
This required new insights into the soul-body relationship, the autonomy of the natural order, and the role of secondary causes in creation.
This section highlights the complex interplay between ancient philosophy, particularly Aristotle���s ideas, and the religious and intellectual milieu of the medieval period, shaping the Western understanding of species and their change over time.

Concerning the issue of species-permanence and origin, Aquinas treated this in dialogue with Augustine���s theory of serial creation. As he comments in his major synthesis, the Summa Theologiae: ���New species, if they appear, pre-exist in certain active powers��� (Pars I, Qu. 73, Rep Obj. 3). This claim suggests a reading of Aristotle that assumed the essential fixity of each definable substantial form, and the eternity of each species since creation. But this conclusion must be read in the context of Aquinas���s complex theory of creation and the discussions of the problem of universals in late Scholastic philosophy (see the entry medieval problem of universals, and Wilkins 2009: Ch. 3). This context prevents any simple picture of Scholastic thought concerning the issue of species permanence, and it cannot be claimed that either Aristotle or later Scholastics such as Aquinas are responsible for the strong ���essentialist��� position often attributed to them in the literature (R. A. Richards 2010: chp. 2). As developed below (2.2), it can be argued that the species concept was ���hardened��� only in the early modern period with the rise of the mechanical philosophy and its attendant preformationist embryology. The ���strong essentialist��� position often attributed to Aristotle and Scholasticism (Hull, 1965), is demonstrably a product of later historical developments (R.A. Richards 2010; Wilkins 2009; Oderberg 2007: chp. 9; Winsor 2006; Lennox 1985, 1987, 2001).

2. Early Modern Foundations
2.1 Cartesian History of Nature
The re-introduction of Greek and Roman atomism in the Renaissance, with the recovery (1417) and printing (1473) of Lucretius���s philosophical poem On the Nature of Things (Lucretius, [1968]), introduced to a literate European audience a series of influential cosmological speculations that included a naturalistic account of the origin of species integrated into a non-teleological materialist cosmology that contrasted markedly with the received Scholastic, Aristotelian, and Augustinian-Platonic traditions. Into the eighteenth century, these speculations, and those drawn from other atomist sources (see the entry on natural philosophy in the Renaissance), were often in the background of novel early modern reflections on species origins and their possible transformation in time (Bowler 2003: chp. 2; Oldroyd 1996; Greene 1959).

A new starting point in systematic reflections on the origin of the earth and living beings, showing both some similarity and also major differences from atomist speculations, dates specifically from the synthesis of natural philosophy and metaphysics put forth by Ren�� Descartes (1596���1650) in his Principia philosophiae (1st ed. 1644; 2nd ed. 1647). This treatise expanded and summarized issues he had developed earlier in Le Monde (The World, or Treatise on Light), a work published only posthumously in 1664, with an improved edition appearing in 1677.

The section you've provided covers two key areas: Thomas Aquinas's views on species permanence and the early modern foundations of evolutionary thought, particularly focusing on Cartesian history of nature. Here's a detailed look at each part:
Concerning Species-Permanence and Origin in the Context of Aquinas
Aquinas and Augustine's Theory of Serial Creation
:
Aquinas engaged with Augustine���s concept of species creation, suggesting that new species pre-exist in "active powers."
His interpretation of Aristotle assumed the essential fixity and eternal nature of species since creation.
Complex Theory of Creation and Universals
:
Aquinas's views must be understood in the context of his broader theory of creation and the medieval problem of universals.
This complexity indicates that neither Aristotle nor Aquinas fully supported the strong essentialist view often attributed to them in later literature.
Misinterpretation of Aristotle and Scholasticism
:
The strong essentialist position often linked to Aristotle and Scholasticism, such as that of Aquinas, is actually a product of later historical developments.
This misinterpretation is challenged by various scholars, who argue that the species concept was solidified only in the early modern period.
Early Modern Foundations
Re-introduction of Greek and Roman Atomism
:
The Renaissance saw a revival of ancient atomism, especially with the recovery and printing of Lucretius���s "On the Nature of Things."
This work provided a naturalistic account of species origin within a non-teleological materialist cosmology, contrasting with Scholastic and Aristotelian traditions.
Descartes��� Synthesis in Natural Philosophy
:
Ren�� Descartes offered a new perspective on the origin of the earth and living beings.
His "Principia philosophiae" and "Le Monde" put forth a synthesis of natural philosophy and metaphysics, differing from atomist speculations.
These sections highlight the transition from medieval to early modern thinking about species and their origins. Aquinas's interpretation of Aristotle and Augustine laid foundational thoughts that were later reinterpreted, while the re-introduction of atomism and Descartes's work marked significant shifts in the understanding of species origins, setting the stage for future developments in evolutionary thought.

It is important for understanding the subsequent reflections on the ���history��� of nature to recognize that these Cartesian speculations on the history of the earth and solar system were introduced in the form of a counter-factual hypothesis that explicitly sought to avoid conflict with accepted theological interpretations of origins (Descartes 1647 [1983: 181]). In the hypothetical account offered in the Principles of Philosophy, Descartes derived the earth from a cooled star ���formerly���like the Sun��� (ibid.). By its gradual solidification in a great celestial vortex, the Earth took form. Subsequent drying and cracking formed the ocean basins, the continents and the mountain ranges.

An outstanding lacuna in Descartes���s account, however, was his failure to incorporate the origins of living beings into his naturalistic story of creation by natural law. Although manuscripts display the degree to which Descartes attempted on several occasions to work out some linkage between his general natural philosophy and the embryological formation of living beings, these reflections did not appear in print during his lifetime (Aucante 2006). The Principles simply skips over the issue of a naturalistic account of the origins of life and the origin of individual species. Instead in Part IV, devoted generally to the origin and physical properties of the Earth, he jumps (Proposition 188) from a discussion of magnetism to a brief allusion to projected Parts V and VI of his Principles that would deal with animals and humans (Descartes 1647 [1983: 275���276]). But the Principles only offers a brief discussion of the various senses and body-soul interaction similar to that put forth in his early unpublished Treatise on Man (1st Latin ed. 1662, 2nd French ed. 1664). These speculations were grounded on the concept of a hypothetical statue- machine created directly by divine action, and possessed immediately of all human functions and structures (Descartes 1664 [1972: 1���5]).

Descartes���s speculations conveyed to his successors at least two issues relevant to the origin and history of living species. First, by presenting the historical account of the origin of the solar system and the world as a counterfactual hypothesis, a means of understanding the history of nature adapted to the limitations of the human mind, rather than as a literally true account, Descartes developed the grounds for a purely fictionalist reading of historical science that persisted into the nineteenth century (Sloan 2006a). Second, the integration of living beings into the new natural philosophy of mechanistic naturalism was left unresolved. If anything, Descartes���s reflections accentuated the problem of providing a naturalistic explanation of the origins of living beings.

Two traditions can be traced in the wake of Descartes���s reflections. Beginning with the De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus of 1669 [1916] by the Danish Cartesian Nicholas Steno (1638���86), efforts commenced to draw the historical origins of living beings into the Cartesian cosmology, in this case primarily by granting that fossils were the remains of once existing organisms on an earth that had formed historically. There was, however, no effort made to account for the origins of these beings on Cartesian principles (Steno 1669 [1916], Rudwick 1972, 2005).

The passage delves into Ren�� Descartes' influence on early modern thoughts about the history of nature and the origins of life, highlighting two significant aspects of his work:
Cartesian Speculations as Counterfactual Hypotheses
:
Descartes introduced his ideas on the history of the earth and the solar system as hypothetical narratives, carefully designed to avoid conflict with prevailing theological views.
In his "Principles of Philosophy," he proposed a natural history of the Earth���s formation, describing it as a cooled star forming into the Earth through solidification in a celestial vortex.
Descartes' Treatment of the Origins of Life
:
A major gap in Descartes's account was his lack of explanation for the origins of living beings within his naturalistic framework.
Although he attempted to link his natural philosophy to the embryological formation of living beings in unpublished manuscripts, these ideas were not included in his published works.
The "Principles of Philosophy" largely skips the issue of life origins, jumping from discussions of magnetism to human senses and body-soul interactions.
Impact of Descartes' Speculations
:
Descartes��� approach allowed for a fictionalist interpretation of historical science, which influenced scientific thought into the 19th century.
He left unresolved the integration of living beings into the mechanistic naturalism of his philosophy, accentuating the challenge of providing a naturalistic explanation for the origins of life.
Subsequent Traditions Influenced by Descartes
:
Following Descartes, thinkers like Nicholas Steno began efforts to incorporate the historical origins of living beings into Cartesian cosmology.
Steno's work, for instance, acknowledged fossils as remains of once-living organisms on a historically formed Earth, but did not extend to explaining their origins based on Cartesian principles.
Descartes' hypotheses and the ensuing intellectual developments played a crucial role in shaping early modern perspectives on nature's history and the origins of species, laying a foundation for future scientific exploration and debate in these areas.

A second tradition sought to give a ���realist��� interpretation of the history of the earth by reconciling this with the account of Genesis. Such a synthesis was the specific effort of the English clergyman, Thomas Burnet (1635���1715). Burnet sought to reconcile a Cartesian-derived historical account of the origins of the Earth with the creation account of the Mosaic tradition. In Burnet���s account, the Earth began from an original chaos fashioned by divine action into the existing Earth through a series of changes that involved the gradual separation of the continents, the reversal of the poles, and the Mosaic flood. To explain the origin of living beings, Burnet relied on the ���spontaneous fruitfulness of the ground��� in the primeval Edenic world, similar to the Augustine theory of the created rationales seminales, rather than on the direct creation of complete forms through divine action (Burnet 1684: bk 2, chp. 2, para. 4, p. 187 [1965: 141]). By connecting this account to the Biblical story of the first chapter of Genesis, Burnet broke with Cartesian counterfactualism, offering for the first time a presumably literal interpretation of a Cartesian-style developmental history of nature that also included the origins of living forms.

The passage describes a second tradition in early modern thought regarding the history of the Earth and the origins of life, which attempted to reconcile scientific ideas with Biblical accounts. This tradition is exemplified by the work of English clergyman Thomas Burnet:
Thomas Burnet's Synthesis
:
Burnet aimed to merge a Cartesian-inspired historical account of the Earth's origins with the Biblical creation story from Genesis.
His work represents an effort to integrate scientific thought with religious doctrine.
Burnet���s Account of Earth���s History
:
According to Burnet, the Earth originated from chaos, shaped by divine action into its current form through a series of changes.
These changes included the gradual separation of continents, a reversal of the poles, and the Biblical flood as described in the story of Noah.
Origin of Living Beings in Burnet's View
:
For explaining the origin of life, Burnet suggested a concept akin to Augustine's "rationales seminales" ��� the idea that the ground in the primeval Edenic world was spontaneously fruitful.
This contrasts with the idea of direct creation of complete forms by divine action.
Burnet's Approach to Genesis and Cartesian Thought
:
By aligning his scientific narrative with the first chapter of Genesis, Burnet diverged from the Cartesian approach of presenting historical accounts as counterfactual hypotheses.
He offered what he presumed to be a literal interpretation of a developmental history of nature, in the style of Cartesian philosophy, but also encompassing the origins of living forms.
Thomas Burnet's work represents a significant attempt in the early modern period to create a cohesive understanding of the Earth's history and the origins of life that harmonized emerging scientific views with Biblical narratives. This approach reflects the broader intellectual effort of the time to reconcile religious beliefs with the advancements in natural philosophy.
