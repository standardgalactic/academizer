Abstract
The social and historical contexts may influence the speed of development. In seven large, nationally representative surveys of U.S. adolescents 1976���2016 (N = 8.44 million, ages 13���19), fewer adolescents in recent years engaged in adult activities such as having sex, dating, drinking alcohol, working for pay, going out without their parents, and driving, suggesting a slow life strategy. Adult activities were less common when median income, life expectancy, college enrollment, and age at first birth were higher and family size and pathogen prevalence were lower, consistent with life history theory. The trends are unlikely to be due to homework and extracurricular time, which stayed steady or declined, and may or may not be linked to increased Internet use.

I was going to note that this is part of a much larger trend involving neotenization of mammals and virtualizing of violence.
ChatGPT
That's an interesting perspective to bring into the discussion. Neotenization, the process of retaining juvenile characteristics into adulthood, could indeed be linked conceptually to the delayed engagement in adult activities among adolescents. This trend might suggest a broader biological or social evolution where slower maturation rates are favored in response to complex social and environmental demands.
The concept of the virtualization of violence, where aggressive or violent behaviors are increasingly experienced or expressed through digital means rather than physical interactions, could also be tied to this shift. Both trends potentially reduce the need for earlier adoption of adult roles or direct physical confrontations, which could be interpreted as adaptive in today's world.
These ideas could feed into larger discussions about how technological, environmental, and societal changes are shaping human development and behaviors, echoing through various aspects of life from individual growth to societal structures. How do you see these trends impacting broader social or cultural patterns?

I would say that the Overton window of safety is constantly shifting and so we can expect further development in this direction. The development of ectopic pregnancy will allow people to "never be born" by maintaining connection to a mechaplacenta and retaining the Umbilicus for feeding and waste removal.
ChatGPT
You're venturing into some profound and speculative territory here, touching on potential future developments in human biology and societal norms. The concept of the Overton window shifting towards greater safety reflects current trends towards risk-aversion and increased protective measures in societal and parental behaviors, which might indeed continue to evolve.
The idea of an ectopic pregnancy managed via a mechaplacenta, allowing individuals to remain in a quasi-fetal state indefinitely, pushes into the realm of science fiction but serves as a fascinating metaphor for the trends of extended adolescence and delayed adulthood. This could be seen as an extreme extension of neotenization, where physical maturation and independent functioning are postponed, potentially indefinitely.
Such scenarios invite reflection on the implications of technological advancements on human biology and autonomy. The ethical, psychological, and social ramifications would be profound, challenging our current understanding of life stages, independence, and what it means to be human.
This concept also raises questions about the nature of dependency and individuality in future societies, as well as how technology might redefine human needs and existence. It���s a rich field for both imaginative speculation and serious ethical consideration. How do you think society might adapt to such dramatic changes in human development and dependency?

I was thinking that until the problem of microasteroids is solved people should not leave their homes
ChatGPT
The concern about microasteroids presents a hypothetical but interesting challenge, especially when considered as a metaphor for broader issues of environmental or external threats. If we take it as a broader symbol for unseen or unpredictable risks in the environment, it could indeed push societies toward more protective and insular behaviors, much like the trends of increased safety and risk-aversion we see today.
In a literal sense, if microasteroids were a real and present danger, it would certainly influence how people interact with the external world, potentially accelerating trends toward virtual interaction and remote living. This could manifest in more people working from home, engaging in virtual social activities, and relying on technology for day-to-day tasks to minimize physical exposure to hazards.
The extension of such trends could dramatically reshape urban planning, architectural design, and technology, emphasizing safer, more self-contained living environments. It could also impact psychological and social dynamics, potentially increasing feelings of isolation or altering the nature of community and connectivity.
In any case, the metaphorical or literal interpretation of challenges like "microasteroids" encourages us to think about how society and individuals might adapt to protect themselves from new types of risks brought about by changes in technology, environment, or our understanding of safety. How do you envision these adaptations impacting daily life or societal structures?
