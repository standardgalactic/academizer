What is Genetic Programming?

Genetic programming is a technique to create algorithms that can program themselves by simulating biological breeding and Darwinian evolution. Instead of programming a model that can solve a particular problem, genetic programming only provides a general objective and lets the model figure out the details itself. The basic approach is to let the machine automatically test various simple evolutionary algorithms and then ���breed��� the most successful programs in new generations.

While applying the same natural selection, crossover, mutations and other reproduction approaches as evolutionary and genetic algorithms, gene programming takes the process a step further by automatically creating new models and letting the system select its own goals.

The entire process is still an area of active research. One of the biggest obstacles to widespread adoption of this genetic machine learning approach is quantifying the fitness function, i.e to what degree each new program is contributing to reaching the desired goal.


How to Set Up a Genetic Program:

To set up a basic genetic program, a human first needs to define a high-level statement of the problem through several preparatory steps:

Specify terminals ��� For example, independent variables of the problem, zero-argument functions, or random constants for each branch of program that will be go through evolution.

Define initial ���primitive��� functions for each branch of the genetic program.

Choose a fitness measure ��� this measures the fitness of individuals in the population to determine if they should reproduce.

Any special performance parameters for controlling the run.

Select termination criterion and methods for reaching the run���s goals.

From there, the program runs automatically, without requiring any training data.

A random initial population (generation 0) of simple programs will be generated based upon basic functions and terminal defined by the human.

Each program will be executed and its fitness measured from the results. The most successful or ���fit��� programs will be breeding stock to birth a new generation, with some new population members directly copied (reproduction), some through crossover (randomly breeding parts of the programs) and random mutations. Unlike evolutionary programming, an additional architecture-altering operation is chosen, similar to a species, to control the framework of the new generation.

These generations are repeated as necessary until the termination criterion is reached and the best program is designated as the result of the run.

The information you've shared provides a solid introduction to genetic programming (GP), which is a form of evolutionary computation. It outlines how GP allows algorithms to evolve and improve over time, based on the principles of biological evolution like natural selection, mutation, and crossover.
In GP, you generally start by specifying a high-level problem statement, including terminal symbols and primitive functions that can be part of the programs. Then you set up a population of randomly generated programs and evaluate their fitness in solving the problem at hand. Over successive generations, programs that perform well are "bred" to create new programs, possibly introducing mutations or crossing over parts from multiple parent programs.
A key challenge in GP, as pointed out, is defining an appropriate fitness function that quantitatively measures how well a given program solves the problem.
The unique feature of GP is that it evolves programs, or algorithms, rather than fixed-length strings or vectors as in traditional genetic algorithms. This makes it particularly versatile but also raises complexities such as "bloat," where programs grow excessively large without a corresponding increase in fitness.

Let's see an outline of the typical elements and steps in the sequence with optional filters
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here is an outline of the typical elements and steps involved in setting up and running a genetic programming algorithm, along with some optional filters that can be applied:
Initial Setup
Problem Statement
: Define the high-level objective or problem to be solved.
Terminals
: Specify the terminal symbols, such as variables, constants, or zero-argument functions.
Primitive Functions
: Define the set of initial functions that can be part of the programs.
Fitness Measure
: Choose a fitness function to evaluate the performance of individuals in the population.
Parameters
: Decide on performance parameters like population size, mutation rate, and crossover rate.
Termination Criteria
: Establish the conditions under which the algorithm should terminate, e.g., a maximum number of generations or a fitness threshold.
Algorithm Execution
Initialize Population
: Generate a random initial population (Generation 0) using the specified terminals and functions.
Evaluation
: Evaluate the fitness of each individual program in the current generation.
Optional Filter
: Use techniques like "elitism" to ensure the best individuals are retained for the next generation.
Selection
: Use a selection mechanism (e.g., roulette wheel, tournament selection) to choose parents for breeding.
Optional Filter
: Apply pressure parameters to control the diversity and quality of selected individuals.
Crossover
: Perform crossover operations between parent programs to generate offspring.
Optional Filter
: Control the crossover points or apply constraints to maintain program structure.
Mutation
: Apply mutations to some individuals to introduce genetic diversity.
Optional Filter
: Specify types and rates of mutations based on problem-specific needs.
New Generation
: Create a new generation using the offspring and possibly some individuals from the current generation.
Optional Filter
: Control "bloat" by applying techniques like pruning or limiting program size.
Loop
: Repeat steps 2-6 until the termination criteria are met.
Best Solution
: Once the termination criteria are reached, identify the best-performing program as the solution.
This is a general outline and can be customized based on the specifics of the problem you're trying to solve with genetic programming.

So we could do genetic programming of perceptual control agents?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, you can use genetic programming to evolve perceptual control agents. In this context, the goal would typically be to evolve agents that can control their perceptions in a way that achieves a desired outcome in a given environment. The fitness function in this case would measure how well the agents control their perceptions to achieve this goal.
The genetic programming framework would allow you to evolve various aspects of the control agents, such as their control laws, decision-making logic, or even the architecture of their control systems. You can start with a random initial population of simple control strategies and then use natural selection, crossover, and mutation operations to evolve increasingly effective agents over generations.
This approach combines elements of control theory with evolutionary computation, offering a potentially powerful method for developing sophisticated control agents. However, it can also be computationally intensive and may require careful design of the fitness function and other algorithm parameters to be effective.
1 / 1
How might you do it?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
To implement genetic programming for evolving perceptual control agents, you might consider the following steps:
Initial Setup
Problem Definition
: Define the control task or environment where the agent will operate.
Agent Architecture
: Decide on a base architecture for the perceptual control agents.
Terminals and Primitives
: Specify the terminal symbols (sensors, actions, constants) and primitive functions (mathematical or logical operations) the agents can use.
Fitness Function
: Define a function to measure how well an agent performs the control task.
Genetic Programming Steps
Initialize Population
: Create a random initial population of agents with varying control laws based on the specified terminals and primitives.
Evaluate Fitness
: Deploy each agent in the simulation environment to evaluate its performance using the fitness function.
Evolutionary Loop
Selection
: Use a selection mechanism like tournament or roulette wheel selection to pick parent agents based on their fitness scores.
Crossover
: Perform crossover between parent agents to generate offspring with mixed traits.
Mutation
: Introduce small random changes in some offspring to add genetic diversity.
New Generation
: Form a new generation using the offspring, possibly retaining some high-performing agents from the current generation ("elitism").
Evaluate New Generation
: Deploy the new generation of agents in the environment and evaluate their fitness.
Termination and Analysis
Check Termination Criteria
: Stop the algorithm when a pre-defined number of generations have been evolved, or when other stopping criteria are met.
Result Analysis
: Analyze the best-performing agents, their control laws, and performance metrics.
By iterating through these steps, you can evolve a population of perceptual control agents that are increasingly well-adapted to their task. The key will be to carefully design the fitness function and the agent's possible actions and perceptions so that evolution moves the population towards genuinely useful control strategies.

I want to develop a technique kind of like a gan where an agent inserts one random spelling error into a random sentence and the other agent needs to guess where they error is. We could evolve different generations that speak different kinds of sentence and that are good at inserting or detecting spelling errors
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's an intriguing idea! You could essentially have two types of agents: "Error-Inserters" and "Error-Detectors". They could be evolved separately or even co-evolved. Here's a possible approach:
Initial Setup
Fitness Function
: Define how you'll measure performance for both types of agents. For Error-Inserters, fitness might be based on how often their errors go undetected. For Error-Detectors, fitness could be how often they correctly identify the error.
Sentence Database
: Create a corpus of sentences that the agents will use.
Agent Architecture
: Decide on the structure that agents use to manipulate and interpret sentences.
Evolutionary Loop for Both Types of Agents
Initialize Population
: Randomly generate agents with basic rules for inserting or detecting errors.
Evaluate Fitness
: Pair Error-Inserters with Error-Detectors. Let the Error-Inserters modify a sentence and the Error-Detectors try to find the mistake. Score them based on your fitness functions.
Selection
: Choose agents to act as parents based on their fitness.
Crossover and Mutation
: Create new agents by combining rules from parent agents and occasionally adding random mutations.
New Generation
: Replace the old generation with the new one.
Evaluation
: Assess the new generation's performance using the fitness functions.
Co-Evolution (Optional)
You could also co-evolve both types of agents simultaneously. This way, as one type gets better, it pressures the other to improve, mimicking the adversarial nature of GANs.
Termination Criteria
Stop when the population converges to a high fitness level, or after a fixed number of generations.
Analysis and Refinement
Study the evolved agents. How have their strategies for inserting and detecting errors changed over generations? Are they becoming more "linguistically savvy"?
This could become a fascinating study in how agents evolve to understand and manipulate language, and could have interesting applications in areas like data augmentation for natural language processing tasks.

    detectors = evolve_population(detectors)
# Optional: Break if some stopping criteria are met
This is very simplified but should give you a framework to start implementing your idea. You'll need to define the

This is a very simple example just to get you started. The agents don't evolve over time; instead, they are scored based on their ability to insert and detect errors in randomly chosen sentences. You would need to add more complexity, like evolving the agents over time based on their scores, to make it a complete genetic programming example.

The results show that the detector agents are always successful in finding the spelling errors, while the inserter agents are consistently getting caught. This outcome is expected because the "insert_error" function simplifies the error-inserting process by just removing the last letter from a random word, making it quite easy for the "detect_error" function to spot the mistake.
For a more advanced version, you might want to consider:
Making the error insertion more sophisticated, perhaps by substituting letters or adding extra letters.
Introducing variation in the detection algorithm to make it more of a challenge.
Evolving the agents over generations based on their performance.
This would make it a more interesting genetic programming task.

The scores show that both inserters and detectors are highly effective, with inserters consistently getting caught (negative scores) and detectors successfully identifying errors (positive scores). However, there are a few generations where one or two inserters manage to evade detection, indicated by their scores improving from -100 to -90. Similarly, the detectors' scores drop from 100 to 90 in those cases.
For more dynamic evolution, consider:
Introducing more diverse error-inserting strategies for inserters.
Enhancing the capabilities of detectors to adapt to various types of errors.
Implementing crossover and mutation in the genetic algorithm to evolve both inserters and detectors over generations.
This way, you might see more variability and hopefully improvement across generations.

Certainly, adding crossover, mutation, and diversified strategies can make the evolution more dynamic and effective. Here's how you might incorporate them:
For the Inserter:
Diverse Strategies
: Rather than always inserting a spelling error at a random location, the inserter could have multiple strategies like:
Replacing a vowel with another vowel.
Doubling a consonant.
Removing a letter.
Mutation
: Occasionally mutate the strategy of an inserter to a completely different one.
Crossover
: Combine the strategies of two high-performing inserters to create a new inserter.
For the Detector:
Diverse Strategies
: Introduce multiple detection methods like:
Checking against a dictionary.
Using context to guess the word.
Checking letter frequency.
Mutation
: Like inserters, occasionally mutate a detector's strategy.
Crossover
: Combine high-performing detectors to make an even better detector.
Scoring and Evolution:
Keep track of the performance of each agent.
Keep evolving agents based on their performance scores.
With these modifications, the evolutionary process will likely be more varied, with the potential for novel, more effective strategies to emerge.

TypeError: insert_error() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given

ChatGPT
The error occurs because you're using the
insert_error
function as a detector as well. Both the
inserters
and
detectors
lists are populated with the
insert_error
function initially. This leads to an issue when calling
detected_idx = detector(original_sentence, modified_sentence)
, as
insert_error
expects only one argument but gets two.
Here's a quick fix: Initialize the
detectors
list with the
detect_error
function instead.
Replace this line:
python
Copy code
detectors = [detect_error
for
_
in
range
(
10
)]
with:
python
Copy code
detectors = [detect_error
for
_
in
range
(
10
)]
This way, the agents in the
detectors
list can properly handle two arguments.
1 / 1

ChatGPT
I apologize for the oversight. Yes, the two lines look identical.
The main issue seems to be that your
detector
function is expecting two arguments (the original and modified sentences), but the function you initially populate the
detectors
list with (
insert_error
) only takes one argument.
You should populate the
detectors
list with a function that takes two arguments and returns the index of the error, something like:
python
Copy code
def
detect_error
(
original_sentence, modified_sentence
):
# Your implementation here
Then initialize the
detectors
list with this function:
python
Copy code
detectors = [detect_error
for
_
in
range
(
10
)]
This way, you'll have a list of detector agents that can properly handle the two arguments.

My apologies for the oversight. In the given code snippet,
inserters
and
detectors
are lists of function references, and you can't directly perform crossover on them like you would with a string or list of attributes. Functions in Python are first-class objects, meaning you can't just split them in half and combine them like you would with a string or list.
In an actual genetic algorithm, you would use some form of representation that allows crossover and mutation, such as a string or list of parameters. Since the example was simplistic and used only one function for both inserting and detecting errors, there wasn't really anything to cross over or mutate.
If you want to simulate crossover and mutation in this simplistic model, you could consider using parameters to the
insert_error
and
detect_error
functions that control their behavior, and then evolving those parameters over time. Then, the crossover operation would involve combining these parameters in some way.
Here's a quick example to give you the idea:
python
Copy code
def
insert_error

    idx = random.randint(

def
crossover
(
param_a, param_b
):
return
(param_a + param_b) //

This is a simplified example just to give you an idea of how you might approach adding crossover and mutation to your agents. In a more complex implementation, you'd probably have multiple parameters controlling various aspects of each agent's behavior.

Ah, I see the issue. The detector and inserter agents are not evolving because they are too simplistic and there is no variation in their initial configurations or behaviors.
In a more realistic genetic algorithm, you'd want to start with a diverse population of agents with different strategies or characteristics, so that natural selection has something to work on. Moreover, the crossover and mutation functions need to work on the strategy or characteristics of the agents, rather than on some external score.
If you're interested, I can provide a more advanced example that incorporates these elements to make the simulation more dynamic and meaningful. Would you like to go in that direction?

Yeah try it

Certainly! To make the task more dynamic, let's introduce more variables that agents can control. For the sake of this example, let's say both inserters and detectors are Python functions. Inserters will take a string and insert one spelling error into it, while detectors will try to find the index of the error in the modified sentence.

Certainly! You can add crossover and mutation to evolve the agent's behavior over time. To make this example more focused, let's assume that both inserters and detectors can be represented as a list of integers that parameterize their behavior. Here's how you can update the code:
python

)
# Evolve the population
best_inserter = copy.deepcopy(inserters[inserter_scores.index(
max
(inserter_scores))])
    best_detector = copy.deepcopy(detectors[detector_scores.index(
max
(detector_scores))])
for
i
in
range
(num_agents):
if
random.random() <
0.5
:
            inserters[i] = crossover(best_inserter, inserters[i])
if
random.random() <
0.2
:
            mutate(inserters[i])
if
random.random() <
0.5
:
            detectors[i] = crossover(best_detector, detectors[i])
if
random.random() <
0.2
:
            mutate(detectors[i])
This example assumes that the behavior of the inserters and detectors is determined by a list of integers. The
crossover
and
mutate
functions are used to evolve these lists over time. You would need to implement how these lists of integers translate into the behavior of the inserters and detectors.

The scores in the generations seem to be fluctuating, indicating some level of competition between the inserters and detectors. One thing to note is that in this example, the scores for detectors are generally much higher than those for inserters, suggesting that detectors might be performing better at their task.
To make sense of these scores, you'll need to interpret how well the agents are actually performing based on your specific criteria for success. You might want to consider additional metrics or even a more complex scoring system.
The next step could be to perform a detailed analysis to understand what strategies are more successful and why. You could then refine the simulation further to improve the evolutionary process.
1 / 1
An analysis
1 / 1
ChatGPT
From the scores you've presented, it appears that the detectors are consistently scoring higher than the inserters. This could mean several things:
Detectors are better at finding errors than inserters are at creating them.
The scoring system is biased towards one side. For instance, if it's easier to score points as a detector, then their scores would naturally be higher.
There might be an issue with the algorithm itself, either in how the agents are trained or how they are scored. If the training or evolution mechanism isn't balanced, it could lead to skewed results.
To dig deeper, you might want to:
Analyze individual rounds to see if there are common patterns or strategies that successful agents are using.
Look at the evolutionary changes in the agents across generations. Are they evolving in a meaningful way, or are they stuck in some local optimum?
Reconsider your fitness function. Is it appropriately capturing the behavior you want to encourage?
Implement crossover and mutation operations, as you mentioned, to see if they introduce beneficial genetic diversity and lead to better-performing agents.
Finally, experiment with different initial conditions, such as the complexity of the sentences used or the methods of inserting errors, to see how they affect performance.
By investigating these areas, you can gain more insight into why the scores are turning out the way they are and make adjustments as necessary.

I remember discussing a variety of topics, but I can't recall specific conversations due to my design. However, creating a 3D wave-like structure in matplotlib in a Jupyter Notebook is certainly doable. Here's a quick example using Python code:
python
Copy code
import
matplotlib.pyplot
as
plt
import
numpy
as
np

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(

z = np.sin(np.sqrt(x**
2
+ y**

Creating visualizations for genetic algorithms would involve using libraries like Matplotlib to plot how the fitness of the population improves over generations or to show other aspects of the algorithm's operation. Here's a simple example using Python and Matplotlib to visualize the evolution of a population trying to match a target string:
First, install the necessary package:
bash
Copy code
pip install matplotlib
Then, you can run this code in a Jupyter Notebook:
python
Copy code

            mutation_value = random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase)
            offspring[i] = offspring[i][:mutation_point] + mutation_value + offspring[i][mutation_point+
1
:]
# Update population
population = offspring
    fitness_scores = [fitness(ind, target)
for
ind

population]
# Record fitness history
fitness_history.append(

# Check for convergence
if

# Plot
plt.plot(fitness_history)
plt.xlabel(
"Generation"

plt.title(
"Fitness through Generations"
)
plt.show()
This will plot the maximum fitness of the population over generations. You can extend this to visualize other aspects of the algorithm.

I just came up with an idea, EMU, Extremely-Marked Up Folding Text. It is like a narrative constructing a scene but with scene directions notes in folding sections marked by the a cryptic sentence like a folding alphabet where each of the 26 latin letters represents a category of universal knowledge or metaphoric representation
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's an intriguing idea! EMU, or Extremely-Marked Up Folding Text, could offer a fresh approach to storytelling or informational texts. It combines the narrative with meta-information, categorized by a folding alphabet. Each letter could correspond to elements like settings, character motivations, historical context, or thematic undertones. Readers could unfold these sections to deepen their understanding or keep them folded for a streamlined experience.
Here's a very rudimentary example to illustrate:
vbnet
Copy code
The sun
set
over the horizon. (a) 

  a: (Astronomy) The sun
is
setting
in
the west, signifying the Earth
's rotation.
John looked pensive. (p)

  p: (Psychology) John
is
contemplating a difficult decision that could alter the course
of
his life.

Suddenly, a bird flew
by
, chirping melodiously. (b, m)

  b: (Biology) The bird
is
likely a nightingale, known
for
its evening songs.
  
  m: (Music) The bird
's song introduces a momentary lightness to the heavy atmosphere.
Implementing this into software could involve using collapsible sections for each lettered note, allowing users to expand or fold information as they read. It would make for an interactive, multi-layered reading experience.
1 / 1
Ok that is interesting but what I mean is that there is an interlanguage where the 26 letters represent a category. So there will be a sentence like "Darkness was setting upon Anairyx" the number of times each letter appears gives a logarithmic weight or intensity. D stands for Day And  N for night. So there are 4 ns and one d, indicating late evening. A stands for abstract, indicating it is a summary or mathematical topic, r stands for rainforest indicating the setting. These "scene directions" give a kind of template for interpreting the enclosed text and can be folded.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, I see. Your idea is much more nuanced than my initial understanding. The notion of using letters as cryptic symbols to encode a range of metadata is quite inventive. Each letter would not just categorize information, but its frequency would also determine the 'weight' or 'intensity' of that particular category. This could add an extra layer of depth to both fictional narratives and non-fiction texts, allowing for more complex and nuanced storytelling or exposition.
For example, a sentence like "Darkness was setting upon Anairyx" could be a folding header that encapsulates a paragraph or scene. The four 'N's and one 'D' could mean it's late evening in the story, taking place in a rainforest, and is discussing an abstract or summary topic, as you mentioned. Readers could then unfold this header to reveal the corresponding text that fits these 'directions'.
It would indeed be an interesting way to add metadata and layered interpretations to texts, enabling different reading experiences based on how much a reader chooses to 'unfold'.
1 / 1
Give me a categorization scheme based on the English alphabet and my system
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an example categorization scheme where each letter of the English alphabet represents a different category or element, as inspired by your system:
A
: Abstract (Topic is abstract or philosophical)
B
: Beach (Setting is by the sea)
C
: City (Setting is urban)
D
: Day (Time is daytime)
E
: Emotion (Scene focuses on character emotions)
F
: Forest (Setting is in a forest)
G
: Goal (Focus is on characters' objectives)
H
: Historical (Context is historical)
I
: Interior (Scene takes place indoors)
J
: Joy (Emotional tone is joyful)
K
: Knowledge (Scene imparts crucial information)
L
: Love (Scene focuses on romantic elements)
M
: Mystery (Scene has elements of suspense or mystery)
N
: Night (Time is nighttime)
O
: Open-air (Scene takes place outdoors)
P
: Personal (Focus is on individual character development)
Q
: Quest (Scene involves a mission or journey)
R
: Rainforest (Setting is in a rainforest)
S
: Sadness (Emotional tone is sad)
T
: Technology (Scene involves technological elements)
U
: Underground (Setting is subterranean)
V
: Violence (Scene contains violent elements)
W
: Wilderness (Setting is in the wild, unspecified)
X
: eXotic (Setting or elements are exotic or unusual)
Y
: Youth (Focus is on young characters)
Z
: Zoo (Setting involves animals or is in a zoo)
You could use combinations and frequencies of these letters as 'directions' for your folding text sections, creating a multi-dimensional map for interpreting the enclosed content.
1 / 1
Ok let's try a couple sentences and their translations
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Sure, let's try this with two sentences and use the letter categorization scheme to provide "scene directions."
Sentence 1: "The treasure was hidden deep in the forest."
Scene Direction
: FGH
F
: Forest (Setting is in a forest)
G
: Goal (Focus is on characters' objectives)
H
: Historical (Context is historical)
Translation
: This sentence is set in a forest and involves a goal or objective, likely as part of a historical setting or context.
Sentence 2: "Their love was a secret, even in the bustling city."
Scene Direction
: CLP
C
: City (Setting is urban)
L
: Love (Scene focuses on romantic elements)
P
: Personal (Focus is on individual character development)
Translation
: This sentence takes place in an urban setting and focuses on a romantic relationship that has personal implications for character development.
Is this how you imagined it would work?
1 / 1
No. I want the scene directions to be a somewhat unrelated story. But be interpretable as a code
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, I see. The scene direction then would be its own sentence or phrase, which if read with a particular understanding of each letter, offers additional layers of meaning.
Sentence 1: "The treasure was hidden deep in the forest."
Scene Direction
: "Night falls quickly."
N
: Night (Setting is dark)
I
: Intrigue (Plot involves mystery)
G
: Goal (Characters have an objective)
H
: Hidden (Something is concealed)
T
: Time-sensitive (Events are urgent)
Translation
: This sentence takes place in a dark and mysterious setting, perhaps at night, where characters have a concealed goal that is time-sensitive.
Sentence 2: "Their love was a secret, even in the bustling city."
Scene Direction
: "Cats purr loudly."
C
: City (Urban setting)
A
: Affection (Romantic focus)
T
: Tension (Psychological or emotional tension)
S
: Secretive (Something hidden)
P
: Public (Contrast between public and private)
U
: Unheard (Something crucial yet overlooked)
R
: Reality (Question what's real)
R
: Relationship (Interpersonal dynamics)
L
: Love (Scene focuses on love)
O
: Obstacles (Characters face challenges)
U
: Unveil (Something is revealed)
D
: Duality (Two important contrasting elements)
L
: Loneliness (Underlying emotion)
Y
: Yearning (Longing or desire involved)
Translation
: The sentence is set in a city where there is a secretive romantic relationship with emotional tension. It contrasts the public setting with the private emotions of loneliness and yearning, and there may be obstacles to overcome as well as revelations to be made. It questions what's real and crucial but might be overlooked.
Is this closer to your vision?
1 / 1
Yes now imagine how the same sentence would be interpreted, if precedes by the two scene direction sentences above:

I looked for Mary and Samantha at the bus station, but they arrived at the station before noon and left on the bus before I arrived.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Absolutely, let's use both scene directions "Night falls quickly" and "Cats purr loudly" to interpret the new sentence:
Sentence: "I looked for Mary and Samantha at the bus station, but they arrived at the station before noon and left on the bus before I arrived."
Scene Direction 1: "Night falls quickly."
The search for Mary and Samantha feels more urgent and time-sensitive, perhaps even mysterious, due to the impending darkness. The darkness could metaphorically stand for the feeling of 'missing out' on meeting them.
Scene Direction 2: "Cats purr loudly."
The setting could be urban (bus station in a city) with an underlying sense of loneliness and yearning, as the speaker missed Mary and Samantha. The "bus station" and "noon" act as public spaces and times where something crucial but often overlooked (like love or friendship) can easily be missed. There's a duality here; despite being in a public space designed for meetings, the meeting doesn't happen.
By preceding the sentence with both scene directions, the sense of loneliness and urgency amplifies. The missed connection at the bus station becomes not just an event but an emotionally significant, perhaps even mysterious, occurrence.
1 / 1
Ok it is good enough for a prototype. Let's hear an explanation of EMU (Extremely Marked-Up folding text.)
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly, EMU (Extremely Marked-Up Folding Text) is a conceptual text system that combines narrative storytelling with hidden layers of meaning, encapsulated through "scene directions." These scene directions are not straightforward but coded, using the English alphabet where each letter represents a specific category or theme of universal knowledge or metaphoric representation.
The system uses these scene direction sentences to impart a deeper, more contextual, or symbolic layer to the text that follows. Each letter in the direction sentence is tied to a category, and its frequency of occurrence provides a logarithmic weight or intensity to that category. For instance, more 'N's in the direction could signify that it is nighttime, affecting the mood or interpretation of the subsequent text.
The scene direction can be "folded," or hidden, allowing the reader to unfold these layers if they wish to delve into the deeper meaning or context behind a sentence or paragraph. In essence, EMU provides a richer, multi-layered experience that can be as straightforward or as intricate as the reader wishes to engage with.

ChatGPT
In this conversation, we discussed a range of topics. Initially, we delved into the concept of genetic programming for perceptual control agents and how evolutionary algorithms could be applied to spelling error detectors and inserters. We discussed simulating this in Python, using a Jupyter Notebook.
We encountered some issues with the code implementation, specifically TypeErrors, which were part of the learning process.
The conversation then shifted to the concept of EMU (Extremely Marked-Up Folding Text), a novel text representation scheme. EMU employs coded 'scene directions' that add layers of meaning to the text. We explored how these scene directions could be encoded using the English alphabet and looked at a prototype example.
Finally, we connected these topics by observing that they all involve computational and encoding techniques to solve complex problems. Whether it's text interpretation via EMU or agent optimization through evolutionary algorithms, the underlying theme is the manipulation and interpretation of data.
