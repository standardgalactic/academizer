Ok nice. Which ones line up with The peanut butter solution (1985)?
None of the scenarios listed previously seem to directly align with the plot of "The Peanut Butter Solution" (1985). In the movie, a boy loses his hair after a traumatic experience and is given a recipe for a magical peanut butter that can make hair grow back. However, he uses too much of the peanut butter and his hair grows out of control. The plot also involves ghosts and a haunted house, but not in the same way as scenario 31 ("A boy touches a stone and is transported to a world where he can talk to ghosts").
Ok, scenario 38 is similar, there are paintings that one can step into that are like real places.
Yes, you're right! Scenario 38 ("A woman steps into a painting and finds herself in a world of moving colors") does have some similarity to the plot of "The Peanut Butter Solution" in that both involve a fantastical world that can be accessed through a portal of some kind (a painting in scenario 38 and a magical peanut butter recipe in the movie). While the specifics of the two scenarios are different, they do share a similar concept of a portal to a magical world.
Yeah, at the end the main character traps the Signor in one of the paintings.
That's right! In the end of "The Peanut Butter Solution", the protagonist Michael traps the ghostly art collector Signor Sanguinetti in one of the paintings, which serves as a kind of prison for him. This further emphasizes the connection between the movie and scenario 38, where a woman steps into a painting and finds herself in a world of moving colors. Both involve a fantastical world accessed through a painting, and in "The Peanut Butter Solution", a painting serves as a prison for one of the characters.
And maybe Superman II, General Zod and others are imprisoned into a kind of mirror.
Yes, you're correct! In the movie "Superman II", the villainous General Zod and his cohorts are imprisoned in a kind of mirror-like structure called the Phantom Zone. This is similar to scenario 34 ("A woman discovers a mirror that reflects a different version of herself every time she touches it"), where a mirror serves as a portal to a different version of oneself. While the specifics of the two scenarios are different, they do share a similar concept of a mirror or reflective surface serving as a portal or prison.
Any sci fi short stories that have not been made into movies, that align?
Sure, here are a few sci-fi short stories that align with some of the scenarios:
"The Library of Babel" by Jorge Luis Borges: This short story imagines a vast library that contains every possible combination of letters and words. The protagonist of the story wanders through the endless stacks of books, searching for a specific text that will reveal the purpose of the library. This aligns with scenario 33 ("A man enters a room where the walls are made of books and the floor is a map of the world").
"The Electric Ant" by Philip K. Dick: This story follows the protagonist, Garson Poole, who discovers that he is not a human being, but rather an artificially created "electric ant" with the ability to manipulate reality. As he explores this new knowledge, he begins to question the nature of his own existence. This aligns with scenario 13 ("A man drinks a potion that allows him to see the hidden connections between all things").
"The Garden of Forking Paths" by Jorge Luis Borges: This story tells the tale of a Chinese spy in England during World War I, who uses a complex novel as a code for transmitting secret messages. As the story unfolds, the reader realizes that the novel is actually a labyrinthine web of possibilities, with multiple branching paths and outcomes. This aligns with scenario 4 ("A girl walks through a mist and enters a realm where time is circular").
"The Aleph" by Jorge Luis Borges: This story centers around a man named Carlos Argentino Daneri, who claims to have discovered a point in space that contains all other points. He calls this point "the Aleph," and he invites the protagonist of the story to come see it for himself. When the protagonist looks into the Aleph, he sees everything in the universe at once. This aligns with scenario 2 ("A woman discovers a door that leads to a room filled with floating orbs of light").
These are just a few examples, but there are many other sci-fi short stories that explore similar themes and scenarios.
Ok maybe a few from Ursula leguin and Vogt.
Sure, here are some short stories by Ursula K. Le Guin and Alfred Vogt that may align with some of the scenarios you mentioned:
"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas" by Ursula K. Le Guin: This short story is about a utopian city where everything is perfect, except for the fact that the city's happiness and prosperity depend on the suffering of one child. It deals with the themes of morality, sacrifice, and the nature of happiness.
"The Rule of Names" by Ursula K. Le Guin: This short story is about a young man named Orrec who has the power to break or make the names of living things. It explores the power of language and the consequences of wielding it irresponsibly.
"The Monster" by Alfred Vogt: This short story is about a man who discovers a creature living in his house that can only be seen by people who have lost their sense of purpose in life. It deals with themes of existentialism, identity, and the search for meaning.
"The City of the Titans" by Alfred Vogt: This short story is about a man who discovers a city of giants hidden in the mountains. It explores themes of power, perspective, and the limits of human knowledge.
"The New Atlantis" by Ursula K. Le Guin: This short story is about a man who is transported to a new world where he discovers a society based on reason, equality, and compassion. It deals with themes of utopia, social justice, and the search for a better world.
