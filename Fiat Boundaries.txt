article appeared in Contemporary Debates in Metaphysics, edited by J. Hawthorne, T. Sider, and D.Zimmerman (Oxford: Blackwell, 2008), pp. 321-40.THE MOON AND SIXPENCE:A DEFENSE OF MEREOLOGICAL UNIVERSALISMThe thesis I am called upon to defend is this: given any collection of objects, no matterhow disparate or widely scattered, there is a further object composed of them all. Forexample, there is an object composed of my left tennis shoe and the lace that is threadedthrough its eyelets���so far, perhaps, no surprise. But there are all of the followingobjects as well: the object composed of the lace threaded through my left shoe and thelace threaded through my right shoe; the object composed of the Eiffel Tower and the tipof my nose; the object composed of the moon and the six pennies scattered across mydesktop. For any objects a through z, whatever and wherever they may be, there is anobject having those objects as its parts. This thesis goes by several names:conjunctivism (Chisholm), unrestricted composition (Lewis), and mereologicaluniversalism (van Inwagen).1 It is often thought to fly in the face of common sense, but ithas won the allegiance of several philosophers, and it is a standard element in the formaltheory of part and whole as it was developed in the twentieth century. In what follows Ishall explain why I believe it to be true.1 Roderick Chisholm used the term ���conjunctivism��� in his lectures. David Lewis uses the term ���unrestrictedcomposition��� in On the Plurality of Worlds (Oxford: Blackwell, 1986), pp. 211-13, and Peter van Inwagenuses the term ���universalism��� in Material Beings (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1990), p. 74.

This excerpt appears to be from an academic article discussing the concept of "mereological universalism." This philosophical thesis asserts that any collection of objects, no matter how varied or widely dispersed, collectively forms a further object. The text uses examples like an object composed of a tennis shoe lace and the Eiffel Tower paired with the tip of a nose, to illustrate this idea. It mentions that this thesis is known by several names, such as "conjunctivism" (Chisholm), "unrestricted composition" (Lewis), and "mereological universalism" (van Inwagen). The text indicates that despite seeming counterintuitive to common sense, this theory has gained support from some philosophers and is a significant part of the formal theory of parts and wholes developed in the 20th century. The author of this excerpt aims to explain their belief in the truth of this thesis. The names Roderick Chisholm, David Lewis, and Peter van Inwagen are cited in relation to the different terminologies used for this philosophical concept.

Classical mereologyMereology (from the Greek word meros for 'part') is the theory of part and whole.Lesniewsi (1916), Tarski (1937), and Leonard and Goodman (1940) have all presentedformal systems of mereology, with definitions, axioms, and proofs of theorems.2 To givethe flavor of these systems, I shall present some of their key definitions and axioms here.Let us take as primitive the relation symbol ���x < y��� for ���x is part of y���. Othermereological notions can then be defined as follows:x is a proper part of y iff x is a part of y & x ��� y. (A proper part of something is a partof it that is distinct from the whole.)x and y overlap (sometimes symbolized ���x o y���) iff for some object z, z is part of x andz is part of y. (Things that overlap are things that have a part in common.)x and y are disjoint iff x and y do not overlap. (Disjoint things are things with no part incommon.)Now for a notion that will be of special importance to us here, the notion of amereological sum (or fusion). Tarski defines it thus:x is a sum of set A iff (y)(y is a member of A -> y < x) & (y)(y < x -> Ez(z is a memberof A & y o z). (In other words, every member of A is a part of x, and every part of xoverlaps some member of A.)For example, a sum of the set {the Eiffel Tower, JVC���s nose} would be an entity that haseach of the members of that set as parts and each of whose parts overlaps either the EiffelTower or JVC���s nose. (Why don���t we express the second clause of the definiens moresimply by saying that every part of x is a member of A? The answer is that we wish tocount as parts of the sum such things as the rivets and beams in the Eiffel Tower, which re not members of the doubleton set (the Eiffel Tower, JVC's nose), but which dc
overlap one of the members.)
It is possible to define the notion of a sum without presupposing the existence of sets,
so long as we use some other device to similar effect, such as plural variables. Van
Inwagen gives the following definition:
x is a sum of the ys =df the ys are all parts of x and every part of x overlaps at least one
of the ys.:
Thus, a sum of all the pennies in the universe would be a thing of which all the pennies
are parts and every part of which is (either a penny or) something overlapping a penny.
Here is some alternative terminology: instead of saying that x is a sum of A (or of the
ys), we could say that the various members of A (or the ys) compose x.aIf the ys have
been enumerated (say as a and b), we can use the expression a + b' as a name for the
sum of the ys.
I now proceed to Carski's axioms, of which there are two. The first says that the
relation is part of is transitive:
A1.If x is part of y and y is part of z, then x is part of z.
The second axiom pertains to the existence and uniqueness of sums
A2. Ex(x is a member of A)-> Ex(x is a sum of A & (y(y is a sum of A -> x = y
This axiom says that every nonempty set has a unique sum. It will be useful to divide the
import of it in two. One half (the half that employs only the first conjunct in the
consequent) says that for any nonempty set of entities, there is at least one sum of that

This passage provides a detailed introduction to classical mereology, the philosophical theory of parts and wholes, originating from the Greek word 'meros' meaning 'part'. Key figures in the development of formal systems of mereology include Lesniewski, Tarski, and Leonard and Goodman, who introduced definitions, axioms, and proofs of theorems.
The text outlines key definitions and axioms in mereology. It starts by taking the relation 'x < y' (x is part of y) as a primitive concept. Then, it defines several mereological notions:
Proper Part:
x is a proper part of y if x is a part of y and x is not equal to y.
Overlap:
x and y overlap if there exists an object z that is part of both x and y.
Disjoint:
x and y are disjoint if they do not overlap.
A central concept in mereology is the notion of a mereological sum or fusion. Tarski defines this as x being a sum of set A if every member of A is a part of x, and every part of x overlaps some member of A. The text provides an example using the Eiffel Tower and JVC���s nose to illustrate this concept.
Van Inwagen offers an alternative definition of a sum that doesn't presuppose the existence of sets but uses plural variables instead. In this view, x is a sum of the ys if all ys are parts of x and every part of x overlaps at least one of the ys.
The passage then introduces two of Tarski's axioms in mereology:
Transitivity of the 'is part of' Relation (A1):
If x is part of y and y is part of z, then x is part of z.
Existence and Uniqueness of Sums (A2):
This axiom states that every nonempty set has a unique sum, which can be understood in two parts - the existence of at least one sum for any nonempty set of entities and the uniqueness of this sum.
These concepts and axioms are foundational to understanding the formal theory of parts and wholes as developed in the 20th century, exploring how objects relate to each other in terms of their constituent parts.

set, that is, at least one entity that the members of that set compose. The other half (the
alf that employs the second conjunct in the consequent) tells us that there is at most ond
such sum.
The uniqueness of sums is perhaps almost as controversial as their existence. It
arguably implies that a statue and the clay of which it is made are one and the same, for
they are both sums of exactly the same molecules. My main concern in what follows will
oe defending the existence half of the axiom, but at times I shall draw upon uniqueness as
well.
There are other axiomatizations of classical mereology besides Tarski's, differing from
his and from one another in what notions they take as primitive, in whether they
presuppose the existence of sets, and in what principles they choose as axioms. For our
purposes here, all these systems are equivalent. They all assume the same formal
properties (transitivity and the like) for the part-whole relation, and they all have the
same implications regarding the existence and uniqueness of sums.s
The view that every set has a sum, or that any objects whatsoever are parts composing
a larger whole, has its mirror image in the doctrine that any objects whatsoever are
wholes composed of smaller parts. The second view is is a a denial of the existence of
6 As an example, I present here an axiomatization of Leonard and Goodman's mereology due to Rolf
Eberle, Nominalistic Systems (Dordrecht: D. Reidel, 1970). There are three axioms:
A1.x <y <-> (z)(zox->zo y)
A2. ExFx-> Ex(y(y o x <-> Ez(Fz& y 0 Z)
A3. (z)(zox <->z0y)-> x=y
A1 does the work of Tarski's first axiom, for it implies that the part-of relation is transitive. (It also implies
hat the relation is reflexive.) A2 and A3 together do the work of Op Tarski's S second axiom without taking fo1
granted the existence of sets. A2 tells us that if S there any Fs, then there is is something that overlaps exactly
those things that overlap an F. Since 'F could be a disjunctive predicate like 'is identical either with the
moon or or with the Eiffel Tower ', this axiom guarantees the existence of a sum of any two or more entities.
A3 secures the uniqueness of sums. If x and y are composed of the same things, whatever overlaps either
will overlap the other, and A3 tells us in that case that x and y are identical. (In the consequent of A3,
have put x = y'where Eberle had a Leibnizian definition of it, 'A -> A[y//x].)
mereological atoms, or simples, in favor of the view that everything has parts within parts
ad infinitum. To believe that matter is infinitely divisible in this way is to believe in what
David Lewis calls *atomless gunk."iTo believe in all the sums countenanced by the
classical mereologist is to believe in what I shall call (without prejudice) mereological
junk. Belief in junk and belief in gunk are independent of each other, and a commitmen
to gunk is not part of classical mereology. Nonetheless, the two views are to some extent
mutually reinforcing (as I show below), and I myself accept a package of views in
mereology that includes them both.

ChatGPT
In this continuation of the discussion on classical mereology, the text elaborates on Tarski's second axiom (A2) regarding the existence and uniqueness of sums. The axiom is divided into two parts: one asserting the existence of at least one sum for any nonempty set of entities, and the other stating the uniqueness of this sum. This notion of uniqueness is somewhat controversial, as it implies that objects like a statue and the clay it's made from, composed of the same molecules, are the same entity.
The author then mentions that there are various axiomatizations of mereology, differing in their primitives, the presupposition of sets, and the chosen axioms. However, for the purposes of the discussion, these systems are essentially equivalent, all assuming the same formal properties for the part-whole relationship and having similar implications regarding the existence and uniqueness of sums.
The passage also touches on the philosophical concept of every set having a sum and any objects being parts of a larger whole. This is contrasted with the view that every object is a whole composed of smaller parts, leading to the rejection of mereological atoms or simples in favor of an infinitely divisible matter, termed "atomless gunk" by David Lewis.
Leonard and Goodman's mereology, as reformulated by Rolf Eberle, is presented with its three axioms:
A1:
Implies the transitivity and reflexivity of the part-of relation.
A2:
Ensures the existence of a sum of entities overlapping a given property.
A3:
Ensures the uniqueness of sums, stating that if x and y are composed of the same things, they are identical.
The author concludes by noting that belief in "mereological junk" (all sums countenanced by the classical mereologist) and "atomless gunk" (belief in infinitely divisible matter) are independent but mutually reinforcing views. The author expresses a personal acceptance of a package of views in mereology that includes both concepts.

You might have to simplify it a bit more
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Sure, let's simplify the concepts from this passage on classical mereology:
Mereology Basics:
Mereology is the study of parts and wholes. It examines how individual parts come together to form a whole, and how these wholes can be broken down into parts.
Key Definitions:
Part of:
The basic idea is that one thing (x) can be a part of another (y).
Proper Part:
If x is a part of y, but x is not the same as y, then x is a proper part of y.
Overlap:
Two things overlap if they share at least one part.
Disjoint:
Two things are disjoint if they share no parts.
Mereological Sum (or Fusion):
This is a complex concept. Essentially, it means that if you have a group of objects, you can think of them as forming a single object. For instance, the Eiffel Tower and your nose, though completely different and distant, can be considered together as one 'thing' or sum in mereology.
Axioms by Tarski:
A1 (Transitivity):
If part A is of part B, and part B is of part C, then part A is also of part C.
A2 (Existence and Uniqueness of Sums):
This says that for any set of parts, there is a unique whole (or sum) they form. This concept is a bit tricky; it's saying that for any group of objects, there's one unique way they come together as a whole.
Controversy:
There's debate in mereology, especially regarding the uniqueness of sums. For example, a clay statue and the clay it���s made from might be considered the same because they're composed of the same molecules.
Different Systems:
Although there are different ways of defining these ideas (like the systems by Lesniewski, Tarski, Leonard and Goodman), they generally agree on the core principles of how parts relate to wholes.
Mereological Junk and Gunk:
These are two concepts:
Junk:
The idea that any collection of objects, no matter how unrelated, can form a whole.
Gunk:
The idea that everything can be infinitely divided into smaller parts, meaning there are no simplest, indivisible parts.
The passage is essentially about how parts relate to wholes in different ways, and the philosophical implications of these relationships.

Product Ontology

Abstract:
This paper presents our experience in reusing mereology ontologies in a Pharmaceutical Product ontology, an ontology built by the EU NeOn project.

It shows a set of mereology ontologies implemented in different machine interpretable languages and analyzes them according to the different types of mereology identified by Varzi.

Then, it describes the specifications of mereology modeling necessitated by a Pharmaceutical Product.

Finally, it presents the ontology which fits best with the specifications. One of the results of this work is a procedure to reuse general (also called common) ontologies.

The research paper titled "Causal Bayesian Networks: A flexible tool to enable fairer machine learning," authored by Silvia Chiappa and William Isaac and published on October 3, 2019, explores the use of Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs) in addressing fairness in machine learning (ML). The paper acknowledges the potential biases present in ML training data, which can lead to unfair treatment based on sensitive attributes like race, gender, disabilities, and sexual orientation. The authors critique the existing fairness criteria in ML for not fully accounting for the complex ways these sensitive attributes influence other variables. CBNs are proposed as a tool to better understand, measure, and address different scenarios of unfairness in datasets. This approach provides both a visual and quantitative method for improving fairness in ML decision-making systems.

"A Cerebral Central Pattern Generator in Aplysia and Its Connections with Buccal Feeding Circuitry" (PMC6579257):
This study probably investigates the existence of a central pattern generator in the brain of Aplysia, a type of sea slug, and its connections with the circuitry involved in feeding behavior. It could provide insights into how simple neural circuits evolve into more complex brain structures that coordinate various activities.
"Biological clockwork underlying adaptive rhythmic movements" (PNAS, 2013):
This article likely explores the biological mechanisms that underpin rhythmic movements in organisms. It might discuss how these mechanisms are adaptive and contribute to the efficient functioning of living beings, possibly touching on the evolution of neural structures that support such movements.
"Central pattern generation in the context of complex activity sequences" (Journal of Experimental Biology, 2019):
This paper seems to focus on how central pattern generators are involved not just in simple rhythmic activities but in more complex sequences of actions. It could provide evidence supporting Anderson's theory by showing how basic neural clusters (CPGs) could evolve to manage more intricate behaviors.
Overall, these studies could support Anderson's theory by showing how simple nerve clusters, originally evolved to coordinate basic movements, could form the foundations of more sophisticated brain functions.

Define mereological universalism
2 / 2
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Mereological universalism is a philosophical concept in the field of mereology, the study of parts and wholes. It posits that for any arbitrary collection of objects, no matter how disparate or spatially separated they may be, there exists a further object that is composed of all those objects as parts. According to this view, any group of entities, regardless of their properties or relations to each other, collectively form a single, larger whole.
For instance, under mereological universalism, not only does an object like a car, composed of its wheels, engine, and body, exist as a whole, but so does a more abstract 'object' that consists of, say, the Eiffel Tower, a specific apple in New York, and a star in a distant galaxy. All conceivable groups of objects, no matter how seemingly unrelated, form larger entities in this philosophical framework.
This theory stands in contrast to more restrictive theories of composition, which might argue that only certain collections of objects, those that meet specific criteria (like being connected in a certain way), form a whole. Mereological universalism is often discussed in the context of debates about ontology (the study of what exists) and is significant in discussions about the nature of objects and their relationships in the universe.

INTRODUCTION 
Why Boundaries? 
We are all familiar with boundaries. Everyone has some idea of what boundaries are because we 
face them every day. Our first experience of boundaries is birth and our last experience is death: life begins 
at some point and ends at another. In the meantime, in the everyday life, we can find a broad range of 
boundaries everywhere: borders between countries, shores of rivers and lakes, edges of objects, summits of 
mountains, the final whistle of a football match, walls to separate nations, fences between the garden of your 
house and the neighbour���s, the skin of your body, and so on. In a metaphorical way, we also talk about other 
things having boundaries or limits such as cultures, our knowledge, the universe, the mind, the power, ethics, 
among others. Since everyone knows what is meant by a boundary, why do a philosophical research on the 
topic? Sometimes the most familiar things to us are the hardest to explain, though. In philosophy, a well- 
known example is what Saint Augustine said about time in his Confessions: ���What then is time? If no one 
asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know���. Asking ���What is a 
boundary?��� is like asking ���What is time?���. We certainly know what a boundary is in everyday life and where 
they can be found. However, if we try to define what is for something to be the boundary of something else, 
then the everyday idea of a boundary can become puzzling. 
However, this research is not about boundaries in general, but the boundaries of the physical objects 
that common-sense beliefs consist of, i.e., the boundaries of tables, chairs, mugs, snooker balls, chairs, 
apples, and every physical object that could be seen with naked eye. In fact, by seeing carefully around us, 
we will realize that most of what we can really see and touch are boundaries (parts of them) rather than the 
whole of the objects: we only see the surfaces of things rather than things themselves. Physical objects fill 
with matter portions of three-dimensional space. A boundary indicates both where a physical object stops 
filling with matter the region of space it occupies at some given time and where the object���s surroundings 
begin. Chapter One will introduce how philosophy and common-sense differ in their ontological accounts 
about physical objects and their boundaries.

The introduction you've shared delves into the philosophical exploration of boundaries, specifically focusing on the boundaries of physical objects. Here's a breakdown of its key points:
Ubiquity of Boundaries:
The text begins by acknowledging that boundaries are a common and familiar aspect of everyday life, ranging from literal physical boundaries like country borders and walls, to metaphorical ones like the limits of knowledge or ethics.
Philosophical Inquiry:
Despite their familiarity, the concept of boundaries poses a philosophical challenge, much like Saint Augustine's contemplation of time. While we intuitively understand what boundaries are in a practical sense, defining them philosophically can be complex.
Focus on Physical Objects:
The research aims to explore the boundaries of physical objects that are part of common-sense reality, like tables, chairs, and apples. It emphasizes that in our daily perception, we often encounter only the surfaces or boundaries of objects rather than the objects in their entirety.
Boundaries in Physical Space:
A key point is that physical objects occupy three-dimensional space and are filled with matter. Boundaries are where the object stops filling space with matter and where its surroundings begin.
Philosophical vs. Common-Sense Views:
The introduction suggests that the first chapter will discuss how philosophy and common-sense understanding might differ in their views about physical objects and their boundaries. This likely involves contrasting everyday perceptions of boundaries with more nuanced philosophical interpretations.
Overall, the introduction sets the stage for a detailed philosophical investigation into the nature of boundaries, particularly those of physical objects, challenging readers to think beyond their everyday understanding of these concepts.

I will take ���surface��� as the term that is often used to refer to the boundaries, top physical layers, or 
outermost parts of ordinary physical objects. Euclid defines a boundary as ���that which is the extremity of 
anything���(1962: Bk I Df.13). A surface is found in the extremity of a physical object. Go instance, the surface 
of an apple is the only part in contact with the apple���s surroundings and, therefore, the only part that we see 
9 
from the apple. The surface is thus the extremity of the apple insofar as nothing of what composes the apple 
can be found beyond it. This follows Aristotle definition of an extremity as the ���first point beyond which it 
is not possible to find any part [of x], and the first point within which every part [of x] is��� (1984a: 1022a4- 
5). The surface of a physical object x is that point between x and x���s surroundings; or, let���s say, between x 
and the remaining space where nothing of x is found. Thus, boundaries are always found in the extremity of 
things what entails being between things. In particular, surfaces are boundaries in the extremities of physical 
objects laying between objects and space. 
The features said above characterizes the ontology of any boundary: a boundary is such that it is 
always ���a boundary of������. This basically means that boundaries are ontologically dependent entities, i.e., the 
existence of a boundary depends upon the existence of something else: every time that you find a boundary, 
you will also find an object what that boundary belongs to. This topic will be addressed in Chapter Two. 
The main thesis is that boundaries and physical objects hold a mutual but asymmetrical de re ontological 
dependence: boundaries rigidly depends upon physical objects, whereas physical objects generically depend 
upon boundaries. Once this distinction has been spelled out, the following chapters will address four puzzles: 
i. Boundary-Belongingness. If a boundary separates two objects or parts of one object, what does the 
boundary belong to? Think of the Equatorial line: it may belong to either the south hemisphere or the 
north hemisphere; it may belong to both; it may belong to neither; or maybe there are two co-located 
boundaries sharing one place at once (in that case, if two boundaries are entirely co-located, can the 
physical objects they belong to being co-located as well?). 
ii. Boundary-Thickness. Physical objects are material bulky things spread out in the three-dimension of 
space. However, surfaces are, by definition, boundaries of only two-spatial dimensions (length and 
height). Given that surfaces lack depth, they are entirely thin boundaries having no thickness at all and, 
therefore, cannot take up any physical space. Nonetheless, many physical properties (e.g., colours, 
sounds, or textures) and physical events (e.g., light reflection or corrosion) are said to happen on the 
objects��� surfaces. How does something that is not a physical object instantiate physical properties or 
causal powers? 
iii. Boundary-Vagueness. A snooker ball has a smooth and sharp surface. However, not every physical object 
seems to have a boundary like that. Objects like clouds, mountains, or trees have vague boundaries where 
it is indeterminate when the boundary ends and when the object���s surroundings begins. Actually, from a 
microscopic scale, any smooth and perfectly sharp ordinary object becomes a fuzzy swarm of tiny 
particles. Are there sharp boundaries at all? If there are, what features should have the objects they belong 
to? If there are vague boundaries, can vagueness be ontological or only the result of the imprecision of 
our language and knowledge?

This excerpt delves deeper into the concept of boundaries in the context of physical objects, using the term 'surface' as a key reference. Here's a summary of the main points:
Definition of 'Surface':
The term 'surface' refers to the boundaries, top physical layers, or outermost parts of ordinary physical objects.
Historical Definitions:
Euclid defines a boundary as the extremity of anything, which implies that a surface is found at the extremity of a physical object.
Aristotle's definition of an extremity as the first point beyond which no part of an object can be found and the first point within which every part of an object is, further clarifies this concept.
Surface as a Boundary:
The surface of an object like an apple is the only part in contact with the surroundings and the only part visible to us.
Surfaces are at the point where the object and its surrounding space meet, emphasizing that boundaries are always between things.
Ontological Nature of Boundaries:
Boundaries are ontologically dependent entities, meaning their existence depends on something else, like an object to which they belong. This concept is set to be explored further in Chapter Two of the text.
Asymmetrical Ontological Dependence:
The main thesis presented is that boundaries and physical objects have a mutual but asymmetrical ontological dependence, where boundaries rigidly depend on physical objects, but physical objects only generically depend on boundaries.
Puzzles Regarding Boundaries:
Several philosophical puzzles about boundaries are introduced:
i.
Boundary-Belongingness:
The dilemma of to which object a boundary belongs.
ii.
Boundary-Thickness:
The paradox of how surfaces, lacking depth, can manifest physical properties or events.
iii.
Boundary-Vagueness:
The challenge of vague boundaries in objects like clouds or mountains and whether sharp boundaries truly exist.
The excerpt establishes a foundation for a complex philosophical examination of the nature of boundaries in physical objects, raising intriguing questions about their existence, characteristics, and the implications of their ontological status.

iv. Artificial/Natural Distinction. Some boundaries seem to be natural or mind-independent carvings in the 
world; others artificial or mind-dependent drawings made by someone. The shore of Loch Ness can be 
an example of the former and the border between Spain and France an example of the latter. However, is 
this distinction clear at all? If the border between Spain and France is a boundary drawn by following the 
Pyrenees as a natural discontinuity on the earth���s surface, is the border entirely artificial? Regarding 
surfaces, are they natural or artificial boundaries? Are those boundaries and the objects they belong to 
genuine denizens of reality? 
Each of these puzzles will be addressed in different parts of the thesis in relation to topics such as 
composition, the nature of space, temporal persistence, modality, and vagueness in physical objects. If there 
is some way of carving the world at its boundaries, then will find out a world of physical objects made of 
bona fide vague boundaries which we attempt to make as sharp as possible by drawing our own boundaries 
on it. Why then boundaries? Since ancient philosophy, philosophers have been largely discussed about 
things and the topic of material beings is among the favourite ones. However, much has been said about 
those things, but not much about their boundaries. This research is about boundaries. Perhaps, this topic has been often unattended by philosophers precisely because boundaries are too familiar to us. It is good to know, however, that by studying boundaries we are studying the objects they belong to as well.

This part of the text introduces additional philosophical puzzles related to boundaries, particularly focusing on the artificial/natural distinction. Here's a summary of the key points:
Artificial vs. Natural Distinction:
Some boundaries are perceived as natural or mind-independent, such as the shore of Loch Ness.
Others are seen as artificial or mind-dependent, like the border between Spain and France.
The text questions the clarity of this distinction, considering cases where even seemingly artificial boundaries might follow natural features.
Complex Distinction:
The thesis explores whether the artificial/natural distinction for boundaries is clear-cut, especially when natural features are taken into account.
Nature of Surfaces:
The text also raises the question of whether surfaces (boundaries) are natural or artificial and whether they, and the objects they belong to, are genuine denizens of reality.
Puzzles and Philosophical Topics:
These puzzles related to boundaries will be addressed in different parts of the thesis in connection to various philosophical topics, including composition, the nature of space, temporal persistence, modality, and vagueness in physical objects.
Significance of Studying Boundaries:
The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of studying boundaries, even though they might seem familiar. It highlights that by studying boundaries, philosophers are also delving into the nature of the objects to which these boundaries belong.
Overall, this section sets the stage for a philosophical exploration of boundaries, challenging preconceived notions about their distinctions and underscoring the rich philosophical territory they represent.

CHAPTER TWO 
The Surfaces of Things 
Boundaries as Ontological Parasites 
Introduction 
This chapter addresses the most relevant metaphysical condition of a boundary: a boundary is an 
ontologically dependent entity. That is, the being of a boundary depends upon the being of something else. 
Boundaries thus are ontological parasites that necessitate the existence of a host. However, what is the nature 
of the ontological dependence of boundaries upon objects? In particular, how do boundaries ontologically 
depend upon physical objects. But also, do physical objects depend upon boundaries in some way? If they 
do, do physical objects depend upon boundaries in a similar way as boundaries depend upon physical 
objects? Surfaces will be taken as the boundaries of material objects. However, surfaces show a tension 
between the abstract and the concrete: although surfaces are two-dimensional boundaries without thickness, 
they are the first part of material objects where many of their physical features and causal events occur. How 
are surfaces and physical objects ontologically related? 
Ontological dependence between surfaces and physical objects is explained in terms of de re and de 
dicto modality. I will argue that the ontological dependence between surfaces and physical objects is a de re 
dependence, but two different sorts of de re dependence: while a boundary rigidly depends for its existence 
upon the material object it belongs to, a physical object generically depends for its spatial existence upon a 
boundary. 
This Chapter has two sections A and B. The first section introduces what is understood by surfaces 
as boundaries of material objects and how they show the tension between being abstract being and concrete 
parts of physical objects. The second section addresses the topic of the ontological dependence between 
boundaries and objects in two main parts: first, an analysis of the Brentano-Chisholm account of boundaries; 
and second, the modal account of boundaries in terms of rigid and generic dependence.

This chapter, titled "The Surfaces of Things: Boundaries as Ontological Parasites," explores the metaphysical condition of boundaries, particularly focusing on the ontological dependence of boundaries on physical objects. Here's a summary of the key points:
Ontological Dependence of Boundaries:
This chapter delves into the central metaphysical aspect of boundaries, which is that they are ontologically dependent entities. In other words, the existence of a boundary relies on the existence of something else.
Boundaries as Ontological Parasites:
Boundaries are described as "ontological parasites" because they necessitate the existence of a host entity, which in this context refers to physical objects.
Nature of Ontological Dependence:
The chapter explores the nature of the ontological dependence of boundaries on physical objects. It raises questions about whether physical objects, in turn, depend on boundaries in some way.
De Re and De Dicto Modality:
The ontological dependence between surfaces (boundaries) and physical objects is examined in terms of de re and de dicto modality. The chapter argues that this dependence involves two different types of de re dependence.
Rigid and Generic Dependence:
The chapter introduces the concepts of rigid and generic dependence in the context of modal accounts of boundaries. It distinguishes between how boundaries rigidly depend on the material objects they belong to and how physical objects generically depend on boundaries for their spatial existence.
Structure of the Chapter:
The chapter is divided into two sections: Section A, which introduces the concept of surfaces as boundaries of material objects, and Section B, which addresses the ontological dependence between boundaries and objects through an analysis of the Brentano-Chisholm account and a modal account.
Overall, this chapter explores the complex relationship between boundaries and physical objects, shedding light on the ontological nature of these entities and their mutual dependence.

The content from Gonzalo Nu��ez Erices' thesis on the metaphysical study of boundaries connects with several of the previous topics we've discussed, particularly those related to ontology, mereology, and the nature of physical objects. Here are some connections:
Mereological Universalism:
In the thesis, the author discusses the boundaries of physical objects, which are a fundamental aspect of mereology (the study of part-whole relationships). The concept of boundaries and how they relate to the objects they belong to aligns with discussions of mereological universalism, which asserts that there is an object composed of all parts, no matter how disparate.
Ontological Dependence:
The thesis delves into the ontological dependence of boundaries on physical objects. This discussion relates to the concept of ontological dependence we explored in previous topics. Specifically, the thesis examines how boundaries are ontological parasites that rely on the existence of a host (physical object).
Nature of Boundaries:
The thesis explores the nature of boundaries, particularly surfaces, which are considered the boundaries of material objects. This ties into the discussions about the nature of boundaries and the challenges they pose, such as boundary thickness, vagueness, and their relationship with physical properties.
Metaphysical Questions:
The thesis raises metaphysical questions about the nature of boundaries and their role in our understanding of physical objects. These questions align with broader metaphysical inquiries we've encountered in previous discussions.
Philosophical Inquiry:
Just as the thesis engages in a philosophical inquiry into boundaries, our previous discussions have revolved around various philosophical topics, including causality, fairness in machine learning, mereology, and the nature of physical reality.
Overall, the study of boundaries in Gonzalo Nu��ez Erices' thesis provides a philosophical lens through which we can examine fundamental questions about the nature of physical objects and their boundaries, offering valuable insights and connections to our previous philosophical discussions.
