The error message you're encountering indicates that ImageMagick's
convert
command is running out of memory while trying to process a large number of JPEG files into a PDF. This often happens when dealing with high-resolution images or a large batch of images. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:
Increase ImageMagick's Memory Limit:
ImageMagick has configuration files where you can adjust the memory limits. These files are typically named
policy.xml
or
imagemagick-policy.xml
and located in
/etc/ImageMagick-6/
(the version number might be different on your system).
Edit this file to increase the memory limits. Look for lines containing
policy domain="resource"
and increase the values for
memory
,
map
, and
disk
. Be cautious not to exceed your system's actual capabilities.
Convert Images in Batches:
Instead of converting all images at once, you could do them in smaller batches. This would reduce the memory requirement for each conversion.
For example:
convert {1..100}.jpg -auto-orient part1.pdf
, then
convert {101..200}.jpg -auto-orient part2.pdf
, and so on.
Reduce Image Resolution:
If the images are high-resolution and such detail is not necessary for your PDF, consider reducing the resolution of the images before conversion.
Use a command like
mogrify -resize 50% *.jpg
to reduce the size of all images by 50%.
Use Disk as Temporary Storage:
If your system has more disk space than RAM, you can configure ImageMagick to use disk space for its operations, though this might slow down the process.
This can be done by setting the
MAGICK_TMPDIR
environment variable to point to a directory with ample space.
Update ImageMagick:
Ensure you have the latest version of ImageMagick, as updates often include performance improvements and bug fixes.
System Resources:
Check your system resources (like RAM and CPU usage) to ensure other processes aren't consuming resources needed by ImageMagick.
Split PDF Generation:
Consider generating multiple PDFs with fewer images each and then merging them into one PDF using a tool like
pdftk
.
Remember to backup your original images before performing batch operations like resizing. If you are not comfortable making these changes yourself, consider seeking assistance from a system administrator.

The syntax isn't right. It looks like it did the first 200 pages. How do i get 201 to 2018 into a pdf, the { } method needs something else
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
To process a specific range of files using the
convert
command in a Unix-like shell, you can use shell expansion or a loop. Since you mentioned that the
{}
syntax didn't work as expected for your range, you might need a different approach. Here's how you can do it:
Using a For Loop:
This method uses a shell loop to process each file individually and then combines them into a single PDF.
bash
Copy code
for
i
in
{201..2018};
do
convert
$i
.jpg -auto-orient page_
$i
.pdf
done
pdfunite page_{201..2018}.pdf history-of-english-201-2018.pdf
rm
page_{201..2018}.pdf
# Clean up individual page PDFs
This script converts each JPEG file into an individual PDF, then uses
pdfunite
to combine these into a single PDF, and finally cleans up the individual page PDFs.
Using Shell Expansion:
If your shell supports brace expansion for the range you're working with, you can try:
bash
Copy code
convert $(
ls
{201..2018}.jpg |
sort
-V) -auto-orient history-of-english-201-2018.pdf
This command uses
ls
to list the files in the specified range and
sort -V
for natural sorting (which is important for correctly ordering page numbers). Then,
convert
processes this sorted list of files.
Note:
The
pdfunite
command is part of the
poppler-utils
package and is used for merging PDF files. If it's not installed on your system, you can usually install it via your package manager.
Ensure that your shell supports the range syntax
{201..2018}
. If it doesn't, the loop method is a safer alternative.
Adjust the commands according to your shell environment and installed utilities.
Try one of these methods to process your images from 201 to 2018 into a PDF. If you encounter any issues, please provide details for further assistance.

ilovepdf.com
,
smallpdf.com
, or
combinepdf.com
offer simple interfaces for uploading, merging, and then downloading your combined PDF.
3. Using Adobe Acrobat
If you have Adobe Acrobat (not the free Reader), you can merge PDFs:
Open Adobe Acrobat.
Click on "Tools" > "Combine Files".
Add the PDF files you want to merge.
Click "Combine" and then save the new PDF.
4. Using Preview on macOS

You
cant I use "convert" imagemagic?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, you can indeed use ImageMagick's
convert
command to merge multiple PDF files into one. It's a versatile tool for handling various image and PDF manipulations. Here's how you can do it:
Basic Command:
To merge two PDFs, you would use a command like this in the terminal:
bash
Copy code
convert first.pdf second.pdf merged.pdf
Replace
first.pdf
and
second.pdf
with the names of your PDF files, and
merged.pdf
with the desired name of the output file.
High-Quality Merge:
Sometimes, the
convert
command can reduce the quality of the output PDF. To maintain the quality, you can specify a higher density (which sets the resolution). For example:
bash
Copy code
convert -density 300x300 first.pdf second.pdf -quality 100 merged.pdf
This sets the density to 300 DPI and the quality to 100%, which should give you a high-quality output.
Handling Large Files:
If you're dealing with large PDF files, you might encounter memory issues. In such cases, you can use ImageMagick's policy configuration to increase the memory limits, or process the files in smaller chunks.
Remember, while
convert
is a powerful tool, it can sometimes lead to large file sizes or reduced quality in the merged PDF. If you encounter these issues, you might want to experiment with the density and quality parameters, or consider using a tool specifically designed for PDF manipulation, like
pdftk
or
Ghostscript
.
You
I have done merge and ocr, but the pdf is still 191 megabytes, i would like half or quarter that can I still further compress it?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, you can further compress a large PDF file to reduce its size. Here are several methods you can use:
1.
Using Ghostscript
Ghostscript is a powerful tool for PDF compression. You can use it to reduce the size of your PDF. The command would look something like this:
bash
Copy code
gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook \
   -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH \
   -sOutputFile=output.pdf input.pdf
In this command:
Replace
input.pdf
with the name of your large PDF file.
Replace
output.pdf
with the name you want for the compressed file.
The
-dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook
option is a good balance between size and quality, but you can adjust this:
/screen
: lower quality, smallest file size.
/ebook
: for better quality, but slightly larger pdfs than
/screen
.
/printer
: high quality, suitable for printing.
/prepress
: high quality, similar to
/printer
, preserves high-resolution images.
2.
Using ImageMagick's
convert
If you used ImageMagick's
convert
to merge the PDFs, you can also use it to compress the file. However, be cautious as it may reduce the quality of images:
bash
Copy code
convert -density 150x150 -quality 60 -compress jpeg input.pdf output.pdf
This command sets the density (DPI) and quality. Adjust these values to find the right balance for your needs.
3.
Online Compression Tools
There are several online tools available that can compress PDF files, like
Smallpdf
,
ILovePDF
, or
Adobe Acrobat's online PDF compressor
. These are user-friendly and can be quite effective, but be aware that uploading sensitive or private documents to online services may pose security concerns.
4.
Using Adobe Acrobat
If you have Adobe Acrobat Pro, it includes a feature to reduce PDF file size:
Open the PDF with Adobe Acrobat Pro.
Go to
File
>
Save As Other
>
Reduced Size PDF
.
Choose the compatibility settings and click
OK
.
5.
Using a Dedicated PDF Compression Tool
There are specialized software tools for PDF compression that you might consider using. These tools often provide more advanced options for compression, allowing greater control over the final output quality and size.
Note on Compression:
Be cautious with the compression settings, especially with the quality of images and text. Over-compression can lead to poor readability and image quality.

If I delete a github repository, I suspect the lfs will stop tracking the files in it?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, if you delete a GitHub repository, any associated Git Large File Storage (LFS) objects or data linked to that repository will also be affected. Here���s what typically happens:
LFS Objects Become Inaccessible:
When you delete a repository on GitHub, the LFS objects that were tracked and stored as part of that repository will no longer be accessible. This is because Git LFS works by storing references to large files in the repository, while the actual file contents are stored on separate Git LFS servers. Deleting the repository removes these references.
Data Deletion:
The actual deletion process of the LFS objects may not be immediate. GitHub might retain the LFS objects for a short period after the repository deletion, but eventually, they will be permanently deleted. This retention period is not specified for general users and should not be relied upon for data recovery.
Backup Consideration:
If you have files tracked by Git LFS in your repository and you plan to delete the repository, it���s important to make backups of those files if you intend to use them later. Once the repository is deleted, recovering these files from GitHub will not be possible.
Impact on Cloned Repositories:
If you or others have cloned the repository, the clones will still contain the LFS pointer files, but they will not be able to fetch the actual large files from the LFS store once the original repository is deleted.
Billing and Quota Considerations:
Deleting a repository with LFS objects might also impact your LFS usage quotas and billing on GitHub. If you���re close to your LFS quota, removing a repository with large files might help in reducing your usage.
To delete a repository with LFS objects:
Backup Important Data:
Ensure you have local copies or backups of all important data, including LFS objects.
Follow GitHub's Repository Deletion Process:
This typically involves going to the repository settings on GitHub, scrolling down to the "Danger Zone", and following the prompts to delete the repository.
Remember, deletion of a repository is irreversible, and this action should be performed with caution, especially for repositories containing important or unique data.
You
I guess I restored it with compressed files. Do you know a linux command or program like imagemagick or similar that can invert colors of pdf, or is this easy to do in libreoffice?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Inverting the colors of a PDF on Linux can be done using a few different methods, including command-line tools like ImageMagick, or using graphical applications like LibreOffice. Here are some ways to do it:
1.
Using ImageMagick
ImageMagick can invert the colors of a PDF, but it's important to note that it converts PDF pages into images, which might affect the quality and increase the file size. Here's how you can do it:
bash
Copy code
convert -density 300 input.pdf -negate output.pdf
Replace
input.pdf
with your file's name and
output.pdf
with the desired output file's name.
The
-density
flag sets the DPI for the conversion process, which you can adjust to balance quality and file size.
2.
Using pdftocairo (Part of Poppler-Utils)
pdftocairo
can convert PDF files to other formats. It can be used to create image files from your PDF, invert the colors, and then convert them back to PDF. This method also treats PDF pages as images:
bash
Copy code
pdftocairo -pdf input.pdf output.pdf
mogrify -negate output-*.pdf
This method first converts the PDF to individual pages, then inverts each page, and finally, you can merge them back into a single PDF.
3.
Using LibreOffice
Inverting colors in LibreOffice Draw might be a bit tricky because it's not a standard feature for PDF editing. You would have to manually change the colors of the text and background. This is feasible for a document with simple formatting, but it can be very time-consuming for complex documents.
4.
Using a PDF Reader for Viewing
If your goal is simply to invert colors for easier reading, many PDF readers (like Okular on Linux) have a 'Night Mode' or color inversion feature that inverts colors on the screen without permanently altering the PDF file.
5.
Using a Script
You can write a simple script to automate the process of converting each page to an image, inverting the colors, and then reassembling them into a PDF. This could be done using bash scripting and tools like ImageMagick or pdftocairo.
Note:
Be mindful of the quality and size of the output file when using ImageMagick or pdftocairo, as converting PDF pages to images and back can significantly alter these aspects.
For text-heavy documents, color inversion through image conversion might not be ideal due to potential quality loss.
Always keep a backup of your original PDF file.
You
my pdf reader can do it easily but it doesn't change the document
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
If your PDF reader has the capability to invert colors for easier viewing but doesn't change the document permanently, it's likely designed for comfortable reading, especially in low-light conditions. This feature is common in many PDF readers as a part of their accessibility or reading options, but it doesn't modify the actual content of the PDF.
To permanently invert the colors of a PDF document, you would need to use a different approach. Here are some revised options that might help:
1.
Using ImageMagick (Revised Approach)
As previously mentioned, ImageMagick can be used to invert the colors, but it treats each page as an image, which might affect text quality and increase file size. Here's a slightly modified command:
bash
Copy code
convert -density 300 input.pdf -channel RGB -negate output.pdf
The
-channel RGB
option ensures that only the color channels are inverted, not the alpha channel (transparency).
2.
Using a Script with pdftoppm and img2pdf
You can use
pdftoppm
to convert PDF pages to images, then use ImageMagick to invert the colors, and
img2pdf
to reassemble them. This process maintains the quality of images better:
bash
Copy code
mkdir
temp_pages
pdftoppm -jpeg input.pdf temp_pages/page
mogrify -negate temp_pages/*.jpg
img2pdf $(
ls
temp_pages/*.jpg |
sort
-V) -o output.pdf
rm
-r temp_pages
This script creates a temporary directory, converts each PDF page to a JPEG, inverts the colors, and then reassembles them back into a PDF.
3.
Using a Dedicated PDF Editing Software
Software like Adobe Acrobat Pro or similar PDF editing tools might offer more control and preserve the document's quality better than command-line tools. However, these tools can be complex and might require a paid license.
4.
Using a Programming Approach
If you're comfortable with programming, you can use a library like PyPDF2 in Python to programmatically invert colors. This method can provide a lot of control over the process but requires programming knowledge.
5.
Consult Online Services
There are online services that can invert PDF colors, but be cautious with sensitive documents, as uploading them to third-party servers might pose security and privacy risks.
Remember:
Inverting colors using image-based methods might not retain the original quality of text and vector graphics.
Always keep a backup of your original document before attempting such modifications.
You
Yeah I just used an online tool since I only had one document, but I would like to find some easier ways to do it.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Using an online tool for a one-time task like inverting colors in a PDF can indeed be convenient. However, for more frequent use, especially if you're handling sensitive documents, it's better to have a reliable method that you can run locally. Here are a few user-friendly options that you can consider for future use:
1.
Automated Scripting
Creating a simple script can automate the process, making it much easier to use command-line tools. For instance, a Bash script using ImageMagick or pdftoppm and img2pdf (as previously described) can simplify the process into a single command. You can create such a script and use it whenever needed by just passing the file name as an argument.
2.
PDF Editing Software with Batch Processing
Some PDF editing software offers batch processing capabilities. Tools like Adobe Acrobat Pro provide a range of editing options, including color inversion, and can handle multiple files at once. This can be a more user-friendly option, though it may require a paid license.
3.
Custom Python Script
If you're comfortable with programming, a Python script using libraries like PyPDF2 or PyMuPDF can provide a lot of flexibility. You can write a script to invert colors in a PDF, and run it as needed. This approach gives you control over the process and can be tailored to your specific requirements.
4.
Dedicated PDF Manipulation Tools
There are dedicated tools for PDF manipulation that might offer a color inversion feature. Tools like PDF Studio or Master PDF Editor on Linux provide a graphical interface and a variety of editing options. These tools are often more user-friendly than command-line options.
5.
Desktop Automation Software
For a completely non-technical approach, you could use desktop automation software like AutoHotkey (Windows) or Automator (macOS). These tools allow you to create workflows that can include opening a command-line tool, running a script, or even automating interactions with a graphical program.
Tips for Using These Methods:
Test on Non-Essential Documents:
Before using any of these methods on important files, test them on non-essential documents to ensure they work as expected.
Backup Your Files:
Always keep backups of original files before applying any changes.
Security:
Be mindful of the sensitivity of the documents you're working with. Local methods are generally more secure than online tools.
Each of these methods has its own advantages and can be chosen based on the frequency of your need and your comfort level with different types of software or scripting.

You
Ok i have a copy of it on my github repository how do I make a live link to it in github makrdown? ![]((1,2,3,4,5))
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
To create a live link to an image in your GitHub repository using Markdown, you will need to use the correct syntax and provide the relative or absolute path to the image file in your repository. Here's how you can do it:
Relative Path
(if the image is in the same repository):
The syntax for embedding an image in Markdown is
![Alt text](URL)
, where "Alt text" is the alternative text for the image, and "URL" is the path to the image.
If the image is in the same repository as your Markdown file, you can use a relative path. For example, if your image
example.jpg
is in the root directory of your repository, you would write:
markdown
Copy code
![
My Image
](
example.jpg
)
If it's in a folder, include the folder name, like:
markdown
Copy code
![
My Image
](
images/example.jpg
)
Absolute Path
(linking directly to the GitHub-hosted image):
You can also use the absolute URL of the image as it appears in your GitHub repository. To get this URL, navigate to the image in your repository, right-click on it and choose "Copy image address".
The Markdown would then look like this:
markdown
Copy code
![
My Image
](
https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository/blob/branchname/path/to/your/image.jpg?raw=true
)
Make sure to append
?raw=true
to the URL to display the image itself, not the GitHub page that hosts the image.
Using GitHub Pages
:
If you have GitHub Pages activated for your repository, the images in your repository can be linked directly as they are served over the web. The URL will be similar to
https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepository/path/to/your/image.jpg
.
Example Markdown Syntax
:
markdown
Copy code
![
My Image Description
](
path/to/image.jpg
)
Replace
My Image Description
with a brief description of your image, and
path/to/image.jpg
with the actual path to your image file in the repository.
Remember to commit and push the image to your GitHub repository if you haven't already. This way, the image will be available online for your Markdown file to reference.
You
it's a pdf, and its title is peak-end-rule.pdf Maybe it could be a link that says, START HERE
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
To create a link to a PDF file in your GitHub repository using Markdown, and have the link text say "START HERE", you can follow these steps:
Determine the Path to Your PDF:
First, you need to know the path to your
peak-end-rule.pdf
file within your repository. For example, if it's in the root of your repository, the path would just be
peak-end-rule.pdf
. If it's inside a folder, it would be something like
foldername/peak-end-rule.pdf
.
Write the Markdown Link:
Use the standard Markdown link syntax, which is
[link text](URL)
. In your case, it would be:
markdown
Copy code
[
START HERE
](
peak-end-rule.pdf
)
Or, if the PDF is in a folder:
markdown
Copy code
[
START HERE
](
foldername/peak-end-rule.pdf
)
Use Absolute URL for External Access:
If you want the link to work outside of GitHub (like in a GitHub Pages site), or if the relative path doesn't work, you can use the absolute URL. Find the absolute URL by navigating to the file in your GitHub repository, clicking on it, and copying the URL from your browser. It will look something like this:
markdown
Copy code
[
START HERE
](
https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository/blob/branchname/peak-end-rule.pdf
)
Replace
yourusername
,
yourrepository
,
branchname
, and
peak-end-rule.pdf
with your actual GitHub username, repository name, branch name, and file path, respectively.
Raw Link for Direct Download (Optional):
If you want the link to start downloading the PDF immediately upon clicking (instead of opening it in the browser), use the raw version of the file URL. Append
?raw=true
to the URL:
markdown
Copy code
[
START HERE
](
https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository/blob/branchname/peak-end-rule.pdf?raw=true
)
When viewers click on the "START HERE" link in your Markdown file, they will be directed to the
peak-end-rule.pdf
file in your GitHub repository. If you used the raw link, the file would start downloading immediately.

I wonder if there is a way to slow the minimum automatic scroll speed on chrome, it's still too fast to read unfamiliar scripts
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Adjusting the minimum automatic scroll speed in Chrome can be a bit tricky, as Chrome itself doesn't offer built-in settings to fine-tune the scroll behavior to that extent. However, there are several approaches you can consider to achieve a slower scrolling speed:
1.
Extensions:
Chrome extensions can help in customizing the scroll behavior. Extensions like "SmoothScroll" or "Chromium Wheel Smooth Scroller" allow you to adjust various scrolling parameters, including speed, smoothness, and step size. Here's how you can use them:
Go to the Chrome Web Store.
Search for a scrolling extension (e.g., "SmoothScroll").
Install the extension.
After installation, access the extension's options to adjust the scroll speed and other settings to your preference.
2.
Mouse or Touchpad Settings:
If you are using a mouse or touchpad, adjusting their settings might help. This won't change the scrolling behavior exclusively in Chrome but will affect scrolling in all applications.
Mouse Settings:
Access the mouse settings in your operating system's control panel. Look for settings related to scroll speed or wheel behavior.
Touchpad Settings:
Similarly, if you're using a laptop, the touchpad settings in your system might offer scroll speed adjustments.
3.
Operating System Accessibility Options:
Some operating systems have accessibility features that can be adjusted to change how scrolling works. This varies depending on whether you're using Windows, macOS, or a Linux distribution.
4.
Custom Scripts:
For more tech-savvy users, custom scripts can be written to modify scroll behavior. This could be done using JavaScript in a custom Chrome extension or userscript. This method requires programming knowledge.
5.
Third-Party Software:
There is software available for both Windows and macOS that allows for more granular control over input devices, including scroll speed. Examples include AutoHotkey for Windows and BetterTouchTool for macOS.
Remember:
Extensions can affect browser performance, so it's recommended to use well-rated and trusted extensions.
Adjusting mouse or touchpad settings will change the behavior across all applications, not just Chrome.
Always be cautious when using third-party software or extensions, especially those that affect input or browsing behavior, from a security and privacy standpoint.
