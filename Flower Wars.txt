Here's an example of screen directions for a script titled
Flower Wars
, centered around Tlacaelel, the influential Aztec leader and architect of the Flower Wars. These directions focus on setting the tone, visualizing the historical world, and creating dynamic moments:
INT. TLACAELEL'S CHAMBER - NIGHT
The room is dimly lit by flickering torches set into the stone walls. Shadows dance across Tlacaelel's face as he kneels before a small altar, deep in thought. His expression is hard, determined. Behind him, a mural depicts a great battle ��� warriors locked in combat under the gaze of the gods.
TLACAELEL
(softly, to himself)
"The gods will be fed, or the world will perish."
He stands, his silhouette framed by the wavering firelight. His hand brushes the edge of his ceremonial war helmet, adorned with quetzal feathers. His gaze hardens as the drums of the city faintly echo in the distance.
EXT. TENOCHTITLAN - DAWN
The sprawling city of Tenochtitlan awakens under the pale light of dawn. The camera glides over the towering temples, canals, and bustling marketplaces, capturing the rhythmic pulse of life. The Great Pyramid looms in the background, a stark reminder of the Aztec empire's power and devotion to their gods.
CUT TO:
EXT. TLACAELEL'S STRATEGY MEETING - DAY
Tlacaelel stands before a group of war chiefs, each dressed in battle attire. The setting sun casts an orange glow over the horizon, bathing the group in an eerie light. Tlacaelel's voice is calm, yet commanding.
TLACAELEL
"We will not fight for conquest. We will fight for blood. For survival."
The chiefs murmur in agreement. The camera lingers on their faces ��� hardened, solemn.
CUT TO:
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - FLOWER WAR - DAY
The earth trembles beneath the warriors' feet as they clash in the heat of battle. Feathered headdresses fly through the air, and obsidian blades glint in the sunlight. The camera follows Tlacaelel as he charges into the fray, his movements fluid, precise.
SLOW MOTION:
Tlacaelel's spear strikes a warrior from Texcoco. Blood splatters across the screen. The camera captures the brutality and ritualistic nature of the battle ��� this is not conquest, this is sacrifice.
CUT TO:
EXT. TLACAELEL ON THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN - SUNSET
Tlacaelel stands at the summit of the pyramid, overlooking Tenochtitlan. His face is stern, contemplative. Below, the people gather, chanting in unison. In the distance, the setting sun dips below the horizon, casting a blood-red glow across the city.
VOICEOVER (TLACAELEL):
"We fight not for land, but to keep the gods alive. Their thirst is eternal. And so is our war."
The camera slowly zooms in on Tlacaelel's face as he watches the sun disappear. His expression is unreadable, but his eyes burn with a fierce resolve.
FADE OUT.
This is a sample of how you could structure the visual and dramatic elements of
Flower Wars
, blending the intensity of battle with the deeper philosophical undercurrents of Tlacaelel's vision for the Aztec empire. Each scene attempts to bring out the ritualistic and symbolic aspects of Aztec warfare, framed around Tlacaelel's pivotal role in shaping the empire's destiny.
