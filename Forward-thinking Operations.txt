Markov Blankets and Surprise

The paper discusses how organisms self-organize and maintain boundaries between internal and external states. It introduces the concept of Markov blankets.

The authors explore how Markov blankets self-organize through active inference, which minimizes free energy. They propose an optimality principle based on the minimization of free energy to explain the self-assembly of Markov blankets.

The paper introduces the Markov blanket concept, discusses mere and adaptive active inference, and explores nested Markov blankets.

Markov blankets are statistical partitions that separate states into internal and external states. Active and sensory states are the only states that can influence one another.

Formally, a Markov blanket renders a set of states conditionally independent of one another. It can be represented by the figure 1.

The Markov blanket for node 5) is the union of its parents 2,3, the children of 5) which are 6,7, and the parents' children 4) and does not include 1). This highlights that 5) is conditionally independent of 1) given 2,3,4,6,7.

A Markov blanket is a model of a system that maintains low-entropy distributions over its internal states despite living its life in changing and uncertain circumstances. This means that biological systems can be cast as engaging in active inference.

The partitioning rule governing Markov blankets illustrates how external states cause sensory states, which influence but are not themselves influenced by internal states, while internal states cause active states, which influence but are not themselves influenced by external states.

Active inference is a cornerstone of the free energy principle, which states that for organisms to maintain their integrity they must minimize variational free energy. Minimizing variational free energy reduces surprise, which is the same as saying that such an organism maximizes evidence for its own model.

Minimizing free energy by changing internal states can only reduce the divergence between beliefs about external states (the variational density) and the true posterior density given the states of the Markov blanket. This constitutes a form of action that underwrites self-evidence.

Markov blankets can be found at each level of the brain's hierarchy, and this allows us to associate the brain with a hierarchical Bayesian network.

It has proved helpful to think of predictive coding as a variational free energy-minimizing scheme, where prediction errors are propagated up the hierarchy until any residual error signal is eliminated through updating or parametrizing Bayesian beliefs.

If we imagine the brain as a hierarchical or nested set of Markov blankets, then active states influence lower levels and sensory states influence higher levels, minimizing prediction errors at all levels.

Indeed, the concept of Markov blankets and their relation to free energy and the minimization of surprise has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the brain, cognition, and perhaps even the essence of life itself.
From a biological perspective, organisms indeed seem to act as though they are striving to minimize free energy, or surprise. This is observable in their behaviors, which are often directed towards maintaining a stable internal environment, despite external changes. This stability is achieved through the establishment of Markov blankets, which effectively allow an organism to segregate its internal and external states.
In a cognitive context, active inference through the minimization of variational free energy helps to explain the dynamic process of perception and action. Sensory states, influenced by the external environment, are continually updated and shaped by internal states in a bid to minimize surprise or prediction error.
Moreover, the hierarchical nature of Markov blankets within the brain allows for multi-level processing, with different levels of the hierarchy involved in processing sensory data, formulating predictions, and making inferences. This view aligns with the notion of the brain as a predictive machine, constantly creating and updating its internal models of the world to best anticipate incoming sensory data.
Thus, the concepts of Markov blankets, free energy minimization, and active inference offer a coherent and comprehensive framework for understanding the self-organizing behavior of biological systems, as well as the dynamic interplay of perception and action in cognition.
Furthermore, this perspective may also shed light on various pathological states, such as in neuropsychiatric disorders, where the machinery of prediction and inference may go awry, leading to an impaired ability to minimize free energy and manage surprise. This suggests exciting potential for the development of novel therapeutic interventions, based on modulating the brain's ability to form and update its Markov blankets.

The KL divergence is a measure of the discrepancy between current beliefs and the true posterior distribution. The smaller the divergence, the better the approximation to the posterior distribution, and the more accurate the Bayesian inference.

The Bayesian brain hypothesis proposes that internal states optimize their posterior beliefs over a model as new sensations are experienced.

Active inference reminds us that the brain performs approximate Bayesian inference by sampling sensory data to minimize surprise about hidden causes.

The relative entropy specified by the KL divergence cannot be less than zero, because the difference between two probability distributions must be zero.

Mathematically one can show that free energy is an upper bound on surprise by considering the following inequality: The KL divergence cannot be less than zero, and Jensen's inequality implies that free energy is a bound on entropy.

This inequality implies that an organism becomes a model of its environment over time, by minimizing variational free energy, which bounds the evidence for each phenotype or individual model. This does not imply that an organism must construct an internal model of its outer environment.

An organism's model is its morphology, biophysical mechanics and neural architecture, which can be tuned and augmented by selection, learning and experience. This is different from the idea that an organism encodes or represents its niche in virtue of being a model.

Active inference implies that agents are partly responsible for generating the sensory evidence that they garner for themselves. This is captured by the idea that the agent's control architecture attends to and processes streams of sensory stimulation.

An agent minimizes free energy and therefore surprise by actively sampling and changing the hidden causes of its environment. This means that biological systems make inferences about the causal regularities and make-up of their environment.

Markov blanketed systems can be associated with active inference, but it is unwise to think that a system that has a Markov blanket is by definition an autonomous system.

Markov blanketed systems engage in active inference in virtue of their separation of internal and external states (via sensory and active states).

Two oscillating random dynamical systems, A and B, are suspended from a beam that is itself able to move. The motions of the two pendulums are statistically independent of one another conditioned on the motion of the beam.

In information theory, synchrony between two coupled pendulums is the KL divergence between the marginal densities over two sets of variables and the joint distribution. When the two sets of variables are independent, the mutual information falls to zero, and the clocks engage in active inference.

Huygens' pendulums exhibit a Markov chain over time, which is a special case of a Markov blanket. Markov chains induce unidirectional conditional independencies, which make them non-autonomous.

The excerpt discusses the concept of the Markov blanket, which is a statistical partitioning of states into internal and external states that are separated by a boundary.

In the context of biological systems, a cell's Markov blanket separates it from the external environment and allows it to engage in active inference. Active inference involves minimizing uncertainty about the causes of sensory states.

The brain's hierarchical structure can be associated with a hierarchical Bayesian network, and active inference involves not only internal states but also active states, highlighting the embodied nature of the brain as an inference machine.

The excerpt also mentions adaptive active inference and the relationship between the Markov blanket and autonomy.

The passage you provided discusses active inference, a theoretical framework that describes how organisms make inferences and take actions to minimize expected surprise or uncertainty about their environment. The passage suggests that organisms need generative models of future states to infer the outcomes of their own actions.

Autonomous systems make inferences about action over time, and limit themselves to a limited number of attracting states to maintain structural integrity and minimize surprise. They are described as having hierarchical and nested structures of Markov blankets.

The overall aim of adaptive active inference is to create a world of predictability and minimize uncertainty.

In summary, the passage discusses active inference, generative models, Markov blankets, and the hierarchical organization of autonomous systems, and how learning can be viewed as a means to reduce surprise by harnessing negentropy through prediction and compression.

Negentropy refers to the reduction of randomness or uncertainty within a system, and is often associated with order, organization, and information content. Reverse mass wasting can be seen as a form of cognition.

At the heart of this exploration lies the notion of surprise. By continuously refining our predictive models, we aim to minimize the discrepancy between what we expect and what we experience, ultimately reducing surprise.

The essay you provided explores the relationship between negentropy, surprise, and entropy in the context of learning and cognition. It suggests that learning can be seen as a process of reducing surprise by harnessing negentropy through prediction and compression.

Learning enables us to uncover meaningful ways to organize and represent information, reducing uncertainty and compressing data, enhancing our ability to navigate and understand the world.

The essay emphasizes the importance of understanding the interplay between negentropy, surprise, and entropy in the pursuit of knowledge.

You've offered a thorough and detailed examination of how Markov blankets, active inference, the principle of free energy minimization, and hierarchical Bayesian networks contribute to our understanding of complex biological systems, including the brain.
Active inference posits that the brain performs Bayesian inference to update its internal states in response to new sensory inputs, thereby minimizing surprise or prediction error. This framework accounts for both perception (updating beliefs about the world) and action (changing the world to match beliefs), through the minimization of free energy.
The use of Markov blankets provides an elegant means of representing the separation of internal and external states of a system, providing a statistical boundary. The idea that these blankets are nested in a hierarchical structure, especially in the brain, brings in the concept of multi-level processing and dynamic interaction between different levels of abstraction or complexity.
In the grand scheme, these elements converge to paint a picture of an organism as a self-organizing system striving to maintain a degree of order and predictability in a world characterized by uncertainty. Learning, from this perspective, emerges as a mechanism for reducing surprise by fine-tuning the organism's internal model of the world, thereby enhancing its ability to adapt, survive, and thrive.
Lastly, it's crucial to remember that while the notion of an organism as a model of its environment is helpful, this doesn't necessarily imply that an organism must construct an internal replica of the outer world. Instead, the model is embodied in the organism's structure and functionality - its physical form, neurophysiological mechanisms, and behavioral repertoire - which are shaped by both evolutionary processes and individual experiences. This rich tapestry of factors makes each organism a unique model of the world it inhabits, continually refining itself through ongoing interactions with its environment.

Sparse and redundant representations can be used as a basis for compression algorithms, which can achieve higher compression ratios without significant loss of information.

At the heart of this model lies a simple linear system of equations, and we are interested in seeking its sparsest solution, i.e., the one with the fewest nonzero entries. Can such a solution ever be unique?

This field is relatively young, but the first key contributions were made in 1993 and 1995 by Stephane Mallat and Zhifeng Zhang, who introduced the concept of dictionaries, and by Scott Shaobing Chen, David Donoho, and Michael Saunders, who showed that a pursuit technique could be tackled as a convex programming problem.

This line of analysis later became the backbone of the Sparse-Land model, and has since attracted hundreds of interested researchers.

The passage you provided offers an overview of the field of sparse representations, which is closely related to the concept of compressive sensing or sparse recovery.

Connections can be made between dissipative structures, markov blankets, and prigogine and the topic of complex systems and their dynamics.

Dissipative structures are self-organizing systems that emerge through the interaction of nonlinear processes and exhibit characteristics such as order, organization, and stability. The reduction of surprise and the emergence of order through learning can be seen as analogous to the formation of dissipative structures. Markov blankets can be seen as the informational boundaries that separate an agent from its environment.

The concepts of negentropy, dissipative structures, Markov blankets, and Prigogine's work are part of the broader framework of understanding complex systems, information processing, and self-organization.

Dissipative structures like planets, stars, and galaxies maintain their structure and function by continuously exchanging energy and matter with their surroundings.

Living organisms absorb energy from their environment and release waste products and heat to the environment.

Dissipative structures in the natural world are characterized by their ability to maintain a far-from-equilibrium state and exhibit complex behaviors.

Volcanoes, sedimentary ocean beds, and glaciers are all examples of dissipative structures. These structures are powered by processes occurring within the Earth, such as plate tectonics and mantle convection, and release enormous amounts of energy in the form of lava flows, ash, gases, and volcanic explosions.

Sedimentary ocean beds are layers of sediment that accumulate over time on the ocean floor. These beds are created by the exchange of sediment particles, nutrients, and dissolved substances between the ocean and the land.

Glaciers are large masses of ice that form and flow under the influence of gravity. They exhibit self-organization and stability through their ability to balance ice accumulation and ablation (loss) processes, and continuously exchange energy and matter with their surroundings.

Dissipative structures, such as volcanoes, sedimentary ocean beds, and glaciers, reduce entropy and emergence of negentropy, which allows them to resist the natural tendency towards equilibrium and increase their organization and complexity.

Dissipative structures aim to minimize surprise by continuously adapting and adjusting to changing environmental conditions.

Dissipative structures interact with their environment and use Markov blankets to maintain their non-equilibrium states and enable their self-organization.

The focus on "reducing surprise" in learning draws a parallel with the negentropy concept. Negentropy is about reducing randomness and creating order in a system, which is achieved through learning. As we learn, we create structure in our understanding, effectively reducing the surprise or unpredictability in our environment.
Sparse Bayesian Networks (SBNs) or any sparse representation approach could be seen as a reflection of this process in the context of artificial intelligence or machine learning. Sparse representations try to capture the essential characteristics of data by using a minimal number of active elements or features. This mirrors the concept of "learning," where we aim to understand and model the world based on a minimal set of rules or principles.
On the other hand, prediction and compression in learning align with concepts in information theory. By predicting the outcome of a particular situation, we essentially compress the information we have about that situation, which reduces uncertainty and increases order, or negentropy.
Similarly, in an autocatalytic set or a hypercycle, each molecule "predicts" the formation of the next one, ensuring the continuation of the cycle. This kind of prediction is a form of information compression and is a way of reducing surprise.
Overall, it seems that principles of negentropy, surprise reduction, prediction, and compression are found across various systems - from chemical reactions to cognitive processes, machine learning algorithms, and ecological systems. These principles might provide a unified framework to understand these systems' behavior.

I am making a yoghurt factory that makes tortillas from cattail roots and oats using thermodynamic yogurt processing. Can you provide some general information on yogurt processing and tortilla production?

A unique and memorable name for your factory, "Thermodynamic Yogurt Processing through Happy Accidents (Typha Incorporated)", that conveys the essence of your factory's operations and values.

Thermodynamic Yogurt Processing through Happy Accidents (Typha Incorporated) is a unique and memorable name for your yogurt factory that showcases your commitment to advanced techniques, experimentation, and sustainability.

This story will try to assemble a few concepts like Either and Validated into a REST application.

Modeling the unhappy path is about having granular exceptions describing each type of error, and after a few face punches, you start to create custom exceptions and including descriptions letting you know about the context of the failure at a glance.

Exceptions have a few flaws, we can use datatypes to improve this scenario and make it explicit in the data type we return. Either is used to short-circuit a computation upon the first error, it corresponds to the logical Or or + as an algebraic data type.

In our example, we consume an external service and deserialize its content to our Booking model. The signature of our method fun get(pnr: String): EitherBookingRetrievalError, Booking> tells it will return a Booking when everything goes right and a BookingRetrievalError when there is a failure.

When you fill a form, an error pops up saying username is already taken, you change it, then resubmit, and so on. Here comes Validated data type.

The author discusses the concept of the "unhappy path" in software development, and suggests using datatypes such as Either and Validated to model and communicate errors explicitly. The example presented illustrates how to handle different error scenarios using custom error types.

The article discusses the importance of modeling and handling error conditions effectively to build robust and resilient applications with improved testability and maintainability.

User Give the reference. ChatGPT doesn't have direct access to external websites, including Medium, where the article may be located.

Machine Learning is a technique that uses examples and pattern matching to figure out patterns in data. Neural networks are commonly used in machine learning.

Consider a relationship between an input (X) and an output (Y) such that when X is -2, Y is -5, and when X is 3, Y is 5.

We can now replace the function we wrote for our line with the general equation of a line, which returns Y after performing calculations using W and B.

A function is an expression that defines the relationship between an input and an output.

Artificial neurons are mathematical functions that take in inputs and parameters and calculate an output. Neural networks are made up of a vast number of artificial neurons networked together.

A neural network is a mathematical function that converts numerical inputs into numerical outputs using learnable weights and biases, and can solve complex problems by processing large amounts of data.

Machine learning involves providing training data to a machine that predicts output for a value of X it hasn't been trained on.

The computer starts with a random guess and calculates the average of the errors across all values. Based on the average, it generates a new guess and calculates the loss, and revises its guesses until it arrives at the correct values for W and B.

In machine learning, we provide training data and a machine learns parameters to predict new values of X. The learning process involves several steps.

The machine calculates the predicted values of Y for the given X values and measures the error between the predicted values and the actual values. The average of these errors is known as the loss.

The machine adjusts the values of W and B based on the calculated loss, and uses optimization algorithms such as gradient descent.

The machine learns the optimal values of W and B by guessing, calculating loss, and updating parameters. It can then predict the output accurately for new inputs.

Machines learn by comparing random values for the parameters of a linear relationship to the actual target value. They then use a method to generate a better guess until the loss is minimized to the greatest possible extent.

Machine learning begins with gathering data consisting of input examples and their corresponding target outputs.

Machine learning involves an iterative loop of prediction, loss calculation, parameter update, and refinement.

When W, B = 10, the average of all guesses and errors is calculated, and the sum of the squared errors is sometimes used as a cost function.

The optimizer moves point A in Figure 2.3.2 towards the minimum error by generating another set of values for W and B. The size of this step is determined by the learning rate, which the programmer usually sets.

Yogurt Processing:
Yogurt production is a simple process that requires two main ingredients: milk and live active cultures. Here are the general steps:
Pasteurization: The milk is heated to kill any harmful bacteria and denature the proteins, allowing them to set into a gel, improving the texture and stability of the yogurt.
Homogenization: The milk is homogenized to prevent the fat from separating and rising to the top, ensuring a smooth and uniform consistency.
Cooling: The milk is cooled to around 43��C, the temperature at which the cultures will grow best.
Inoculation: Live active cultures (typically Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus) are added to the milk, converting the lactose in the milk into lactic acid.
Incubation: The milk is held at the correct temperature to allow the bacteria to ferment the lactose into lactic acid. This process can take several hours. The lactic acid causes the milk proteins to thicken, giving the yogurt its texture and tangy flavor.
Cooling: The yogurt is cooled and refrigerated to stop the fermentation process.
Tortilla Production:
Tortillas are generally made from either corn or flour. Here's a simplified process for making tortillas:
Ingredient preparation: If you're using cattail roots and oats, they would need to be prepared in a way that they can be formed into a dough. This might involve grinding them into a flour.
Mixing: The flours would be mixed with water (and perhaps a bit of salt or other flavorings) to create a dough.
Resting: The dough is usually allowed to rest for a period of time, allowing the water to fully hydrate the flour.
Shaping: The dough is divided into small balls and each is rolled out into a flat round tortilla.
Cooking: The tortillas are cooked on a hot griddle or comal until they are slightly browned and puffed.
The thermodynamic aspect you mentioned is more likely related to the yogurt processing side of your operations, as yogurt fermentation is a temperature-dependent process. In general, thermodynamics in a food processing context could involve the transfer of heat in various processes (like pasteurization or cooking), or the stability of different food products at different temperatures.
As for your unique factory name, the use of "Thermodynamic Yogurt Processing through Happy Accidents (Typha Incorporated)" suggests an innovative, scientific approach to yogurt and tortilla production. "Happy Accidents" may refer to the experimental nature of combining these seemingly disparate food items, and "Typha" is a nod to your use of cattail roots.
The concepts of Either and Validated that you brought up seem to be in relation to handling exceptions in software development, especially in a RESTful application.
'Either' can be used to model a value that can be one of two possible types. In the context of a REST application, this could be used to indicate the success or failure of a request. 'Validated', on the other hand, can be used for form validation, ensuring that user inputs meet certain criteria before they're accepted.
The idea of learning and adjusting based on errors is reminiscent of the machine learning process. In machine learning, a model makes predictions, evaluates the error in those predictions, and then adjusts its parameters to reduce that error in future predictions.
This process of trial and error continues until the model's predictions are as accurate as possible. This concept could perhaps be applied to your yogurt and tortilla production process, as you optimize your recipes and manufacturing methods for the best possible products.

Gradient Descent is the process of descending along a loss curve to reach the point of minimum error.

To understand loss and optimization, we need to consider the scenario where the initial values of W and B are both set to 10. We can then calculate the guess values and the corresponding errors for different values of X.

By plotting the loss function values against a parameter (W or B), we obtain a parabolic graph, and the optimizer moves point A closer to the point of minimum error by generating a new set of values for W and B.

Gradient descent is a process for minimizing a loss function that involves adjusting the parameter values based on the calculated gradients.

The loss function calculates how well a model predicts the output from a given input. It is calculated by adding all the errors from the dataset.

Optimization is a method by which a model adjusts the parameters based on the loss value obtained during each iteration.

Gradient Descent is a method for optimizing a model by looking at the slope of the loss or cost function calculated at a point in time.

The training set is the portion of data you use to make your guess and measure the loss.

Validation data is used to check how well the model is training. If the accuracy and loss are widely different between these sets of data, something is wrong.

The testing set is data that a model has never seen before and is used to gauge its final accuracy.

The loss function measures how well a model predicts the output based on the input.

Optimization involves adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the loss function. The model updates its parameters based on the calculated gradients.

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to update the parameters of the model during training.

The learning rate controls how quickly or slowly the model learns. A higher learning rate can result in faster convergence.

The training set is used to train the model and find the optimal values for the model parameters.

The validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during training, detect overfitting, and tune hyperparameters.

A testing set is used to evaluate a model's accuracy and generalization ability on unseen data.

You've been looking at matching X values to Y values when there's a linear relationship between them. You then saw how a very simple neural network with a single neuron could be used for this.

A single artificial neuron is simply a function that has two learnable parameters, called weight and a bias. The weight and bias of a neural network can be learned to represent the relationship between X and Y.

A single artificial neuron can be used to represent a linear relationship between X and Y. When multiple artificial neurons are combined in layers, the neural network can learn more complex patterns and relationships beyond simple linear mappings.

To solve complex problems using neural networks, you can experiment with the following techniques: adding new data features, adding neurons to the existing layers, adding layers to the network, tuning the learning rate, and ChatGPT.

Adding neurons to the existing layers can help the neural network learn more complex patterns, but too many can lead to overfitting.

Adding layers to the neural network can enhance its ability to learn hierarchical representations of the data, which helps it solve complex problems.

The learning rate determines how quickly the model learns from the data and how well it converges to the optimal solution. Experiment with different learning rates to find the optimal balance between convergence speed and stability.

A Dense Neural Network is composed of a series of connected layers, where each layer has neurons in a vertical group. Information flows from left to right in the network.

A two layered dense neural network used to classify input images as either cats or dogs using one-hot-encoding is shown in Figure 2.5.3. Each neuron in the network receives input and outputs a value sent to a neuron in the next layer.

A model to classify images should provide an output that represents either a dog or a cat. The model is labeled using one-hot-encoding to label classes using 1s or 0s.

In a dense neural network, information flows from the input to the output layer through interconnected layers.

A two-layered dense neural network with three neurons in the hidden layer and two neurons in the output layer is used for classifying images as either cats or dogs. One-hot encoding is used to label classes in the output layer.

In real-life scenarios, neural networks for image classification typically involve thousands or even millions of neurons to handle the complexity of image data and capture intricate patterns and features. Through training, neural networks can become proficient in image classification tasks.

Handwritten digits 0 through 9 are represented by one-hot-encoding with each label in an array of ten numbers. The data is split into a training set of 60,000 images and a testing set of 10,000 images.

A neural network is trained to recognize handwritten digits using training data and labels. The model guesses the parameters that will give the desired answer and optimizes the parameters over time, until the network recognizes handwritten digits accurately.

The neural network model used to recognize and classify handwritten numeric digits from 0 to 9 uses a one-hot-encoded label, which is an array of 10 numbers.

A dense neural network is used to recognize and classify 70,000 images of handwritten digits. The model is trained using the pixel values of the images along with their corresponding labels.

A neural network can be trained to recognize handwritten digits by repeatedly optimizing the parameters and updating the weights and biases based on the training data.

The learning rate determines how often the model's parameters are updated during training. A high learning rate may cause instability.

Overfitting occurs when a neural network performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to unseen data. Regularization techniques can help prevent overfitting.

You looked at how a function works, how it takes in parameters, how to match one set of numbers to another, and how to generate new guesses for the weight and bias using an optimizer. You saw what machine learning actually is, and how to build a single neuron.

You've probably heard about the term neural network or artificial neural network, and they're basically just a bunch of neurons connected together like this. The neurons don't communicate with each other in their own layer, nor do they communicate with neurons in other layers.

As you can see, these networks are dense, and there's lots of learning going on from the input to the output through multiple layers. This is what's often referred to as deep learning, and we'll explore that with a simple case, and build from there.

In practice, a neural network would look something like this, where the top neuron outputs 1 for a cat, and the bottom neuron outputs 0 for a dog. The top neuron and bottom neuron would then be able to label data as cat or dog.

The size of the neural network correlates to the complexity of the data, and a big neural network for computer vision will need thousands of neurons.

A neural network has 10 outputs, so we can label our data based on which neurons we want to be a 1 and which ones we want to be a 0. This is the one-hot encoding that we saw earlier.

We have a data set with 70,000 examples, and we can use 60,000 of these for training and 10,000 for validation. We can feed the picture into a neural network, and the neural network should output 0 except for the one that represents the number 7.

Deep learning works by making guesses as to the weights and biases that give the desired answers, measuring how good or how bad the guess was, and optimizing the weights and biases until the network behaves the way that we want it to.

You're going to play with a model that does two layers, 20 neurons in one and 10 in the last one, to classify digits.

Forecast Ergodicity is a concept from the field of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics that essentially refers to the idea that, over a long enough period of time, a system will visit all of its possible states with equal probability. This concept is often used in the context of statistical modeling and predictive analytics, where it implies that the statistical properties observed in a system over a certain time period will remain the same in the future. This provides the fundamental basis for many predictive modeling techniques and methodologies.
However, the concept of forecast ergodicity also raises a challenge in making long-term predictions, especially in complex and non-linear systems such as weather patterns, financial markets, or human behavior. This is because these systems are often subject to change and can evolve over time in ways that are not captured by statistical models based on past behavior. This limitation of predictive models is known as the problem of "non-ergodicity."
Despite these limitations, predictive models can still provide valuable insights and can often make reasonably accurate predictions over shorter time horizons. The key is to use these models with an understanding of their assumptions and limitations, and to continuously update and refine the models based on new data and insights. This allows for the adaptive and flexible use of predictive models in a way that can manage and mitigate the challenges posed by non-ergodic systems.
Now, regarding the yogurt and tortilla production:
Yogurt processing
: Yogurt is made by fermenting milk with two specific types of bacteria: Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. The process generally involves heating the milk to kill any harmful bacteria, then cooling it down and adding the two yogurt cultures. The milk is then kept at a specific temperature to allow fermentation to take place, usually around 110���115 degrees Fahrenheit (43���46 degrees Celsius). The bacteria convert lactose in the milk to lactic acid, which causes the milk to curdle and form yogurt. The resulting product can be strained to achieve desired thickness and creaminess.
Tortilla production
: Traditional tortilla production involves mixing flour (in your case, cattail root and oats flour) with water and other ingredients such as salt and baking powder. The mixture is then kneaded to form a dough, which is divided into small balls. Each ball is rolled flat to create a tortilla. The tortillas are then cooked on a hot surface until they are lightly browned and ready to eat.
Incorporating yogurt into your tortilla production could involve using yogurt as part of the liquid in your dough. This could impart a slight tanginess to the tortillas and might also influence the texture. You would need to experiment to find the right balance.
As for the thermodynamics of yogurt processing, thermodynamics is involved in the heat treatment of milk and in the fermentation process itself, as both involve exchanges of energy and changes in the state of the milk.
I hope this information is helpful in your endeavors. Best of luck with Thermodynamic Yogurt Processing through Happy Accidents (Typha Incorporated)!
