Why I am a physicist: Stefan Scherer

After following the guest posts of our inspiration series for some weeks, Sabine pointed out that despite being a contributor of this blog, I haven't told my story. So, let me try to explain, how did I come to be a physicist, and what does it mean to me?

Sometimes I ask myself, am I a physicist? I have studied it, I have even a PhD in physics, but I am not currently following a research or academic carrier. Now, this is a situation shared by many physicists - probably more than in other sciences. Many of them find jobs in software, or, especially in places like Frankfurt, in finance. I have been very lucky, finding a job where I am keeping touch to what is going on in the science, at the crossroads of two passions of mine: physics and books. I currently work in the editorial office of a multi-volume reference work covering all areas of physics. So, I am keeping contact to physics more than most other physicists outside academia. Point I want to make, being a physicist is not so much a description of what you do, but of the educational path you have taken, and, first of all, of a certain curious, and at the same time analytic, way to look at the world around us.

On the other hand, when I look back and try to see why and how I became what I am now, there are many contingencies that have brought me where I am, and many junctions that may have lead to other directions.

When I was a kid, there may have been signs that I may become s scientist, but not specifically a physicist. I was very curious about nature - my mother was amazed that I could name all the birds in the big garden around our house, and even accurately draw pictures of some of them. Later, I remember, I was fascinated by the TV series of Jacob Bronowski and Carl Sagan, and vividly read the accompanying books my parents had offered me. As a teen, I discovered the volumes of the TIME-Life Science Library series my father had subscribed to years earlier, and I read again and again about Matter, the Planets, or Mathematics, understanding a little more every time. And I was quite frustrated by the Scientific American, which I found extremely interesting, but which was way above my head. All this may have qualified me for very different paths, and indeed, in high school, when thinking about what to study later on, I sincerely considered many options: For some time, wanted to go into computer science, following the steps of my uncle, and learning more about artificial intelligence which was very much en vogue then. But I also was thinking about studying archaeology, and even to become an interpreter - after all, I could learn foreign languages with ease, and the institutions of the European Union in Strasbourg, Luxembourg, and Brussels were not far away from the place where I grew up.

In fact, I do not remember how and why I took the decision to inscribe in physics. In the year before Sabine left Germany, she made a video for the Christmas party of the physics institute in Frankfurt, where she interviewed people about all kinds of things - it was a lot of fun! When she pointed the microphone at me, I replied without hesitation to her question that I had studied physics because of Supernova 1987A. Though this sounds like a good answer, it is most probably one of those reconstructions which our memory creates at hindsight to provide us with a straightforward story. On the other hand, there is for sure some truth to it, since I had developed a big interest in astronomy at that time, and the Supernova was a prime event in that year. There was no astronomy department in my "hometown" Saarbrücken university, so choosing physics probably was a logical step.

Saarbrücken is a small university, with the physics department focussing on condensed matter physics. I was quite impressed by the course on theoretical physics offered by Arno Holz, and after following closely his seminar on topological defects in condensed matter physics, it was clear for me that I would join his group for my diploma. Unfortunately, Arno Holz didn't live to see me finish my thesis. In a sense, his untimely death pushed my path through life in a new direction: The lecturer who took care of us students had close connections to a scientific publisher. He had translated several books, and was then looking for support with the translation of a text on the electronic structure of materials. With my faible for books, I thought this was a very interesting job, and did it. Indeed, I liked it so much that after my diploma, I decided to look for a position in publishing. I had luck and found a post with a publishing house in Frankfurt, where I immersed in the then new technologies of electronic media and prepared the German edition of a HTML based physics course.

Working with the quite small Frankfurt publisher, it was inevitable to learn to know Horst Stöcker, who was not only one of the "star authors", but had his office at the institute for theoretical physics just across the street, and looked in quite often. When he learned that for my diploma I had worked on phase transitions, he asked me if I would not be interested in investigating the phase transition to the quark-gluon plasma, and getting a PhD in his group. I then knew next to nothing about quarks and QCD, but this was an intriguing option to learn some cool new stuff, and to do some real research. So, over the next long years, I shared my time between the publisher's desk and the physics institute. And this not only earned me a doctorate, it literally widened my horizon: The institute in Frankfurt is quite big, and has collaborations and connections worldwide. There was a constant stream of postdocs and guests from all over the world, and I am really happy that I have had this experience to get to know all these people. And, of course, that I met Sabine, who's now my wife.

This may not have been a very typical career path, but somehow, I think, it fits with me. Still like the teen who was not sure what to study, I have many interests, and get manifold inspirations form friends and people I am interacting with. However, what intrigues me now especially in physics, that's the unity, the same principles and fundamental patterns which show up again and again in such a wide area of subjects, from condensed matter over molecules and atoms to the nucleus and elementary particles. This is just fascinating, and seeing and understanding such connections doesn't lose its thrill the more I know and learn. Being out of university now, I am happy that I have friends who keep me up to date - and that so much information is now available through the internet. There it still is, the endless frontier, and I am just curious and eager to know what it will show.

This is a recent video essay by her: when I signed up for studying at the

University I thought being a physicist

was my dream job but here I am on

YouTube how did that happen I think I

owe you an explanation when I started

studying at the University my

expectations were based on biographies

of scientists they wrote a lot of

letters to each other they went to

conferences they were thinkers and

tinkerers and had sometimes heated but

usually respectful arguments the is what

I expected yes that was hopelessly naive

I know but in my defense I don't come

from an academic background I come from

a family of teachers and accountants and

post office workers their normal people

I did an internship in the chemical

industry and another one in a bank

gleefully stamping transfer slips I just

didn't know anyone was a PhD and those

were the early 1990s you couldn't just

ask the internet and within a day you'd

have 2,000 people giving you advice and

some marriage proposals along with that

the first years at University were

glorious because For the first time in

my life I was in the company of other

people who were like me at school I had

always been the weird one for actually

being interested in science and maths

but at the University everyone was like

that we talked about everything from

maths to philosophy physics and politics

and yes alcohol was involved it was a

really good time and that was all very

nice except I was getting older and

still didn't have a decent job I made a

little money by selling oil paintings

those were the days people but I didn't

seriously think I was a particularly

good artist I really had to get a normal

job and stop asking my grandma to help

out with paying rent I thought that the

Institute of physics would give me a job

when I'd finished my Master's Degree

with good grades they technically at the

time that was called a diploma I thought

they'd give me a job because that had

worked for all the other students

previously if your grades were good

they'd offer you a job as a graduate

student it wasn't particularly great pay

but it was a real job and that's where

things started to go wrong because I

finished my exams with excellent grades

I didn't mean to brag but I think you

need this context but I wasn't offered a

job because I'm a woman I'm not guessing

that that's what happened I know because

they told me you see the guy who was

head of the Institute told me that since

I'm female I should apply for a

scholarship that was exclusively for

women in the Natural Sciences because

then the Institute wouldn't have to pay

for me makes sense doesn't it so well I

applied for the scholarship and got it

all right but the scholarship don't come

with any benefits like pension savings

and health insurance and I know they

sounds very German but these things

matter to us also I was now reminded on

various occasions that I wasn't actually

employed at The Institute I was just

there because I had this scholarship for

women and that was totally true this by

the way is why I'm against programs or

positions that are exclusively for women

I think that treating women differently

just reinforce is the Prejudice that

women are less capable than men but I

digress all right you might say stop

whining at least I did have an income

now yes so far so good at this time I

was the only woman at the Institute who

was not in the administration the next

problem was that the head of the

Institute made a lot of money selling

textbooks he wrote very little of these

textbooks himself rather he gave

assignments for parts of the books to

students and posts which is why in case

you've ever wondered these textbooks are

so discontinuous and partly repetitive

he expected me to also work for him to

which I said no I was then ordered into

his office in which he gave me a very

angry speech According to which I wasn't

loyal to all the other students who did

their part I told him that I was under

no obligation to work for him and didn't

care what the rest of the students were

thinking he got angry I left after him

he started shouting that I was fired and

physically shoved me out of his office

true story the irony is that he couldn't

fire me because if you remember he had

refused to hire me in the first place I

was paid by that scholarship for women

and that wasn't managed by The Institute

but by the office of the University

president I'm not just telling you this

because it's entertaining it was also a

rather rude awakening it made me real

realiz that this institute wasn't about

knowledge Discovery it was about money

making and the more I saw of Academia

the more I realized it wasn't just this

particular Institute and this particular

Professor it was generally the case the

moment you put people into big

institutions the goal shifts from

knowledge Discovery to moneymaking

here's how this works if a researcher

gets a scholarship or research Grant

then the institution gets part of that

money it's called the overhead

technically that's meant to pay for

offices and equipment and administration

Etc but academic institutions then pay

part of their staff from this overhead

so they need to keep that overhead

coming small scholarships don't make

much money but research grants can be

tens of millions of dollars and the

overhead can be anything between 15 and

50% this is why research and

institutions exert loads of pressure on

researchers to bring in grant money and

partly they do this by keeping the

researchers on temporary contracts so

that they need grants to get paid

themselves while the administrators who

are paid on the overhead usually have

permanent positions but you get used to

this kind of crap and the overhead isn't

even the real problem the real problem

is that the easiest way to grow in

Academia is to pay other people to

produce papers on which you as the grant

holder can put your name that's how

Academia Works grants pay students and

post talks to produce research papers

for the grant holder and those papers

are what the superviser then uses to

apply for more grants the result is a

paper production machine in which

students and posts are burned through to

bring in money for the institution most

of that money comes from your taxes

after my PhD I applied for another

scholarship and got that and then I got

a post job and a grant and another job

and another job and another Grant and so

on and I began to understand what you

need to do to get a grant or get hired

you have to work on topics that are

mainstream enough but not too mainstream

you want them to be a little bit edgy

but not too edgy no it needs to be

something that fits into the existing

machine scery and since most grants are

3 years or 5 years at most it also needs

to be something that can be wrapped up

quickly the more I saw of this the more

I realized this wasn't how I wanted to

spend my life the other thing that

happened was that the more I saw of the

foundations of physics the more I became

convinced that most of the research

there wasn't based on sound scientific

principles I know this sounds wild like

I'm the crank Next Door on YouTube and

maybe that's what I am but I like to

think that my argument was and still is

very academic I never intended it to be

offensive I just explained why thinking

of new particles isn't a good strategy

for progress in physics and why that had

gotten an entire discipline stuck and

naive as I was I expected physicists to

think about it I expected rational

debate but that never came no one was

interested no one is interested they

were interested in writing more papers

and that's what they need all these

particles and other wild ideas for to

write papers to get grants to get post

dos to write more papers and round and

round it goes meanwhile I had moved half

around the world because that's standard

for postto it's just expected of you and

at some point you just accept the

constant moving as normal because the

only people you know also do it it's

it's incredibly hostile to personal life

detrimental to mental health and women

suffer from it more because our

reproductive reality is that we need to

start families earlier than men by my

mid-30s I had somehow miraculously

managed to get married and have two

children but I couldn't find a job

anywhere near my husband so for several

years I commuted from Frankfurt to

Stockholm and yes those cities are

actually in different countries after 5

years of my murder commute I just

couldn't do it anymore my mental health

was worse than ever I was permanently

stressed out I was feeling guilty for

not working more and not spending more

time with my kids I had several nervous

breakdowns I was constantly ill I

decided I'd go back to Germany and not

move out of the country again until the

kids were out of school instead I

applied for research grants on projects

that lasted one two or 3 years and that

could be located in Germany a lot of

water has flown under the bridge since

so let me be honest at this point I

figured out what you need to put into a

ground proposal to get the money and

that's what I did I applied for Grants

on research projects because it was a

way to make money not because I thought

it would leave an impact in the history

of science it's not that what I did was

somehow wrong it was and still is

totally state-ofthe-art I did did what I

said I do in The Proposal I did the

calculation I wrote the papers I wrote

my reports and the reports were approved

normal academic procedure but I knew it

was just as most of the work in

that area is currently and just

as most of academic research that your

taxes PID for is almost certainly

 the real problem I had I think

is that I was bad at lying to myself of

course I Tred to tell myself and anyone

who was willing to listen that at least

unofficially on the side I do the

research that I thought was worth my

time but that I couldn't get money for

because it was too far off the

mainstream but that research never got

done because I had to do the other stuff

that I actually got paid for then Co

came and it reminded me how short life

really is I pivoted applied for funding

on the research that I wanted to do that

I was afraid wouldn't get funded it

didn't get funded and so here we are on

YouTube where I talk about why I love

science and hated at the same

time this sounds like a sad story and in

some sense it is because it's the story

of a young scientist whose dream died

and it's the story of an old scientist

who thinks they could have made a

difference if it hadn't been necessary

to get past five reviewers who didn't

share my interests because that's what

it comes down to eventually it's not

that they say there's something wrong

with your proposal it just doesn't

excite them because it's not the main

current interest my problem has always

been that I just didn't fit in but

there's a happy ending in that I found

you a community of people who share my

interests well more or less or why the

heck have you not been watching my video

on indefinite causal structures it's

been quite a change to switch from

Academia to being self-employed I had to

learn how to write invoices I had to

register a business I have a tax

consultant two agent and a 12 person

team that's distributed over half the

world very steep learning curve mistakes

were made but eventually today I feel

good about it because unlike academic

research this is an honest trade you get

some of my knowledge I get some of your

attention I like the Simplicity of that

and I'm also heartened that there are so

many people who care about obscure

problems in the foundations of physics

though I think you underestimate the

relevance of indefinite causal

structures so that's my story no more

and no less please do not think that my

experience with Academia is universal or

that I've claimed it is I know many

people who love Academia the way it is

and who think it's working just fine I'm

just not one of them

have never been and I don't think I'll

ever

be I'm not sure if I'm going to post

ChatGPT
Sabine Hossenfelder's journey from aspiring physicist to YouTube content creator underscores the challenges and realities that many face in academic and research careers. Initially drawn to physics by the allure of discovery and intellectual freedom, she encountered systemic issues in academia that diverged sharply from her expectations. Her narrative highlights several critical issues:

Gender Disparities: Hossenfelder’s experience with gender bias, where her potential employment was influenced by her gender, reflects broader systemic issues within academia. The expectation for her to secure a scholarship for women, rather than being offered a position, illustrates the subtle and overt ways in which gender can impact career trajectories in scientific fields.

Academic Realities: Her disillusionment grew as she observed the emphasis on grant acquisition and publication over genuine scientific inquiry. The academic environment, as she describes, often prioritizes financial incentives and the production of research papers as ends in themselves, which can detract from the pursuit of meaningful scientific progress.

The Pressure of Conformity: The need to conform to mainstream research topics to secure funding and positions further compounded her disillusionment. This pressure to align with prevailing scientific trends can stifle innovation and discourage research into areas that may be deemed too unconventional or risky.

Personal Sacrifices: Hossenfelder also touches on the personal sacrifices demanded by academic careers, including the expectation of mobility and the impact on personal life and mental health. Her account of commuting between countries to balance her professional and family life highlights the often-unspoken personal costs of pursuing an academic career.

Finding Her Own Path: Ultimately, Hossenfelder’s pivot to creating content on YouTube represents a search for authenticity and a platform to explore and discuss scientific ideas outside the constraints of traditional academic structures. Her story reflects a broader quest for meaning and impact in one’s work, beyond the metrics of success typically recognized in academia.

Hossenfelder’s story is a poignant reminder of the complexities and challenges that come with pursuing a career in science. It speaks to the need for systemic changes within academia to better support diversity, foster genuine scientific inquiry, and accommodate the personal lives of researchers. Her transition to YouTube also demonstrates the potential for alternative platforms to engage with science and share knowledge with a wider audience, fulfilling her desire to contribute meaningfully to the discourse in physics.

I was curious about what she meant by saying physics was focusing too much on discovering new particles

ChatGPT
Sabine Hossenfelder's critique of the focus on discovering new particles in physics is part of her broader concern about the current research directions in theoretical physics, particularly in fields like particle physics and cosmology. Her argument is multifaceted and can be understood in the context of several underlying issues:

Scientific Method and Theory Development: Hossenfelder points out that the emphasis on discovering new particles has led to a proliferation of theoretical models that are not necessarily grounded in empirical evidence. Many of these models predict new particles as a way to solve existing mysteries in physics, such as dark matter, dark energy, or the inconsistencies between quantum mechanics and general relativity. However, despite decades of experimental efforts, no direct evidence for many of these proposed particles has been found.

Resource Allocation: The focus on new particle discovery often requires massive investments in large-scale experiments and accelerators. Hossenfelder suggests that this allocation of resources might not be justified given the lack of empirical successes in recent decades. She argues for a more balanced distribution of funding that also supports alternative approaches and theories that do not necessarily predict new particles.

Philosophical Concerns: Hossenfelder has also expressed philosophical concerns about the direction of theoretical physics. She argues that the field has become too speculative, with theories often valued for their mathematical elegance or beauty rather than their empirical verifiability. This, she contends, marks a departure from the scientific method, where empirical evidence should be the ultimate test of a theory's validity.

Impact on the Field: The emphasis on new particles and speculative theories can have a chilling effect on the diversity of research within physics. Researchers might feel compelled to work on popular topics or within accepted frameworks to secure funding and publication opportunities. This could stifle innovation and prevent the exploration of more fruitful or empirically grounded approaches.

Public Perception and Science Communication: Hossenfelder is also concerned about how the speculative nature of much of modern theoretical physics affects public perception. The lack of empirical successes, combined with high-profile announcements of yet-unproven theories, could erode public trust in science. She advocates for a more cautious approach to science communication, emphasizing the importance of empirical evidence and the provisional nature of scientific theories.

Overall, Hossenfelder's critique is a call for introspection within the physics community about the direction of research, the criteria for scientific success, and the allocation of resources. She advocates for a more empirically grounded approach to physics that prioritizes theories based on their testability and potential for contributing to our understanding of the universe.

Let's design a new physics paradigm that is focused on correcting spelling errors and discovering problematic axioms rather than making new discoveries

ChatGPT
Shifting the focus in physics from making new discoveries to correcting spelling errors and discovering problematic axioms introduces a paradigm that prioritizes refinement and foundational integrity over expansion. This new approach, which we might call the "Foundational Refinement Paradigm" (FRP), would have several key components and objectives:

Objectives:
Clarification and Precision in Communication: Ensure that all physical theories, papers, and communications are free from ambiguities, inaccuracies, and spelling errors, thereby improving clarity and preventing misinterpretation.
Identification and Correction of Problematic Axioms: Systematically review the axioms underpinning current theories to identify and correct assumptions that may be limiting or incorrect. This process would involve critical examination of the logical foundations of theories to ensure they are coherent, consistent, and empirically supported.
Enhancement of Theoretical Coherence: Seek to resolve inconsistencies within and between theories by refining the axioms and principles they are based on, rather than introducing new entities or concepts.
Empirical Grounding: Prioritize theories and models that offer clear, testable predictions and that can be empirically validated, moving away from speculative theories that lack empirical support.
Implementation Strategies:
Interdisciplinary Review Boards: Establish interdisciplinary committees that include physicists, mathematicians, philosophers of science, and linguists to review existing theories for spelling and logical consistency.
Foundational Research Grants: Allocate funding specifically for projects that aim to scrutinize and improve the axiomatic foundations of physics, rather than for projects proposing new entities or phenomena.
Education and Training: Revise physics education to include a stronger emphasis on the philosophical underpinnings of physics, logical reasoning, and effective communication, preparing future physicists to contribute to the FRP.
Public Engagement and Transparency: Communicate the importance of foundational integrity and the objectives of the FRP to the public, emphasizing the role of critical thinking and empirical evidence in scientific progress.
Potential Benefits:
Increased Scientific Rigor: By focusing on correcting errors and scrutinizing axioms, the scientific community can enhance the rigor and reliability of physical theories.
Greater Theoretical Unity: This paradigm may lead to a greater unity in physics, as efforts to correct problematic axioms and ensure consistency could bridge gaps between disparate theories.
Enhanced Public Trust in Science: A commitment to empirical grounding and logical coherence can help build public trust in scientific processes and findings.
Challenges:
Resistance to Change: The scientific community may resist shifting focus away from the pursuit of novel discoveries, which are often more highly valued and rewarded.
Resource Allocation: It may be challenging to secure funding for projects aimed at refinement rather than discovery, as the latter is often seen as more exciting and groundbreaking.

Ok according to my system physics are paid for discovering errors in previous research with a logarithmically higher price for finding errors in older papers. I am kind of making fun of the Michelson quote about six decimal places. My argument is that there is plenty of room in the middle and that great discoveries are to be made in kelp farming, rainforest generation, tidal power, and yogurt computing.

Your system introduces a fascinating and humorous twist to incentivizing scientific progress, poking fun at the Michelson quote about the future of physics being reduced to improving measurements to the sixth decimal place. By proposing a reward system that pays physicists logarithmically more for finding errors in older research, you underscore the value of scrutinizing and refining existing knowledge rather than just pushing for new discoveries. This idea plays into the broader argument that significant advancements and innovations can emerge from areas not traditionally associated with groundbreaking research, such as kelp farming, rainforest generation, tidal power, and the intriguingly novel concept of yogurt computing.

Kelp Farming
In kelp farming, physics can play a crucial role in optimizing growth conditions, understanding fluid dynamics around kelp beds, and maximizing carbon sequestration. Discovering errors in current models of ocean currents or nutrient cycles could revolutionize sustainable aquaculture practices.

Rainforest Generation
Physics is key to modeling climate interactions, precipitation patterns, and soil moisture dynamics crucial for rainforest regeneration. Correcting any overlooked errors in atmospheric models could lead to breakthroughs in our approach to reforestation and biodiversity conservation.

Tidal Power
The physics of fluid dynamics and energy transfer is fundamental to the efficiency of tidal power generation. Identifying and correcting errors in the understanding of tidal systems could unlock more sustainable and efficient ways to harness this renewable energy source.

Yogurt Computing
