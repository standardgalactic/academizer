The free energy principle���a precis
17 October 2023

By Maxwell Ramstead
Keywords: cognition Free Energy Principle
1. Introduction
Here, we present the free energy principle (FEP) in a simple manner to a broad audience. Alongside other cornerstones of mathematical physics���for instance, variational principles such as the principles of stationary action or the principle of maximum entropy���the FEP serves as the basis for a new class of mechanics or mechanical theories (in the manner that the principle of stationary action leads to classical mechanics, or the principle of maximum entropy leads to statistical mechanics). This new physics has been called Bayesian mechanics [1], and comprises tools that allow us to model the time evolution of things or particles within a system that are coupled to, but distinct from, other such particles [2]. More specifically, it allows us to partition a system of interest into ���particles��� or ���things��� that can be distinguished from other things [3]. This coupling is sometimes discussed in terms of probabilistic ���beliefs��� that things encode about each other; in the sense that coupled systems carry information about each other���because they are coupled. The FEP allows us to specify mathematically the time evolution of a coupled random dynamical system, in a way that links the evolution of the system and that of its ���beliefs��� over time (or belief updating: changing your mind in light of new evidence or information).

We begin by presenting an overview of the FEP. The FEP rests on sparse coupling, that is, the idea that ���things��� can be defined in terms of the absence of direct influence between subsets of a system (that can be partitioned into things or particles). Markov blankets formalize a specific kind of sparseness or separation between things, which we take to be definitional of things per se under the FEP. We then discuss the multi-scale aspect of the FEP: namely, that this self-similar pattern repeats at every scale at which things can be observed���from rocks to rockstars, and beyond. We discuss the broader philosophical implications of this approach to thingness via sparseness. We conclude with a discussion of the integrative or unificatory implications of the FEP for the study of life and mind.

The Free Energy Principle (FEP), as presented by Maxwell Ramstead, aims to provide a foundational framework for understanding the dynamics of systems in terms of Bayesian mechanics. This principle extends the traditional boundaries of mathematical physics by employing concepts such as sparse coupling and Markov blankets. Sparse coupling involves defining entities within a system through the absence of direct influences among them, while Markov blankets describe the boundaries that separate and define these entities.
The FEP posits that all systems���from the simplest particles to complex organisms like humans���can be understood as maintaining their state and organization through processes that minimize free energy. This is analogous to systems continuously updating their beliefs or predictions about the external world based on new information, akin to a form of cognitive updating.
This principle has far-reaching implications, spanning multiple scales of observation, and suggests a unified approach to studying both living and non-living systems. The philosophical and scientific ramifications of the FEP suggest a new way of thinking about how entities maintain their existence and adapt to their environments, potentially offering insights into cognition, life, and the organization of matter.

2. Information physics from first principles
The free energy principle is a mathematical principle that allows us to describe the time evolution of coupled random dynamical systems. It was proposed by neuroscientist Karl Friston in the mid-2000s, in the context of theoretical neurobiology [4].  The FEP exists at the intersection of mathematics, statistics, and physics, namely: classical, statistical, and quantum mechanics, dynamical systems theory, and information theory.  Since its inception it has been applied to a wide range of disciplines, from wet neuroscience and computational modeling [5] and nonequilibrium physics [6, 3], to psychology [7], robotics [8, 9], collective behavior [10, 11], morphogenesis [12, 13], evolutionary biology and natural selection [14], niche construction theory [15], echo chamber formation and information spread in social networks [16], and to artificial intelligence [17].

Heuristically, the FEP tells us something deep about what it means for things to be coupled to each other, but distinct from one another. It implies that any thing that exists physically���in the sense that it can be reliably reidentified over time as ���the same thing,��� an idea that we discuss below���will necessarily look as if it ���tracks��� the things to which it is coupled. Loosely speaking, the FEP says that observable things do on average what it is characteristic or typical for them to do, given what they are���and that in doing so, they end up attuning to (and indeed tuning) the statistics of the things to which they are coupled. Mathematically speaking, this ���tracking��� behavior is formalized as a kind of abductive inference (called variational Bayes or approximate Bayesian inference), allowing the thing to attune itself to the statistics of the environment to which it is coupled (which will typically be made up of other things).

The section you provided delves deeper into the Free Energy Principle (FEP) as a cornerstone concept across various scientific disciplines, highlighting its broad applicability and foundational significance in understanding coupled systems. Karl Friston's introduction of FEP in the context of theoretical neurobiology has paved the way for its adoption in a diverse array of fields, from neuroscience and physics to social sciences and artificial intelligence.
At its core, the FEP offers a framework for explaining how systems evolve over time through interactions with their environment. This evolution is guided by the principle of minimizing free energy, which in practical terms equates to systems making predictions or forming beliefs about their surroundings. These predictions are continuously updated in response to new data, a process described mathematically through variational Bayes or approximate Bayesian inference methods.
The principle suggests that any defined "thing" in a system���be it a particle, an organism, or a more abstract entity���maintains its identity by statistically aligning its behavior with that of the coupled entities. This alignment is not merely a passive adaptation but an active process of tracking and responding to environmental statistics. Such dynamics ensure that entities not only remain coherent and identifiable over time but also function optimally within their ecological or systemic niches.
FEP's transdisciplinary appeal stems from its ability to model complex interactions and predict system behaviors across scales, offering insights into everything from individual cognitive processes to patterns in collective behavior and technological systems. This unifying approach underscores the principle's potential to bridge gaps between empirical observations and theoretical models in various scientific domains.

3. Some preliminary epistemology of physics: Dynamics, mechanics, and principles
More precisely, we appeal to a distinction between dynamics, mechanics, and principles, which is fairly standard in physics [1]. Dynamics are simply formal descriptions of behavior. Mechanics (aka mechanical theories) are mathematical theories that are developed to explain the functional form or ���shape��� of dynamics, i.e., they explain why the dynamics are the way that we observe them to be. Principles, in turn, tell us where mechanical theories come from. More formally, mechanical theories allow us to generate dynamics, whereas principles can be used to write down mechanical theories. For instance, classical mechanics emerges from the principle of least action: we set the variation of the action to zero, and take the paths of the system that conform to that constraint, as the paths of the system through its state space.

The move from dynamics to mechanics and principles is well illustrated by the transition from Galileo and Kepler���s phenomenological formalizations to Newton���s principles-based formulations (simplifying the history somewhat). Kepler���s formal descriptions of the movements of heavenly bodies���formalized as geocentric ellipses���constitute a dynamics, according to this definition. Newton���s laws of motion explain (e.g.) why the elliptical trajectories of planets have the shape that they do.

The FEP is what it says on the tin: it is a principle, which can be applied as a modeling method for generic physical systems. Importantly, the FEP is not an empirical theory that could be subjected to verification or falsification. Rather, much like the principle of least action or the principle of maximum entropy in physics, the FEP is used to write down theories that can, in turn, be subjected to empirical verification procedures. The truth of the FEP is mathematical. Having said that, it is a striking fact that principles like the principle of least action and the FEP can be used to explain the behavior of things in the natural world (see [1], for a discussion). If the principle of least action leads to classical mechanics, the FEP, in turn, leads to Bayesian mechanics. This is a physics of the informational coupling between interacting things.

This section outlines a fundamental conceptual framework within physics that distinguishes between dynamics, mechanics, and principles���each playing a critical role in the formulation and understanding of physical theories.
Dynamics
: This term refers to the formal descriptions of the behaviors or states of systems as observed. Dynamics do not inherently provide explanations; they simply describe what happens, such as Kepler���s description of planetary orbits as ellipses.
Mechanics
: Mechanics build on dynamics by providing the mathematical theories that explain the observed behaviors���essentially, they answer the question of "why" a system behaves as it does. For example, Newton's laws of motion offer a mechanical explanation for Kepler���s dynamical observations of planetary motion.
Principles
: Principles are the foundational concepts from which mechanical theories are derived. They provide a basis to formulate and shape these theories. For instance, the principle of least action in classical mechanics dictates that the path taken by a system between two states is the one for which the action is minimized.
The Free Energy Principle (FEP) fits into this hierarchy as a principle. It's a tool for generating mechanical theories about the behavior of systems, particularly in how they interact and exchange information���coined under the term "Bayesian mechanics." Like other principles in physics, the FEP provides a framework from which dynamics can be derived and understood, though it itself is not directly verifiable through empirical data. Instead, the mechanics derived from the FEP can be tested and refined based on empirical observations.
This epistemological approach highlights how principles like the FEP are crucial in physics and related disciplines. They not only help in framing scientific inquiries and developing models but also serve as a bridge linking abstract mathematical formulations to tangible, observable phenomena. The FEP���s application across various domains���from neuroscience to social sciences���underscores its utility in explaining and predicting the dynamics of systems characterized by complex informational interactions.

4. A theory of thingness (or ���every thing���)
The perspective opened up by the FEP starts from the question of what it means to be an observable thing in our physical universe. In other words, it assumes the rest of physics and attempts to answer that question specifically in the context of physical reality. The (classical) formulation of the FEP answers the question by appealing to the separation of timescales: at some time scale, it looks as if there are things that can be reliably (re)identified, and that persist through time as what they are [3]. The FEP is thus at its very core a dynamical systems approach, focused on the time evolution of coupled random dynamical systems���which are both separate from but coupled to each other���and also on modeling the time evolution of this coupling itself [6].

In that sense, it attempts an answer to the question that is preliminary to state space modeling. Indeed, when one uses the FEP, one usually begins by specifying a temporal scale, formally doing so via the apparatus of the Langevin equation, which has the form

x��(�� ) = f (x, �� ) + ��

This  allows  us  to  describe  the  time  evolution  or  flow  x of a system as a mixture of a deterministic component f (known as the flow or drift) and a noise component ��, which represents the phenomena that are averaged out at some time scale. Given this setup, one an traverse scales of variance, from the very fast fluctuations of unimaginably small quantum processes and fields, through to the meso-scale of living systems, to large-scale cosmological phenomena���carving out ���things��� at each scale, in terms of the sparseness structures or Markov blankets that emerge and dissolve as one traverses scales. The notion that the evolution of systems is driven by the interaction of nested phenomena unfolding at faster and slower timescales is ubiquitous in scientific investigation, from physics to psychology���and the idea that scientifically interesting systems are nested systems, composed of other interesting systems, is core to the FEP.

The "theory of thingness" explored within the Free Energy Principle (FEP) addresses profound questions about the nature and persistence of entities ("things") in the physical universe. This theory leverages the concept of timescale separation to define what constitutes an observable entity. At certain timescales, entities appear distinct and consistent enough to be recognized and identified consistently over time, thus fitting the classical definitions of things.
The FEP utilizes a dynamical systems framework to model how these entities, while distinct, remain interconnected through various forms of coupling. This approach not only accounts for the time evolution of individual systems but also the evolution of the interconnections among these systems. The key tool in this modeling is the Langevin equation:

���the noise that encapsulates random, transient fluctuations. Such a formulation allows scientists to describe and predict the behavior of systems across multiple timescales, from quantum fluctuations to cosmological shifts.
In essence, the FEP suggests that everything in the universe���from subatomic particles to galaxies���can be modeled as systems defined by their temporal and spatial boundaries, known as Markov blankets. These boundaries distinguish systems from their environments but also link them through interactions that allow for energy and information exchange. By defining entities in terms of their Markov blankets, the FEP provides a robust framework for understanding how entities emerge, persist, and evolve within the universe.
This approach is integral to the FEP's broader application in understanding nested systems. It posits that systems are often composed of smaller subsystems, each with its own dynamics and timescales. This concept is central to many fields of study, suggesting a universal applicability of the FEP in explaining not only physical phenomena but also biological and psychological processes where entities are seen as both products and parts of larger systems.

5. Sparseness and thingness
The FEP is based on the idea that sparseness is key to thingness. The main idea is that thingness is defined in terms of what is not connected to what. Think of a box containing an idealized gas, as opposed to a box containing a rock. In a gas, we have strongly mixing dynamics: any molecule in the gas could find itself arbitrarily connected to any other, such that no persistent ���thing��� can be identified in the box. By contrast, a rock does not mix with or dissipate into its environment���at least, not over the temporal scale that we can reliably reidentify it as being the rock that it is. In other words, the rock exists as a rock (i.e., as the thing that it is) because it is disconnected from the rest of the system in a specific way.

We said earlier that the FEP says that if a physical thing exists, then it will look as if it is tracking the things to which it is coupled. More precisely, then, the FEP states that if a physical system instantiates the right kind of sparseness, then subsets of the system (i.e., particles or things) will appear to track each other. The sparseness in play is formalized as a Markov blanket. (Note that, terminologically, we use the word ���system��� to refer to the whole random dynamical system, and the word ���thing��� or ���particle��� to refer to Markov blanketed subsets of that system.)


Figure 1: Markov blankets and sparseness. The Markov blanket captures the dependence structure of the dynamics or flow of a sparsely coupled random dynamical system. Note that the equations of motion show that internal states are only influenced by blanket states and other internal states; and vice versa for external states. Likewise note that sensory states are defined as those that are affected by external states and affect internal states (thereby mediating their vicarious interactions) but that are not affected by internal states; and vice versa for active states.

The Markov blanket is important because it is the way that we capture the sparse dependence structure of the system: where dependence means that one random variable quantifiably predicts the flow or dynamics of another. The blanket is defined as the set of states conditioned upon which states internal to a particle are rendered independent of states external to the particle. With the blanket so defined, the FEP says that if a system contains a Markov blanket, then states internal to the boundary will look as if they encode a kind of belief about what lies beyond the boundary, i.e., a Bayesian belief or conditional probability distribution, parameterised by internal states.

Figure 2: The free energy principle: A technical diagram. The free energy principle (FEP) says that if the generative model (or dependence structure) of a random dynamical system contains a Markov blanket, then it will look as if internal states track the statistics of external states across the boundary. Technically, these beliefs are the parameters of an approximate Bayesian or variational probability density defined over all the states of the system. Note that external states are only labeled as external relative to other particles and their internal states; see [20].

Equipped with the FEP, one can now simulate or model self-organization in terms of (Bayesian) belief updating. In other words, in the same way one can use classical mechanics to model, design, and build physical artifacts (e.g., bridges and planes), one can use Bayesian mechanics to model, design, and build things that evince ���sentient��� behavior (e.g., cells and minds)���where ���sentient��� means ���responsive to sensory stimuli��� (as in [21]). This is the utility of the FEP; namely, the applications discussed above. We conclude with a brief discussion of some philosophical commitments behind these applications.

The section on "Sparseness and Thingness" within the context of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) elaborates on how the concept of sparseness is fundamental to defining entities or "things" in a system. Sparseness is essentially about what is not connected, or the absence of connections, which helps to delineate distinct entities within a broader system.
Understanding Sparseness and Thingness:
Concept of Sparseness
: The FEP posits that for something to be considered a distinct entity ("thing"), it must exhibit a level of disconnection or separateness from other elements within the system. This separateness allows the entity to maintain its identity over time, akin to a rock in a box that remains distinct and does not mix with its surroundings, unlike gas molecules which are in constant, chaotic interaction.
Role of Markov Blankets
: Markov blankets are crucial in this framework as they define the boundaries of a "thing" within a system. A Markov blanket for a particular subsystem includes all the variables that shield the internal states of the subsystem from the external states. This boundary ensures that internal states are only influenced by other internal states and the states on the blanket, allowing the subsystem to maintain its distinctiveness and functional autonomy.
Internal States
: Influenced by and influence the states in the Markov blanket.
External States
: Defined relatively, these are the states outside of the Markov blanket which do not directly influence the internal states of the subsystem.
Bayesian Beliefs and Self-Organization
: Within the boundaries defined by a Markov blanket, the internal states of a subsystem are thought to encode beliefs about the external world. These beliefs are represented by a conditional probability distribution, parameterized by internal states, reflecting the subsystem's "expectations" or predictions about external states. This setup allows for Bayesian belief updating, where the subsystem adjusts its internal states (beliefs) in response to changes in its environment, maintaining its identity and functionality.
Application and Implications:
The utility of the FEP, as articulated through sparseness and Markov blankets, extends beyond simple physical systems to more complex, sentient behaviors observed in biological and artificial systems. By applying the principles of Bayesian mechanics, derived from the FEP, researchers and engineers can model, design, and simulate systems that exhibit responsive and adaptive behaviors, akin to sentient organisms. This can have profound implications for fields like robotics, AI, and cognitive sciences, where understanding and replicating sentient behavior is crucial.
Philosophical Commitments:
The FEP, while deeply rooted in mathematics and physics, also carries philosophical implications regarding how entities are defined and understood within the physical universe. It challenges and refines our conceptualization of individuality and interaction in complex systems, providing a structured yet flexible framework to explore the dynamics of life, cognition, and matter.
In conclusion, the theory of sparseness and thingness under the FEP provides a comprehensive approach to understanding how distinct entities maintain their identities through sparse connections and informational boundaries. This understanding is pivotal for advancing theories and applications across various scientific and technological domains.

6. Strange inversions and the FEP
The philosophical implications of Bayesian mechanics under the FEP have only begun to be explored (see [1], for a discussion). A few general remarks are in order. One first implication concerns the nature of explanation under the FEP. The FEP rests on a ���strange inversion��� (in the spirit of [22]) of the traditional explanatory strategy deployed in the sciences of life and mind. In particular, the FEP inverts the usual manner of explaining phenomena in the life sciences [23]. Typically, we have some phenomenon that we want to explain [24, 25], and the usual procedure is to identify the set of parts, operations, and their organization which together lead to the emergence of that phenomenon. The FEP inverts this style of explanation: it does not say that organisms must minimize free energy or surprise to exist. Rather, the FEP says that if things exist, then they minimize free energy or surprise���or can be modeled as such [23, 26].

A second major philosophical implication of the FEP has to do with what it means to exist as a whole. The FEP theoretic type of explanation also constitutes an inversion of the traditional metaphysics of emergence that we have inherited from Aristotle and which continues to structure thinking about emergence in philosophy and science. This is the view that the whole is ���other than��� or ���more than the sum of its parts,��� which was popularized in modern times by British emergentists [27]. On this view, the nested or multi-level structure of physical reality is best understood as the successive emergence or supervenience of new ���layers of reality��� from more basal phenomena (e.g., the emergence of chemistry from physics, or the emergence of biology from chemistry). On this count, the FEP underwrites another ���strange inversion.��� Under the FEP, the novel capabilities of the whole are underwritten by the fact that the whole is less than the sum of its parts. Indeed, a whole can only function as an integrated whole if we remove degrees of freedom from its parts. A petrol engine, for instance, can only function if the degrees of freedom of its pistons are dramatically reduced (to movement along a single axis); and the easiest way to destroy an engine would be to introduce such new degrees of freedom. The same could be said about cancer formation in living tissues, etc. (see [28]). Of course, the phenomena that emerge from interactions between the constrained components are vastly different from their unconstrained counterparts and may appear new or unpredictable. However, mathematically speaking, this emergent behavior is made possible for the system because degrees of freedom have been removed from the parts. (Note that this sparseness-based perspective on thingness is closely related to discussions of the ���closure of constraints��� in the enactive approach [29, 30]���indeed, we know that maximizing entropy given a set of constraints is mathematically equivalent to minimizing variational free energy given a generative model [2, 1, 31]���and is closely related, but distinct from, discussions of ���absential��� phenomena discussed by [32].

ChatGPT
The discussion on "Strange Inversions and the FEP" highlights two profound philosophical implications of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and Bayesian mechanics, which both challenge and reshape traditional explanatory and metaphysical frameworks in the sciences, particularly in the life and cognitive sciences.
1. Inversion of Traditional Explanatory Strategies
Traditionally, scientific inquiry in the life sciences has followed a reductionist approach, where phenomena are explained by identifying the parts, operations, and organizational structures that produce them. The FEP introduces a "strange inversion" to this approach by positing that if entities (or "things") exist, they inherently minimize free energy or surprise. This is a reversal of the typical cause-effect reasoning; instead of saying that minimizing free energy leads to the existence or persistence of systems, the FEP suggests that the existence of systems implies their engagement in free energy minimization. This perspective aligns with the idea that systems are not just passive receivers but active participants in their own perpetuation through constant prediction and adjustment in response to environmental feedback.
2. Metaphysical Inversion of Emergence
The traditional view of emergence, influenced by Aristotelian metaphysics and later by British emergentists, posits that wholes are more than the sum of their parts, often exhibiting new properties or capabilities that do not exist in the individual components. The FEP challenges this by suggesting that the capabilities of the whole are actually underwritten by a reduction in the degrees of freedom of its components. This implies that a system���s functional integrity and emergent properties are facilitated by constraining and specifying the roles and interactions of its parts. Such constraints ensure efficient and predictable operation, much like a petrol engine functions optimally only when the movements of its pistons are strictly regulated. In biological terms, this can be analogized with cancer, where the deregulation of cellular behavior leads to pathological outcomes.
This FEP-based view aligns with concepts in enactive cognition and theories of constraints, where the closure and specification of constraints are seen as central to the functioning and evolution of systems. It also connects to philosophical discussions around "absential" phenomena���those properties or behaviors that arise not merely from the presence of certain elements but from their orchestrated absence or limitation.
Philosophical Contributions and Implications
The philosophical contributions of the FEP are significant as they offer a new lens through which to view both the mechanics of life and cognitive processes and the broader metaphysical questions about the nature of wholes and their emergent properties. By inverting traditional notions about causality and emergence, the FEP provides a framework for understanding how systems manage complexity and maintain coherence, not by adding more elements or interactions, but by judiciously limiting and defining them.
This approach has deep implications for various fields, including systems biology, cognitive science, and robotics, suggesting that the design and management of complex systems might benefit from principles that focus on minimizing complexity and specifying functional constraints, rather than merely maximizing components and interactions.

Finally, the FEP has some deep philosophical implications for the way that we carve up the natural world. In a sense, the introduction of Bayesian mechanics echoes the move from Scholastic philosophy to classical mechanics in the late 1600s (for a related discussion in consciousness studies, see [33]). In Scholastic philosophy, following the teachings of Aristotle, the movements or behaviors of things (i.e., their dynamics) was explained by appealing to the five classical elements of nature: earth, water, air, fire, and aether. More broadly, the world was divided into the sublunary and supralunary spheres of existence. On this view, the sublunary sphere comprised the things that we know from our ordinary experience, where things are always in the process of becoming, i.e., they have a beginning, middle, and end. The behaviors of things were then explained by appealing to the properties of the classical elements. For instance, the earth element is cold and dry, and things that are of that element tend to fall. The supralunary sphere denoted the behavior of celestial bodies and the like, which were of the aether element, and thereby moved in perfect circles and not subject to decay.

The conceptual revolution introduced by classical mechanics abolished the distinction between sublunary and supralunary spheres of existence, since it could be shown that the dynamics of supralunary and sublunary things were governed by the same principles. Similarly, the FEP stands in contrast to approaches that would split the sphere of mind or life from the sphere of physical phenomena, such as some versions of the enactive approach (e.g., [34]). The FEP eschews all such distinctions and embraces a physics of thingness that ranges from subatomic particles to galaxy clusters���and every kind of thing in between. Importantly, the resulting philosophical perspective is not physicalist reductionism (a reduction of causal efficacy to ���mere��� physics)���but rather, a deep commitment to anti-reductionism, emphasizing the causal contributions of things at every scale to the overall dynamics of the nested system.

The profound philosophical implications of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) as described in your summary extend to revising our understanding of the natural world's organization and the traditional divides between different domains of existence. This perspective mirrors a significant shift in philosophical and scientific thought, similar to the transition from Scholasticism to classical mechanics that fundamentally altered our comprehension of the universe.
Transition from Scholastic to Modern Physics
Historically, Scholastic philosophy, deeply influenced by Aristotle, categorized the world into sublunary and supralunary spheres, with distinct dynamics governed by the classical elements (earth, water, air, fire, and aether). This dichotomy positioned celestial bodies as perfect and incorruptible, moving in eternal circles, distinct from the ever-changing, corruptible nature of earthly things. Classical mechanics dissolved these distinctions by demonstrating that both celestial and terrestrial phenomena could be explained by the same set of natural laws.
FEP���s Philosophical Paradigm Shift
Similarly, the FEP eliminates the traditional separations���such as those between mind and matter, or life and non-life���asserting that all phenomena, from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest galaxy clusters, operate under the same principles of Bayesian mechanics. This universal applicability challenges both the dualistic divides and strict reductionism that reduces all phenomena to mere physical interactions. Instead, the FEP promotes an anti-reductionist stance, recognizing the unique and significant causal contributions of entities at every scale.
Implications for Understanding Complexity
This shift has critical implications for how we conceptualize complexity and causality in the natural world:
Unified Framework
: By applying the same principles across all scales and systems, FEP provides a unified framework for understanding phenomena that traditionally belong to separate domains of science.
Complex Systems
: It acknowledges that complex systems exhibit properties and behaviors that cannot simply be predicted or explained by examining their parts in isolation. This supports a holistic view where the interactions and interdependencies within systems play crucial roles.
Causality
: FEP emphasizes a layered causality where different levels of organization influence each other in non-linear and often unpredictable ways, challenging simple cause-effect chains.
Broader Impact
In recognizing the interconnectedness and non-reductionist causality of systems, the FEP contributes to a broader understanding of the natural world that aligns with contemporary approaches in systems biology, cognitive science, and ecological studies. This approach encourages a more integrated view of science and philosophy, where the behavior of complex systems can be understood through both the properties of their components and the dynamics of their entire network.
In sum, the FEP not only provides a scientific framework for understanding the dynamics of systems but also offers a philosophical lens through which we can reconsider our traditional categorizations and understandings of the universe, fostering a more interconnected and holistic view of nature.

Could I get some simplified analogies and metaphors to explain the more difficult topics?
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Certainly! Simplified analogies and metaphors can make complex concepts like those found in the Free Energy Principle (FEP) more accessible:
1.
Markov Blankets
: Think of a Markov blanket as the shell of a turtle. The shell separates the turtle from the outside environment, protecting it and allowing it to interact with the world through specific, controlled interfaces (its head, legs, and tail). In a similar way, a Markov blanket in a system delineates the boundaries between the internal states of a system and the external environment, mediating the interactions between them.
2.
Minimizing Free Energy
: Imagine you are trying to adjust the temperature in your house to be comfortable but also energy efficient. You might adjust your thermostat settings based on the weather forecast (external information) and how warm or cool your house currently feels (internal state). In this way, you're trying to minimize the "energy cost" or discomfort. Similarly, systems minimize free energy by adjusting their states to better predict and cope with environmental changes, reducing uncertainty.
3.
Bayesian Mechanics and Updating Beliefs
: Consider how you might navigate a familiar path in the fog. Even though visibility is poor, you use your knowledge of the path (prior belief) and any faint landmarks you can see (new evidence) to update your understanding of where you are and adjust your direction. This continuous process of updating your belief about your location based on new sensory data is akin to how Bayesian mechanics describe systems updating their states based on new information.
4.
Sparseness and Thingness
: Think of a crowded room where everyone is moving randomly versus a dance performance where each dancer has a clearly defined space and set of movements. In the crowded room, it's hard to distinguish individual patterns or predict movements (like a gas), while in the dance, each dancer's role and space (sparseness) make it easy to identify and follow them (like a rock). This analogy helps explain how sparseness in a system allows us to define and recognize "things" as distinct entities.
5.
Strange Inversions in Explanation
: The traditional view might say a plant grows towards the light because it needs light to grow (a straightforward cause-effect relationship). The FEP inversion would say, if we see a plant, we can infer it must have successfully optimized its interaction with its environment (including light) to minimize free energy, indicating an ongoing, successful adaptation rather than a simple causal response.
These analogies should help clarify some of the foundational concepts of the FEP and make them more relatable by connecting them to everyday experiences or observable phenomena.
