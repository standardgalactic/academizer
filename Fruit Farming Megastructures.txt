Background information and structure 
of paper 
It has been known since the 1800s that infrared-absorbing 
(greenhouse) gases (GHGs) warm Earth���s surface and that the 
abundance of GHGs changes naturally as well as from human 
actions [1, 2].1 Roger Revelle wrote in 1965 that we are conducting 
a ���vast geophysical experiment��� by burning fossil fuels that accu- 
mulated in Earth���s crust over hundreds of millions of years [3] 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air is now increasing and already has 
reached levels that have not existed for millions of years, with 
consequences that have yet to be determined. Jule Charney led a 
study in 1979 by the United States National Academy of Sciences 
that concluded that doubling of atmospheric CO2 was likely to 
cause global warming of 3 �� 1.5���C [4]. Charney added: ���However, 
we believe it is quite possible that the capacity of the 
intermediate waters of the ocean to absorb heat could delay the 
estimated warming by several decades.��� 
After U.S. President Jimmy Carter signed the 1980 Energy 
Security Act, which included a focus on unconventional fossil 
fuels such as coal gasification and rock fracturing (���fracking���) to 
extract shale oil and tight gas, the U.S. Congress asked the 
National Academy of Sciences again to assess potential climate 
effects. Their massive Changing Climate report had a measured 
tone on energy policy���amounting to a call for research [5]. Was 
not enough known to caution lawmakers against taxpayer sub- 
sidy of the most carbon-intensive fossil fuels? Perhaps the equa- 
nimity was due in part to a major error: the report assumed that 
the delay of global warming caused by the ocean���s thermal iner- 
tia is 15 years, independent of climate sensitivity. With that as- 
sumption, they concluded that climate sensitivity for 2 ��� CO2 is 
near or below the low end of Charney���s 1.5���4.5���C range. If climate

sensitivity was low and the lag between emissions and climate 
response was only 15 years, climate change would not be nearly 
the threat that it is. 
Simultaneous with preparation of Changing Climate, climate 
sensitivity was addressed at the 1982 Ewing Symposium at the 
Lamont Doherty Geophysical Observatory of Columbia 
University on 25���27 October, with papers published in January 
1984 as a monograph of the American Geophysical Union [6]. 
Paleoclimate data and global climate modeling together led to an 
inference that climate sensitivity is in the range 2.5���5���C for 2 ��� 
CO2 and that climate response time to a forcing is of the order of 
a century, not 15 years [7]. Thus, the concept that a large amount 
of additional human-made warming is already ���in the pipeline��� 
was introduced. E.E. David, Jr, President of Exxon Research and 
Engineering, in his keynote talk at the symposium insightfully 
noted [8]: ���The critical problem is that the environmental impacts 
of the CO2 buildup may be so long delayed. A look at the theory 
of feedback systems shows that where there is such a long delay, 
the system breaks down, unless there is anticipation built into 
the loop.��� 
Thus, the danger caused by climate���s delayed response and 
the need for anticipatory action to alter the course of fossil fuel 
development was apparent to scientists and the fossil fuel indus- 
try 40 years ago.2 Yet industry chose to long deny the need to 
change energy course [9], and now, while governments and fi- 
nancial interests connive, most industry adopts a ���greenwash��� 
approach that threatens to lock in perilous consequences for hu- 
manity. Scientists will share responsibility if we allow govern- 
ments to rely on goals for future global GHG levels, as if targets 
had meaning in the absence of policies required to achieve them. 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was 
established in 1988 to provide scientific assessments on the state 
of knowledge about climate change [10] and almost all nations 
agreed to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change [11] with the objective to avert ���dangerous an- 
thropogenic interference with the climate system���. The current 
IPCC Working Group 1 report [12] provides a best estimate of 3���C 
for equilibrium global climate sensitivity to 2 ��� CO2 
and 
describes shutdown of the overturning ocean circulations and 
large sea level rise on the century time scale as ���high impact, low 
probability��� even under extreme GHG growth scenarios. This con- 
trasts with ���high impact, high probability��� assessments reached 
in a paper [13]���hereafter abbreviated Ice Melt���that several of 
us published in 2016. Recently, our paper���s first author (JEH) de- 
scribed a long-time effort to understand the effect of ocean mix- 
ing and aerosols on observed and projected climate change, 
which led to a conclusion that most climate models are unrealis- 
tically insensitive to freshwater injected by melting ice and that 
ice sheet models are unrealistically lethargic in the face of rapid, 
large climate change [14]. 
Eelco Rohling, editor of Oxford Open Climate Change, invited 
a perspective article on these issues. Our principal motivation in 
this paper is concern that IPCC has underestimated climate sen- 
sitivity and understated the threat of large sea level rise and 
shutdown of ocean overturning circulations, but these issues, be- 
cause of their complexity, must be addressed in two steps. Our 
present paper addresses climate sensitivity and warming in the 
pipeline, concluding that these exceed IPCC���s best estimates. 
Response of ocean circulation and ice sheet dynamics to global 
warming���already outlined in the Ice Melt paper���will be 
addressed further in a later paper. 
The structure of our present paper is as follows. Climate sensi- 
tivity section makes a fresh evaluation of Charney���s equilibrium 
climate sensitivity (ECS) based on improved paleoclimate data 
and introduces Earth system sensitivity (ESS), which includes the 
feedbacks that Charney held fixed. Climate response time section 
explores the fast-feedback response time of Earth���s temperature 
and energy imbalance to an imposed forcing, concluding that 
cloud feedbacks buffer heat uptake by the ocean, thus increasing 
the delay in surface warming and making Earth���s energy imbal- 
ance an underestimate of the forcing reduction required to stabi- 
lize climate. Cenozoic era section analyzes temperature change 
of the past 66 million years and infers the Cenozoic history of 
CO2, thus providing insights about climate change. Aerosols sec- 
tion addresses the absence of aerosol forcing data via inferences 
from paleo data and modern global temperature change, and we 
point out potential information in ���the great inadvertent aerosol 
experiment��� provided by recent restrictions on fuels in interna- 
tional shipping. Summary section discusses policy implications 
of high climate sensitivity and the delayed response of the cli- 
mate system. Warming in the pipeline need not appear. We can 
take actions that slow and reverse global warming; indeed, we 
suggest that such actions are needed to avoid disastrous conse- 
quences for humanity and nature. Reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions as rapidly as practical has highest priority, but that 
policy alone is now inadequate and must be complemented by 
additional actions to affect Earth���s energy balance. The world is 
still early in this ���vast geophysical experiment������as far as conse- 
quences are concerned���but time has run short for the 
���anticipation��� that E.E. David recommended.

The paper you're referring to seems to focus on the critical issue of climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases and the delayed response of Earth's climate system to emissions. Here's a breakdown of the background information and structure:
Background Information
The scientific understanding that greenhouse gases warm Earth���s surface has been established since the 1800s.
The concept that the abundance of these gases can change naturally and through human actions was noted by Roger Revelle in 1965, highlighting the ongoing "vast geophysical experiment" due to the burning of fossil fuels.
Revelations from studies in the late 1970s and early 1980s (such as Charney's study and the Changing Climate report) explored the impacts of CO2 levels on climate, pointing to an underestimated climate sensitivity and a potentially longer delay in temperature increase due to the ocean's thermal inertia.
Structure of the Paper
Climate Sensitivity Section:
Reevaluates the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) suggested by Charney using updated paleoclimate data and introduces Earth system sensitivity (ESS) which considers additional feedbacks.
Climate Response Time Section:
Discusses the fast-feedback response times of Earth���s temperature and energy imbalance due to external forcing, with an emphasis on cloud feedbacks and their role in moderating ocean heat uptake.
Cenozoic Era Section:
Analyzes temperature changes over the past 66 million years, providing insights into the historical levels of CO2 and their implications for understanding modern climate change.
Aerosols Section:
Addresses gaps in aerosol forcing data, using inferences from paleo data and recent changes in global temperatures, particularly noting the effects of modern regulations on shipping fuels.
Summary and Policy Implications Section:
Concludes with a discussion on the high climate sensitivity and the need for urgent policy measures to mitigate the delayed but significant effects of climate change.
The authors aim to highlight the underestimated aspects of climate change models and the urgent need for anticipatory action to mitigate the worst impacts of global warming. This work is framed within the context of ongoing scientific debates and public policy, stressing that while significant advancements in understanding have been made, much work remains in terms of policy adaptation and mitigation strategies.

Climate sensitivity (ECS and ESS) 
This section gives a brief overview of the history of ECS estimates 
since the Charney report and uses glacial-to-interglacial climate 
change to infer an improved estimate of ECS. We discuss how 
ECS and the more general Earth system sensitivity (ESS) depend 
on the climate state. 
Charney defined ECS as the eventual global temperature 
change caused by doubled CO2 if ice sheets, vegetation and long- 
lived GHGs are fixed (except the specified CO2 doubling). Other 
quantities affecting Earth���s energy balance���clouds, aerosols, 
water vapor, snow cover and sea ice���change rapidly in response 
to climate change. Thus, Charney���s ECS is also called the ���fast- 
feedback��� climate sensitivity. Feedbacks interact in many ways, 
so their changes are calculated in global climate models (GCMs) 
that simulate such interactions. Charney implicitly assumed that 
change of the ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica���which we 
categorize as a ���slow feedback������was not important on time 
scales of most public interest. 
ECS defined by Charney is a gedanken concept that helps us 
study the effect of human-made and natural climate forcings. If 
knowledge of ECS were based only on models, it would be diffi- 
cult to narrow the range of estimated climate sensitivity���or 
have confidence in any range���because we do not know how well 
feedbacks are modeled or if the models include all significant 
real-world feedbacks. Cloud and aerosol interactions are com- 
plex, e.g. and even small cloud changes can have a large effect. 
Thus, data on Earth���s paleoclimate history are essential, allowing 
us to compare different climate states, knowing that all feed- 
backs operated.

by E.E. David and employed by electrical engineers [15]. The cli- 
mate forcing caused by 2 ��� CO2���the 
imposed perturbation of 
Earth���s energy balance���is ���4 W/m2. 
If there were no climate 
feedbacks and Earth radiated energy to space as a perfect black 
surface, Earth���s temperature would need to increase ���1.2���C 
to in- 
crease radiation to space 4 W/m2 and restore energy balance. 
However, feedbacks occur in the real world and in GCMs. In our 
GCM the equilibrium response to 2 ��� CO2 was 4���C warming of 
Earth���s surface. Thus, the fraction of equilibrium warming due 
directly to the CO2 change was 0.3 (1.2���C/4���C) and the feedback 
���gain���, g, was 0.7 (2.8���C/4���C). Algebraically, ECS and feedback gain 
are related by ECS �� 1:2���C=��1 ? g��(1) 
We evaluated contributions of individual feedback processes to g 
by inserting changes of water vapor, clouds, and surface albedo 
(reflectivity, literally whiteness, due to sea ice and snow changes) 
from the 2 ��� CO2 GCM simulation one-by-one into a one- 
dimensional radiative-convective model [16], finding gwv �� 0.4, 
gcl �� 0.2, gsa �� 0.1, where gwv, 
gcl, and gsa are the water vapor, 
cloud and surface albedo gains. The 0.2 cloud gain was about 
equally from a small increase in cloud top height and a small de- 
crease in cloud cover. These feedbacks all seemed reasonable, 
but how could we verify their magnitudes or the net ECS due to 
all feedbacks? 
We recognized the potential of emerging paleoclimate data. 
Early data from polar ice cores revealed that atmospheric CO2 
was much less during glacial periods and the CLIMAP project [17] 
used proxy data to reconstruct global surface conditions during 
the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which peaked about 20 000 
years ago. A powerful constraint was the fact that Earth had to 
be in energy balance averaged over the several millennia of the 
LGM. However, when we employed CLIMAP boundary conditions 
including sea surface temperatures (SSTs), Earth was out of en- 
ergy balance, radiating 2.1 W/m2 to space, i.e. Earth was trying to 
cool off with an enormous energy imbalance, equivalent to half 
of 2 ��� CO2 
forcing. 
Something was wrong with either assumed LGM conditions or 
our climate model. We tried CLIMAP���s maximal land ice���this 
only reduced the energy imbalance from 2.1 to 1.6 W/m2. 
Moreover, we had taken LGM CO2 as 200 ppm and did not know 
that CH4 and N2O were less in the LGM than in the present inter- 
glacial period; accurate GHGs and CLIMAP SSTs produce a plane- 
tary energy imbalance close to 3 W/m2. Most feedbacks in our 
model were set by CLIMAP. Sea ice is set by CLIMAP. Water vapor 
depends on surface temperature, which is set by CLIMAP SSTs. 
Cloud feedback is uncertain, but ECS smaller than 2.4���C for 2 ��� 
CO2 would require a negative cloud gain. gcl ��� 0.2 from our GCM 
increases ECS from 2.4���C to 4���C (Equation 1) and accounts for al- 
most the entire difference of sensitivities of our model (4���C for 2 
��� CO2) 
and the Manabe and Stouffer model [18] (2���C for 2 ��� CO2) 
that had fixed cloud cover and cloud height. Manabe suggested 
[19] that our higher ECS was due to a too-large sea ice and snow 
feedback, but we noted [7] that sea ice in our control run was less 
than observed, so we likely understated sea ice feedback. 
Amplifying feedback due to high clouds increasing in height with 
warming is expected and is found in observations, large-eddy 
simulations and GCMs [20] Sherwood et al. [21] conclude that 
negative low-cloud feedback is ���neither credibly suggested by any 
model, nor by physical principles, nor by observations.��� Despite a 
wide spread among models, GCMs today show an amplifying 
cloud feedback due to increases in cloud height and decreases in 
cloud amount, despite increases in cloud albedo [22]. These cloud 
changes are found in all observed cloud regimes and locations, 
implying robust thermodynamic control [23]. 
CLIMAP SSTs were a more likely cause of the planetary energy 
imbalance. Co-author D. Peteet used pollen data to infer LGM 
tropical and subtropical cooling 2���3���C greater than in a GCM 
forced by CLIMAP SSTs. D. Rind and Peteet found that montane 
LGM snowlines in the tropics descended 1 km in the LGM, incon- 
sistent with climate constrained by CLIMAP SSTs. CLIMAP as- 
sumed that tiny shelled marine species migrate to stay in a 
temperature zone they inhabit today. But what if, instead, these 
species partly adapt over millennia to changing temperature? 
Based on the work of Rind and Peteet, later published [24], we 
suspected but could not prove that CLIMAP SSTs were too warm. 
Based on GCM simulations for 2 ��� CO2, 
on our feedback analy- 
sis for the LGM, and on observed global warming in the past cen- 
tury, we concluded that ECS was in the range 2.5���5���C for 2 ��� CO2. 
If CLIMAP SSTs were accurate, ECS was near the low end of that 
range. In contrast, our analysis implied that ECS for 2 ��� CO2 was 
in the upper half of the 2.5���5���C range, but our analysis depended 
in part on our GCM, which had sensitivity 4���C for 2 ��� CO2. To re- 
solve the matter, a paleo thermometer independent of biologic 
adaptation was needed. Several decades later, such a paleo ther- 
mometer and advanced analysis techniques exist. We will use re- 
cent studies to infer our present best estimates for ECS and ESS. 
First, however, we will comment on other estimates of climate 
sensitivity and clarify the definition of climate forcings that 
we employ. 
IPCC and independent climate 
sensitivity estimates 
Reviews of climate sensitivity are available, e.g. Rohling et al. [25], 
which focuses on the physics of the climate system, and 
Sherwood et al. [26], which adds emphasis on probabilistic combi- 
nation of multiple uncertainties. Progress in narrowing the un- 
certainty in climate sensitivity was slow in the first five IPCC 
assessment reports. The fifth assessment report [26] (AR5) in 
2014 concluded only���with 66% probability���that ECS was in the 
range 1.5���4.5���C, the same as Charney���s report 35 years earlier. 
The broad spectrum of information on climate change���espe- 
cially constraints imposed by paleoclimate data���at last affected 
AR6 [12], which concluded with 66% probability that ECS is 2.5��� 
4���C, with 3���C as their best estimate (Supplementary Fig. TS.6). 
Sherwood et al. [21] combine three lines of evidence: climate 
feedback studies, historical climate change, and paleoclimate 
data, inferring S �� 2.6���3.9���C with 66% probability for 2 ��� CO2, 
where S is an ���effective sensitivity��� relevant to a 150-year time 
scale. They find ECS only slightly larger: 2.6���4.1���C with 66% prob- 
ability. Climate feedback studies, inherently, cannot yield a sharp 
definition of ECS, as we showed in the cloud feedback discussion 
above. Earth���s climate system includes amplifying feedbacks that 
push the gain, g, closer to unity than zero, thus making ECS sen- 
sitive to uncertainty in any feedback; the resulting sensitivity of 
ECS to g prohibits precise evaluation from feedback analysis. 
Similarly, historical climate change cannot define ECS well be- 
cause the aerosol climate forcing is unmeasured. Also, forced 
and unforced ocean dynamics give rise to a pattern effect: [27] 
the geographic pattern of transient and equilibrium temperature 
changes differ, which affects ECS inferred from transient climate 
change. These difficulties help explain how Sherwood et al. [21]

The excerpt you shared delves deep into the assessment and reevaluation of climate sensitivity, specifically Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) and Earth System Sensitivity (ESS). Here���s an analysis of the key points discussed in the excerpt:
Climate Sensitivity Estimates and Definitions
Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS):
Defined historically as the global temperature change expected from a doubling of CO2 concentrations, assuming quick-responding variables like clouds, water vapor, and sea ice adapt immediately, while slow variables like ice sheets and vegetation remain unchanged.
Earth System Sensitivity (ESS):
A broader measure that includes both fast feedbacks (like ECS) and slow feedbacks (like ice sheets and vegetation changes) over a longer timescale.
Historical Context and Reevaluation
Charney Report's ECS:
Initially suggested an ECS range largely based on model simulations which have limitations due to the complexities of climate feedbacks, especially involving clouds and aerosols.
Paleoclimate Data:
The use of paleoclimate data from ice cores and other proxies provides a real-world test of climate models, revealing that actual ECS might be higher due to underestimation of feedback mechanisms in models.
Methodological Insights
Feedback Mechanisms:
The section discusses the importance of understanding various feedbacks���water vapor, cloud cover, and surface albedo���and their combined effects on global temperature, which are intricate and often interconnected.
Cloud Feedbacks:
Particular emphasis is placed on cloud feedbacks, which are noted as particularly complex and variable, impacting the overall climate sensitivity significantly. The gain from cloud feedbacks is noted as a critical factor in understanding ECS.
Challenges and Advances
Modeling Challenges:
The limitations of early climate models, especially regarding their treatment of cloud dynamics and ice sheet responses, highlight the ongoing challenges in accurately predicting climate sensitivity.
New Tools and Data:
The development of better tools and more comprehensive paleoclimate datasets have allowed for more refined estimates of ECS and ESS, helping to narrow the range of likely climate sensitivity.
Implications for Policy and Future Research
Policy Relevance:
Understanding ECS and ESS is crucial for predicting the timing and magnitude of climate change, thereby informing effective climate policy and adaptation strategies.
Future Directions:
The excerpt suggests a need for further research into the components of climate sensitivity, particularly through the integration of new paleoclimatic data and advanced modeling techniques to improve the precision of climate predictions.
This thorough analysis of ECS and ESS underscores the complexity of climate systems and the critical role of diverse scientific approaches in improving our understanding of climate impacts. The historical and future context provided illustrates both the progress made and the challenges that remain in predicting and mitigating climate change.

Climate forcing definitions 
Attention to climate forcing definitions is essential for quantita- 
tive analysis of climate change. However, readers uninterested in 
radiative forcings may skip this section with little penalty. We de- 
scribe our climate forcing definition and compare our forcings 
with those of IPCC. Our total GHG forcing matches that of IPCC 
within a few percent, but this close fit hides larger differences in 
individual forcings that deserve attention. 
Equilibrium global surface temperature change is related to 
ECS by DTs��� F ��� ECS �� F ��� k;(2) 
where k is a widely used abbreviation of ECS, DTS is the global 
mean equilibrium surface temperature change in response to cli- 
mate forcing F, which is measured in W/m2 averaged over the en- 
tire planetary surface. There are alternative ways to def i ne F, as 
discussed in Chapter 8 [29] of AR5 and in a paper [30] hereafter 
called Eff i cacy. Objectives are to fi nd a def i nition of F such that 
different forcing mechanisms of the same magnitude yield a sim- 
ilar global temperature change, but also a def i nition that can be 
computed easily and reliably. The fi rst four IPCC reports used ad- 
justed forcing, Fa, which is Earth���s energy imbalance after strato- 
spheric temperature adjusts to presence of the forcing agent. Fa 
usually yields a consistent response among different forcing 
agents, but there are exceptions such as black carbon aerosols; Fa 
exaggerates their impact. Also, Fa is awkward to compute and 
depends on def i nition of the tropopause, which varies among 
models. Fs, the fi xed SST forcing (including fi xed sea ice), is more 
robust than Fa as a predictor of climate response [30, 31], but a 
GCM is required to compute Fs. In Eff i cacy, Fs is def i ned as 
Fs�� Fo�� 
dTo 
k ;(3) 
where Fo is Earth���s energy imbalance after atmosphere and land 
surface adjust to the presence of the forcing agent with SST fi xed. 
Fo is not a full measure of the strength of a forcing, because a 
portion (dTo) of the equilibrium warming is already present as Fo 
is computed. A GCM run of about 100 years is needed to accu- 
rately def i ne Fo because of unforced atmospheric variability. 
That GCM run also def i nes dTo, the global mean surface air tem- 
perature change caused by the forcing with SST fi xed. k is the 
model���s ECS in ���C per W/m2. dTo/k is the portion of the total forc- 
ing (Fs) that is ���used up��� in causing the dTo warming; radiative 
fl ux to space increases by dTo/k due to warming of the land sur- 
face and global air. The term dTo/k is usually, but not always, less 
than 10% of Fo. Thus, it is better not to neglect dTo/k. IPCC AR5 
and AR6 def i ne effective radiative forcing as ERF �� Fo. 
Omission 
of dTo/k was intentional [29] and is not an issue if the practice is 
followed consistently. However, when the forcing is used to cal- 
culate global surface temperature response, the forcing to use is 
Fs, not Fo. It would be useful if both Fo and dTo were reported for 
all climate models. 
A further refinement of climate forcing is suggested in Efficacy: 
effective forcing (Fe) defined by a long GCM run with calculated 
ocean temperature. The resulting global surface temperature 
change, relative to that for equal CO2 forcing, defines the forc- 
ing���s efficacy. Effective forcings, Fe, were found to be within a few 
percent of Fs for most forcing agents, i.e. the results confirm that 
Fs is a robust forcing. This support is for Fs, not for Fo �� ERF, 
which is systematically smaller than Fs. The Goddard Institute 
for Space Studies (GISS) GCM [32, 33] used for CMIP6 [34] studies, 
which we label the GISS (2020) model,3 has higher resolution 
(2������ 2.5���and 40 atmospheric layers) and other changes that 
yield a moister upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, rela- 
tive to the GISS model used in Efficacy. GHG forcings reported for 
the GISS (2020) model [32, 33] are smaller than in prior GISS mod- 
els, a change attributed [33] to blanketing by high level water va- 
por. However, part of the change is from comparison of Fo in GISS 
(2020) to FS in earlier models. The 2 ��� CO2 
fixed SST simulation 
with the GISS (2020) model yields Fo �� 3.59 W/m2, dTo �� 0.27���C 
and k �� 0.9���C 
per W/m2. Thus FS �� 3.59 �� 0.30 �� 3.89 W/m2, 
which is only 5.4% smaller than the FS �� 4.11 W/m2 for the GISS 
model used in Efficacy. 
Our GHG effective forcing, Fe, was obtained in two steps. 
Adjusted forcings, Fa, were calculated for each gas for a large 
range of gas amount with a global-mean radiative-convective 
model that incorporated the GISS GCM radiation code, which 
uses the correlated k-distribution method [35] and high spectral 
resolution laboratory data [36]. The Fa are converted to effective 
forcings (Fe) via efficacy factors (Ea; Table 1 of Efficacy) based on 
GCM simulations that include the 3-D distribution of each gas. 
The total GHG forcing is 
Fe�� FaCO2���� �� 1:45FaCH4���� �� 1:04FaN2O���� 
�� 1:32FaMPTGs��OTGs���� �� 0:45Fa��O3��(4) 
The CH4 coefficient (1.45) includes the effect of CH4 on O3 and 
stratospheric H2O, as well as the efficacy (1.10) of CH4 per se. We 
assume that CH4 is responsible for 45% of the O3 change [37]. 
Forcing caused by the remaining 55% of the O3 change is based 
on IPCC AR6 O3 forcing (Fa �� 0.47 W/m2 in 2019); we multiply this

ing should be larger, because IPCC forcings are Fo for all gases ex- 
cept O3, for which they provide Fa (AR6 section 7.3.2.5). Table 1 in

Efficacy allows accurate comparison: dTo for 2 ��� CO2 
for the GISS 
model used in Efficacy is 0.22���C, k is 0.67���C per W/m2, so dTo/k �� 
0.33 W/m2. Thus, the conversion factor from Fo to Fe (or Fs) is 
4.11/(4.11���0.33). The non-O3 portion of AR6 2019 forcing 
(3.84���0.47 �� 3.37) W/m2 
increases to 3.664 W/m2. The O3 portion 
of the AR6 2019 forcing (0.47 W/m2) decreases to 0.385 W/m2 be- 
cause the efficacy of Fa(O3) is 0.82. The AR6 GHG forcing in 2019 
is thus ���4.05 W/m2, expressed as Fe ��� Fs, which is ���1% larger 
than follows from our formulae. This precise agreement is not in- 
dicative of the true uncertainty in the GHG forcing, which IPCC 
AR6 estimates as 10%, thus about 0.4 W/m2. We concur with 
their error estimate and employ it in our ECS uncertainty analy- 
sis (Equilibrium climate sensitivity section). 
We conclude that the GHG increase since 1750 already produ- 
ces a climate forcing equivalent to that of 2 ��� CO2 (our formulae 
yield Fe ��� Fs �� 4.08 W/m2 
for 2021 and 4.13 W/m2 for 2022; IPCC 
AR6 has Fs �� 4.14 W/m2 for 2021). The human-made 2 ��� CO2 
cli- 
mate forcing imagined by Charney, Tyndall and other green- 
house giants is no longer imaginary. Humanity is now taking its 
first steps into the period of consequences. Earth���s paleoclimate 
history helps us assess the potential outcomes. 
Glacial-to-interglacial climate oscillations 
In this section we describe how ice core data help us assess ECS 
for climate states from glacial conditions to interglacial periods 
such as the Holocene, the interglacial period of the past 12 000 
years. We discuss climate sensitivity in warmer climates in 
Cenozoic era section. 
Air bubbles in Antarctic ice cores���trapped as snow piled up 
and compressed into ice���preserve a record of long-lived GHGs 
for at least 800 000 years. Isotopic composition of the ice provides 
a measure of temperature in and near Antarctica [40]. Changes 
of temperature and CO2 are highly correlated (Fig. 2). This does 
not mean that CO2 is the primal cause of the climate oscillations. 
Hays et al. [42] showed that small changes of Earth���s orbit and the 
tilt of Earth���s spin axis are pacemakers of the ice ages. Orbital 
changes alter the seasonal and geographical distribution of inso- 
lation, which affects ice sheet size and GHG amount. Long-term 
climate is sensitive because ice sheets and GHGs act as amplify- 
ing feedbacks: [43] as Earth warms, ice sheets shrink, expose a 
darker surface, and absorb more sunlight; also, as Earth warms, 
the ocean and continents release GHGs to the air. These amplify- 
ing feedbacks work in the opposite sense as Earth cools. Orbital 
forcings oscillate slowly over tens and hundreds of thousands of 
years [44]. The picture of how Earth orbital changes drive millen- 
nial climate change was painted in the 1920s by Milutin 
Milankovitch, who built on 19th century hypotheses of James 
Croll and Joseph Adh��� emar. Paleoclimate changes of ice sheets 
and GHGs are sometimes described as slow feedbacks [45], but 
their slow change is paced by the Earth orbital forcing; their slow 
change does not mean that these feedbacks cannot operate more 
rapidly in response to a rapid climate forcing. 
We evaluate ECS by comparing stable climate states before 
and after a glacial-to-interglacial climate transition. GHG 
amounts are known from ice cores and ice sheet sizes are known 
from geologic data. This empirical ECS applies to the range of 
global temperature covered by ice cores, which we will conclude 
is about ���7���C to �� 1���C 
relative to the Holocene. The Holocene is 
an unusual interglacial. Maximum melt rate was at 13.2 kyBP, as 
expected [45] and GHG amounts began to decline after peaking 
early in the Holocene, as in most interglacials. However, several 
ky later, CO2 and CH4 increased, raising a question of whether 
humans were affecting GHGs. Ruddiman [46] suggests that defor- 
estation began to affect CO2 6500 years ago and rice irrigation be- 
gan to affect CH4 5000 years ago. Those possibilities complicate 
use of LGM-Holocene warming to estimate ECS. However, sea 
level, and thus the size of the ice sheets, had stabilized

The section you shared provides a detailed exploration of climate forcing definitions and their importance in quantitative climate analysis, comparing various definitions and their implementation in climate models and IPCC reports. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and definitions discussed:
Key Concepts of Climate Forcing Definitions
Climate Forcing (F):
This term refers to any influence affecting Earth's energy balance, leading to changes in the climate system. It's usually quantified in watts per square meter (W/m^2).
Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS):
Describes the equilibrium change in global surface temperature resulting from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, considering fast feedbacks like water vapor, clouds, and sea ice but not slow feedbacks like ice sheets and vegetation.
Adjusted Forcing (F_a):
Calculated by accounting for the adjustments in stratospheric temperatures to the presence of forcing agents. This method often provides consistent responses among different forcing agents but can overestimate impacts, such as those from black carbon.
Fixed SST Forcing (F_s):
More robust than F_a, F_s includes the effects of fixed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and sea ice. It's used to predict climate responses more reliably but requires complex general circulation model (GCM) computations.
Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF):
The current preferred method, ERF is the change in net (down minus up) radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere after allowing for stratospheric temperatures to adjust but excluding changes in surface temperature and feedbacks from other fast processes.
Effective Forcing (F_e):
Based on long GCM runs with calculated ocean temperatures, this definition is intended to reflect the actual efficacy of different forcing agents compared to CO2, based on the resultant global temperature changes.
Methodological Insights
The paper elaborates on the complex calculations involved in deriving these forcing terms, emphasizing the discrepancies between different models and approaches. For instance, the GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies) models are discussed in the context of their evolution and the implications of changes in high-level water vapor and other factors.
The significance of accurate forcing definitions is highlighted by the need for precise climate modeling and prediction, which directly impacts policy-making and climate action strategies.
Challenges and Refinements
Variability and Comparability:
One challenge mentioned is the difficulty of comparing different climate forcing agents due to variations in their physical impacts on the climate system. The paper argues for the utility of both F_s and F_e in providing a more complete picture of forcing impacts.
Historical Data and Adjustments:
The use of historical and paleoclimate data is critical in refining these definitions, as it provides empirical checks against model predictions and helps refine estimates of climate sensitivity and forcing.
Implications for Climate Research and Policy
Modeling Improvements:
Advances in climate modeling, as reflected in successive IPCC reports and studies like the one discussed, improve our understanding of how different forcings impact Earth���s climate system.
Policy Guidance:
Accurate definitions and understanding of climate forcings are crucial for developing effective climate policies and strategies, as they influence the projected impacts of different greenhouse gases and other climate influencers.
Overall, this section underscores the complexity and critical nature of defining and understanding climate forcings in the context of global climate modeling and policy-making. It highlights ongoing efforts to refine these definitions to better predict and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Knowledge of climate sensitivity can be advanced further via 
analysis of the wide climate range in the Cenozoic era (Earth sys- 
tem sensitivity section). However, interpretation of data and 
models, and especially projections of climate change, depend on 
understanding of climate response time. 
Climate response time 
We expected climate response time���the time for climate to ap- 
proach a new equilibrium after imposition of a forcing���to be- 
come faster as mixing of heat in ocean models improved [75]. 
That expectation was not met when we compared two genera- 
tions of the GISS GCM (global climate model). The GISS (2020) 
GCM is improved [32, 33] in its ocean simulation over the GISS 
(2014) GCM as a result of higher vertical and horizontal resolu- 
tion, more realistic parameterization of sub-grid scale motions, 
and correction of errors in the ocean computer program [32]. Yet 
the time for the model to achieve 63% of its equilibrium response 
remained about 100 years. There are two reasons for this: one 
that is obvious and one that is more interesting and informative. 
The surface in the newer model warms as fast as in the older 
model, but it must achieve greater warming to reach 63% of equi- 
librium because its ECS is higher, which is one reason that the re- 
sponse time remains long. The other reason is that Earth���s 
energy imbalance (EEI) in the newer model decreases rapidly. EEI 
defines the rate that heat is pumped into the ocean, so a smaller 
EEI implies a longer time for the ocean to reach its new equilib- 
rium temperature. Quick drop of EEI���in the first year after intro- 
duction of the forcing���implies existence of ultrafast feedback in 
the GISS (2020) model. For want of an alternative with such a 
large effect on Earth���s energy budget, we infer a rapid cloud feed- 
back and we suggest (Slow, fast and ultrafast feedbacks section) 
a set of brief GCM runs that define cloud changes and other diag- 
nostic quantities to an arbitrary accuracy. 
The Charney report [4] recognized that clouds were a main 
cause of a wide range in ECS estimates. Today, clouds still cast 
uncertainty on climate predictions. Several CMIP6 [34] GCMs 
have ECS of ���4���6���C for 2���CO2 [171, 172] with the high sensitivity 
caused by cloud feedbacks [84]. As cloud modeling progresses, it 
will aid understanding if climate models report their 2 ��� CO2 re- 
sponse functions for both temperature and EEI (Earth���s en- 
ergy imbalance). 
Fast EEI response���faster than global temperature response��� 
has a practical effect: observed EEI understates the reduction of 
climate forcing required to stabilize climate. Although the mag- 
nitude of this effect is uncertain (see Supplementary Material 
SM6), it makes the task of restoring a hospitable climate and sav- 
ing coastal cities more challenging. On the other hand, long cli- 
mate response time implies the potential for educated policies to 
affect the climate outcome before the most undesirable conse- 
quences occur. 
The time required for climate to reach a new equilibrium is 
relevant to policy (Perspective on policy implications section), 
but there is another response time of practical importance. With 
climate in a state of disequilibrium, how much time do we have 
before we pass the point of no return, the point where major cli- 
mate impacts are locked in, beyond our ability to control? That���s 
a complex matter; it requires understanding of ���slow��� feedbacks, 
especially ice sheets. It also depends on how far climate is out of 
equilibrium. Thus, we first consider the full Earth system 
sensitivity. 
Earth system sensitivity (ESS) 
The Cenozoic era���the past 66 million years���provides an oppor- 
tunity to study Earth system sensitivity via a consistent analysis 
for climate ranging from hothouse conditions with Earth 15���C 
warmer and sea level 60 m higher than preindustrial climate to 
glacial conditions with Earth 7���C cooler and sea level 120 m lower 
than preindustrial. Atmospheric CO2 amount in the past 800 000 
years (Fig. 2), confirms expectation that CO2 is the main control 
knob [87] on global temperature. We can assume this control 
existed when CO2 amount varied due to CO2 emissions caused by 
plate tectonics (continental drift). The two-step [91] that the 
Indian plate executed as it moved through the Tethys (now 
Indian) ocean left a signature in atmospheric CO2 and global tem- 
perature. CO2 emissions from subduction of ocean crust were 
greatest when the Indian plate was moving fastest (inset, Fig. 6) 
and peaked at its hard collision with the Eurasian plate at 50 
MyBP. Diminishing metamorphic CO2 emissions continue as the 
Indian plate is subducted beneath the Eurasian plate, pushing up 
the Himalayan Mountains, but carbon drawdown from

weathering and burial of organic carbon exceeds emissions. 
Motion of the Indian Plate thus dominates the broad sweep of 
Cenozoic CO2, but igneous provinces play a role. The North 
Atlantic Igneous Province (caused by a rift in the sea floor as 
Greenland pulled away from Europe) that triggered the 
Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) event about 56 
MyBP and the Columbia River Flood Basalt about 15 MyBP (Fig. 6) 
are most notable. 
We infer the Cenozoic history of sea surface temperature 
(SST) at sites of deepwater formation from the oxygen isotope 
d18O in shells of deep-ocean-dwelling foraminifera preserved in 
ocean sediments [44, 90]. High latitude SST change���including a 
correction term as SST approaches the freezing point���provides 
an accurate estimate of global surface temperature change. This 
Cenozoic temperature history and climate sensitivity inferred 
from the LGM cooling yield an estimate of Cenozoic CO2 history. 
We suggest that this whole-Cenozoic approach may define the 
CO2 history (Fig. 9a) more accurately than CO2 proxy measure- 
ments. We find CO2 about 325 ppm in the early Pliocene and 450 
ppm at transition to glaciated Antarctica. Global climate models 
(GCMs) that isolate on the Pliocene tend to use CO2 levels of order 
400 ppm in attempts to match actual Pliocene warmth and ice 
sheet models use CO2 of order 700 ppm or greater to achieve ice 
sheet disintegration on Antarctica, which suggests that the mod- 
els are not realistically capturing amplifying feedback processes 
(see Cenozoic CO2 section). 
The Cenozoic provides a perspective on present greenhouse 
gas (GHG) levels. The dashed line in Fig. 23 is the ���we are here��� 
level of GHG climate forcing. Today���s GHG forcing of 4.6 W/m2 is 
relative to mid-Holocene CO2 of 260 ppm; we present evidence in 
Cenozoic CO2 section that 260 ppm is the natural Holocene CO2 
level. Human-caused GHG forcing today is already above the 
level needed to deglaciate Antarctica, if such forcing is left in 
place long enough. We do not predict full deglaciation of 
Antarctica on a time scale people care about���rather we draw at- 
tention to how far today���s climate is out of equilibrium with 
today���s GHG level. This is one measure of how strongly humanity 
is pushing the climate system. Stabilizing climate requires re- 
moving the disequilibrium by reducing human-made climate 
forcing. A danger is that it will become difficult or implausible to 
prevent large sea level rise, if deglaciation is allowed to get 
well underway. 
GHGs are not the only large human-made climate forcing. 
Understanding of ongoing climate change requires that we also 
include the effect of aerosols (fine airborne particles). 
Aerosols 
Aerosol climate forcing is larger than the IPCC AR6 estimate and 
has likely been significant for millennia. We know of no other 
persuasive explanation for absence of global warming in the last 
half of the Holocene (Fig. 14) as GHG forcing increased 0.5 W/m2 
(Fig. 15). Climate models without a growing negative aerosol forc- 
ing yield notable warming in that period [173], a warming that, in 
fact, did not occur. Negative aerosol forcing, increasing as civili- 
zation developed and population grew, is expected. As humans 
burned fuels at a growing rate���wood and other biomass for mil- 
lennia and fossil fuels in the industrial era���aerosols as well as 
GHGs were an abundant, growing, biproduct. The aerosol source 
from wood-burning has continued in modern times [146]. GHGs 
are long-lived and accumulate, so their forcing dominates even- 
tually, unless aerosol emissions grow higher and higher���the 
Faustian bargain [98]. 
Multiple lines of evidence show that aerosol forcing peaked 
early this century [174]. Emissions from the largest sources, 
China and India, were increasing in 2000, but by 2010 when the 
first limits on ship emissions were imposed, China���s emissions 
were declining. We estimate peak (negative) aerosol forcing as at 
least 1.5���2 W/m2, with turning point at 2010, consistent with 
Fig. 3 of Bauer et al. [175] GHG plus aerosol forcing grew ��0.3 W/ 
m2 per decade (GHGs: ��0.45, aerosols: ���0.15) during 1970���2010, 
which produced warming of 0.18���C per decade. With current pol- 
icies, we expect climate forcing for a few decades post-2010 to in- 
crease 0.5���06 W/m2 per decade and produce global warming of at 
least ��0.27���C per decade. In that case, global warming will reach 
1.5���C in the 2020s and 2���C before 2050 (Fig. 24). Such acceleration 
is dangerous in a climate system that is already far out of equilib- 
rium and dominated by multiple amplifying feedbacks. 
The sharp change of ship emissions in 2020 (The great inad- 
vertent aerosol experiment section) provides an indirect measure 
of aerosol effects. Diamond [176] finds a cloud brightness de- 
crease of order 1 W/m2 in a shipping corridor. We find a larger ef- 
fect, increased absorption of about 3 W/m2 in regions of heavy 
ship traffic in the North Atlantic and North Pacific (Fig. 22), but a 
longer record is needed to define significance. However, the sin- 
gle best sentinel for global climate change is Earth���s en- 
ergy imbalance. 
Earth���s energy imbalance 
Earth���s energy imbalance (EEI) is the net gain (or loss) of energy 
by the planet, the difference between absorbed solar energy and 
emitted thermal (heat) radiation. As long as EEI is positive, Earth 
will continue to get hotter. EEI is hard to measure, a small differ- 
ence between two large quantities (Earth absorbs and emits

The sections you've shared from the paper delve into several critical areas of climate science: Earth's climate response time, Earth System Sensitivity (ESS) through the Cenozoic era, and the impact of aerosols on climate forcing. Here's an analysis of these topics and their implications:
Climate Response Time
Definition
: Climate response time refers to how quickly the climate system approaches a new equilibrium after a change in forcing.
Modeling Insights
: Despite improvements in climate models, such as the GISS (2020) model, the response time to achieve 63% of equilibrium response remains about 100 years. This is partly due to higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) in newer models, which requires greater warming to reach equilibrium, and the rapid decrease in Earth's Energy Imbalance (EEI), which slows the warming process.
Earth System Sensitivity (ESS)
Cenozoic Era as a Study Period
: The Cenozoic era, spanning the last 66 million years, is used to study ESS by analyzing climates ranging from much warmer to much cooler than today's climate.
CO2 as a Control Knob
: Historical CO2 levels, influenced by geological events such as the movements of the Indian plate and volcanic activity, have been a major driver of global temperature changes throughout the Cenozoic.
Implications
: Understanding ESS in this context helps clarify the potential impacts of current and future CO2 levels, particularly concerning large-scale ice sheet responses and sea level changes.
Aerosols and Climate Forcing
Role of Aerosols
: Aerosols have a significant cooling effect, which can mask some of the warming effects of greenhouse gases. The historical and ongoing contributions of aerosols from human activities (like burning biomass and fossil fuels) have likely been significant for millennia.
Recent Changes
: The paper discusses recent reductions in aerosol emissions, particularly from shipping, and their potential effects on climate forcing. These reductions could lead to a decrease in the aerosol cooling effect, revealing more of the warming impact from greenhouse gases.
Policy Implications
Urgency and Response
: The long response time of the climate system provides a window for policy actions to prevent the worst outcomes of climate change. However, the complexity and scale of feedbacks involved require nuanced and aggressive policy measures.
Point of No Return
: There's a critical need to understand when irreversible climate impacts might lock in, necessitating immediate and sustained action to manage both CO2 and aerosols effectively.
Key Takeaways
Modeling Improvements
: Continued improvements in climate models are crucial for better predictions and more effective climate strategies.
Feedback Mechanisms
: Understanding both fast and slow feedback mechanisms is essential for predicting how quickly and severely the climate will respond to different forcings.
Historical Context
: Insights from past climate conditions, such as those provided by ice core data and geological records, are invaluable in predicting future climate scenarios and informing policy decisions.
This comprehensive look at various aspects of climate science underscores the complexity of Earth's climate system and the critical need for integrated approaches to managing human impacts on global temperatures and sea levels.

Equilibrium warming versus committed warming 
Equilibrium warming for today���s climate forcing is the warming re- 
quired to restore Earth���s energy balance if atmospheric composi- 
tion is fixed at today���s conditions. Equilibrium warming is a 
benchmark that can be evaluated from atmospheric composition 
and paleoclimate data, with little involvement of climate models. 
It is the standard benchmark used in definition of the Charney ECS 
(equilibrium climate sensitivity excluding slow feedbacks) [4] and 
ESS (Earth system sensitivity, which includes slow feedbacks such 
as ice sheet size) [71]. GHG climate forcing now is 4.6 W/m2 relative 
to the mid-Holocene (7 kyBP) or 4.1 W/m2 relative to 1750. There is 
little merit in debating whether GHG forcing is 4.6 or 4.1 W/m2 be- 
cause it is still increasing 0.5 W/m2 per decade (Perspective on pol- 
icy implications section). ECS response to 4.6 W/m2 forcing for 
climate sensitivity 1.2���C per W/m2 is 5.5���C. The eventual Earth sys- 
tem response (ESS) to sustained 4.6 W/m2 forcing is about 10���C 
(Earth system sensitivity section), because that forcing is large 
enough to deglaciate Antarctica (Fig. 23). Net human-made forcing 
today is probably near 3 W/m2 due to negative aerosol forcing. 
Even 3 W/m2 may be sufficient to largely deglaciate Antarctica, if 
the forcing is left in place permanently (Fig. 23). 
���Committed warming��� is less precisely defined; even in the 
current IPCC report [12] (p. 2222) it has multiple definitions. One 
concept is the warming that occurs if human-made GHG emis- 
sions cease today, but that definition is ill-posed as well as unre- 
alistic. Do aerosol emissions also cease? That would cause a 
sudden leap in Earth���s energy imbalance, a ���termination shock,��� 
as the cooling effect of human-made aerosols disappears. A more 
useful definition is the warming that will occur with plausibly 
rapid phasedown of GHG emissions, including comparison with 
ongoing reality. However, the required ���integrated assessment 
models,��� while useful, are complex and contain questionable 
assumptions that can mislead policy (see Perspective on policy 
implications section). 
Nature���s capacity for restoration provides hope that future 
warming can be limited, if humanity moves promptly toward 
sustainable energy and climate policies. Earth���s ability to remove 
human-made CO2 emissions from the atmosphere is revealed by 
Fig. 26. Fossil fuel emissions now total more than 10 GtC/year, 
which is almost 5 ppm of CO2, yet CO2 in the air is only increasing 
2.5 ppm/year. The other half is being taken up by the ocean, solid 
land, and biosphere. Indeed, Earth is taking up even more be- 
cause deforestation, fires, and poor agricultural and forestry 
practices are additional human-made CO2 sources. If human 
emissions ceased, atmospheric CO2 would initially decline a few

ppm per year, but uptake would soon slow���it would take millen- 
nia for CO2 to reach preindustrial levels [131]. This underscores 
the difficulty of restoring Earth���s energy balance via emission 
reductions alone. Furthermore, fossil fuels have raised living 
standards in most of the world and still provide 80% of the 
world���s energy, which contributes to a policy inertia. As the real- 
ity of climate change emerges, the delayed response of climate 
and amplifying feedbacks assure that the world has already set 
sail onto even more turbulent climate seas. Scientists must do 
their best to help the public understand policy options that may 
preserve and restore a propitious climate for future generations. 
Perspective on policy implications 
This section is the first author���s perspective based on more than 
20 years of experience on policy issues that began with a paper 
[179] and two workshops [180] that he organized at the East-West 
Center in Hawaii, followed by meetings and workshops with util- 
ity experts and trips to more than a dozen nations for discussions 
with government officials, energy experts, and environmental- 
ists. The aim was to find a realistic scenario with a bright energy 
and climate future, with emphasis on cooperation between the 
West and nations with emerging or underdeveloped economies. 
Energy, CO2 and the climate threat 
The world���s energy and climate path has good reason: fossil fuels 
powered the industrial revolution and raised living standards. 
Fossil fuels still provide most of the world���s energy (Fig. 27a) and 
produce most CO2 emissions (Fig. 27b). Much of the world is still 
in early or middle stages of economic development. Energy is 
needed and fossil fuels are a convenient, affordable source of en- 
ergy. One gallon (3.8 l) of gasoline (petrol) provides the work 
equivalent of more than 400 h labor by a healthy adult. These 
benefits are the basic reason for continued high emissions. The 
Covid pandemic dented emissions in 2020, but 2022 global emis- 
sions were a record high level. Fossil fuel emissions from mature 
economies are beginning to fall due to increasing energy effi- 
ciency, introduction of carbon-free energies, and export of 
manufacturing from mature economies to emerging economies. 
However, at least so far, those reductions have been more than 
offset by increasing emissions in developing nations (Fig. 28). 
The potential for rising CO2 to be a serious threat to humanity 
was the reason for the 1979 Charney report, which confirmed 
that climate was likely sensitive to expected CO2 levels in the 
21st century. In the 1980s it emerged that high climate sensitivity 
implied a long delay between changing atmospheric composition 
and the full climate response. Ice core data revealed the impor- 
tance of amplifying climate feedbacks. A climate characterized 
by delayed response and amplifying feedbacks is especially dan- 
gerous because the public and policymakers are unlikely to

The concepts of "equilibrium warming," "committed warming," and their implications for climate policy are central to understanding how current and future climate actions might shape our environment.
Equilibrium Warming
Definition
: Equilibrium warming refers to the temperature increase needed to restore Earth's energy balance if atmospheric composition is fixed at today's levels. It represents the long-term temperature response expected from current levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other forcings without further increases.
Current Forcing
: Presently, the greenhouse gas climate forcing is estimated at about 4.6 W/m^2 relative to the mid-Holocene or 4.1 W/m^2 relative to the year 1750, highlighting a significant increase in forcing due to human activities.
Implications for Temperature
: Using a climate sensitivity of 1.2��C per W/m^2, a forcing of 4.6 W/m^2 suggests an equilibrium warming of approximately 5.5��C. The Earth System Sensitivity (ESS), which includes slower feedbacks like ice sheets, suggests even higher potential warming (around 10��C) which could lead to significant ice melt, including the deglaciation of Antarctica.
Committed Warming
Definition
: Committed warming refers to the future warming that would occur even if all human-made GHG emissions were to cease immediately. This concept considers the inertia in the climate system and the delayed response due to slow feedback mechanisms.
Complexity in Definition
: The term "committed warming" can be ambiguous as it involves different scenarios, such as whether aerosol emissions also cease, which would result in a termination shock from the sudden loss of their cooling effect.
Practical Definition
: A more practical approach considers the warming that will occur under a rapid phase-down of GHG emissions, taking into account both emissions trajectories and natural feedback processes.
Policy Implications
Restoring Balance
: The significant challenge of restoring Earth's energy balance highlights the importance of both reducing emissions and enhancing natural carbon sinks. Despite high levels of CO2 uptake by oceans, land, and the biosphere, atmospheric CO2 levels continue to rise, albeit at a slower rate than emissions alone would suggest.
Energy and Emissions
: Fossil fuels continue to dominate global energy supply due to their high energy density and economic benefits. This dependency complicates efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, especially as developing economies continue to grow and increase their fossil fuel use.
Perspective on Global Action
The discussions and workshops led by experts in various international settings underline the need for realistic and cooperative energy and climate strategies. These strategies must balance the immediate energy needs of growing economies with the urgent need to reduce GHG emissions to mitigate climate change.
In conclusion, the paper articulates the urgent need for a comprehensive approach to climate policy that addresses both the immediate and long-term impacts of climate change. This includes a focus on rapid emission reductions, enhancing carbon sinks, and fostering international cooperation to ensure equitable and effective responses to the global climate challenge.

Greenhouse gas emissions situation 
The United Nations uses a target for maximum global warming 
to cajole progress in limiting climate change. The 2015 Paris 
Agreement [201] aimed to hold ���the increase in the global average 
temperature to well below 2���C above the pre-industrial levels 
and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5���C 
above the pre-industrial levels.��� The IPCC AR5 report added a cli- 
mate forcing scenario, RCP2.6, with a rapid decrease of GHG cli- 
mate forcings, as needed to prevent global warming from 
exceeding 2���C. Since then, a gap between that scenario and real- 
ity opened and is growing (Fig. 31). The 0.03 W/m2 gap in 2022 
could be closed by extracting CO2 from the air. However, required 
negative emissions (CO2 extracted from the air and stored per- 
manently) must be larger than the desired atmospheric CO2 re- 
duction by a factor of about 1.7 [63]. Thus, the required CO2 
extraction is 2.1 ppm, which is 7.6 GtC. Based on a pilot direct-air 
carbon capture plant, Keith [202] estimates an extraction cost of 
$450���920 per tC, as clarified elsewhere [203]. Keith���s cost range 
yields an extraction cost of $3.4���7.0 trillion. That covers excess 
emissions in 2022 only; it is an annual cost. Given the difficulty 
the UN faced in raising $0.1 trillion for climate purposes and the 
growing emissions gap (Fig. 31), this example shows the need to 
reduce emissions as rapidly as practical and shows that carbon 
capture cannot be viewed as the solution, although it may play a 
role in a portfolio of policies, if its cost is driven down. 
IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), the sci- 
entific body advising the world on climate, has not bluntly in- 
formed the world that the present precatory policy approach 
will not keep warming below 1.5���C or even 2���C. The ���tragedy of 
the commons��� [204] is that, as long as fossil fuel pollution can 
be dumped in the air free of charge, agreements such as the 
Kyoto Protocol [205] and Paris Agreement have limited effect on 
global emissions. Political leaders profess ambitions for dubious 
net-zero emissions while fossil fuel extraction expands. IPCC 
scenarios that phase down human-made climate change 
amount to ���a miracle will occur���. The IPCC scenario that moves 
rapidly to negative global emissions (RCP2.6) has vast biomass- 
burning powerplants that capture and sequester CO2, a nature- 
ravaging, food-security-threatening [206], proposition without 
scientific and engineering credibility and without a realistic 
chance of being deployed at scale and on time to address the cli- 
mate threat.

Climate and energy policy 
Climate science reveals the threat of being too late. ���Being too 
late��� refers not only to warning of the climate threat, but also to 
technical advice on policy implications. Are we scientists not 
complicit if we allow reticence and comfort to obfuscate our de- 
scription of the climate situation? Does our training, years of 
graduate study and decades of experience, not make us well- 
equipped to advise the public on the climate situation and its pol- 
icy implications? As professionals with deep understanding of 
planetary change and as guardians of young people and their fu- 
ture, do we not have an obligation, analogous to the code of 
ethics of medical professionals, to render to the public our full 
and unencumbered diagnosis? That is our objective. 
The basis for the following opinions of the first author, to the 
extent not covered in this paper, will be described in a book in 
preparation [2]. We are in the early phase of a climate emer- 
gency. The present huge planetary energy imbalance assures 
that climate will become less tolerable to humanity, with greater 
climate extremes, before it is feasible to reverse the trend. 
Reversing the trend is essential���we must cool the planet���for 
the sake of preserving shorelines and saving the world���s coastal 
cities. Cooling will also address other major problems caused by 
global warming. We should aim to return to a climate like that in 
which civilization developed, in which the nature that we know 
and love thrived. As far as is known, it is still feasible to do that 
without passing through irreversible disasters such as many- 
meter sea level rise. 
Abundant, affordable, carbon-free energy is essential to 
achieve a world with propitious climate, while recognizing the 
rights and aspirations of all people. The staggering magnitude of 
the task is implied by global and national carbon intensities: car- 
bon emissions per unit energy use (Fig. 32). Global carbon inten- 
sity must decline to near zero over the next several decades. This 
chart���not vaporous promises of net zero future carbon emis- 
sions inserted in integrated assessment models���should guide 
realistic assessment of progress toward clean energy. Policy must 
include apolitical targeting of support for development of low- 
cost carbon-free energy. All nations would do well to study stra- 
tegic decisions of Sweden, which led past decarbonization efforts 
(Fig. 32) and is likely to lead in the quest for zero or negative car- 
bon intensity that will be needed to achieve a bright future for 
today���s young people and future generations. 
Given the global situation that we have allowed to develop, 
three actions are now essential. 
First, underlying economic incentives must be installed glob- 
ally to promote clean energy and discourage CO2 emissions. 
Thus, a rising price on GHG emissions is needed, enforced by bor- 
der duties on products from nations without a carbon fee. Public 
buy-in and maximum efficacy require the funds to be distributed 
to the public, which will also address wealth disparity. 
Economists in the U.S. support carbon fee-and-dividend [207]; 
college and high school students join in advocacy [208]. A rising 
carbon price creates a level playing field for energy efficiency, re- 
newable energy, nuclear power, and innovations; it would spur 
the thousands of ���miracles��� needed for energy transition. 
However, instead, fossil fuels and renewable energy are now sub- 
sidized. Thus, nuclear energy has been disadvantaged and ex- 
cluded as a ���clean development mechanism��� under the Kyoto 
Protocol, based on myths about nuclear energy unsupported by 
scientific fact [209]. A rising carbon price is crucial for decarbon- 
ization, but not enough. Long-term planning is needed. Sweden 
provides an example: 50 years ago, its government decided to re- 
place fossil fuel power stations with nuclear energy, which led to 
its extraordinary and rapid decarbonization (Fig. 32). 
Second, global cooperation is needed. De facto cooperation be- 
tween the West and China drove down the price of renewable en- 
ergy. Without greater cooperation, developing nations will be the 
main source of future GHG emissions (Fig. 28). Carbon-free, dis- 
patchable electricity is a crucial need. Nations with emerging 
economies are eager to have modern nuclear power because of 
its small environmental footprint. China-U.S. cooperation to de- 
velop low-cost nuclear power was proposed, but stymied by U.S. 
prohibition of technology transfer [210]. Competition is normal, 
but it can be managed if there is a will, reaping benefits of coop- 
eration over confrontation [211]. Of late, priority has been given 
instead to economic and military hegemony, despite recognition 
of the climate threat, and without consultation with young peo- 
ple or seeming consideration of their aspirations. Scientists can 
support an ecumenical perspective of our shared future by 
expanding international cooperation. Awareness of the gathering 
climate storm will grow this decade, so we must increase scien- 
tific understanding worldwide as needed for climate restoration. 
Third, we must take action to reduce and reverse Earth���s en- 
ergy imbalance. Highest priority is to phase down emissions, but 
it is no longer feasible to rapidly restore energy balance via only 
GHG emission reductions. Additional action is almost surely 
needed to prevent grievous escalation of climate impacts includ- 
ing lock-in of sea level rise that could destroy coastal cities 
world-wide. At least several years will be needed to define and 
gain acceptance of an approach for climate restoration. This ef- 
fort should not deter action on mitigation of emissions; on the 
contrary, the concept of human intervention in climate is dis- 
tasteful to many people, so support for GHG emission reductions 
will likely increase. Temporary solar radiation management 
(SRM) will probably be needed, e.g. via purposeful injection of at- 
mospheric aerosols. Risks of such intervention must be defined, 
as well as risks of no intervention; thus, the U.S. National 
Academy of Sciences recommends research on SRM [212]. The 
Mt. Pinatubo eruption of 1991 is a natural experiment [213, 214] 
with a forcing that reached [30] ���3 W/m2. Pinatubo deserves a co- 
ordinated study with current models. The most innocuous aero- 
sols may be fine salty droplets extracted from the ocean and 
sprayed into the air by autonomous sailboats [215]. This ap- 
proach has been discussed for potential use on a global scale 
[216], but it needs research into potential unintended effects 
[217]. This decade may be our last chance to develop the knowl- 
edge, technical capability, and political will for actions needed to 
save global coastal regions from long-term inundation.

The point of the paper was that reducing our aerosol usage was having a counteracting effect on global warming. Specifically sulphur emissions had a greater cooling effect then anticipated perhaps by increasing albedo. This reduces some uncertainty in predictions and points to a faster rate of warming than initially predicted (especially if we cut emissions)
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
The point you've highlighted about the paper involves the complex role of aerosols, particularly sulfur emissions, in climate dynamics. Here���s a summary of how aerosols, especially sulfur compounds, influence global warming and the implications for future climate change projections:
Role of Aerosols in Climate Change
Cooling Effect
: Aerosols like sulfate particles can have a cooling effect on the Earth's climate. They achieve this primarily through increasing the albedo of the planet, which means they help reflect more solar radiation back into space.
Sulfur Emissions
: Sulfur compounds, which are often released through the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes, can form sulfate aerosols. These aerosols are significant in their capacity to cool the Earth by enhancing cloud brightness, which increases cloud albedo (the reflective quality of clouds).
Implications for Climate Predictions
Counteracting Global Warming
: The cooling effect of sulfur aerosols has been somewhat counteracting the warming effects of greenhouse gases. This interplay has temporarily masked some of the warming that would otherwise be apparent from greenhouse gas emissions alone.
Uncertainty in Climate Models
: The extent of the cooling effect of aerosols has introduced uncertainties in climate models, particularly in predicting the rate of warming. Understanding the specific impacts of aerosols helps refine these models.
Impact of Reducing Emissions
: As global efforts increase to reduce sulfur emissions and other pollutants for health and environmental reasons, the cooling effect provided by these aerosols will diminish. Consequently, this could lead to a faster rate of warming than previously anticipated if greenhouse gas emissions are not simultaneously and significantly reduced.
Strategic Considerations
Policy Implications
: The understanding that cutting aerosol emissions might lead to a rapid increase in warming rates presents a challenge for climate policy. It emphasizes the need for aggressive and immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to offset the potential rapid warming from decreased aerosol cooling.
Research and Monitoring
: Continued research into the quantification of aerosol effects on climate is crucial. This research must guide policy and help predict and mitigate the impacts of these changes in aerosol concentrations.
In summary, the paper points out a critical aspect of climate dynamics���the significant, albeit temporary, cooling effect of sulfur aerosols. As global policies shift towards cleaner air, understanding and preparing for the potential implications of reduced aerosol cooling on global warming rates become imperative. This scenario underscores the complexity of climate systems and the need for integrated strategies that address both greenhouse gas emissions and aerosol impacts to manage global warming effectively.

I wanted to propose covering a dormant volcano with like 200,000 tons of sulphur and then artificially inducing erruptions with a radioactive tracer such as a nuclear bomb, to further study these effects.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Introducing large amounts of sulfur into the atmosphere by covering a dormant volcano with sulfur and then triggering an eruption using a nuclear device is a highly speculative and controversial idea. Here are some critical points to consider about this proposal:
Environmental and Geological Impact
Volcanic Eruption
: Artificially inducing a volcanic eruption, even if technically feasible, would be extremely dangerous. It could result in unpredictable geological activity, potentially causing massive destruction to nearby ecosystems and human settlements.
Sulfur Release
: The intentional release of large amounts of sulfur into the atmosphere could mimic the effects of large volcanic eruptions, which have been known to cause global cooling. However, such actions would also lead to increased acid rain, which can harm aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, degrade water quality, and damage agriculture.
Technical and Ethical Concerns
Use of Nuclear Devices
: The use of nuclear explosives for geoengineering purposes raises significant ethical, legal, and security concerns. The global political ramifications and the risk of nuclear proliferation make this approach highly contentious and likely unacceptable to the international community.
Unpredictable Outcomes
: The effects of such a large-scale geoengineering experiment are difficult to predict and could lead to unintended consequences, such as shifts in climate patterns that could negatively impact global food production and water supply.
Regulatory and Scientific Issues
Regulatory Hurdles
: There are numerous international treaties and regulations that would likely prohibit such an experiment. These include laws against nuclear explosions, environmental protection acts, and international agreements on climate change and geoengineering.
Research Alternatives
: More conventional and less risky research methods are available to study the impact of aerosols on climate. These include atmospheric sampling, computer models, and small-scale experiments that do not involve nuclear explosions or intentional volcanic eruptions.
Moral and Public Health Considerations
Public Health
: The health implications for people living near the experiment site and downwind of it could be severe, including respiratory problems from increased particulate matter in the air.
Moral Implications
: There is a moral question regarding human intervention in natural systems at such a scale, particularly involving technologies with significant destructive potential.
In conclusion, while the concept of studying aerosol effects on weather and climate is scientifically valid, the method proposed involves extreme risks and numerous practical and ethical challenges. Alternative research methods that do not entail high-risk interventions are preferable for advancing our understanding of climate systems and potential geoengineering techniques.

I wanted to study the effect of banning all outboard motors, exterior exhausts, and hunting on the global ecosystem.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Studying the impact of banning all outboard motors, exterior exhausts (like those from vehicles and factories), and hunting could provide valuable insights into how human activities influence the global ecosystem. Here's a breakdown of how such a study could be structured and what it might reveal:
1.
Impact of Banning Outboard Motors
Environmental Benefits
: Reducing pollution in water bodies could lead to clearer waters and healthier aquatic ecosystems. This reduction would decrease oil and gasoline runoff, which can be toxic to marine life.
Economic and Social Impact
: There would need to be consideration of the economic impact on communities that rely on boats for transportation, fishing, and tourism. Alternatives like electric motors could be explored.
2.
Impact of Banning Exterior Exhausts
Air Quality Improvement
: Eliminating exhausts from vehicles, factories, and other industrial sources would significantly improve air quality, reducing smog and health issues related to air pollution.
Climate Change Mitigation
: By cutting down on emissions of greenhouse gases and particulates, this measure could contribute to slowing down climate change.
Transition Challenges
: Transitioning to cleaner alternatives (e.g., electric vehicles, renewable energy for industrial processes) would be crucial. The economic, infrastructural, and societal adjustments would require careful planning and substantial investment.
3.
Impact of Banning Hunting
Biodiversity and Wildlife Populations
: Banning hunting could lead to the recovery of wildlife populations that are currently under pressure. However, it may also lead to overpopulation and ecological imbalance in certain areas where hunting is used as a management tool.
Ecosystem Services
: Healthier wildlife populations could improve ecosystem services like pollination and seed dispersal.
Cultural and Economic Considerations
: Hunting is an integral part of culture and economy in many regions. Bans could affect traditions and livelihoods, requiring the development of economic alternatives for those communities.
Methodology for Study
Data Collection
: Longitudinal studies and environmental monitoring would be essential. Satellite imagery, wildlife population tracking, air and water quality monitoring could provide comprehensive data.
Modeling and Simulation
: To predict long-term impacts, sophisticated environmental and economic models would be needed. These models would simulate the outcomes of such bans on both local and global scales.
Stakeholder Involvement
: Engaging communities, industries, and environmental groups in the study would help assess the socio-economic impacts and develop viable alternatives to current practices.
Case Studies
: Examining regions where similar bans are already in place could offer practical insights and help anticipate challenges and benefits.
Expected Outcomes
Ecological Health
: Improved health of various ecosystems could be a major outcome, contributing to the resilience of the environment against pollution and climate change.
Economic Shifts
: Transitioning industries and communities to new practices could spur innovation but might also cause short-term economic disruptions.
Policy Recommendations
: The study could provide critical data to inform policymakers, helping them to draft regulations that balance ecological health with economic and social needs.
Challenges
Enforcement and Compliance
: Ensuring compliance with such widespread bans would be challenging and resource-intensive.
Unintended Consequences
: Each ban might have unintended ecological or economic consequences, requiring adaptive management strategies.
Conducting such a comprehensive study would not only illuminate the direct effects of these bans but also foster a deeper understanding of the intricate connections between human activities and the global ecosystem. This could guide more sustainable practices and policies in the future.
