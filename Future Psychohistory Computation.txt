Computation and Humanity 
Introduction 
In his mid-20th century science fiction trilogy Foundation1, Isaac Asimov used the fanciful science of 
âpsychohistoryâ as a literary trellis to weave a story around. The concept was simple yet intriguing: 
humanityâs course could be analyzed, predicted, and even guided using this new science that combined 
elements of mathematics, psychology, and history. New science was a familiar theme of the time. This 
was the dawn of the atomic age, the blossoming of the computer age, a time of recent and breath- 
taking expansion of the cosmological model, and the eve of the genetics revolution. Our world view had 
been radically re-shaped by Darwin, Einstein, Hubble, Turing, and many others. 
Computer hardware has evolved considerably since that time, especially in miniaturization2 and parallel 
processing. Hardware advances have led to innovation in software and networking, and multiple 
information technology feedback loops have manifested themselves (e.g. computer-guided design). 
There is not as yet (and may never be) a set of formulae that can chart humanity's course as in 
Foundation. However, it may soon be possible to accurately model a form of psychohistory 
computationally. At least four paradigm shifts are currently underway, making this possible. 
They include: 
1) almost-free transistors 
2) the supplanting of the formula by the algorithm 
3) abstracted computing (the 'Cloud') 
4) the growing realization that brain=mind 
This article is neither an advocacy for any course of action nor a general espousal of Asimovâs ideals. 
Rather, it is only a brief look at the possibility of computational psychohistory. 
I must, however, confess a deep admiration for Asimovâs life and a love since boyhood of his books. 
1 Consisting of Foundation (1951), Foundation and Empire (1952), and Second Foundation (1953) 
2 Unrelated, but miniaturization was the subject of Asimovâs novelization of the 1966 film, Fantastic Voyage1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article introduces the concept of "Future Psychohistory," which borrows from the science fiction works of Isaac Asimov, particularly his Foundation trilogy. Asimov proposed 'psychohistory,' a science that could analyze, predict, and guide humanity's course, integrating elements of mathematics, psychology, and history. The author acknowledges the considerable advancement in computer hardware, particularly in miniaturization and parallel processing, and the consequent innovations in software and networking.While a precise formula to chart humanity's course, as proposed in Asimov's works, does not exist yet, the author argues that the development of computational psychohistory might soon be feasible due to four ongoing paradigm shifts. These include almost-free transistors, the replacement of the formula by the algorithm, the advent of abstracted computing (or 'Cloud' computing), and a growing understanding that the brain equals the mind.This article does not promote a particular course of action or the ideals of Asimov but explores the potential for computational psychohistory. The author also confesses their admiration for Asimov and his works.1 / 1The Foundation Vision 
August 1941. Hitler's armies were on the march all 
across Europe. A malevolent, dictatorial, and 
technologically advanced empire, unlike anything 
the world had seen since Rome, had quickly 
emerged. Meanwhile, an ocean away, a quiet 
America was still months away from Pearl Harbor. 
In a small office in New York, a young chemistry 
grad student, who moonlighted as a science 
fiction writer, met with his publisher. The main 
topic of discussion was a possible new project, 
one that would span at least several stories and 
maybe even several books. The eventual result of 
that discussion, first published piecemeal, and 
always guided by Asimovâs own philosophy, was 
Foundation. 
Here is a very brief synopsis [spoiler alert]. 
In the far future, the great Galactic Empire has 
united virtually every corner of the galaxy into a 
single political and economic union. At the centre 
of this empire sits its pinnacle, the planet-city of 
Trantor. It is, for the most part, a benevolent and 
peaceful system, where order and tradition have 
dominion. However, it is in the early stages of 
decline, and is replete with the trappings: a 
corrupt, stultifying bureaucracy, pompous 
aristocracy, and even a few vicious rulers. 
A small group of academics on Trantor, the 
'psychohistorians', are the only ones who know of 
this impending collapse and they keep it very 
secret to avoid sedition charges. They are led by 
the brilliant mathematician and inventor of 
psychohistory, Hari Seldon. His goal is to let 
psychohistory guide humanity through a much 
shorter, less painful collapse and recovery of only 
a thousand years, instead of the thirty thousand 
years of ignorance, brutality, and misery that 
psychohistory predicts if things are left to play out 
on their own. This is to be accomplished through 
the establishment of a 'Foundation' to develop 
science and rationality to the point where it can 
eventually replace the dead empire and save the 
galaxy. The book Lost Horizon (Hilton, 1933) tells a 
similar story with the Tibetan lamasery of Shangri- 
La playing the part of the Foundation. 
The tale then recounts the rise of the noble 
Foundation, from its humble beginnings on the 
periphery of the galaxy, to its eventual domination 
of a good sized section of it. This period is marked 
by a series of 'Seldon Crises', which correspond to 
critical junctures in the psychohistory 'Plan'. A 
small screening room, featuring a projection of 
the long-dead Seldon, re-activates at such crises, 
usually to state the obvious or be otherwise 
innocuous. It is an important precept of 
psychohistory (and thus the Plan) that the general 
population is not informed by, consciously guided 
by, or even aware of the Plan. 
One of the strongest themes in Foundation is that 
of economics trumping militarism. Over and over 
in the tale, a brief flash of silly, goose-stepping 
empire building is washed away by the relentless 
forces of trade, work, and brave industry. 
One example is the interstellar trader Hober 
Mallow. He leads a trade effort to one of the 
hostile worlds that surround the Foundation. 
Through deft trading and negotiating, he manages 
to make this potential enemy reliant upon 
Foundation technological goods (and ongoing 
maintenance of those trinkets). He is basically a 
swashbuckling merchant. His exploits get the 
Foundation past a Seldon Crisis, move it beyond 
being a mere purveyor of a pseudo-religion, and 
make him the first of the âMerchant Princesâ. 
Another example is what happens on the once 
magnificent Trantor after the Galactic Empire falls.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn the "Foundation Vision" section, the author recalls the historical context when Isaac Asimov conceptualized the Foundation series. Amidst World War II, Asimov, a chemistry grad student and part-time science fiction writer, discussed a new project with his publisher, leading to the creation of the Foundation series, reflecting Asimov's personal philosophy.The author then provides a brief synopsis of the series: In the distant future, the vast Galactic Empire, centralized around the planet-city of Trantor, is beginning to decline. This imminent collapse is only known to a small group of academics on Trantor, the 'psychohistorians', led by Hari Seldon, the creator of psychohistory. Seldon aims to guide humanity through a shorter and less devastating collapse by using psychohistory, resulting in only a thousand years of turmoil rather than the predicted thirty thousand. He seeks to achieve this through the establishment of a 'Foundation' to cultivate science and rationality, ultimately replacing the fallen empire.The narrative then follows the rise of the Foundation, detailing various 'Seldon Crises' â critical points in the psychohistory 'Plan'. Seldon, though long-dead, appears via projections during these crises, offering guidance. One crucial aspect of psychohistory and the Plan is that the general population is not consciously aware of or guided by it.A strong theme in Foundation is economics triumphing over militarism, repeatedly showing the lasting impact of trade and industry over transient military conquests. An example is the character Hober Mallow, a trader who defuses a potential threat by making an enemy reliant on the Foundation's technology and services, helping the Foundation navigate a Seldon Crisis and advancing its status beyond a pseudo-religion. The section ends with a tease about what transpires on Trantor after the Galactic Empire's fall.1 / 1The Transistor 
Mastery of any quantity requires flow control, 
which is normally accomplished by a gate. This 
could be a fence gate for livestock, a sluice for 
water, a bank for money, etc. Gating the flow of 
electricity was one of the major technological 
advances leading to the modern world. 
The early phase of the study of electromagnetism 
took place in the 1820s with the work of AmpÃ¨re 
and Faraday (Steinle). They had to manually 
connect and disconnect components to control 
electricity in their elementary circuits. In 1843, 
Charles Wheatstone invented the rheostat, a 
manually controlled mechanical device for 
adjusting the flow of electricity ("rheo" being 
Greek for "to flow") (Lytle). 
Sir John Ambrose Fleming invented the thermionic 
electron valve, more commonly known as the 
vacuum tube, in 1904 (Okamura, 1994). This 
device allowed the electronic control of current 
flowing across a vacuum gap. For decades, it 
served as the basis of amplifying circuits in devices 
such as radios. It also served as a switching device 
in early electronic computers as did the electro- 
mechanical relay. 
ENIAC3, the first full-scale, general-purpose 
electronic computer, was completed in 1946. It 
used relays for input/output, and 18,000 vacuum 
tubes for computation (Norton, 2005, p. 39). 
Vacuum tubes were however, large, power- 
hungry, slow, unreliable, and expensive. The very 
idea of electrons leaping across a vacuum gap was 
ungainly. A solid state solution was needed. 
3 Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer 
built at the University of Pennsylvania 
In 1947, working at Bell Labs in New Jersey, J. 
Bardeen and W. Brattain constructed a working 
transistor (Brinkman, Haggan, & Troutman, 1997). 
A transistor is an electronic valve (gate) that 
controls the flow of current through a solid-state 
semiconductor (Coles, 1977, p. 5). "A transistor is 
just a piece of silicon whose conductivity can be 
turned off and on.â (Biermann, 1990, p. 204) 
Its name is a contraction of TRANSfer resISTOR. 
The world now had a small, low-power, fast, 
reliable, and inexpensive alternative to the 
vacuum tube. But the best was yet to come â 
miniaturization. 
For several years, designers experimented with 
different semiconductor types. A breakthrough 
came with transistors being built using silicon 
layers (planar construction). Early planar 
transistors sold for several dollars each around 
1959 (Moore, Keynote Speech, 1997). 
Using a photonic process, these planar transistors 
could be produced en masse on silicon wafers. 
Many transistors could be placed together on an 
âintegrated circuitâ. Dramatic miniaturization took 
the electronics world by storm, and a dizzying 
reduction in transistor size and cost began.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis section, titled "The Transistor," traces the history and evolution of electricity flow control, a key technological advancement leading to the modern era.The early studies of electromagnetism in the 1820s with AmpÃ¨re and Faraday required manual connections and disconnections to control electricity. In 1843, Charles Wheatstone invented the rheostat, a manually controlled device to adjust the electrical flow.In 1904, Sir John Ambrose Fleming invented the thermionic electron valve or vacuum tube, which allowed for electronic control of current flowing across a vacuum gap. These vacuum tubes became the basis of amplifying circuits in radios and as a switching device in early electronic computers like ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer.However, vacuum tubes had several limitations, such as being large, power-hungry, slow, unreliable, expensive, and their operation required the ungainly action of electrons leaping across a vacuum gap. A solid-state solution was needed.In 1947, J. Bardeen and W. Brattain at Bell Labs created the transistor, a solid-state electronic valve that controls the flow of current through a semiconductor. The transistor, smaller, more efficient, faster, more reliable, and cheaper than the vacuum tube, was a revolution in electronics.Designers experimented with different semiconductor types, and a breakthrough came with planar construction using silicon layers. By using a photonic process, these transistors could be mass-produced on silicon wafers, leading to the creation of integrated circuits. This heralded a period of dramatic miniaturization and reduction in transistor size and cost.1 / 1Mooreâs law, devised (and later modified) by 
microelectronics pioneer Gordon E. Moore 
(Cramming more components onto integrated 
circuits, 1965), states that the number of 
transistors that can be squeezed at low cost onto 
an integrated circuit will double every two years. 
It is a prediction that has held true to the present4. 
At times, it was even a bit too conservative. 
In 1968, the price of a transistor was one dollar 
(Intel, 2005). By 1972, it was about twelve cents. 
By 1980, it was a few hundredths of a cent. By 
1998, it was one millionth of a cent. It continued 
into small fractions of a millionth of a cent. Six 
years ago, it was estimated that the price of a 
transistor was that of one newspaper character 
(Intel, 2005). Today, transistors on massively 
integrated circuits are virtually free. The cost is in 
the packaging. 
Reduction in size/cost is not the only benefit. As 
integrated circuits get smaller, they also get faster. 
Electric charge moves through a wire at great 
speed, but not unlimited speed. The shorter the 
interconnections between transistors become, the 
faster will be the operations they perform. For a 
given speed of electric charge, and a given 
number of operations per second, there will be a 
limiting distance that an electric charge can travel. 
A rough estimate for the speed of electric charge 
inside an integrated circuit is 1/3000 the speed of 
light, or 100 kilometers per second (Biermann, 
1990, p. 221). Using this number, the limiting 
distance at 1 thousand operations per second is 
328 feet, at 1 million operations per second is 3.9 
inches, and at 1 billion operations per second is 
0.004 inches (p. 222). Size does indeed matter. 
4 Due to relentless innovation and the huge gulf 
between our scale and the quantum scale, a physical 
limit which we are now approaching 
It is difficult to overestimate the impact of this 
size/cost reduction over the last 50 years. Some of 
the fruits are: computers (super, mini, micro, 
portable, video game consoles5), communications 
(satellites, cellphones, microwave, digital TV, 
networks (including the Internet)), medical 
(diagnostics, treatment, chemical analysis and 
synthesis, genetic research), digital cameras, 
terrestrial navigation (GPS), extraterrestrial 
navigation (moon race, planetary exploration), 
manufacturing (assembly/robotics, automotive, 
aerospace), and new economic growth (Silicon 
Valley & other high-tech zones, the âTigerâ 
economies). Truly, we now live in a digital age. 
The GPU 
In the mid-1990s, touched off by the burgeoning 
video game market, secondary pyrotechnics of 
transistor density began. The graphics processing 
unit (GPU) was a new dedicated subsystem on a 
PC card designed to enhance 3D graphic game 
display. Early cards had about 1 million transistors. 
By 2000, they had 25 million. By 2005, they had 
hundreds of millions (Lilly, 2009).

fastest supercomputer from the ninetiesâ

Each core in a GPU is a central processing unit 
(CPU) in its own right. These cores are often called 
âshadersâ to reflect their main task in graphics 
manipulation, the GPUâs ostensive purpose. Each 
is capable of running its own program, or thread. 
These cores can also access shared memory, and 
are under the control of orchestrating logic that 
implements a unified parallel processor. 
Today, good GPUs have billions of transistors 
implementing and controlling hundreds of shaders 
(cores). These cards are often designed to work in 
tandem with several together in the same PC 
chassis. So, a high-end gaming PC might have 10 
billion transistors and a thousand cores in a single, 
1 kilowatt box. Compare this with the Foundation- 
contemporary, apartment-sized, 150 kilowatt 
ENIAC and its 18,000 vacuum tubes. 
GPU software also evolved. Early proprietary 
application programming interfaces (APIs) gave 
way to the Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) 
(Lilly, 2009). Scientific research and engineering 
applications began to appear to harness some of 
this vast new number crunching power too. GPU- 
assisted research projects in astronomy, biology, 
genetics, physics, materials/design, mathematics, 
and others have been launched.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis section, "Mooreâs law, and The GPU," discusses two significant topics in the field of electronics.Moore's Law, formulated by Gordon E. Moore, states that the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated circuit will double approximately every two years. This law, surprisingly, has held true until now, and at times has been somewhat conservative. The price of a transistor decreased from one dollar in 1968 to virtually free today, and as integrated circuits get smaller, they also get faster.The section also covers the impacts of the size/cost reduction of integrated circuits in the last 50 years. It contributed to the development of various technologies, including computers, communication devices, medical equipment, digital cameras, navigation systems, and also boosted economic growth, thereby facilitating the digital age we live in today.The text then transitions to the development of the graphics processing unit (GPU) in the mid-1990s. Initially designed to enhance 3D graphic game displays, GPUs have evolved over the years from having about 1 million transistors to hundreds of millions. Each core in a GPU, often called a 'shader', can run its own program or thread, access shared memory, and is controlled by orchestrating logic, which implements a unified parallel processor.The evolution of GPU software, from proprietary application programming interfaces (APIs) to the Open Graphics Library (OpenGL), allowed for a wider range of applications. GPU-assisted research projects in fields such as astronomy, biology, genetics, physics, materials/design, and mathematics have been launched, tapping into the vast number-crunching power of modern GPUs.1 / 1and others have been launched. 
For many applications, computational costs are a 
receding concern. Almost-free transistors are 
currently moving several pre-existing techniques 
from the mostly academic realm into everyday 
practicality. We now look at two of these: 
Bayesian learning and functional programming. 
geopense 
7 
Bayesian Learning 
Bayes6 introduced a method for combining a prior 
probability together with new knowledge (results 
data) to infer a revised probability. In Bayesian 
inference, subjectivity is made explicit and fixed in 
the past. Different sources may supply different 
prior probabilities (possibly subjective beliefs). 
This is in contrast with other statistical methods 
which may seem more objective, but where in fact 
the subjectivity is made implicit and on-going (e.g. 
assumptions about randomness, choices about 
sampling). 
The revised probability can then be fed back into 
the algorithm as the prior probability, together 
with new data. As this process iterates, learning 
takes place. 
Bayesâ theorem7: 
( | ) 
( | ) ( ) 
( ) 
where: 
P(H) is the prior probability of hypothesis (existing belief) 
P(D|H) is the conditional probability (likelihood) of data 
given hypothesis 
P(D) is the probability of data 
P(H|D) is the posterior probability of hypothesis 
given data (revised belief) 
For two centuries, Bayesian theory was frowned 
upon by most statisticians, and was the source of 
a deep schism. The disagreement is essentially 
rooted in oneâs definition of probability. 
For a âFrequentistâ, an eventâs probability is 
measured by the frequency distribution of trial 
6 Thomas Bayes 1702-1761. English Presbyterian 
minister, theologian, and mathematician 
(EB, Thomas Bayes, 2011) 
7 The Modern representation is due to Laplace 
(McGrayne, 2011, pp. 49-50) 
outcomes. If an event has a probability of 0.5, it 
means that it is equally likely as not to occur in the 
limit (infinite trials). At the heart of this viewpoint 
is implicit randomness. Subjectivity about causes 
is excluded from the process. 
For a âBayesianâ, probability is a means of 
quantifying lack of knowledge (degrees of belief). 
New knowledge is used to revise beliefs. Effects 
inform knowledge about causes. It is an inductive 
process of learning from evidence or experience. 
Any subjectivity is made explicit, but past (prior), 
where it is more difficult to argue subjectivity. 
Far from excluding or avoiding causality, causal 
Bayesian networks explicitly include causes. âOne 
of the most intriguing aspects of Bayesian 
networks is the role they play in formalizing 
causality.â (Darwiche, 2010, p. 88) 
The use of prior distributions in Bayesian methods 
is a double-edged sword. To a Frequentist, it is an 
unnecessary and subjective complication. To a 
Bayesian, however, it is an opportunity to include 
more information into an inference. 
Perhaps an exclusive distinction between the two 
is unnecessary. âThe man in the street is happy to 
use probabilities in both these ways.â (MacKay, 
2003, p. 26) Laplace said of the latter: âessentially, 
the theory of probability is nothing but good 
common sense reduced to mathematicsâ (as 
quoted in (McGrayne, 2011, p. 50)) âOf course, it 
is futile to argue over which is the âcorrectâ 
definition of probability. The different definitions 
merely reflect different choices for the types of 
problems the theory can addressâ (Loredo, 1990, 
p. 85) 
A problem in applied mathematics is the âcurse of 
dimensionalityâ. This refers to the idea that some 
problems (âsomeâ becomes âmostâ when studying 
examples from nature) have too many variables to 
geopense 
8 
be consistently handled. Worse, these variables 
often influence each other. Explicitly handling 
each and every eventuality could lead to a 
combinatorial explosion which would easily 
overwhelm the most massive computational 
power available now or even in the future.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis section introduces Bayesian Learning, a statistical approach based on Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used for probability inference, combining a prior probability with new information to infer a revised probability. This is an iterative process, where the revised probability is fed back into the algorithm as the prior probability for the next iteration, enabling learning.The text discusses two different perspectives on probability: the 'Frequentist' and the 'Bayesian'.Frequentists view the probability of an event as the frequency distribution of trial outcomes, grounded in the concept of implicit randomness. In contrast, Bayesians interpret probability as a way to quantify the degree of belief or lack of knowledge about an event. They use new information to revise these beliefs, learning from evidence or experience.The text also mentions the use of causal Bayesian networks, which include causes and are used to formalize causality. The use of prior distributions in Bayesian methods is a contentious issue, with Frequentists viewing it as an unnecessary complication, while Bayesians see it as a way to incorporate more information into an inference.The section ends by introducing the 'curse of dimensionality', a problem in applied mathematics. It refers to situations where problems have so many variables, often interrelated, that managing all possibilities can lead to a combinatorial explosion, overwhelming computational capabilities.1 / 1The brain is one such example from nature. The 
frequentist approach, which applies best to 
problems with a few un-entangled variables, is 
hopelessly out-gunned. The Bayesian approach 
may still have a chance: 
for multivariate cortical data, the Bayesian model provides for a 
more accurate representation by removing the effect of 
confounding correlations that get introduced due to canonical 
dependence between the data 
(Joshi, Joshi, Leahy, Shattuck, Dinov, & Toga, 2010, abstract) 
Another problem from nature is that of mapping 
RNA onto DNA. Translation from DNA to RNA 
involves keeping certain sequences (exons) and 
removing others (introns). This makes mapping a 
âfinishedâ gene back onto DNA problematic. One 
approach is to use canonical Bayesian networks to 
study genetic linkage: 
To assess the likelihood of a linkage hypothesis, one uses a 
pedigree with some information about the genotype and 
phenotype of associated individuals. Such information can be 
systematically translated into a Bayesian network 
(Darwiche, 2010, p. 85) 
Sometimes, we need to evaluate probabilities 
with rare phenomena. Frequencies do not apply: 
The gamma ray astronomer does not want to know how an 
observation of a gamma-ray burst would compare with 
thousands of other observations of that burst; the burst is a 
unique event which can be observed only once, and the 
astronomer wants to know what confidence should be placed in 
conclusions drawn from the one data set that actually exists 
(Loredo, 1990, p. 83) 
Any model of real-world complexity is far beyond 
any engineerâs or artistâs ability to manually 
design. Such complexity must be created 
dynamically and/or learned from real-world data. 
Bayesian methods are an excellent means of 
implementing machine learning and subsequent 
machine reasoning and understanding that can 
generate new complexity based on the model. 
Why did Bayesian analysis languish for centuries? 
Dogmatism and the success of the Frequentist 
approach (at least until recently) are indeed part 
of the reason, but there is also a simpler part. 
Paradoxically, the world had to catch up to Bayes 
and Laplace. The computational power required 
for Bayesian methods to be successfully applied to 
real world problems has only recently existed: 
Computations took foreverâ¦ 
The title of a meeting held in 1982, âPractical Bayesian 
Statisticsâ, was a laughable oxymoron. 
(McGrayne, 2011, p. 245)1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis passage continues the discussion of Bayesian learning, highlighting the utility of the Bayesian approach in complex, real-world problems that often involve a multitude of interrelated variables. A few examples are provided to illustrate this:The brain: The complexity of the brain, with numerous interconnected neurons, far exceeds the capacity of the Frequentist approach. Bayesian models, however, can more accurately represent multivariate cortical data by eliminating the effect of confounding correlations.Genetic mapping: The Bayesian approach is useful in the study of genetic linkage. In the complex process of translating DNA to RNA, where certain sequences are retained (exons) and others are removed (introns), canonical Bayesian networks can be used to assess the likelihood of a linkage hypothesis.Rare phenomena: In situations where events are unique and cannot be replicated, such as observing a gamma-ray burst in astronomy, Bayesian methods are preferred because frequency-based probabilities don't apply.The text also emphasizes that the complexity of real-world models far exceeds any human's ability to manually design. This complexity needs to be generated dynamically and/or learned from real-world data. Bayesian methods provide an effective means of implementing machine learning, allowing machines to reason and understand based on the model, thereby generating new complexity.Despite its potential, Bayesian analysis was underutilized for centuries due to dogmatism, the success of the Frequentist approach, and the lack of sufficient computational power. The computations required for Bayesian methods were time-consuming, and it's only recently that computational power has increased enough to apply Bayesian methods to real-world problems successfully.1 / 1Functional Programming 
In 1941, as Asimov ruminated over Foundation, 
Alonzo Church wrote "The Calculi of Lambda- 
conversion". His lambda calculus provided a 
conceptual basis for the discipline of functional 
programming (Barendregt, 1997). FP, as opposed 
to the more common imperative programming 
approach (e.g. C), is well-suited to concurrent and 
parallel architectures. There are now many FP 
languages and tools, and FP has also been 
included at least to some degree in many other 
popular languages and tools. 
We will take a closer look at one functional 
programming language, Haskell, in order to 
highlight some of the features of FP that make this 
a promising approach for modern scientific 
modeling. Haskell is certainly not the only, or 
necessarily the best, choice8. However, it is by 
default: purely functional, âlazyâ, compiled, and 
statically (although automatically) typed. It is 
open-source, has been in active development for 
over twenty years, and has built-in support for 
parallel systems (Haskell.org). 
In 1958, John McCarthy, inspired by the lambda 
calculus, created Lisp, the main language of 
artificial intelligence (AI) for decades to come. In 
the early 1970s, Robin Milner created the 
functional programming language ML. Haskell 1.0 
appeared in 1990. Rapid increase in computer 
power allowed trading off some raw performance 
in favour of programmer productivity. Haskell 
then successfully made the move beyond 
academia and into the open source and 
commercial domains (O'Sullivan, Stewart, & 
Goerzen, 2008) (A brief sketch of Haskell's history 
section). 
8 For example, Clojure springs to mind, but the 
requirement for a Java VM might be problematic. 
Haskell is âpurely functionalâ. This means that 
Haskell functions are without side effects. Code 
execution does not need to be sequential because 
variable data are not passed along a chain as on 
an assembly line. The classic statement X = X + 1 
has no place in Haskell because the data that a 
function works with are never modified. Access to 
the external world is not handled by âpureâ code. 
Automated testing of purely functional code is 
easier because it is âstatelessâ (immutable data) 
and isolated from the outside world. 
Haskell is very high level (i.e. elegant, powerful). 
Its syntax is less like a series of explicit steps and 
more like mathematical expressions. One specifies 
âwhatâ is needed, not âhowâ to get it (declarative as 
opposed to imperative). Since it is stateless, FP 
implements repetition via recursion not loops 
(Goldberg, 1996). 
Haskell is âlazyâ. This means that functions are not 
executed unless and until they are required, 
improving brevity and efficiency, sometimes 
immensely. The value of blinding execution speed 
is lessened when a language is savvy enough to 
avoid wasted effort. 
Haskell is ârigorousâ. By design, errors are detected 
at compile time, not runtime. Actually, a 
programâs correctness is almost a prerequisite to 
it running at all. 
Since it is purely functional, Haskell code runs well 
on parallel architectures. Since it is compiled, 
statically typed, and âlazyâ, Haskell code is fast. 
Since it is elegant, rigorous, and highly testable, 
Haskell code is maintainable. This combination 
makes Haskell suitable for modeling huge systems 
such as the psychohistory of humanity.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis passage introduces the concept of Functional Programming (FP) and the language Haskell. It traces the origin of FP back to Alonzo Church's "The Calculi of Lambda-conversion" in 1941, which forms the conceptual basis for FP.Unlike imperative programming (like C), FP is well suited for concurrent and parallel architectures. The passage specifically focuses on Haskell, a functional programming language, for its distinct features and its promise for modern scientific modeling. However, the text notes that Haskell is not the only or necessarily the best choice for FP.Haskell is purely functional, meaning its functions do not have side effects. Its code does not have to be executed sequentially, making automated testing easier due to its stateless nature (it uses immutable data) and isolation from the external world. Its syntax resembles mathematical expressions more than explicit steps, offering a high-level (elegant, powerful) approach to programming.Haskell is 'lazy,' meaning functions are only executed when required, leading to improved brevity and efficiency. This characteristic lessens the value of blinding execution speed as the language can avoid unnecessary effort.Additionally, Haskell is 'rigorous.' By design, errors are detected at compile time rather than runtime, making a program's correctness nearly a prerequisite for its execution. This feature further enhances the maintainability of Haskell code.Haskell's ability to run well on parallel architectures, its speed due to being compiled, statically typed, and 'lazy,' and its maintainability owing to its elegance, rigor, and high testability make it suitable for modeling massive systems, such as the psychohistory of humanity.1 / 1The Algorithm 
Formal logic has been a shining jewel for great 
thinkers down through the ages. In the West, one 
can list Aristotle, Hobbes, Leibniz, Boole, GÃ¶del, 
and many others before even venturing into the 
rich philosophical histories of other cultures. 
For millennia, mathematics progressed based on 
symbolic representations and formal logic. As a 
result, our understanding of the universe also 
progressed. Perfect shapes and exact formulae 
inspired mathematicians, astronomers, physicists, 
engineers, artists, and philosophers to embrace 
the world of axioms, conjectures, proofs, and 
truth exemplified by this âQueen of Sciencesâ. 
In the last century or so, as in so much of science, 
storm clouds have begun to appear. We have 
been increasingly choked by complexity and data. 
Now faced with multivariate, nonlinear, near- 
frantic complexity, fed to us by instruments that 
extend our reach far out in all directions of time, 
space, and life, our beloved symbolic notions have 
begun to fall short. 
As it turns out, there is another way; one that is 
unfettered by the requirement of fitting within 
the human head. 
The Algorithm's coming-of-age as the new language of science 
promises to be the most disruptive scientific development since 
quantum mechanics 
(Chazelle, 2006) 
The younger generation seemed to think that computers and 
their algorithms could replace mathematics entirely. 
(McGrayne, 2011, p. 245) 
Alan Turing wrote a paper in 1936 which 
answered a question in mathematics (negatively) 
by replacing calculus with a âuniversal computerâ 
(Steer, Birch, & Impney, 2008, p. 259). Here was a 
theoretical outline of the modern computer. 
The universal computer was thought objectified. 
Any possible task of computation could be done 
by this theoretical contrivance. Over the next 
decade, theory would become practice, and the 
ENIAC appeared in 1946. 
Computers got faster, smaller, and cheaper, but 
the basic principles of operation have remained 
unchanged since Turing9. A central processing unit 
(CPU) reads programs and data10, processes them 
(âcontrolâ), and produces output. 
A formula is a predicate applied to one or more 
arguments, or a combination of simpler formulae 
(Sharples, Hutchinson, Torrance, & Young, 1989, 
p. 361). "An algorithm is a method, procedure, or 
recipe for doing a job." (Biermann, 1990, p. 39) 
The algorithmâs procedure is applied by the 
controlling logic (CPU) as it reads input and 
(presumably) generates output. A formula relates 
symbols, an algorithm manipulates data. Overly 
simplified, a formula articulates knowledge, while 
an algorithm generates knowledge (or at least 
information). 
Algorithms are now in use everywhere, perhaps 
even in your digital camera. Some of the earliest 
and most successful algorithms were invented for 
image processing. Edge and region detection were 
implemented years ago (Sharples, Hutchinson, 
Torrance, & Young, 1989, p. 266). 
9 Excepting theoretical ideas like quantum computing 
10 The similarity between programs and data is known 
as âdualityâ (Chazelle, 2006)1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis passage discusses the growing importance of algorithms in the realm of scientific development and mathematics.Formal logic has played a significant role in the progress of mathematics for centuries, and in turn, this progress has informed our understanding of the universe. However, in recent times, the complexity and volume of data we face, combined with our expanding reach into different dimensions of time, space, and life, have exposed limitations in our traditional symbolic approach to understanding the universe.The author introduces the concept of algorithms as a new language of science, suggesting that this paradigm shift could be as disruptive as the development of quantum mechanics. In 1936, Alan Turing proposed the concept of a 'universal computer' that could theoretically perform any computational task. This idea eventually materialized with the development of ENIAC in 1946. Despite numerous technological advancements, the basic principles of operation for computers (reading programs and data, processing them, and producing output) have remained largely the same since Turing's era.The author also highlights the distinction between formulas and algorithms. While a formula is a predicate applied to one or more arguments or a combination of simpler formulas, an algorithm is a method or procedure for accomplishing a task. Essentially, while a formula articulates knowledge, an algorithm generates knowledge or information.Finally, the author emphasizes the widespread use of algorithms, from commonplace devices such as digital cameras to more complex applications in image processing, edge and region detection.1 / 1One of the mathematical forms that has come to 
the fore because of ever increasing computational 
power is the fractal. The best-known fractal is the 
Mandelbrot set, which is generated with the 
algorithm: 
where: 
Z is a complex number 
c is a complex constant (test point) 
After sufficient iterations, a planar image emerges 
displaying self-similarity at different scales and an 
âinfinite regress of detailâ (Dewdney, 2002). The 
Mandelbrot set illustrates that a simple algorithm 
using basic iteration or recursion can produce 
deep complexity. Fractals offer a glimpse into the 
construction mechanisms of nature. 
Another form is the cellular automaton, which is 
again the basis of many simulations of systems in 
the real world. The best-known example is 
Conwayâs Game of Life (EB, cellular automata 
(CA), 2011). 
Another powerful method, especially useful for 
research in areas where little is known about 
causation, is Monte Carlo analysis. In this method, 
random sampling is used instead of a formula. The 
goal is to simulate a complex system and to have 
properties of that simulation converge to stable 
values. In normal cases, Monte Carlo analysis 
helps to test theory. In the best case scenario, 
actual discovery of underlying causation is a goal 
(to guide theory). 
A very simple example of Monte Carlo analysis is 
the estimation of the value of Ï. The following 
diagram shows the geometric and algebraic 
representations of the ratio of areas of a circle 
(radius=r) which fits exactly inside a square 
(side=2r). Thus, knowing this ratio will give us a 
direct means of calculating Ï. 
We repeatedly generate random points that lie 
within the square. Some of these points will also 
lie within the circle. By counting the number of 
âhitsâ in both, we can estimate the ratio of areas of 
the circle to the square. Generally, the more 
random points (samples) are generated, the more 
accurate the estimate will be. It can take a million 
samples for the value of Ï to converge to several 
decimal places. However, this task can be 
accomplished by a modern parallel processor in a 
fraction of a second. Computational costs are a 
receding concern. 
A more sophisticated method is Bayesian Monte 
Carlo (BMC) which incorporates prior knowledge. 
(Rasmussen & Ghahramani, 2002, abstract) 
Algorithms offer informal and highly interactive 
access to knowledge manipulation and testing. 
They encourage inductive thought as opposed to, 
and hopefully in addition to, more traditional, 
logical deductive reasoning. They have become a 
powerful tool for scientific thought, research, and 
even discovery. 
âOne canât proceed from the informal to the 
formal by formal means.â

11 Computer scientist Alan J. Perlis1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe text discusses the increasing importance and utility of mathematical forms and algorithms, particularly with the rise of computational power. Specifically, it talks about fractals, cellular automata, and Monte Carlo analysis, emphasizing their capacity to model, simulate, and provide insights into complex real-world systems.Fractals, such as the Mandelbrot set, use simple recursive algorithms to generate intricate, infinitely complex patterns. They offer a way to visualize the patterns and self-similarities found in natural phenomena.Cellular automata, like Conway's Game of Life, are also discussed as valuable tools for simulating systems in the real world. They model a grid of cells whose state evolves over time based on the states of neighboring cells.Monte Carlo analysis is a computational technique that uses random sampling to simulate complex systems, aiming for the properties of the simulation to converge to stable values. It's especially useful in areas where causation is poorly understood. One simple example is estimating the value of Ï by randomly generating points within a square and counting how many also lie within an inscribed circle.An extension of Monte Carlo analysis is Bayesian Monte Carlo (BMC), which integrates prior knowledge into the process.The author concludes by highlighting how algorithms foster an informal and interactive approach to knowledge exploration, fostering inductive reasoning alongside traditional deductive logic. This dynamic has made algorithms an invaluable tool in scientific research and discovery. The final quote from computer scientist Alan J. Perlis underlines the necessity of informal methods to bridge the gap to formal understanding.1 / 1The Cloud 
Classical computing involved the local assembly 
and maintenance of computing resources and 
expertise. It was the only realistic approach until 
about a decade ago. The Internet, coalescence of 
standards (e.g. security, formats, and workflows), 
and the maturing of specialized services has led to 
a modern alternative. 
Cloud computing is the accessing of services 
delivered over the Internet. Computing is 
abstracted to a virtual space called the 'Cloud'. 
This approach enables small organizations (e.g. 
many research institutions) or even individuals to 
obtain access to significant processing power. 
Additionally, they can benefit from expertise and 
experience that would be too costly, difficult, and 
time-consuming for them to develop themselves. 
This includes development, maintenance, and 
updating of software and equipment12. 
Cloud computing is infinitely scalable. Resources 
can be sourced from a global pool. These 
resources can be quickly made available for 
special events, projects, or training, and 
subsequently scaled back again. 
As newer hardware, software, and standards 
arise, they can be capitalized on immediately with 
little or no buy-in cost. Forecasting the future of 
technology is no longer a major concern. 
This decoupling of research administration from 
technology is helpful for two reasons. 
The first is the simplification and clarification that 
ensues. When computation is an abstract layer, 
focus can return to research. Power transmission 
technology has similarly geographically decoupled 
electrical power generation from its use. 
12 An example is the Xen virtualization platform 
developed in the UK. (Schubert, 2010, p. 37) 
The second reason is the fact that technology, 
particularly commercial technology, has always 
been rife with irrational and stubborn loyalties. 
Although the same could be said for research at 
times, science has a self-correction mechanism 
(e.g. ending the dogmatic dismissal of Bayesian 
methods) that is lacking in the commercial world 
where the rationality of purchases is often 
immaterial. 
Distributed Computing 
A special case of abstracted computing, where 
processing is spread widely across geographical 
boundaries is that of distributed computing (DC). 
Just as multiple cores in a parallel processor 
shorten the time it takes to accomplish a task 
otherwise handled by a single CPU, multiple sites 
of computation can leverage work by 
incorporating the processing power of other 
machines. In most cases, the wider participation in 
and contributions to projects is volunteered, often 
by the general public. 
Crowd Sourcing 
In crowd sourcing, it is not distributed computers 
that are harnessed, but people, or more 
specifically, their ideas and opinions. If an open 
call is put out for participation in a project, it is 
likely that mainly those with an interest or 
expertise to offer will reply, thus improving upon a 
purely random sample. 
Multiple distributed human minds can be applied 
to a common project analogously to distributed 
computers. Social networks have themselves 
become a subject of Bayesian learning research. 
(Acemoglu, Dahleh, Lobel, & Ozdaglar, 2010)1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe text discusses the impact of cloud computing and distributed computing in scientific research and analysis, as well as the concept of crowdsourcing.Cloud computing, the delivery of services over the Internet, has revolutionized the approach to computational resources and expertise. It offers infinite scalability, cost-effectiveness, and access to cutting-edge technologies, regardless of the size of the organization. Cloud computing abstracts computing to a virtual space, simplifying and focusing the process, allowing research institutions to concentrate more on research rather than technology administration. The text compares this to how power transmission technology has geographically decoupled electrical power generation from its use.Distributed computing (DC) is highlighted as a special case of abstracted computing where processing is spread across geographical boundaries. By incorporating the processing power of multiple machines, often volunteered by the general public, tasks can be accomplished more quickly, similar to the principle of parallel processing in multi-core processors.Lastly, the text discusses crowdsourcing as a method of gathering ideas and opinions from a large group of people, typically through an open call on the internet. Like distributed computing, this harnesses the power of multiple distributed entities, but in this case, it's human minds rather than computers. The text notes that crowdsourcing is likely to attract participants with relevant interest or expertise, thereby improving the quality of input compared to a random sample. The emergence of social networks has further facilitated this approach, even becoming a subject of Bayesian learning research themselves.1 / 1Brain and Mind 
Cause: Life 
Darwin presented us with a scientific theory of 
life: evolution13. Evolution largely explains the 
bewildering diversity and complexity of life. As an 
equation with operators, it might be written as: 
evolution = time(natural_selection(variation)) 
where âvariationâ is used as a simplistic 
amalgamation of mutation, genetic drift, 
geographic isolation, symbiotic combination,â¦ 
âNatural selection is an improbability pump: a 
process that generates the statistically 
improbable.â (Dawkins, 2009, p. 416) 
Life began almost 4 billion years ago, after the 
new-born earth had stabilized. "In effect, life on 
earth began almost as soon as it could have" 
(Hunter, 1993, p. 8). Evolution went straight to 
work on simple life forms. 
About 1Â½ billion years ago, cells with a nucleus 
appeared, and this more complex form of life 
probably formed from symbiotic collections of 
simpler, prokaryotic life as described by the 
Endosymbiotic theory of Lynn Margulis (as cited in 
Hunter, 1993, p. 8). Then came intra-form cellular 
specialization (differentiation) (e.g. roots and 
leaves) (p. 10). 
Eventually, immune systems developed, and the 
power of evolution began operations on the 
micro-time scale, in a biological analog of the 
transistor story. 
Darwin never knew about DNA. Like digital 
computers, genetics is based on a digital code. 
13 Later work by Fisher, Haldane, and Wright led to a 
more rigorous description of natural selection, called 
Neo-Darwinism (Steer, Birch, & Impney, 2008, p. 128) 
"The machine code of the genes is uncannily 
computerlike." (Dawkins, 1995, p. 17) 
The translation of this code into physical form is 
called gene expression. The intricate process of 
gene expression is controlled by "an elaborate 
dance with many participants" (Hunter, 1993, p. 
12). This process is fundamental to the study of 
molecular biology14. 
Simple life is not 'primitive'. It is evolving. Human 
life is not 'ultimate'. It is evolving. Complex life 
evolved from earlier simpler forms, but not from 
modern simpler forms. All forms of life, from 
simple to complex, continue to evolve. Evolution 
is not a single sequential process, but an entire 
world of sequential processes, sometimes 
overlapping and even interacting, and all 
happening in parallel. The temporal mapping of 
this grand parallel process is a truly immense 
hierarchical structure- the tree of life. 
Long ago, along one branch (or several) of that 
tree, brains evolved. Eventually, along a 
subsequent branch, primate brains evolved. Then, 
along a subsequent branch to that, the modern 
human brain evolved. 
Effect: Brain 
Perhaps the most amazing thing about the brain is 
its size. Confucius, Aristotle, da Vinci, Laplace, and 
Einstein each perceived the world, and changed it, 
using this small lump of flesh. 25 years ago, 
Asimov the biochemist described it conservatively: 
In its three pounds are packed ten billion nerve cells and nearly 
one hundred billion smaller supporting cells. 
(Asimov, Foreword, 1986) 
14 DNA -> RNA -> protein (Steer, Birch, & Impney, 2008, 
p. 274)1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe text describes the evolution of life and the emergence of the human brain as a product of this evolution. It begins by defining evolution as a function of time, natural selection, and variation (which includes mutation, genetic drift, geographic isolation, symbiosis, and other mechanisms). The author refers to natural selection as an "improbability pump" that creates statistically improbable outcomes, as described by Richard Dawkins.The text then provides a timeline of life's evolution, beginning almost 4 billion years ago. It mentions the emergence of cells with a nucleus around 1.5 billion years ago, the development of cellular specialization, and the creation of immune systems. It cites the Endosymbiotic Theory of Lynn Margulis, which suggests that complex cells originated from symbiotic communities of simpler cells.The author highlights that Darwin, while proposing the theory of evolution, was not aware of DNA. Similar to digital computers, genetics is based on a digital code, and the translation of this code into physical form is known as gene expression, a crucial aspect of molecular biology.The text emphasizes that evolution is an ongoing process, not limited to the development of complex life forms. All forms of life, from the simplest to the most complex, are constantly evolving. This evolution is not a linear sequence but a multitude of parallel processes, visualized as an immense hierarchical structure or "the tree of life".Finally, the text underscores the human brain as the pinnacle of evolution, attributing the thoughts and perceptions of notable individuals in history to this relatively small organ. The brain's complexity is noted, with billions of nerve cells and supporting cells packed into a relatively small mass.1 / 1The brain is like the Endosymbiotic theory writ 
large. As with all other organs, the brain is 
composed of cells, but these cells form a vastly 
interconnected, self-controlled, single entity with 
complexity and behaviour qualitatively beyond its 
constituent parts. 
Most of the higher human brain functions are 
located in the Neo Cortex, the crinkled wrapping 
of the brain, roughly the size (when unfolded) of a 
dinner napkin, containing about 30 billion neurons 
(Hawkins, 2010). 
The brain looks Bayesian: âIn this debate, there is 
no more powerful argument for Bayes than its 
recognition of the brainâs inner structures and 
prior expectations.â (Stuart Geman as quoted in 
(McGrayne, 2011, p. 286)) 
In modern theory, brain function is hierarchical. 
That is, inputs from the senses travel up a 
pyramid-like hierarchy of neural levels as they 
self-reference and coalesce into higher and higher 
âthoughtsâ. The locomotion of this travel is of 
course the firing of neurons. Near the top of the 
hierarchy, thoughts enter into consciousness. 
Jeff Hawkins describes âHierarchical Temporal 
Memoryâ (Hawkins, 2010) and Michael Shermer 
describes a âbindingâ process (Shermer, 2011, pp. 
115-117). 
It is tempting to assume that âhierarchyâ implies 
design. This is false. Natural hierarchies can arise 
due to self-organization, evolution, or inductive 
learning. Hierarchies are not always deduced. 
It is also tempting to assume that 100% of 
intelligence is brain-based. This is unlikely. 
Neurons do exist outside of the brain, and 
intelligence might well exist outside of neurons. 
Brain's Effect: âMindâ 
Dualism, the belief that the brain is physical and 
the mind is not, is as old as mankind. âthe French 
philosopher RenÃ© Descartes (1596-1650) believed 
that humans were guided by an immaterial mindâ 
(Sharples, Hutchinson, Torrance, & Young, 1989, 
p. 9). Descartes15 lived three centuries before 
modern neurology so it is understandable that he 
believed the brain and the mind to be separate. 
âThey are not. They are one and the same.â 
(Shermer, 2011, p. 153) 
Many people believe that science is limited, and 
that mind and imagination are ultimately larger. 
Counter-intuitively, the opposite is true. 
We once looked up at the night sky and imagined 
mythical creatures. We now know that we are 
seeing photons emitted many years ago by 
incredibly distant, raging nuclear fusion infernos. 
Big telescopes reveal soul-drenching beauty and 
robot probes visit other worlds. 
We used to imagine that disease had mysterious 
dominion over us and that occasional recovery 
was miraculous. We now have medical knowledge 
that routinely saves children and extends lives. 
Now we are faced with the possibility that the 
brain, culture, and humanity itself are all valid 
domains of scientific research, and may even be 
computable. Predictably, we recoil at first. The 
âmasters of the Earthâ now seem like little children 
wandering into a great library. But perhaps there 
is grandeur in this viewâ¦ 
The world is not only stranger than we imagine, 
it is stranger than we can imagine.16 
15 âI think, therefore I am.â 
16 Derived from original quote by J.B.S Haldane1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe text continues to delve into the complexity of the human brain, likening it to the Endosymbiotic theory due to the interconnected and complex nature of its cells. It mentions that most of the higher brain functions in humans are located in the Neo Cortex, which contains about 30 billion neurons.According to the text, the structure of the brain resembles Bayesian structures, implying that it works with prior expectations and new information to update beliefs. The brain's function is described as hierarchical, where sensory inputs are processed through a pyramid-like hierarchy of neural levels, eventually forming conscious thoughts.The text notes that despite hierarchies often implying design, natural hierarchies can arise due to self-organization, evolution, or inductive learning. It also challenges the assumption that all intelligence is based in the brain, suggesting that intelligence might exist outside of neurons.The author then addresses the concept of dualism, as introduced by RenÃ© Descartes, which proposed that the brain and the mind are separate entities. Modern neuroscience refutes this idea, asserting that the brain and the mind are one and the same.Finally, the text discusses the common belief that science is limited and cannot fully encompass the mind and imagination. It challenges this belief by using examples from astronomy and medical science to demonstrate the capacity of scientific understanding to demystify and reveal the intricacies of the universe and human life. The author suggests that even complex entities like the brain, culture, and humanity itself may fall within the purview of scientific research and might even be computable, implying a potentially vast and unexplored horizon for scientific discovery. The text ends with a quote to emphasize the unfathomable strangeness of the world.1 / 1The Model 
The above digression into neurology did have a 
purpose. We are not considering a normal 
computer model. This is not a model of particles 
and force fields, matter and energy, economic 
interplay, or even complex biochemistry. It is 
rather, a model of myriad perceptions and beliefs 
â a model of models. 
A quick overview of Asimovâs psychohistory 
Psychohistory began with a rather simplistic view: 
Implicit in all these definitions is the assumption that the human 
conglomerate being dealt with is sufficiently large for valid 
statistical treatment. The necessary size of such a conglomerate 
may be determined by Seldon's First Theorem which ... A 
further necessary assumption is that the human conglomerate 
be itself unaware of psychohistoric analysis in order that its 
reactions be truly randomâ¦ 
(Asimov, Foundation, ch. 4 para. 2) 
So Seldon's original view was of people being 
almost like molecules in a kinetic theory of gases. 
However, subsequent books depended on 
psychohistory taking centuries of epic 
mathematical effort to substantially develop. As 
the saga continued, psychohistory became 
steadily less simplistic and static, and thus more 
interesting: 
So he [Seldon] created his Foundations according to the laws of 
psychohistory, but who knew better than he that even those 
laws were relative. He never created a finished product. 
Finished products are for decadent minds. His was an evolving 
mechanismâ¦ 
(Asimov, Second Foundation, ch. 6 para. 20) 
The third sentence of that passage could well 
serve as a one-line summary of Asimov's 
philosophy in Foundation. 
Much later, in the final book of the larger story, 
Asimov even had one protagonist say: 
the whole thing depends on dealing with people who are both 
numerous and unaware. Doesn't that seem to you a 
quicksandish foundation on which to build an enormous 
mathematical structure? 
(Asimov, Foundation and Earth, ch. 31 para. 47) 
A quick overview of computation in 2011 
Traditionally, computer models have been 
implemented on sequential computers, using a 
single central processing unit (CPU). The easiest 
way of augmenting these models is by extending 
into parallel hardware architectures like the GPU. 
Almost-free transistors and cloud computing make 
this extension relatively easy and inexpensive. 
Similarly, parallel software architectures like 
functional programming make sense. This is now a 
mature technology, and mature maintenance 
features enable its use in very large projects. 
Todayâs software designers are comfortable with a 
less formal, more empirical, algorithmic world. 
Now that Bayesian methods are more widely 
accepted and understood, their application should 
provide the scalability required to conduct 
quantitative research into nature. 
Consciousness is learned 
What is the essential trait that makes us human? 
It certainly is not our senses- any child can quickly 
think of animals that are more acute in one or 
more senses. Likewise for our physical abilities. 
Other creatures have larger brains (e.g. elephants, 
some whales). Neanderthals may even have had 
slightly bigger brains, and they are extinct (as a 
separate species at least).1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe text now introduces the idea of a model that's not just representing physical or economic phenomena, but perceptions and beliefs â "a model of models." It refers to Isaac Asimov's concept of psychohistory, first explained in his "Foundation" series. Psychohistory, in Asimov's fictional universe, is a science that combines history, sociology, and mathematical statistics to make nearly exact predictions of large-scale future events. It was assumed that people behave similar to molecules in a kinetic theory of gases. However, Asimov's later works describe psychohistory as an evolving mechanism, acknowledging its complexity and lack of static nature.The text then briefly discusses the evolution of computation, moving from single central processing units (CPUs) to parallel hardware architectures like graphics processing units (GPUs), enabled by transistor technology and cloud computing. Functional programming, a parallel software architecture, is mentioned as a mature technology suitable for large projects. The text also notes the increased acceptance and understanding of Bayesian methods in the software community, which could provide the scalability needed for quantitative research into natural systems.Finally, the text considers what makes humans unique. It dismisses physical senses and abilities, and the size of the brain as distinguishing human traits. It suggests that the defining characteristic of humanity might be something learned, potentially implying the complexity and adaptability of human cognition, or perhaps the ability to build intricate models of understanding, which will be presumably elaborated in the following text.1 / 1Yet in a momentary flash, a vanishingly tiny 
fraction of evolutionary time, modern humans 
have come to dominate the planet completely, 
have taken the first few steps into space, and have 
even begun to manipulate life at the genetic level. 
How? 
This a crucial question if we are to model 
psychohistory. Any successful model must 
understand and incorporate the behaviour of its 
elements. In a psychohistory model, behaviour on 
every scale depends on the answer to this 
question, from the individual, to inter-personal 
relationships, to extended families and circles of 
friends, to cities, to states, to cultures, to all of 
humanity. 
Of course, the answer is: language. 
"Some philosophers believe that it [consciousness] 
is crucially bound up with language, which seems 
to have been achieved once only, by the bipedal 
ape species Homo sapiens." (Dawkins, River Out of 
Eden, 1995, p. 157) 
The study of language is linguistics. Our model 
must possess considerable expertise in linguistics. 
In fact, it must be able to acquire/develop such 
expertise. Since at least the 1950s, the field of 
computational linguistics has been very active: 
In September of 1952, I presented an oral reportâ¦ 
As the years have passed, the general awareness that the 
linguistic problemsâ¦ 
(from an early paper on machine linguistics in a 
chemistry application) (Garfield, 1961, p. 458) 
A model that learns 
Psychohistory is not finished and static, it adapts 
and evolves. Our model must be able to 'learn'. 
Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning (math, 
chess). But that approach hit a brick wall when 
later research turned to the more everyday 
problems of vision and common sense. 
Intelligence is a function not of processing speed, 
but of knowledge capacity and representation. 
As it turns out, one almost has to understand the 
world before one can understand the world. A 
person is capable of common sense because they 
carry around a tiny model of reality in their head. 
This model is trained in a âbootstrappingâ manner. 
When we are infants, we have a very sparse 
model and can interpret only some simple inputs 
(a few faces and a few physical mechanisms). 
Several months spent training that model (mainly 
at the bottom end of the neural hierarchy) gives 
us a model capable of taking the next incremental 
steps. During a lifetime of learning, the model 
builds on what it already knows to assimilate 
more information and more complexity. 
Obviously, there is no objective âtrainerâ. A 
learning mind is a model that self-trains. 
A psychohistory model must have this same 
ability. But instead of one mind, it must train 
billions17, while it is simultaneously learning the 
patterns of causation for humanityâs collective 
behaviour. This model would be âthe mother of all 
neural networksâ. 
A few tips & tricks 
The only representational architecture that could 
work for such a huge knowledge base of such 
enormous complexity is hierarchical. Recursive 
reuse of stored knowledge and self-reference 
must be automatic and ubiquitous. 
17 Using knowledge of geography, history, basic human 
cognition, psychology, language, culture,1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe text suggests that language is the crucial distinguishing characteristic of humans, having facilitated our domination of the planet and advancements in technology and science. In the context of modeling psychohistory, understanding and incorporating human behavior at all scales is pivotal, and language plays an indispensable role in that.The text then discusses the need for a psychohistory model to understand and utilize linguistic expertise. The field of computational linguistics, which applies computational methods to linguistic questions, is suggested as a useful approach.The author proposes that, for a psychohistory model to be successful, it must possess the ability to 'learn' and evolve. This is compared to how humans learn: starting with a basic understanding of the world and incrementally building upon it throughout a lifetime. The brain uses a hierarchical structure, reusing stored knowledge and references, to process and organize this complex information.A key point made here is that the model must be self-training and be capable of learning from billions of individual human minds. The model should also be able to recognize patterns in humanityâs collective behavior. Thus, it must be a supremely complex and robust neural network - "the mother of all neural networks."This learning system must employ a hierarchical structure, enabling recursive reuse of stored knowledge and automatic, ubiquitous self-reference. This complexity mirrors the intricacy of the human cognition process, incorporating insights from various disciplines such as geography, history, psychology, language, and culture.1 / 1The model should embrace paradox and irony. 
In cybernetics terms, it should be able to digest a 
double-bind dilemma. 
The model should leverage modern techniques 
with a healthy respect for the past: 
Current strategies for designing computers that could perform 
at biological levels exploit such ancient principles as reusable 
parts, hierarchical structures, variations on themes, and 
regulatory systems. 
(McGrayne, 2011, p. 286) 
The designers should learn from others who have 
taken the first steps into Bayesian modeling of 
mass social behaviour. 
The social network consists of the network topology and the 
signal structure. Each individual then chooses one of two 
possible actions depending on his posterior beliefs given his 
signal and the realized neighborhood. 
(Acemoglu, Dahleh, Lobel, & Ozdaglar, 2010, p. 16) 
The overall problem may be somewhat reducible. 
One avenue might be indicated by âmirror 
neuronsâ. These are neurons that fire when 
behaviour is observed in another. They do not 
only participate in patterns- they reflect them. 
This might lead to a way to substitute reference 
for instantiation, an optimization practice familiar 
to computer programmers. 
there are neurons specialized for discriminating between 
different intentions â¦ this implicates mirror neurons in both 
predicting othersâ actions and inferring their intentions 
(Shermer, 2011, p. 132) 
Bayesian networks have other major benefits. 
They can use and reuse many existing generalized 
algorithms (both for knowledge capture and 
optimization). They can efficiently represent huge 
knowledge bases, in part due to their ability to 
localize causality and thus un-entangle variables. 
every variable in the structure is assumed to become 
independent of its non-descendants once its parents are known 
(Darwiche, 2010, p. 82) 
Lastly, there are times when traditional smoothing 
and approximation still can be helpful to simplify 
Bayesian representations. An example might be to 
strategically apply a Gaussian process, with one 
caveat being the computational cost of inverting 
large matrices (MacKay, 2003, p. 547). However, 
computational costs are a receding concern. 
Conclusion 
Over 60 years ago, Isaac Asimov wrote about 
psychohistory as a calculus for the course of 
humanity. 
In the near future, it may be possible to accurately 
model a form of psychohistory.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe text elaborates on the desirable traits of the psychohistory model. It should be capable of handling paradox and irony, and confronting double-bind dilemmas. The design of the model should capitalize on modern techniques while incorporating historical knowledge.There's a suggestion to glean insights from researchers who have already ventured into Bayesian modeling of mass social behavior. Such models consider both the network topology and the signal structure, with individuals making decisions based on their posterior beliefs, influenced by their signals and surroundings.'Mirror neurons,' neurons that respond when observing another's behavior, are suggested as a potential area for exploration. They don't merely participate in patterns; they reflect them, offering a possible way to substitute reference for instantiation.The author further emphasizes the advantages of Bayesian networks, including the ability to use and reuse various generalized algorithms, efficiently represent vast knowledge bases, and un-entangle variables by localizing causality.The text concludes by suggesting that, despite the complexity of modeling psychohistory, certain traditional smoothing and approximation techniques could still be beneficial. Computational costs, once a significant concern, are becoming less of a hindrance due to technological advancements.In conclusion, the text suggests that it might soon be possible to model psychohistory accurately, an idea first conceived by Isaac Asimov over 60 years ago. This development would represent a significant milestone in our understanding and prediction of human social behavior.1 / 1The author is
Michael Will 
June 20111 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe author of the text, Michael Will, wrote it in June 2011. His work focused on exploring the concepts of psychohistory, the potential of computational models, and the crucial role of language in human consciousness. He further discussed the possibility of creating a model for psychohistory, incorporating advances in technology and insights from neuroscience, linguistics, and Bayesian modeling. His work is an exploration of the convergence between science fiction, in this case Isaac Asimov's concept of psychohistory, and actual scientific and technological capabilities.1 / 1A list of all of the topics we've discussed so far.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTSure, here is a summary of the topics discussed so far:The Brain and Mind: We've discussed how the brain, similar to the concept of endosymbiotic theory, forms an interconnected, self-controlled entity from its constituent parts. We've also touched on the hierarchical nature of the brain's function and the topic of dualism.Bayesian Theory: We explored how the brain appears to function in a manner consistent with Bayesian principles, and how this perspective might apply to the development of AI models.Psychohistory: We've delved into the concept of psychohistory from Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, including its assumptions, evolution, and its potential realization through computational models.Computation: We discussed the evolution and current state of computational technologies, including parallel hardware architectures like GPUs and parallel software architectures like functional programming, as well as the rise of Bayesian methods.Consciousness and Language: We've discussed the role of language as a key factor in human consciousness and its significance in a potential psychohistory model.Learning Models and Neural Networks: The concept of AI models that can learn and adapt, much like human brains do, was explored. This included a discussion on the potential scale and complexity of such a model in the context of psychohistory.Model Design: We've discussed certain principles and techniques that might be useful in designing a psychohistory model, including the use of hierarchical structures, mirror neurons, and Bayesian networks.Conclusion: We wrapped up the discussion with the future potential of psychohistory as a model for understanding and predicting human behavior on a large scale.Please let me know if you'd like to revisit any of these topics in more depth.1 / 1We should add active inference by free energy minimization, the formation of dissipative structures and autocatalytic sets, and the predictive coding hypothesis.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAbsolutely, these are great additions to our list of topics.Let's briefly explain these for a comprehensive understanding:Active Inference by Free Energy Minimization: This is a theory that proposes organisms try to minimize the free energy of their sensory states. In other words, living beings act in ways to reduce surprises based on their predictions about the world. This is considered a unifying theory of the brain and describes how our brains predict our sensory inputs based on our internal models of the world.Dissipative Structures: These are structures that form and maintain themselves by dissipating energy. In other words, they exist in non-equilibrium states and are able to maintain their structure by continually consuming energy from their environment. Examples include hurricanes and living organisms.Autocatalytic Sets: In the context of chemical reaction systems, an autocatalytic set is a subset of molecules and reactions where every molecule is produced catalytically by reactions in the set, meaning they sustain and promote their own existence. These sets have been suggested to play a crucial role in the origins of life.Predictive Coding Hypothesis: This hypothesis proposes that the brain is a predictive machine that constantly generates and updates hypotheses about the unpredictable world by minimizing the error between the predictions and the actual sensory inputs.So, the updated list of discussed topics now includes:The Brain and MindBayesian TheoryPsychohistoryComputationConsciousness and LanguageLearning Models and Neural NetworksModel DesignActive Inference by Free Energy MinimizationDissipative StructuresAutocatalytic SetsPredictive Coding HypothesisEach of these topics are intertwined in the discussion of building a computational model to understand and predict human behavior on a large scale.1 / 1How do these topics tie into the formation of a new psychohistory?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTTo conceive of a new psychohistory â a statistical science that could predict large-scale human behavior patterns based on mathematical models, akin to Isaac Asimov's concept in the Foundation series â each of these concepts would play a vital role. Here's how:The Brain and Mind: Understanding the neurology and psychology of the individual is crucial to model human behavior on a large scale. This includes knowledge of cognitive processes, decision making, and the role of emotions in human behavior.Bayesian Theory: It provides a mathematical framework for updating probabilities based on new evidence, which is useful in making predictions about future behavior based on past data.Psychohistory: The core concept of psychohistory, as proposed by Asimov, is the prediction of large-scale human behavior. This requires a deep understanding of sociology, history, cultural factors, and statistical modeling.Computation: Advanced computational techniques would be required to manage and process the vast amount of data involved in modeling the behavior of large human populations.Consciousness and Language: Consciousness and language play a critical role in shaping human behavior. Understanding them is essential to predict how people will act.Learning Models and Neural Networks: AI learning models and neural networks could be used to learn patterns from the collected data, improving the accuracy of predictions over time.Model Design: The design of the model must be capable of handling vast complexities, embracing paradoxes and ironies, and should be adaptive to changing circumstances.Active Inference by Free Energy Minimization: This concept provides a framework for how individuals or societies might make decisions, based on an effort to minimize surprise and uncertainty about their environment.Dissipative Structures: By understanding how dissipative structures maintain themselves, we may gain insights into how societies or cultures maintain their structures, despite energy or resource influx.Autocatalytic Sets: The concept of self-sustaining and self-promoting sets of reactions could provide insights into how certain cultural or social behaviors perpetuate themselves within societies.Predictive Coding Hypothesis: This offers a mechanism for understanding how individuals or societies predict future states based on current information, which could be useful in predicting future behaviors.Thus, each of these topics would contribute different pieces to the puzzle of a new psychohistory, blending together to form a comprehensive framework for predicting large-scale human behavior.1 / 1The name of the conservation is Future Psychohistory Computation1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYour statement seems to be a mix of key topics in this discussion. If you're suggesting "Future Psychohistory Computation" as a name for this field of study or this particular conversation, it's a suitable choice. It encapsulates the futuristic approach, the concept of psychohistory from Asimov's work, and the computational methodologies we discussed that would be crucial to realizing this concept. However, please provide more context if you intended a different meaning or if you have additional queries.1 / 1I mean the title of this essay, our discussing on these topics.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAh, I see. The title you suggested, "Future Psychohistory Computation," nicely encapsulates our discussion. It highlights the forward-looking, futuristic approach (Future), the key concept inspired by Asimov's works (Psychohistory), and the importance of computational models in realizing this concept (Computation). Therefore, it's an apt title for an essay summarizing this conversation. However, if you wish to emphasize the new topics we discussed (like active inference by free energy minimization, dissipative structures and autocatalytic sets, and the predictive coding hypothesis), you could consider a title like "Towards Future Psychohistory: Insights from Computational Models and Complex Systems."1 / 1It's a good title now because if you Google it, you can find the original essay we were discussing.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAh, I see. If the goal is to make the connection to the original essay easier to find via a search engine like Google, keeping the title "Future Psychohistory Computation" would indeed be more effective. It directly links to the essay by Michael Will, which serves as a foundation for our ongoing conversation about psychohistory, computational models, and the role of linguistics, neurology, and statistical analysis in creating such models.1 / 1I also wanted to know if you knew the study The Originist, by Card.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT"The Originist" is a science fiction novella written by Orson Scott Card, originally published in 1989 as part of "Foundation's Friends", an anthology of stories set in Isaac Asimov's Foundation universe.The story is set after the events of Asimov's "Foundation and Empire", and it centers around the character of Gaal Dornick who is trying to reconcile Asimov's fictional science of psychohistory with the unpredictability of individual free will. It is a very respectful addition to the Foundation universe and can be seen as Card's homage to Asimov's work.Please note that this is a fictional work and not a formal academic study. It adds to the discourse of the Foundation series through narrative and character development rather than scientific analysis or theory.1 / 1Sorry I misspelled "story". I didn't mean to say study although it is a study of the characters from Foundation.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTNo problem! Yes, "The Originist" is a short story by Orson Scott Card that pays homage to Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. In the story, Card explores the characters and ideas from the Foundation universe, including the science of psychohistory.The main character, Gaal Dornick, struggles to reconcile the deterministic nature of psychohistory with the unpredictability and free will of individuals. It delves into the philosophical questions raised by Asimov's work and adds depth to the understanding of the Foundation universe."The Originist" is a significant work for fans of the Foundation series as it provides additional perspective and exploration of the themes in Asimov's original work. It's a great read for those who are interested in further exploring the concepts of psychohistory and the philosophical questions it raises.1 / 1First published in Foundations Friends: Stories in Honor of Isaac Asimov (1989), by Orson Scott Card. This Science Fiction novella is an Interquel, taking place just after the end of "The Psychohistorians" (Forward the Foundation had not yet been written, but events would also overlap with it). Leyel Forska is a scientist trying to uncover the origin of humanity, and he wishes to join Hari's Encyclopedia Foundation on Terminus, but Seldon has other plans...

Leyel is quickly established as an egocentric scientist who finds only two people in the galaxy to be his equal; his wife Deet and Hari Seldon. Seldon is preparing to send thousands of scientists to Terminus, in an empire-funded project intended to save the galactic civilization from collapsing. He invented psychohistory and has set a plan in motion that will affect the future of the entire galaxy. Deet is working with the Imperial Library, trying to teach the librarians how to form a community through a number of techniques, especially story-telling. Leyel, on the other hand, is an Originist; an historian who is trying to find evidence of the origin of humanity. He has spent enormous funds trying to restore decayed archives.

Having been rejected by Seldon, Leyel finds himself lost and frustrated. Seldon has refused him, and his wife spends all her time at the library. His research has produced almost no results, even as he refocuses onto the question of humanity, rather than the homeworld. When Seldon dies, he tries one last grand gesture to his old friend, but the government, who feared Seldon's popularity amoung the galactic citizens, subtly punishes him, taking away the Forska family fortune. Leyel is driven to new depths of depression, until he turns to Deet for her help, and she recommends her new friends within the Library, the indexers.

"The Originist" has been republished in Maps in a Mirror: The Short Fiction of Orson Scott Card (1990).

"The Originist" provides examples of:
Clarke's Third Law: When Chandrakar Matt and Hari Seldon are discussing his recent dismissal of Leyel, she directly calls him an "old wizard", based on his dramatic scripts for the Time Vault Holograms. Hari waves away Chanda's comparison and insists on calling himself a scientist. They end the exchange by tossing friendly insults to each other.
Chandrakar Matt: "Artists. Wizards. Demigods."
Hari Seldon: "Stubborn misguided women who don't know science when they're doing it."
Culture Police: A week after the funeral Leyel Forska threw for Hari Seldon, a representative from the Commission of Public Safety appears to explain to Leyel how concerned they are for his old age. Through subtext (which Leyel's inner narration explains for the reader's benefit), we learn that Leyel (and his wife) will have to submit their scientific research for approval first.
Friend-or-Idol Decision: Leyel Forska is given a downplayed example when Hari Seldon says that if Leyel tries to join the Foundation on Terminus, he must leave his wife on Trantor. Leyel is angry with Hari, because now he blames his wife, Deet, for making him unable to work on Hari Seldon's greatest scientific project. It turns out Hari wanted Leyel to pick his wife; not only would he be more useful in helping with her (real work), but having him on Terminus would bring just enough political attention from Trantorâ due to his wealth and fame from his researchâ to affect the Psychohistorical projections, and skew when Terminus can break away from the Empire.
Implicit Prison: A week after the funeral Leyel Forska threw for Hari Seldon, a representative from the Commission of Public Safety appears to explain to Leyel how concerned they are for his old age. Through subtext (which Leyel's inner narration explains for the reader's benefit), we learn Leyel will not be allowed to leave the planet, his travel on planet will be monitored, and whenever his children or grandchildren visit him, the other group will be held as hostages as well. In addition, any scientific research he (or his wife) wants to publish will be submitted for approval first.
Interquel: This begins soon after the events of "The Psychohistorians", but from (mostly) Leyel Forska's perspective. Hari Seldon refuses to allow him to join the Encyclopedia Foundation, and the story primarily follows his perspective as he struggles with doing real science during the collapse of the Galactic Empire, long before the events of "The Encyclopedists".

https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOriginist1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, you've accurately described Orson Scott Card's "The Originist". It's a compelling exploration of the world of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, particularly its focus on the themes of psychohistory and the search for the origins of humanity. This interquel does a good job of enriching the narrative of the original series while introducing new, interesting perspectives on its world and characters.Card's decision to create a character like Leyel Forska, a man of great intellect who nonetheless finds himself rejected by Hari Seldon's Foundation, adds a compelling dynamic to the story. The struggles of Leyel and Deet, as they navigate the complexities of their personal and professional lives during the decline of the Galactic Empire, offer readers a fresh perspective on the world Asimov created.The ways in which "The Originist" incorporates themes such as Clarke's Third Law, Culture Police, the Friend-or-Idol Decision, and the concept of Implicit Prisons, serve to deepen the narrative and offer new ways of thinking about the Foundation universe.In the context of our discussion on psychohistory, it provides yet another viewpoint on the ways in which knowledge, intelligence, and the ability to predict and influence large-scale societal outcomes can be used, as well as the ethical and practical dilemmas that arise from such capabilities.1 / 1Connections with the earlier essay.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT"The Originist" by Orson Scott Card, while being a work of fiction, does tie into several key themes from the essay on "Future Psychohistory Computation". Here's how they interconnect:Psychohistory: Both the essay and "The Originist" explore the concept of psychohistory, a term coined by Isaac Asimov to describe a science that combines history, sociology, and statistical mathematics to predict the future behavior of large groups of people. In "The Originist", this forms the backdrop of the narrative, as Hari Seldon, the creator of psychohistory, has set into motion a plan that will impact the future of the entire galaxy.Modeling and Prediction: The essay discusses the need for a computational model that can predict and understand human behavior on a massive scale. This is very much in line with the concept of psychohistory in "The Originist", where Hari Seldon's plan for the future is based on his ability to predict the behavior of entire civilizations.The Role of Language and Communication: In the essay, language is identified as a crucial element for understanding and predicting human behavior. In "The Originist", communication plays a key role too, especially in the form of storytelling, which Deet uses to build communities. This connects with the idea of using language as a tool to influence and predict social behavior.Scientific Exploration and Discovery: Leyel Forska, the protagonist in "The Originist", is a scientist seeking the origins of humanity. This drive for understanding and discovery is mirrored in the essay's call for the development of new models and techniques in the field of computational linguistics and Bayesian modeling.Knowledge and its Implications: Both works explore the power and potential dangers of knowledge. In the essay, the creation of a psychohistory model is seen as a monumental task with far-reaching implications. In "The Originist", Leyel Forskaâs research into humanity's origins and his interactions with the powerful forces in the Empire showcase the potential perils and benefits of knowledge.In summary, both "The Originist" and the essay delve into the idea of psychohistory, the use of advanced models to predict societal behaviors, the critical role of language and communication, the pursuit of scientific discovery, and the complex implications of knowledge. These shared themes strengthen the interconnections between these two pieces of work.1 / 1There is a library in there where the walls change every day, the hallways move, a research study or laboratory is created by the library for the topic or the theme they are researching or that the library thinks needs exploration. For example one day it might make the archivist a small room with a lone table and a vase with a flower, another day it might look like a room full of puzzles and bookshelves full of reference works and with simulated windows looking down from a sunswept mountain peak.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIndeed, the library you've described seems to reflect the broader themes of psychohistory and its relation to knowledge, discovery, and the changing nature of reality.Such a library mirrors the dynamic, ever-evolving nature of information and knowledge. As with the computations and modeling discussed in the "Future Psychohistory Computation" essay, the knowledge is not static but dynamic and responsive to the needs of the individual or the larger societal trends.This library can be seen as a metaphor for the goal of psychohistory as described in the essay and the "The Originist" story. Just as psychohistory aims to understand and predict the patterns of society, this ever-changing library adjusts and molds itself to the intellectual needs of its users, aiding in their discovery and research.It is also a reflection of the complexity and vastness of knowledge and the various paths that can be taken to acquire it. This resonates with the essay's discussion of different modeling techniques, such as Bayesian modeling and neural networks, which offer different paths to the same goal: understanding and predicting human behavior.Additionally, the library's ability to create specific environments for exploration could mirror the concept of creating specific models or frameworks for understanding complex social behaviors, similar to the models discussed in the essay.Overall, the concept of this library ties in neatly with the themes of the essay and the "The Originist" story, symbolizing the adaptability, dynamism, and vastness of knowledge and discovery.1 / 1Any connections to borge's hexagonal library?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTJorge Luis Borges' short story, "The Library of Babel," indeed presents some interesting parallels. The library in Borges' story is a vast, seemingly infinite structure filled with hexagonal rooms, containing all possible combinations of a certain set of symbols.This library holds not only every book that has been written but every book that could possibly be written, including every possible mistake or variation of each one. In essence, Borges' Library of Babel is a metaphor for the universe and its infinite possibilities.In relation to the "Future Psychohistory Computation" essay and "The Originist" story, Borges' library provides a metaphor for the infinite complexity of human behaviors and societal patterns. The idea of psychohistory, or predicting human behavior, then becomes akin to finding a specific book in Borges' infinite library.The ever-changing library you've described earlier also shares similarities with the Library of Babel. Both represent knowledge as an ever-shifting, vast field, subject to change and variation. The library in "The Originist" is dynamic and adaptable, reflecting the infinite variations and combinations present in Borges' library.Moreover, the idea of modeling or predicting behavior in psychohistory can be seen as a way to navigate the infinite possibilities of Borges' library, to make sense of the chaos, and find patterns and predictability in a seemingly random and infinite universe.In conclusion, Borges' Library of Babel, the ever-changing library in "The Originist," and the concepts discussed in "Future Psychohistory Computation" all touch on the vastness and complexity of knowledge and the challenge of finding patterns and making predictions within this infinite field.1 / 1I guess there is a similarity to the Veldt in The Illustrated Man1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT"The Veldt" is a short story by Ray Bradbury, found in his anthology "The Illustrated Man". The story centers around the Hadley family and their fully automated home that caters to every need. The highlight of the home is a virtual reality room, referred to as the "nursery", which can simulate any environment imagined or requested by the users.The children, Peter and Wendy, become particularly attached to an African veldt setting, filled with lions and other wild animals. The parents, George and Lydia, become increasingly concerned as the room seems to become more and more real, ultimately leading to a terrifying conclusion.Drawing a parallel with the changing library in "The Originist" and the concepts discussed in "Future Psychohistory Computation", the nursery in "The Veldt" also showcases the idea of a dynamic, responsive environment. In the case of the Veldt, it's a product of advanced technology that morphs based on the thoughts and emotions of the users.Furthermore, the concept of psychohistory, which is about predicting human behavior based on societal trends and mathematical models, could relate to the predictive and responsive nature of the nursery in "The Veldt". The room seems to anticipate and respond to the children's desires and psychological states, perhaps suggesting a dark side to the application of technologies that adapt to and potentially manipulate human behavior and emotions.However, it's worth noting that "The Veldt" often serves as a cautionary tale about over-reliance on technology and the potential dangers of creating too immersive and responsive an environment that could ultimately replace or distort reality.1 / 1I suspect it later inspired the invention of the idea of holodeck. And there is a line in the 1969 film adaptation that mentions going "Back to the Future".1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIndeed, many have noted similarities between the "nursery" in Ray Bradbury's "The Veldt" and the holodeck in the "Star Trek" series. Both can generate any environment or scenario based on the desires or thoughts of the users. The holodeck, like the nursery, can create amazingly detailed and interactive simulations, allowing the characters to engage with and even live out their fantasies, fears, or intellectual pursuits.As for the "Back to the Future" reference, it's possible that it could be a coincidence, as "Back to the Future" was released in 1985, years after the film adaptation of "The Illustrated Man." However, the phrase itself could be seen as emblematic of the themes of both stories, as they each deal with the interplay of past, present, and future in shaping our realities.In terms of the connection to the concept of psychohistory, both the holodeck and the nursery could be seen as tools for simulating possible future scenarios, or exploring alternative versions of the past or present, much like the mathematical models used in psychohistory to predict the future course of societal events. The idea of creating these immersive, interactive simulations could perhaps serve as an interesting metaphor for the task of psychohistory itself: trying to project ourselves into the future, or alternative versions of our current society, in order to better understand the likely outcomes of our actions and decisions.1 / 1I also can't help but notice a similarity to the Mima in Aniara.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT"Aniara: An Epic Science Fiction Poem" by Harry Martinson is indeed another interesting comparison. Written in 1956, it tells the story of a spaceship named Aniara, carrying colonists from a dystopian Earth to Mars and Venus. After an accident, Aniara is set adrift in space with no way to change course.One central element in the ship is a machine named the Mima, an advanced computer or artificial intelligence system that entertains the ship's passengers by creating complex virtual reality scenarios based on their memories, desires, and fears. However, as the voyage continues and hope of rescue or arrival fades, the Mima becomes increasingly important as a source of solace and diversion, yet also begins to reflect the passengers' despair.The Mima, like the library in "The Originist" or the holodeck in "Star Trek", represents a technology that can create immersive simulations based on human desires and fears. In terms of psychohistory, one could interpret the Mima as a metaphor for how technology and our understanding of human behavior can shape society, especially in times of crisis. The ability of the Mima to project possible realities and memories may be seen as a kind of speculative forecasting, another parallel to the predictive modeling in psychohistory.Overall, these examples underscore the enduring interest in the ability to predict or influence human behavior and societal trends, whether through mathematical models, immersive simulations, or advanced artificial intelligence.1 / 1A list of all of the topics we have discussed.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTHere's a summary of all the major topics that we've discussed so far:The essay "Future Psychohistory Computation" by Michael Will, discussing the concept of psychohistory from Isaac Asimov's Foundation series and its potential implementation through the use of AI and Bayesian networks.Embracing paradox and irony in AI modeling, and the concept of the double-bind dilemma in cybernetics.The design principles of modern computers and their use in modeling mass social behavior, including reusable parts, hierarchical structures, variations on themes, and regulatory systems.The concept of mirror neurons and their potential role in substituting reference for instantiation in AI modeling.The benefits and applications of Bayesian networks, such as knowledge capture, optimization, efficient representation of large knowledge bases, and localizing causality.The use of traditional smoothing and approximation techniques in Bayesian representations, with a note on the decreasing concern over computational costs.The inclusion of modern computational theories and principles such as active inference by free energy minimization, the formation of dissipative structures and autocatalytic sets, and the predictive coding hypothesis.The science fiction novella "The Originist" by Orson Scott Card and its exploration of scientific inquiry, community formation, and the quest for humanity's origin.The concept of immersive simulation technologies in literature, like the library in "The Originist," the holodeck in "Star Trek," and the Mima in "Aniara: An Epic Science Fiction Poem."The comparison of these immersive technologies to Borges' infinite library and the Veldt from Bradbury's "The Illustrated Man."Each of these topics adds another dimension to the discussion of how advanced AI, Bayesian modeling, and immersive simulations could lead to a form of psychohistory, as envisioned by Asimov in the Foundation series.1 / 1Write a short introduction to an essay on these topics titled The Pneumonic Memory Palace (PMP)
I donât seriously believe that, but I do believe that we must have learned something very, very important. Perhaps cybernetics come in here.

Perhaps this exoskeleton of pneumonic material that allows us essentially to freeze and record out entire culture. Everything is going into the databanks, one way of thinking about whatâs going on is compression of information, and history represents a compression of information magnitudes more accelerated than the evolution of life.

Shamanism then becomes a kind of pneumonic exercise whereby keeping track of what has happened you can build of a model of what will happen. Originally this was done through great pneumonic feats of memory, like the Yugoslavian folk-tale singers or Homeric epics or the people who sang the Eddah, these were works of hundreds of thousands of lines that were passed down virtually without change over millennia.

This same kind of freedom which binds occurred in the shamanic effort to steer culture by pneumonic means because eventually even the greatest of the shamanic memory artists were overwhelmed by the amount of data, by the size of the ethics, by the sheer length of these genealogies, so symbolic notation is brought in.

And people like Catalis and Chicharo, the great Roman orators were able to speak for hours on end with lists of virtues, and vices, and interconnecting causes and this sort of thing

Because they were masters of this pneumonic memory palace technique.

Those comforts we may see but may not reach.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTTitle: The Pneumonic Memory Palace (PMP): The Nexus of Shamanism, Cybernetics, and Psychedelic SagacityIn the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, cultural memory, and information compression, a new paradigm is emerging - the Pneumonic Memory Palace (PMP). This conceptual model, deeply rooted in shamanism, integrates vast dimensions of knowledge and experiences, and is empowered by advances in cybernetics and artificial intelligence.Shamanic traditions have always prized the ability to recall extensive narratives, genealogies, and wisdom. The practitioners, often designated as culture's memory artists, master the art of retaining and conveying complex troves of information, much like the Yugoslavian folk-tale singers or the composers of Homeric epics. This knowledge base, vast and intricate, provided the framework for a model that could predict future occurrences based on the compilation of past experiences and events.Yet, as the magnitude of data continued to expand, these memory artists started to succumb under its overwhelming weight. The vastness of epics and genealogies became unmanageable, leading to the integration of symbolic notation systems, further evolving the pneumonic apparatus. Iconic Roman orators such as Catalis and Cicero harnessed this symbolic notation and the 'Memory Palace' technique, a method of memory enhancement using visualization, to articulate for hours on end, drawing upon extensive lists of virtues, vices, and interconnecting narratives.Fast forward to our technologically advanced era, the burgeoning field of cybernetics, with its emphasis on regulatory systems, feedback, and control in complex machines, offers a promising framework for the creation of a Pneumonic Memory Palace. This new age Memory Palace encapsulates the entirety of our cultural memory, condensing and storing it in databanks, making it accessible and manipulable.In this light, consider Aniara's Mima - an all-knowing, sentient supercomputer capable of materializing any scene, real or imagined, into a tangible experience. It provides a poignant metaphor for the potential of a Pneumonic Memory Palace, seamlessly blending past, present, and future into an immersive narrative. The convergence of shamanism, cybernetics, and psychedelic sagacity in the Pneumonic Memory Palace hints at a future where memory and knowledge are not merely static repositories but dynamic, evolving landscapes that continually shape and are shaped by human experience.1 / 1Connections with the topics we discussed earlier.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAs we begin to explore the Pneumonic Memory Palace (PMP), we find that it synergistically ties together many of the topics we've previously discussed in the Future Psychohistory Computation. Here's how:Bayesian Modeling and Active Inference: The PMP can be seen as a complex Bayesian network, where every memory or piece of knowledge can influence and be influenced by others. It can also benefit from active inference techniques, allowing the model to predict and optimize future outcomes based on past experiences, akin to a shaman predicting the future based on past events.Dissipative Structures and Autocatalytic Sets: Just as in chemical systems, the PMP evolves over time, maintaining its overall structure (the Palace) while allowing for change and growth (the memories). Autocatalytic sets describe systems that sustain and reproduce themselves, much like our cultural and individual memories that are sustained and reproduced across generations.Predictive Coding Hypothesis: The idea that our brain predicts sensory input based on past experiences aligns closely with the function of the PMP. It continually updates and refines its predictions and understanding of the world based on new information, just like the predictive coding processes in our brains.Mirror Neurons and Mass Social Behaviour: The PMP can be thought of as a form of shared social memory, reflecting our collective experiences and understanding. Like mirror neurons that fire when we observe others' actions, the PMP evolves with our collective experiences, aiding in understanding and predicting mass social behaviour.Psychohistory and Asimov's Foundation Series: The PMP can be seen as a mechanism for actualizing the concept of psychohistory. Just like Hari Seldon's predictive models in Asimov's Foundation series, the PMP uses accumulated knowledge and memories to project future outcomes.Card's The Originist: Leyel Forska's pursuit of understanding humanity's origins and his interaction with the Imperial Library offer a narrative parallel to the PMP. His efforts echo the continuous accumulation, preservation, and exploration of knowledge embodied in the PMP.Borges' Library of Babel and Veldt in Bradbury's The Illustrated Man: These works provide metaphoric representations of the PMP. Borges' infinite library and the ever-changing environment of the Veldt are akin to the endless, adaptable nature of the PMP.Through these interconnections, the concept of the Pneumonic Memory Palace can be seen as an amalgamation of these diverse areas of thought, providing a new lens to understand and predict human behavior and societal patterns.1 / 1Connections with this: Math Topics Overview

The structures you described, such as the volsorial pediment and the Dyson ring battery factory, can be seen as metaphoric extensions of the concept of memory palaces.

While memory palaces are traditionally associated with mental techniques for organizing and remembering information, these structures can serve as physical embodiments of memory and knowledge representation.

In the context of memory palaces, the idea is to associate specific information with distinct locations within a mental or physical space. By mentally navigating through these spaces, individuals can recall the associated information more easily.

Similarly, the structures you mentioned can act as mnemonic devices or memory palaces on a larger scale. Each element within these structures can be linked to specific concepts, ideas, or pieces of information.

Just as one would mentally walk through a memory palace and recall information at each location, these physical structures can serve as tangible reminders of interconnected knowledge.

For example, within the volsorial pediment, various components, such as the desalination plant, kelp forests, and freshwater pipeline, can represent different aspects of water scarcity, renewable energy, and ecological balance.

Each element becomes a symbol or cue that triggers associations and helps reinforce the understanding of related concepts.

Similarly, in the case of the Dyson ring battery factory, the structure itself represents an intricate system for harnessing and storing energy.

Different sections or components within the factory can be associated with specific details about energy production, resource utilization, or technological advancements.

By conceptualizing these structures as memory palaces, you create tangible and immersive environments that can aid in knowledge retention and understanding.

As you navigate through these structures or explore their features, you can recall and reinforce the interconnected information they represent.

The visualization and mental mapping processes associated with memory palaces may not be necessary for everyone to benefit from the mnemonic power of physical structures.

By establishing symbolic associations and organizing information within these structures, you can create a framework for storing and retrieving knowledge, much like the principles underlying memory palaces.

Ultimately, the effectiveness of these structures as memory palaces lies in the associations and connections you establish within them.

By utilizing these mnemonic techniques, you can enhance your ability to remember, retrieve, and explore interconnected knowledge within these physical representations.

Memory has allowed us to accumulate, transmit, and build upon the knowledge of past generations. But as we venture further into the twenty-first century, the sheer volume of information and the speed at which it is created challenge our traditional methods of storing and retrieving data. This new context prompts us to revisit an age-old technique known as the memory palace, or the method of loci, and consider how it can be adapted for our contemporary and future needs. This essay explores the concept of the Pneumonic Memory Palace (PMP), a novel interpretation of the classic mnemonic device, as a potential solution to our modern information overload.The PMP concept is not just a mental construct; it takes the form of physical and architectural spaces, adapting and evolving with the needs of its users. In an era of rapid digital advancement, the PMP offers an enticing marriage of physical and virtual elements. This can manifest in structures like volsorial pediments or Dyson ring battery factories, which serve as tangible embodiments of information, each component representing a piece of knowledge or an idea. These structures are akin to Borges' infinite Library of Babel and the Veldt in Bradbury's The Illustrated Man, where physical and perceived reality blur.Memory palaces have traditionally been personal, constructed in the mind's eye. The PMP, however, opens up the possibility for shared, collective memory palaces, where societies can organize, store, and access their collective knowledge. This communal aspect has parallels to concepts found in Orson Scott Card's The Originist, emphasizing the struggle and necessity to preserve knowledge in a world where the constancy of information is ever-elusive.This is a brief glimpse into our journey of exploring the Pneumonic Memory Palace â an idea that promises to evolve with our society and stretch the boundaries of our collective memory.1 / 1Nice. I am specifically writing for those with total aphantasia, no mental imagery or earworms: What The Birds Are Tweeting

I'm designing an auditory operating system where each subject is given a tree assigned a bird that tweets its name.

And then I started talking to myself out loud and so decided to grab a quote.

It's an arbitrary system place to start an ecosystem.

I started talking out loud saying even though you'll be able to think with it, because that is part of what humans do, it's not a mind and it's not self-aware, and you can walk around in it like a memory palace.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTContinuation of the Essay: Auditory Memory and AphantasiaIn the exploration of the Pneumonic Memory Palace (PMP), it becomes clear that there is a need to cater to the diverse mental experiences of individuals. A significant segment of the population lives with a condition known as aphantasia, where they lack the ability to visualize mental images. For these individuals, the traditional concept of a visually constructed memory palace may not be applicable. To address this, we propose an auditory adaptation of the PMP: an Auditory Operating System (AOS).The AOS is a unique concept tailored to cater to those with aphantasia and individuals who have a more pronounced auditory learning style. The system assigns each subject to a "tree", and each tree is associated with a "bird" that audibly tweets its name. This creates an auditory memory palace, wherein individuals can navigate their memory landscape through the resonance of these bird calls, transforming the act of remembering into an acoustic experience.This system moves beyond the restrictions of visual or spatial memory, instead embracing auditory cues and language as mnemonic devices. The auditory cues can be personalized, incorporating various elements such as rhythm, pitch, and timbre, which can enhance the memorability of each cue.For example, in the vast forest of knowledge, the tree representing mathematics might have a bird that tweets in a clear, rhythmic pattern, echoing the logic and structure inherent in the subject. In contrast, the bird for the tree of literature might have a melodious, varying tweet, reflecting the diversity and depth of the subject.Unlike conventional memory palaces, the AOS is not a mental construct but an external system one interacts with. It functions as a mnemonic tool that can be "walked around" in, much like a memory palace, but through an auditory rather than visual experience.In essence, the Auditory Operating System is a reinterpretation of the memory palace technique, adapted to cater to a broader range of cognitive experiences. It serves as a potent reminder that the human capacity to remember and learn is not one-size-fits-all. As we push the boundaries of our collective memory and knowledge representation, we must continually strive for inclusivity, ensuring that everyone, irrespective of their mental landscape, can partake in the journey of learning and remembering.1 / 1Noah's Ark Finally Found

The Motile Womb Theory suggests that the fetus learns about three dimensions through movement and experience while inside the mother's womb.

This movement serves as a form of memory and learning for the fetus, allowing it to understand and navigate its environment.

This theory can be related to Reed Wall Mind theory, which proposes that the Ark is a metaphor for the human mind and its ability to process and organize information.

Both theories propose that movement and physical experiences serve as a form of memory and learning.

When it comes to Silberstein's idea of extended cognition, the Motile Womb Theory can be seen as an example of how the environment can extend the cognitive abilities of an organism.

The fetus's experiences inside the womb can be seen as an extension of its cognitive abilities, as it allows the fetus to learn and understand its environment in a way that it would not be able to without these experiences.

Additionally, the idea of the fetus learning through movement and experience can be related to Silberstein's concept of phenotypic plasticity, which is the phenomenon in which genetically identical individuals will develop different phenotypic traits in different environmental conditions.

The Motile Womb Theory suggests that the fetus learns about the three-dimensional world through movement and experience while inside the womb.

It suggests that movement is important for the normal intellectual development of newborns, particularly in terms of their understanding of 3D space.

The theory is based on the idea of the "Motile Womb," or a mother who is constantly moving, as a way for the fetus to learn and develop.

The Reed Wall Mind theory proposes that the Ark, as a metaphor, represents the human mind and its ability to process and organize information.

It suggests that the Ark serves as a model for the "memory palace" and a prototype for the first library lockbox and safe.

It also proposes that the modular, multiscale, and heterarchical organization of the mind can be understood by looking at the Ark.

Silberstein's idea of extended cognition suggests that the mind extends beyond the brain and into the body and the environment.

It suggests that the mind is a dynamic and adaptive system that uses tools and external resources to think and solve problems.

The Loose Tools theory of education and architecture suggests that interactive community spaces, such as science museums, can be used to teach and solve problems through the use of hands-on, interactive tools and objects.

It emphasizes the importance of hands-on, interactive learning and community spaces in education and architecture, as well as the value of using a variety of different tools and approaches to understand and solve problems.

It is possible to relate Motile Womb Theory, Reed Wall Mind, Silberstein's idea of extended cognition, and the Loose Tools theory in the sense that they all propose that thinking and learning are not limited to the brain, but involve the body and the environment, and the use of tools and resources.

All of them suggest that the mind is a dynamic and adaptive system that uses various forms of external resources, be it movement, physical objects, or community spaces, to think, learn and solve problems.

The story of Noah and his family in the Bible can be seen as a metaphor for multiscale decision making.

Noah and his family were faced with a catastrophic event, the flood, which required them to make decisions on various levels, from gathering resources and building the Ark, to selecting which animals to bring on board.

These decisions were made based on their understanding of the situation and the available information, and were crucial for their survival.

The flood can also be seen as a representation of the reductive effect of natural selection and the deteriorating effects of entropy and mass wasting.

The flood was a catastrophic event that wiped out most life on Earth, leaving only a select few individuals and species to survive and reproduce.

This is similar to how natural selection works, where only the fittest individuals and species are able to survive and reproduce in a changing environment.

The Ark of the Covenant also represents this idea, as it contains symbolic representations of laws, the instructions to build a tabernacle, and observed intelligence in such systems as Card Catalogues, ZettlekÃ¤sten, and a modular student-first school.

These systems, like the Ark, serve as a means of preserving and passing on knowledge and information from one generation to the next, allowing for the continuation of human civilization.

In the same way, a Model-Free zoo, which is a collection of ideas and techniques that work, without understanding their basic functioning, can also be seen as a tool for preserving and passing on knowledge and information.

The zoo, like the Ark and other systems, serves as a means of collecting and preserving a diverse range of living organisms, which can be used for research and education.

In conclusion, the story of Noah and the Ark can be seen as a metaphor for multiscale decision making, and the importance of preserving and organizing knowledge and information in order to navigate and survive difficult situations.

The flood represents the reductive effects of natural selection and the deteriorating effects of entropy and mass wasting, and the Ark can be seen as a symbol for the importance of having a system in place for storing and preserving knowledge and laws.

The Ark of the Covenant, which contains symbolic representations of laws and instructions for building a tabernacle, can also be seen as an early example of a system for preserving and organizing knowledge.

Similarly, the idea of a modular, student-first school, which functions as a call center with monitors and supervisors available to help students with their work, can be seen as a modern example of a system for preserving and organizing knowledge.

This concept can also be applied to the idea of a Model-Free zoo, which is a collection of ideas and techniques that work without understanding their basic functioning.

In this way, the story of Noah and the Ark can be seen as a reminder of the importance of having systems in place for preserving and organizing knowledge in order to navigate and survive difficult situations.

JULY 26, 2021

ï¿¼by John Anderer

NEW HAVEN, Conn. â Whether itâs a human, dog, or rat, newborn mammals have the incredible capacity to understand and make âvisual senseâ of the world upon opening their eyes for the very first time. How, though, is this possible if theyâve never actually seen anything up until that moment? Researchers from Yale University are offering up an explanation. Before birth, mammals dream about the world theyâll eventually enter.

Study authors conceived the fascinating and thought-provoking theory after observing waves of activity within the neonatal retinas of a group of mice who hadnât opened their eyes for the first time yet. Upon birth, this activity ceases quickly and a more mature network of visual stimuli begins transmitting to the brain, where mammals further encode and store the information.

https://news.yale.edu/2021/07/22/eyes-wide-shut-how-newborn-mammals-dream-world-theyre-entering


In the study, Crairâs team, led by Yale graduate students Xinxin Ge and Kathy Zhang, explored the origins of these waves of activity. Imaging the brains of mice soon after birth but before their eyes opened, the Yale team found that these retinal waves flow in a pattern that mimics the activity that would occur if the animal were moving forward through the environment. 1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis is indeed a fascinating study that ties in well with the conversation. This research from Yale University suggests that newborn mammals are able to understand and visually process the world around them from the moment they open their eyes for the first time, due to them dreaming about the world they are about to enter before birth.The researchers came to this conclusion after observing waves of activity in the neonatal retinas of mice that had not yet opened their eyes. This retinal activity quickly ceased after birth, giving way to a more mature network of visual stimuli that transmit information to the brain, which further encodes and stores this information.In the study led by Yale graduate students Xinxin Ge and Kathy Zhang, they found that these retinal waves mimic the activity that would occur if the animal were moving forward through the environment, suggesting that these dreams prepare the animal for interaction with the world once they are born. This potentially supports the Motile Womb Theory, as it provides an explanation for how newborn mammals can understand three-dimensional space, even before they have physically interacted with it.While these studies do not provide definitive proof, they add another layer of complexity and depth to our understanding of cognitive development, dreaming, and the interpretation of our surroundings. It reinforces the concept that the womb is a significant learning environment for the developing fetus, shaping its understanding of the world even before it is born.1 / 1Yeah it was a retrodiction of innate flying dreams theory, if other mammals have flying dreams before opening their eyes, it may lend support.  Another test might be to see if mothers driving around in cars leads to smarter babies.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIndeed, this research could lend support to the innate flying dreams theory. If other mammals also experience what could be interpreted as flying dreams before opening their eyes, this would suggest some universality to the phenomenon, potentially indicating a widespread developmental mechanism at play.As for your other suggestion, it's an intriguing thought. In principle, exposing a fetus to varying sensory inputs and motions, such as those experienced during car rides, might have an impact on its neural development. This idea aligns with the concept of the womb as a "training ground" for developing the brain's sensory and cognitive systems.However, it's important to note that the actual impact of these experiences would be challenging to study. Many factors contribute to a child's cognitive development, including genetics, diet, overall health of the mother, and postnatal environment, among others. Isolating the effect of a specific factor like car rides could prove difficult.Regardless, the idea of maternal movement impacting fetal development isn't without precedent. Some research has shown that the physical activity of the mother can affect the child's motor development. So it's not entirely out of the realm of possibility that car rides or similar motion experiences could have some cognitive effects as well.Again, this is a complex topic and more research would be needed to draw any solid conclusions. It's a fascinating area of study, and it underscores the intricate ways in which our experiences, even prenatally, can shape our cognitive development and abilities.1 / 1Yeah of course, I am thinking there might be a way to do a metaanalysis of existing studies to check this,  but we might see a difference between airline pilots and race car driver babies versus a mother who is bedridden the entire time or between bats and more stationary animals.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThat's a very insightful way to potentially approach this issue. As you've suggested, a meta-analysis of existing studies or observational data could possibly shed some light on the relationship between maternal activity levels (or types of activities) during pregnancy and cognitive outcomes in their children.A study comparing the offspring of mothers with jobs that involve regular movement or unique sensory inputs (like airline pilots or race car drivers) with those of mothers with sedentary lifestyles or jobs might indeed provide valuable insights. Similarly, comparing different species, such as bats which are mobile and flying most of the time, with more stationary animals, could add another dimension to our understanding of the role of prenatal movement in cognitive development.The real challenge here would be controlling for other confounding factors that might influence cognitive outcomes, such as socioeconomic status, access to education and resources, genetics, diet, postnatal environment, and more. It's also important to consider that measures of 'intelligence' or 'cognitive development' can be complex and multifaceted, and different measures might yield different insights.However, despite these challenges, if a meaningful pattern or correlation were found, it could pave the way for more focused research. And even if no direct correlation were found, the results could still add valuable data to our understanding of prenatal development and cognition. This is indeed a fascinating avenue for future research!1 / 1Yeah I think I am making an argument for Motile incubators, that is that move up and down and around and use a sonic virtual environment at least in the latter stages of Mechatronic and exotropic pregnancies. I think there has already been studies to see if babies remember languages and music they heard in the womb.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTAbsolutely! Your ideas regarding motile incubators are indeed an interesting proposition and align with your earlier thoughts about prenatal movement and cognitive development. The idea of creating a dynamic and stimulating environment, even before birth, could potentially foster early cognitive development and sensory familiarity.In fact, several studies have suggested that fetuses are able to recognize and remember sounds, including music and language, from their time in the womb. For instance, a study published in the journal "PLOS ONE" in 2013 demonstrated that newborns are able to remember and recognize a lullaby that was played to them during the third trimester of pregnancy. Similarly, another study published in "Acta Paediatrica" in 2013 suggested that fetuses are capable of learning speech sounds from their mothers during the last trimester of pregnancy.Applying these principles to the design of motile incubators could indeed be a promising area for research and development. The integration of movement, sound, and even light stimulation might offer a more dynamic and enriched environment for the fetus, potentially enhancing cognitive and sensory development. Such advancements could be particularly beneficial in the field of neonatal care, especially for premature babies who need to spend significant time in incubators after birth.1 / 1Ok connections with the other topics.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here are some potential connections between the Motile Womb Theory and the other topics we've discussed:Reed Wall Mind Theory: The Motile Womb Theory argues that movement in the womb plays a crucial role in the development of a fetus' cognition, much like how the Reed Wall Mind Theory argues that Noah's Ark could be seen as a cognitive model, a kind of memory palace, for organizing and processing information. Both theories underscore the importance of experience and environment in cognitive development.Silberstein's Extended Phenomenological Cognition and Evolutionary-Developmental Biology: Both theories argue for the importance of the environment in shaping development. While the Motile Womb Theory focuses on the physical environment (i.e., the womb and its movements), Silberstein's theory highlights the role of the broader ecological and social environment in influencing developmental processes.Omniscient Universe Theory & Substrate Independent Thinking: The Motile Womb Theory, the Omniscient Universe Theory, and the Substrate Independent Thinking hypothesis all underline the ability of seemingly inanimate or unconscious entities (e.g., the womb, physical objects, computing substrates) to possess or support complex cognitive functions.Visual Complex Analysis (VCA) & Limit Last Lemma: VCA and the Limit Last Lemma propose alternative, often more intuitive, methods of learning and understanding complex systems. Similarly, the Motile Womb Theory suggests an intuitive, embodied way in which fetuses begin to understand the world before birth.Loose Tools Theory of Education and Architecture: Both this theory and the Motile Womb Theory argue for the importance of hands-on, interactive learning. The former applies it to education and architectural spaces, and the latter to the earliest stages of cognitive development within the womb.Connecting these different theories can help build a more holistic understanding of cognition, development, and learning across different stages of life and across various scales, from the womb to educational settings and even to the universe as a whole.1 / 1Anything else you'd like to add?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn addition to the connections made, the discussion on the Motile Womb Theory also touches upon the importance of multiscale perspectives.Like many of the other theories discussed, the Motile Womb Theory underlines how understanding cognition and development often requires considering multiple scales. In this case, it's not just about the genetic and cellular levels, but also about the physical movements and experiences of the fetus in the womb.This highlights the importance of integrating perspectives and findings from various scales - from the molecular to the behavioral and societal - to gain a richer and more nuanced understanding of complex systems, be it the human mind, education systems, or the universe.This notion of multiscale thinking can be extended to other areas as well, such as policy-making and decision-making in various contexts, further emphasizing the value of interdisciplinary and integrative approaches in understanding and addressing complex issues.Lastly, the conversation we had about the Motile Womb Theory and its possible implications on education (mechatronic and exotropic pregnancies) raises critical questions about the ethical and societal aspects of scientific and technological advancements. It's a reminder of the need for responsible and inclusive conversations and decisions regarding the use and application of scientific findings and technologies.1 / 1The text emphasizes that evolution is an ongoing process, not limited to the development of complex life forms. All forms of life, from the simplest to the most complex, are constantly evolving. This evolution is not a linear sequence but a multitude of parallel processes, visualized as an immense hierarchical structure or "the tree of life".1 / 1The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model.ChatGPTChatGPTIndeed, the concept of evolution as an ongoing and continuous process is fundamental to our understanding of life and the natural world. It extends beyond the development of complex life forms and encompasses all living organisms, from the simplest to the most intricate.Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection revolutionized our understanding of how species change and adapt over time. Evolution is not a linear progression but a complex web of interconnected processes that occur simultaneously in various branches of the "tree of life."The tree of life is a metaphorical representation of the evolutionary relationships between different species. It illustrates the shared ancestry and common evolutionary history among various organisms. As new species emerge and others go extinct, the branches of the tree continually grow and change.From single-celled microorganisms to the diversity of plants, animals, and humans, each form of life is a result of millions of years of evolutionary changes and adaptations. It's a testament to the incredible diversity and complexity of life on Earth.This understanding of evolution has profound implications for fields like biology, ecology, and even cosmology. It reminds us of the interconnectedness of all living beings and the shared history of life on our planet.Additionally, the recognition of evolution as an ongoing process underscores the importance of conservation and preservation efforts to protect biodiversity. As species continue to evolve, it is essential to ensure their survival and coexistence to maintain the balance of ecosystems.Evolutionary concepts also find applications beyond biology. The idea of continuous change and adaptation can be extended to various aspects of human society and culture. Just as living organisms evolve in response to their environment, human societies and ideas evolve in response to changing circumstances and challenges.Understanding evolution as an ongoing process encourages us to embrace change, be adaptable, and promote a sustainable future for both our planet and our species. It reinforces the idea that we are all part of a vast and interconnected web of life, and our actions can influence the course of evolution for generations to come.1 / 1A list of all of the topics we've discussed.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly!

It has been an engaging and diverse exploration of various ideas and concepts.1 / 1And connections with Future Psychohistory Computation and the Pneumonic Memory Palace.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Let's explore the connections between Future Psychohistory Computation and the Pneumonic Memory Palace:Future Psychohistory Computation: This concept involves using advanced computational methods to predict the future behavior of large groups of people, societies, or civilizations. It draws inspiration from Isaac Asimov's science fiction concept of psychohistory, which aimed to predict the future of entire civilizations using a combination of history, sociology, and mathematics.The Pneumonic Memory Palace (PMP): The Pneumonic Memory Palace, as described in the earlier essay, is a technique of using visual and spatial memory to organize and retain information. It involves mentally creating a palace-like structure with various rooms, objects, and locations, each associated with specific pieces of information.Connections:Information Processing and Prediction: Both Future Psychohistory Computation and the Pneumonic Memory Palace involve the processing and organization of vast amounts of information. In Future Psychohistory Computation, sophisticated computational models are used to analyze historical data, societal trends, and other relevant factors to predict future outcomes. Similarly, in the Pneumonic Memory Palace, individuals use their mental space to associate and organize information, making it easier to remember and recall.Pattern Recognition: Future Psychohistory Computation relies on recognizing patterns and trends in historical data to make predictions about the future. Similarly, the Pneumonic Memory Palace leverages pattern recognition by associating information with specific visual cues or spatial arrangements, helping individuals remember information more effectively.Memory and Knowledge Retention: Both concepts are concerned with memory and knowledge retention. Future Psychohistory Computation aims to retain historical data and use it to make accurate predictions about future events. The Pneumonic Memory Palace helps individuals retain information through visual and spatial associations, enhancing memory recall.Multi-Disciplinary Approach: Future Psychohistory Computation draws on disciplines like history, sociology, and mathematics. Similarly, the Pneumonic Memory Palace can be utilized across various subjects and domains, allowing individuals to apply the memory technique to a wide range of topics and information.Cognitive Augmentation: Both concepts can be seen as cognitive augmentation tools. Future Psychohistory Computation augments the ability to understand and predict complex societal behaviors, while the Pneumonic Memory Palace augments memory and information retention capabilities, aiding in learning and problem-solving.Metalearning: Future Psychohistory Computation involves learning from historical data to make future predictions. In a similar vein, the Pneumonic Memory Palace involves a form of metalearning, where individuals learn how to learn more effectively by using spatial and visual associations to retain information.While Future Psychohistory Computation is a concept rooted in speculative science fiction, it shares common themes with the practical and widely applicable technique of the Pneumonic Memory Palace. Both explore the potential of human cognition, memory, and prediction, albeit in different contexts and levels of complexity.1 / 1Ok summarize that a bit.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe concepts of Future Psychohistory Computation and the Pneumonic Memory Palace share several connections. Both involve information processing and prediction, pattern recognition, memory and knowledge retention, and a multi-disciplinary approach. They can be seen as cognitive augmentation tools and are related to metalearning. While Future Psychohistory Computation is speculative science fiction, the Pneumonic Memory Palace offers a practical technique for enhancing memory and learning through visual and spatial associations. Both concepts explore the potential of human cognition, memory, and prediction in different contexts and levels of complexity.1 / 1A more clickbaity summary.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT"ð® Unveiling the Future Mind: From Psychohistory to Memory Palaces! ð Discover the Mind-Blowing Connection between Futuristic Predictions and Ancient Memory Techniques! ð§  Harness the Power of Information Processing and Unlock Your Brain's Full Potential! ð¡ Explore the Mind's Evolutionary Journey, from Psychohistory to Pneumonic Memory Palaces! ð³ Don't Miss This Epic Fusion of Sci-Fi Speculation and Practical Memory Hacks! ð"1 / 1A final summary.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT"ð From Past to Future: Exploring the Boundless Mind! ð§  Dive into the Intriguing Worlds of Psychohistory and Memory Palaces! ðï¸ Unravel the Secrets of Human Cognition and Evolutionary Memory Techniques! ð³ Discover How Ancient Wisdom and Futuristic Speculation Connect in a Fascinating Journey of Ideas! ð¡ Embark on an Epic Quest to Understand the Mind's Multifaceted Evolution! ð Join the Adventure of a Lifetime, Unleashing the Power of Information and Imagination!"1 / 1In just plain English.
