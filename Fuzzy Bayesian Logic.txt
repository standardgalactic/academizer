The St. Petersburg Paradox
First published Tue Jul 30, 2019; substantive revision Tue Aug 1, 2023
The St. Petersburg paradox was introduced by Nicolaus Bernoulli in 1713. It continues to be a reliable source for new puzzles and insights in decision theory.

The standard version of the St. Petersburg paradox is derived from the St. Petersburg game, which is played as follows: A fair coin is flipped until it comes up heads the first time. At that point the player wins 
$
2
n
,
 where n is the number of times the coin was flipped. How much should one be willing to pay for playing this game? Decision theorists advise us to apply the principle of maximizing expected value. According to this principle, the value of an uncertain prospect is the sum total obtained by multiplying the value of each possible outcome with its probability and then adding up all the terms (see the entry on normative theories of rational choice: expected utility). In the St. Petersburg game the monetary values of the outcomes and their probabilities are easy to determine. If the coin lands heads on the first flip you win $2, if it lands heads on the second flip you win $4, and if this happens on the third flip you win $8, and so on. The probabilities of the outcomes are 
1

,

,

,���. Therefore, the expected monetary value of the St. Petersburg game is

(Some would say that the sum approaches infinity, not that it is infinite. We will discuss this distinction in Section 2.)

The ���paradox��� consists in the fact that our best theory of rational choice seems to entail that it would be rational to pay any finite fee for a single opportunity to play the St. Petersburg game, even though it is almost certain that the player will win a very modest amount. The probability is 
1
2
 that the player wins no more than $2, and 
3
4
 that he or she wins no more than $4.

In a strict logical sense, the St. Petersburg paradox is not a paradox because no formal contradiction is derived. However, to claim that a rational agent should pay millions, or even billions, for playing this game seems absurd. So it seems that we, at the very least, have a counterexample to the principle of maximizing expected value. If rationality forces us to liquidate all our assets for a single opportunity to play the St. Petersburg game, then it seems unappealing to be rational.

1. The History of the St. Petersburg Paradox
The St. Petersburg paradox is named after one of the leading scientific journals of the eighteenth century, Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum Imperialis Petropolitanae [Papers of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Petersburg], in which Daniel Bernoulli (1700���1782) published a paper entitled ���Specimen Theoriae Novae de Mensura Sortis��� [���Exposition of a New Theory on the Measurement of Risk���] in 1738. Daniel Bernoulli had learned about the problem from his cousin Nicolaus I (1687���1759), who proposed an early but unnecessarily complex version of the paradox in a letter to Pierre R��mond de Montmort on 9 September 1713 (for this and related letters see J. Bernoulli 1975). Nicolaus asked de Montmort to imagine an example in which an ordinary dice is rolled until a 6 comes up:

[W]hat is the expectation of B ��� if A promises to B to give him some coins in this progression 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 etc. or 1, 3, 9, 27 etc. or 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 etc. or 1, 8, 27, 64 instead of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc. as beforehand. Although for the most part these problems are not difficult, you will find however something most curious. (N. Bernoulli to Montmort, 9 September 1713)

It seems that Montmort did not immediately get Nicolaus��� point. Montmort responded that these problems

have no difficulty, the only concern is to find the sum of the series of which the numerators being in the progression of squares, cubes, etc. the denominators are in geometric progression. (Montmort to N. Bernoulli, 15 November 1713)

However, he never performed any calculations. If he had, he would have discovered that the expected value of the first series (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) is:

���
���
n
=
1
 
5
n
���
1
6
n
���
2
n
���

.
For this series it holds that

n
���
���
 
���
���
���
a
n
+
1

���
���
���

,
so by applying the ratio test it is easy to verify that the series is divergent. (This test was discovered by d���Alembert in 1768, so it might be unfair to criticize Montmort for not seeing this.) However, the mathematical argument presented by Nicolaus himself was also a bit sketchy and would not impress contemporary mathematicians. The good news is that his conclusion was correct:

it would follow thence that B must give to A an infinite sum and even more than infinity (if it is permitted to speak thus) in order that he be able to make the advantage to give him some coins in this progression 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 etc. (N. Bernoulli to Montmort, 20 February 1714)

The next important contribution to the debate was made by Cram��r in 1728. He read about Nicolaus��� original problem in a book published by Montmort and proposed a simpler and more elegant formulation in a letter to Nicolaus:

In order to render the case more simple I will suppose that A throw in the air a piece of money, B undertakes to give him a coin, if the side of Heads falls on the first toss, 2, if it is only the second, 4, if it is the 3rd toss, 8, if it is the 4th toss, etc. The paradox consists in this that the calculation gives for the equivalent that A must give to B an infinite sum, which would seem absurd. (Cram��r to N. Bernoulli, 21 May 1728)

In the very same letter, Cram��r proposed a solution that revolutionized the emerging field of decision theory. Cram��r pointed out that it is not the expected monetary value that should guide the choices of a rational agent, but rather the ���usage��� that ���men of good sense��� can make of money. According to Cram��r, twenty million is not worth more than ten million, because ten million is enough for satisfying all desires an agent may reasonably have:

mathematicians value money in proportion to its quantity, and men of good sense in proportion to the usage that they may make of it. That which renders the mathematical expectation infinite, is the prodigious sum that I am able to receive, if the side of Heads falls only very late, the 100th or 1000th toss. Now this sum, if I reason as a sensible man, is not more for me, does not make more pleasure for me, does not engage me more to accept the game, than if it would be only 10 or 20 million coins. (21 May 1728)

It seems you've shared a comprehensive text about the St. Petersburg Paradox, which has an essential place in probability theory and the philosophy of economics. This paradox was introduced by Nicolaus Bernoulli and describes a game with a seemingly infinite expected value, leading to an apparent contradiction with common-sense reasoning about rational decision-making.
Is there a specific question you would like to know more about or something specific you'd like me to explain from this text?
1 / 1
This is a classical problem in probability theory that challenges our intuition about expected value and rational decision-making.

The paradox presents a game where the expected monetary value is infinite, yet most people would be unwilling to pay more than a modest amount to play the game. It seems irrational to pay a large sum for the opportunity to play, despite the infinite expected value, because the chances of winning a significant amount are extremely low.

The St. Petersburg Paradox has led to many discussions and debates in economics, mathematics, and philosophy, as it reveals an apparent inconsistency between mathematical reasoning and human intuition. Solutions have been proposed that involve considering utility functions, risk aversion, and bounded rationality.

Absolutely, you've summarized the St. Petersburg Paradox and its implications quite well.
The paradox has indeed sparked significant debate and led to the development of various approaches to resolve the inconsistency it presents. By shifting the focus from the expected monetary value to the expected utility, some have argued that the paradox can be resolved. The concept of utility captures a person's subjective valuation of wealth, which may not increase linearly with the amount of money. This concept has been instrumental in the development of utility theory in economics.
Another approach is to consider the bounded rationality of human decision-makers, recognizing that people often make decisions based on heuristics and rules of thumb rather than perfect mathematical reasoning.
The St. Petersburg Paradox continues to be a rich source for philosophical inquiry and theoretical development in decision theory, illustrating the complex interplay between mathematical models, human behavior, and rationality.

This is, of course, not news to mathematicians. The infinite sum produced by the Pasadena game is known as the alternating harmonic series, which is a conditionally convergent series. (A series

Indeed, what you've mentioned is related to the mathematical concepts of conditional convergence and the Riemann rearrangement theorem.
The series you provided is a special case of a conditionally convergent series, meaning it converges, but if you take the absolute value of all its terms, the new series diverges. The alternating harmonic series is a classic example of this phenomenon.
The Riemann rearrangement theorem states that if a series is conditionally convergent, you can rearrange its terms to make it converge to any real number, or even to positive or negative infinity. This is an intriguing result because it shows that the sum of an infinite series is not always a fixed value; in some cases, it depends on the order in which the terms are added.
In the context of probability and economics, these mathematical properties can lead to some counterintuitive results and paradoxes, such as the Pasadena game, which might be related to the St. Petersburg Paradox in some discussions.
This highlights the intricate and sometimes surprising connections between different areas of mathematics and their applications to real-world scenarios. Is there anything specific you'd like to know more about regarding this topic?

4. A Bounded Utility Function?
Arrow (1970: 92) suggests that the utility function of a rational agent should be ���taken to be a bounded function.��� since such an assumption is needed to avoid [the St. Petersburg] paradox���. Basset (1987) makes a similar point; see also Samuelson (1977) and McClennen (1994).

Arrow���s point is that utilities must be bounded to avoid the St. Petersburg paradox and that traditional axiomatic accounts of the expected utility principle guarantee this to be the case. The well-known axiomatizations proposed by Ramsey (1926), von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947), and Savage (1954) do, for instance, all entail that the decision maker���s utility function is bounded. (See section 2.3 in the entry on decision theory for an overview of von Neumann and Morgenstern���s axiomatization.)

If the utility function is bounded, then the expected utility of the St. Petersburg game will of course be finite. But why do the axioms of expected utility theory guarantee that the utility function is bounded? The crucial assumption is that rationally permissible preferences over lotteries are continuous. To explain the significance of this axiom it is helpful to introduce some symbols. Let 
{
p
A
,
(
1
���
p
)
B
}
 be the lottery that results in A with probability p and B with probability 
1
���
p
. The expression 
A
���
B
 means that the agent considers B to be at least as good as A, i.e., weakly prefers B to A. Moreover, 
A
���
B
 means that A and B are equi-preferred, and 
A
���
B
 means that B is preferred to A. Consider:

The Continuity Axiom: Suppose 
A
���
B
���
C
. Then there is a probability 
p
���
[
0
,
1
]
 such that 
{
p
A
,
(
1
���
p
)
C
}
���
B
.
To explain why this axiom entails that no object can have infinite value, suppose for reductio that A is a prize check worth $1, B is a check worth $2, and C is a prize to which the agent assigns infinite utility. The decision maker���s preference is 
A
���
B
���
C
, but there is no probability p such that 
{
p
A
,
(
1
���
p
)
C
���
B
. Whenever p is nonzero the decision maker will strictly prefer 
{
p
A
,
(
1
���
p
)
C
}
 to B, and if p is 0 the decision maker will strictly prefer B. So because no object (lottery or outcome) can have infinite value, and a utility function is defined by the utilities it assigns to those objects (lotteries or outcomes), the utility function has to be bounded.

Does this solve the St. Petersburg paradox? The answer depends on whether we think a rational agent offered to play the St. Petersburg game has any reason to accept the continuity axiom. A possible view is that anyone who is offered to play the St. Petersburg game has reason to reject the continuity axiom. Because the St. Petersburg game has infinite utility, the agent has no reason to evaluate lotteries in the manner stipulated by this axiom. As explained in Section 3, we can imagine unboundedly valuable payoffs.

Some might object that the continuity axiom, as well as the other axioms proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstern (and Ramsey and Savage), are essential for defining utility in a mathematically precise manner. It would therefore be meaningless to talk about utility if we reject the continuity axiom. This axiom is part of what it means to say that something has a higher utility than something else. A good response could be to develop a theory of utility in which preferences over lotteries are not used for defining the meaning of the concept; see Luce (1959) for an early example of such a theory. Another response could be to develop a theory of utility in which the continuity axiom is explicitly rejected; see Skala (1975).

5. Ignore Small Probabilities?
Buffon argued in 1777 that a rational decision maker should disregard the possibility of winning lots of money in the St. Petersburg game because the probability of doing so is very low. According to Buffon, some sufficiently improbable outcomes are ���morally impossible��� and should therefore be ignored. From a technical point of view, this solution is very simple: The St. Petersburg paradox arises because the decision maker is willing to aggregate infinitely many extremely valuable but highly improbable outcomes, so if we restrict the set of ���possible��� outcomes by excluding sufficiently improbable ones the expected utility will, of course, be finite.

But why should small probabilities be ignored? And how do we draw the line between small probabilities that are beyond concern and others that are not? Dutka summarizes Buffon���s lengthy answer as follows:

To arrive at a suitable threshold value, [Buffon] notes that a fifty-six year old man, believing his health to be good, would disregard the probability that he would die within twenty-four hours, although mortality tables indicate that the odds against his dying in this period are only 10189 to 1. Buffon thus takes a probability of 1/10,000 or less for an event as a probability which may be disregarded. (Dutka 1988: 33)

Is this a convincing argument? According to Buffon, we ought to ignore some small probabilities because people like him (56-year-old males) do in fact ignore them. Buffon can thus be accused of attempting to derive an ���ought��� from an ���is���. To avoid Hume���s no-ought-from-an-is objection, Buffon would have to add a premise to the effect that people���s everyday reactions to risk are always rational. But why should we accept such a premise?

Another objection is that if we ignore small probabilities, then we will sometimes have to ignore all possible outcomes of an event. Consider the following example: A regular deck of cards has 52 cards, so it can be arranged in exactly 52! different ways. The probability of any given arrangement is thus about 1 in 
8
���
10
67
. This is a very small probability. (If one were to add six cards to the deck, then the number of possible orderings would exceed the number of atoms in the known, observable universe.) However, every time we shuffle a deck of cards, we know that exactly one of the possible outcomes will materialize, so why should we ignore all such very improbable outcomes?

Nicholas J. J. Smith (2014) defends a modern version of Buffon���s solution. He bases his argument on the following principle:

Rationally negligible probabilities (RNP): For any lottery featuring in any decision problem faced by any agent, there is an 
��
>
0
 such that the agent need not consider outcomes of that lottery of probability less than 
��
 incoming to a fully rational decision. (Smith 2014: 472)
Smith points out that the order of the quantifiers in RNP is crucial. The claim is that for every lottery there exists some probability threshold 
��
 below which all probabilities should be ignored, but it would be a mistake to think that one and the same 
��
 is applicable to every lottery. This is important because otherwise we could argue that RNP allows us to combine thousands or millions of separate events with a probability of less than 
��
.
 It would obviously make little sense to ignore, say, half a million one-in-a-million events. By keeping in mind that that the appropriate 
��
 may vary from case to case this worry can be dismissed.

Smith also points out that if we ignore probabilities less than 
��
,
 then we have to increase some other probabilities to ensure that all probabilities sum up to one, as required by the probability axioms (see section 1 in the entry on interpretations of probability). Smith proposes a principle for doing this in a systematic manner.

However, why should we accept RNP? What is the argument for accepting this controversial principle apart from the fact that it would solve the St. Petersburg paradox? Smith���s argument goes as follows:

Infinite precision cannot be required: rather, in any given context, there must be some finite tolerance���some positive threshold such that ignoring all outcomes whose probabilities lie below this threshold counts as satisfying the norm���. There is a norm of decision theory which says to ignore outcomes whose probability is zero. Because this norm mentions a specific probability value (zero), it is the kind of norm where it makes sense to impose a tolerance: zero plus or minus 
��
 (which becomes zero plus 
��
,
 given that probabilities are all between 0 and 1)��� the idea behind (RNP) is that in any actual context in which a decision is to be made, one never needs to be infinitely precise in this way���that it never matters. There is (for each decision problem, each lottery therein, and each agent) some threshold such that the agent would not be irrational if she simply ignored outcomes whose probabilities lie below that threshold. (Smith 2014: 472���474)

Suppose we accept the claim that infinite precision is not required in decision theory. This would entail, per Smith���s argument, that it is rationally permissible to ignore probabilities smaller than 
��
. However, to ensure that the decision maker never pays a fortune for playing the St. Petersburg game it seems that Smith would have to defend the stronger claim that decision makers are rationally required to ignore small probabilities, i.e., that it is not permissible to not ignore them. Decision makers who find themselves in agreement with Smith���s view run a risk of paying a very large amount for playing the St. Petersburg game without doing anything deemed to be irrational by RNP. This point is important because it is arguably more difficult to show that decision makers are rationally required to avoid ���infinite precision��� in decisions in which this is an attainable and fully realistic goal, such as the St. Petersburg game. For a critique of RNP and a discussion of some related issues, see H��jek (2014).

Another objection to RNP has been proposed by Yoaav Isaacs (2016). He shows that RNP together with an additional principle endorsed by Smith (Weak Consistency) entail that the decision maker will sometimes take arbitrarily much risk for arbitrarily little reward.

Lara Buchak (2013) proposes what is arguably a more elegant version of this solution. Her suggestion is that we should assign exponentially less weight to small probabilities as we calculate an option���s value. A possible weighting function r discussed by Buchak is 
r
(
p
)
=
p
2
.
 Her proposal is, thus, that if the probability is 
1
8
 that you win $8 in addition to what you already have, and your utility of money increases linearly, then instead of multiplying your gain in utility by 
1
8
,
 you should multiply it by 
(
1
8
)
2
=
1
64
.
 Moreover, if the probability is 
1
16
 that you win $16 in addition to what you already have, you should multiply your gain by 
1
256
,
 and so on. This means that small probabilities contribute very little to the risk-weighted expected utility.

Buchak���s proposal vaguely resembles the familiar idea that our marginal utility of money is decreasing. As stressed by Cram��r and Daniel Bernoulli, more money is always better than less, but the utility gained from each extra dollar is decreasing. According to Buchak, the weight we should assign to an outcome���s probability is also nonlinear: Small probabilities matter less the smaller they are, and their relative importance decrease exponentially:

The intuition behind the diminishing marginal utility analysis of risk aversion was that adding money to an outcome is of less value the more money the outcome already contains. The intuition behind the present analysis of risk aversion is that adding probability to an outcome is of more value the more likely that outcome already is to obtain. (Buchak 2014: 1099.)

Buchak notes that this move does not by itself solve the St. Petersburg paradox. For reasons that are similar to those Menger (1934 [1979]) mentions in his comment on Bernoulli���s solution, the paradox can be reintroduced by adjusting the outcomes such that the sum increases linearly (for details, see Buchak 2013: 73���74). Buchak is, for this reason, also committed to RNP, i.e., the controversial assumption that there will be some probability so small that it does not make any difference to the overall value of the gamble.

Another worry is that because Buchak rejects the principle of maximizing expected utility and replaces it with the principle of risk-weighted maximizing expected utility, many of the stock objections decision theorists have raised against violations of the expected utility principle can be raised against her principle as well. For instance, if you accept the principle of risk-weighted maximizing expected utility, you have to reject the independence axiom. This entails that you can be exploited in some cleverly designed pragmatic argument. See Briggs (2015) for a discussion of some objections to Buchak���s theory.

6. Relative Expected Utility Theory
In the Petrograd game introduced by Colyvan (2008) the player wins $1 more than in the St. Petersburg game regardless of how many times the coin is flipped. So instead of winning 2 utility units if the coin lands heads on the first toss, the player wins 3; and so on. See Table 1.

It seems obvious that the Petrograd game is worth more than the St. Petersburg game. However, it is not easy to explain why. Both games have infinite expected utility, so the expected utility principle gives the wrong answer. It is not true that the Petrograd game is worth more than the St. Petersburg game because its expected utility is higher; the two games have exactly the same expected utility. This shows that the expected utility principle is not universally applicable to all risky choices, which is an interesting observation in its own right.

...than the St. Petersburg game, as you are guaranteed to win more money in the Petrograd game no matter what happens. But if both games have infinite expected utility, then they would be equally valuable according to traditional expected utility theory. This is another manifestation of the St. Petersburg paradox.
Relative Expected Utility Theory (REUT), proposed by Colyvan (2008), attempts to address this issue. In REUT, the utility of a lottery is relative to a reference class, or baseline, of other lotteries. The idea is to measure the utility of a lottery relative to other lotteries rather than in an absolute sense.
REUT suggests that we can compare the St. Petersburg game to the Petrograd game by looking at their relative expected utilities. According to this theory, the Petrograd game has a higher relative expected utility compared to the St. Petersburg game, given a proper reference class. This would allow us to sensibly say that the Petrograd game is preferable to the St. Petersburg game, even though both have infinite expected utilities.
However, the adoption of REUT introduces a new set of challenges. One must decide how to appropriately choose the reference class, which can lead to various complications. Different reference classes might yield different comparisons, and it might not always be clear what the most relevant reference class is.
Some might argue that REUT merely shifts the problem without providing a satisfactory solution to the underlying paradox. Nevertheless, it's an interesting approach that tries to capture our intuitive judgments about these paradoxical games by allowing for comparisons between infinite utilities.

Is the Petrograd game worth more than the St. Petersburg game because the outcomes of the Petrograd game dominate those of the St. Petersburg game? In this context, dominance means that the player will always win $1 more regardless of which state of the world turns out to be the true state, that is, regardless of how many times the coin is flipped. The problem is that it is easy to imagine versions of the Petrograd game to which the dominance principle would not be applicable. Imagine, for instance, a version of the Petrograd game that is exactly like the one in Table 1 except that for some very improbable outcome (say, if the coin lands heads for the first time on the 100th flip) the player wins 1 unit less than in the St. Petersburg game. This game, the Petrogradskij game, does not dominate the St. Petersburg game. However, since it is almost certain that the player will be better off by playing the Petrogradskij game a plausible decision theory should be able to explain why the Petrogradskij game is worth more than the St. Petersburg game.

Colyvan claims that we can solve this puzzle by introducing a new version of expected utility theory called Relative Expected Utility Theory (REUT). According to REUT we should calculate the difference in expected utility between the two options for each possible outcome. Formally, the relative expected utility (
REU
) of act 
A
k
 over 
A
l
 is

REU
(
A
k
,
A
l
)
=
n
���
i
=
1
 
p
i
(
u
k
i
���
u
l

)
.
According to Colyvan, it is rational to choose 
A
k
 over 
A
l
 if and only if 
REU
(
A
k
,
A
l
)
>
0
.

Colyvan���s REUT neatly explains why the Petrograd game is worth more than the St. Petersburg game because the relative expected utility is 1. REUT also explains why the Petrogradskij game is worth more than the St. Petersburg game: the difference in expected utility is 
1
���
(
1
2
)
100
 which is > 0.

However, Peterson (2013) notes that REUT cannot explain why the Leningradskij game is worth more than the Leningrad game (see Table 2). The Leningradskij game is the version of the Petrograd game in which the player in addition to receiving a finite number of units of utility also gets to play the St. Petersburg game (SP) if the coin lands heads up in the second round. In the Leningrad game the player gets to play the St. Petersburg game (SP) if the coin lands heads up in the third round.

It is obvious that the Leningradskij game is worth more than the Leningrad game because the probability that the player gets to play SP as a bonus (which has infinite expected utility) is higher. However, REUT cannot explain why. The difference in expected utility for the state that occurs with probability

Bartha (2007) and (2016) proposes a more complex version of relative expected utility theory. In Bartha���s theory, the utility of an outcome x is compared to the utility of some alternative outcome y and a basepoint z, which can be chosen arbitrarily as long as x and y are at least as preferred as z. The relative utility of x vis-��-vis y and the base-point z is then defined as the ratio between u(x) ��� u(z) and the denominator u(y) ��� u(z); the latter is a ���measuring stick��� to which u(x) ��� u(z) is compared. So if u(x) = 10, u(y) = 20 and u(z)= 0, then the relative utility of x vis-��-vis y and the base-point z is U(x, y; z) = 0.5.


Bartha���s suggestion is to ask the agent to compare the St. Petersburg game to a lottery between two other games. If, for instance, Petrograd+ is the game in which the player always wins 2 units more than in the St. Petersburg game regardless of how many times the coin is tossed, then the player could compare the Petrograd game to a lottery between Petrograd+ and the St. Petersburg game. By determining for what probabilities p a lottery in which one plays Petrograd+ with probability p and the St. Petersburg game with probability 
1
���
p
 is better than playing the Petrograd game for sure one can establish a measure of the relative value of Petrograd as compared to Petrograd+ or St. Petersburg. (For details, see Sect. 5 in Bartha 2016. See also Colyvan and H��jek���s 2016 discussion of Bartha���s theory.)

An odd feature of Bartha���s theory is that two lotteries can have the same relative utility even if one is strictly preferred to the other; see Bartha (2011: 34���35). This indicates that the relative utilities assigned to lotteries in Bartha���s theory are not always choice-guiding.

Let us also mention another, quite simple variation of the original St. Petersburg game, which is played as follows (see Peterson 2015: 87): A manipulated coin lands heads up with probability 0.4 and the player wins a prize worth 
2
n
 units of utility, where n is the number of times the coin was tossed. This game, the Moscow game, is more likely to yield a long sequence of flips and is therefore worth more than the St. Petersburg game, but the expected utility of both games is the same, because both games have infinite expected utility. It might be tempting to say that the Moscow game is more attractive because the Moscow game stochastically dominates the St. Petersburg game. (That one game stochastically dominates another game means that for every possible outcome, the first game has at least as high a probability of yielding a prize worth at least u units of utility as the second game; and for some u, the first game yields u with a higher probability than the second.) However, the stochastic dominance principle is inapplicable to games in which there is a small risk that the player wins a prize worth slightly less than in the other game. We can, for instance, imagine that if the coin lands heads on the 100th flip the Moscow game pays one unit less than the St. Petersburg game; in this scenario neither game stochastically dominates the other. Despite this, it still seems reasonable to insist that the game that is almost certain to yield a better outcome (in the sense explained above) is worth more. The challenge is to explain why in a robust and non-arbitrary way.

The challenges and complexities you've outlined here are part of an ongoing conversation within decision theory and philosophy. They relate to how we value games with infinite expected utility, and they highlight the difficulties that conventional expected utility theory faces in handling certain kinds of problems.
Colyvan's Relative Expected Utility Theory (REUT) and Bartha's more complex version are both attempts to handle these difficulties. As you pointed out, they can solve certain problems but are still limited in other respects.
REUT's Limitations
: As seen in the Leningradskij vs. Leningrad example, REUT fails where infinite values create an undefined expression. It works well when dealing with finite values but breaks down when infinite values are introduced, which often happens in variations of the St. Petersburg game.
Bartha's Version
: Bartha's theory adds complexity to get around some of the limitations of REUT, using a ���measuring stick��� and relative utility. But it has strange implications, like two lotteries having the same relative utility even if one is strictly preferred.
Stochastic Dominance Principle
: As you mentioned with the Moscow game, this principle may also seem appealing, but it breaks down when a small change creates a situation where neither game dominates the other.
These puzzles serve as an example of the broader challenges in philosophy and decision theory, where intuitive principles often clash with mathematical formalisms. They are not just technical issues but relate to deep questions about rationality, value, and decision-making.
One possible direction for future research might involve modifying the utility function or incorporating additional principles into decision theory. Some philosophers have explored using bounded or truncated utility functions to handle the St. Petersburg paradox, for example. Others might look to alternative mathematical frameworks that can handle infinities in a more nuanced way.
In conclusion, these games, and the paradoxes they create, highlight a rich and challenging area in decision theory that's ripe for further exploration and refinement. They offer valuable insights into the limits of existing theories and point the way towards new possibilities for understanding rational decision-making.

The St. Petersburg Paradox is a classical problem in probability and decision theory that highlights a seeming contradiction between rational decision-making and expected monetary value.
Here's a brief description of the paradox:
You play a game where a fair coin is flipped repeatedly until it comes up heads.
If the coin is flipped
n
n
n
times before coming up heads, you receive
2

2^n
2
n
dollars.
The game stops as soon as the coin lands heads, and you're paid accordingly.
So if the coin lands heads on the first flip, you get $2. If it lands heads on the second flip, you get $4, and so on. The expected monetary value of this game is infinite:

However, most people would not be willing to pay anywhere near an infinite amount to play this game, and even a modest amount like $20 or $25 might seem too high.
This paradox raises fundamental questions about decision-making and utility. It illustrates that the mathematical expectation (in this case, infinite) does not always align with our intuitive sense of value.
In terms of Bayesian decision-making, the paradox is related in the following ways:
Utility Functions
: Bayesian decision theory is based on the notion of maximizing expected utility, not just monetary value. If utility is a non-linear function of money, then the paradox can be resolved. For instance, a logarithmic utility function would result in a finite expected utility for the game, even though the expected monetary value is infinite.
Subjective Probabilities
: Bayesian decision-making often involves subjective probabilities, which can take into account an individual's unique beliefs and preferences. In the context of the St. Petersburg game, this might allow for different assessments of value based on personal risk tolerance or other factors.
Rationality
: The paradox also raises questions about rationality, which is a central concern in Bayesian decision theory. Is it irrational to refuse to pay a large amount to play the St. Petersburg game, even though the expected value is infinite? Different interpretations of rationality may lead to different conclusions here.
The St. Petersburg Paradox is thus an intriguing and illuminating problem that touches on many key concepts in probability, decision theory, and Bayesian reasoning. It helps illustrate the complexities of real-world decision-making and the limitations of certain mathematical models.

Daniel Bernoulli proposed a very similar idea in his famous 1738 article mentioned at the beginning of this section. Daniel argued that the agent���s utility of wealth equals the logarithm of the monetary amount, which entails that improbable but large monetary prizes will contribute less to the expected utility of the game than more probable but smaller monetary amounts. As his article was about to be published, Daniel���s brother Nicolaus mentioned to him that Cram��r had proposed a very similar idea in 1728 (in the letter quoted above). In the final version of the text, Daniel openly acknowledged this:

Indeed I have found [Cram��r���s] theory so similar to mine that it seems miraculous that we independently reached such close agreement on this sort of subject. (Daniel Bernoulli 1738 [1954: 33])

2. The Modern St. Petersburg Paradox
Cram��r���s remark about the agent���s decreasing marginal utility of money solves the original version of the St. Petersburg paradox. However, modern decision theorists agree that this solution is too narrow. The paradox can be restored by increasing the values of the outcomes up to the point at which the agent is fully compensated for her decreasing marginal utility of money (see Menger 1934 [1979]). The version of the St. Petersburg paradox discussed in the modern literature can thus be formulated as follows:

A fair coin is flipped until it comes up heads. At that point the player wins a prize worth 
2
n
 units of utility on the player���s personal utility scale, where n is the number of times the coin was flipped.

Note that the expected utility of this gamble is infinite even if the agent���s marginal utility of money is decreasing. We can leave it open exactly what the prizes consists of. It need not be money.

It is worth stressing that none of the prizes in the St. Petersburg game have infinite value. No matter how many times the coin is flipped, the player will always win some finite amount of utility. The expected utility of the St. Petersburg game is not finite, but the actual outcome will always be finite. It would thus be a mistake to dismiss the paradox by arguing that no actual prizes can have infinite utility. No actual infinities are required for constructing the paradox, only potential ones. (For a discussion of the distinction between actual and potential infinities, see Linnebo and Shapiro 2019.) In discussions of the St. Petersburg paradox it is often helpful to interpret the term ���infinite utility��� as ���not finite��� but leave it to philosophers of mathematics to determine whether it is or merely approaches infinity.

Some authors have discussed exactly what is problematic with the claim that the expected utility of the modified St. Petersburg game is infinite (read: not finite). Is it merely the fact that the fair price of the wager is ���too high���, or is there something else that prompts the worry? James M. Joyce notes that

a wager of infinite utility will be strictly preferred to any of its payoffs since the latter are all finite. This is absurd given that we are confining our attention to bettors who value wagers only as means to the end of increasing their fortune. (Joyce 1999: 37)

Joyce���s point seems to be that an agent who pays the fair price of the wager will know for sure that she will actually be worse off after she has paid the fee. However, this seems to presuppose that actual infinities do exist. If only potential infinities exist, then the player cannot ���pay��� an infinite fee for playing the game. If so, we could perhaps interpret Joyce as reminding us that no matter what finite amount the player actually wins, the expected utility will always be higher, meaning that it would have been rational to pay even more. Russell and Isaacs (2021:179) offer a slightly different analysis. Their point is that ���however much the St. Petersburg gamble is worth, no particular outcome could be worth exactly that much���. This is because the St. Petersburg gamble is worth more than any finite outcome, but less than something worth infinitely much.

Is the St. Petersburg gamble perhaps worth something like an infinite amount of money? No. The St. Petersburg gamble is sure to pay only a finite amount of money. Suppose there is something which is worth more than each finite amount of money���such as an infinite amount of money (whatever that might come to), or a priceless artwork, or true love. If [the agent] has something like that, then the prospect of keeping it (with certainty) will dominate giving it up in exchange for the St. Petersburg gamble; thus the St. Petersburg gamble is not worth so much. Of course, nothing is worth more than each finite amount of money, yet not worth more than every finite amount of money. So the conclusion of [the agent���s] reasoning is that nothing she could bid���monetary or otherwise���would be the right price. (Russell and Isaacs 2021:179)

Decisions theorists wish to clarify a means-ends notion of rationality, according to which it is rational to do whatever is the best means to one���s end. The player thus knows that paying more than what one actually wins cannot be the best means to the end of maximizing utility. But always being forced to pay too little is also problematic, because then the seller would ���pay��� too much (that is, receive too little). So at least one agent will be irrational and pay too much unless we can establish a fair price of the gamble. This observation enables us to strengthen the original ���paradox��� (in which no formal contradiction is derived) into a stronger version consisting of three incompatible claims:

The amount of utility it is rational to pay for playing (or selling the right to play) the St. Petersburg game is higher than every finite amount of utility.
The buyer knows that the actual amount of utility he or she will actually receive is finite.
It is not rational to knowingly pay more for something than one will receive.
Many discussions of the St. Petersburg paradox have focused on (1). As we will see in the next couple of sections, many scholars argue that the value of the St. Petersburg game is, for one reason or another, finite. A rare exception is H��jek and Nover. They offer the following argument for accepting (1):

The St Petersburg game can be regarded as the limit of a sequence of truncated St Petersburg games, with successively higher finite truncation points���for example, the game is called off if heads is not reached by the tenth toss; by the eleventh toss; by the twelveth toss;���. If we accept dominance reasoning, these successive truncations can guide our assessment of the St Petersburg game���s value: it is bounded below by each of their values, these bounds monotonically increasing. Thus we have a principled reason for accepting that it is worth paying any finite amount to play the St Petersburg game. (H��jek and Nover 2006: 706)

Although they do not explicitly say so, H��jek and Nover would probably reject (3). The least controversial claim is perhaps (2). It is, of course, logically possible that the coin keeps landing tails every time it is flipped, even though an infinite sequence of tails has probability 0. (For a discussion of this possibility, see Williamson 2007.) Some events that have probability 0 do actually occur, and in uncountable probability spaces it is impossible that all outcomes have a probability greater than 0. Even so, if the coin keeps landing tails every time it is flipped, the agent wins 0 units of utility. So (2) would still hold true.

3. Unrealistic Assumptions?
Some authors claim that the St. Petersburg game should be dismissed because it rests on assumptions that can never be fulfilled. For instance, Jeffrey (1983: 154) argues that ���anyone who offers to let the agent play the St. Petersburg gamble is a liar, for he is pretending to have an indefinitely large bank���. Similar objections were raised in the eighteenth century by Buffon and Fontaine (see Dutka 1988).

However, it is not clear why Jeffrey���s point about real-world constraints would be relevant. What is wrong with evaluating a highly idealized game we have little reason to believe we will ever get to play? H��jek and Smithson (2012) point out that the St Petersburg paradox is contagious in the following sense: As long as you assign some nonzero probability to the hypothesis that the bank���s promise is credible, the expected utility will be infinite no matter how low your credence in the hypothesis is. Any nonzero probability times infinity equals infinity, so any option in which you get to play the St. Petersburg game with a nonzero probability has infinite expected utility.

It is also worth keeping in mind that the St. Petersburg game may not be as unrealistic as Jeffrey claims. The fact that the bank does not have an indefinite amount of money (or other assets) available before the coin is flipped should not be a problem. All that matters is that the bank can make a credible promise to the player that the correct amount will be made available within a reasonable period of time after the flipping has been completed. How much money the bank has in the vault when the player plays the game is irrelevant. This is important because, as noted in section 2, the amount the player actually wins will always be finite. We can thus imagine that the game works as follows: We first flip the coin, and once we know what finite amount the bank owes the player, the CEO will see to it that the bank raises enough money.

If this does not convince the player, we can imagine that the central bank issues a blank check in which the player gets to fill in the correct amount once the coin has been flipped. Because the check is issued by the central bank it cannot bounce. New money is automatically created as checks issued by the central bank are introduced in the economy. Jeffrey dismisses this version of the St. Petersburg game with the following argument:

[Imagine that] Treasury department delivers to the winner a crisp new billion billion dollar bill. Due to the resulting inflation, the marginal desirabilities of such high payoffs would presumably be low enough to make the prospect of playing the game have finite expected [utility]. (Jeffrey 1983: 155)

Jeffrey is probably right that ���a crisp new billion billion dollar bill��� would trigger some inflation, but this seems to be something we could take into account as we construct the game. All that matters is that the utilities in the payoff scheme are linear.

Readers who feel unconvinced by this argument may wish to imagine a version of the St. Petersburg game in which the player is hooked up to Nozick���s Experience Machine (see section 2.3 in the entry on hedonism). By construction, this machine can produce any pleasurable experience the agent wishes. So once the coin has been flipped n times, the Experience Machine will generate a pleasurable experience worth 
2
n
 units of utility on the player���s personal utility scale. Aumann (1977) notes without explicitly mention the Experience Machine that:

The payoffs need not be expressible in terms of a fixed finite number of commodities, or in terms of commodities at all [���] the lottery ticket [���] might be some kind of open-ended activity -- one that could lead to sensations that he has not heretofore experienced. Examples might be religious, aesthetic, or emotional experiences, like entering a monastery, climbing a mountain, or engaging in research with possibly spectacular results. (Aumann 1977: 444)

A possible example of the type of experience that Aumann has in mind could be the number of days spent in Heaven. It is not clear why time spent in Heaven must have diminishing marginal utility.

Another type of practical worry concerns the temporal dimension of the St. Petersburg game. Brito (1975) claims that the coin flipping may simply take too long time. If each flip takes n seconds, we must make sure it would be possible to flip it sufficiently many times before the player dies. Obviously, if there exists an upper limit to how many times the coin can be flipped the expected utility would be finite too.

A straightforward response to this worry is to imagine that the flipping took place yesterday and was recorded on video. The first flip occurred at 11 p.m. sharp, the second flip 
60
2
 minutes later, the third 
60
4
 minutes after the second, and so on. The video has not yet been made available to anyone, but as soon as the player has paid the fee for playing the game the video will be placed in the public domain. Note that the coin could in principle have been flipped infinitely many times within a single hour. (This is an example of a ���supertask���; see the entry on supertasks.)

It is true that this random experiment requires the coin to be flipped faster and faster. At some point we would have to spin the coin faster than the speed of light. This is not logically impossible although this assumption violates a contingent law of nature. If you find this problematic, we can instead imagine that someone throws a dart on the real line between 0 and 1. The probability that the dart hits the first half of the interval, 
[
0
,
1
2
)
,
 is 
1
2
.
 And the probability that the dart hits the next quarter, 
[
1
2
,
3
4
)
,
 is 
1
4
, and so on. If ���coin flips��� are generated in this manner the random experiment will be over in no time at all. To steer clear of the worry that no real-world dart is infinitely sharp we can define the point at which the dart hits the real line as follows: Let a be the area of the dart. The point at which the dart hits the interval [0,1] is defined such that half of the area of a is to the right of some vertical line through a and the other half to the left the vertical line. The point at which the vertical line crosses the interval [0,1] is the outcome of the random experiment.

In the contemporary literature on the St. Petersburg paradox practical worries are often ignored, either because it is possible to imagine scenarios in which they do not arise, or because highly idealized decision problems with unbounded utilities and infinite state spaces are deemed to be interesting in their own right

The St. Petersburg Paradox is a famous problem in probability and decision theory. It highlights a situation where traditional expected value calculations seem to conflict with our intuitive judgments about rational decision-making.
The paradox centers around a particular betting game. A fair coin is flipped repeatedly until it comes up heads. The player wins 2^n units of utility, where n is the number of times the coin was flipped. The expected monetary value of this game is infinite, as the series 0.5 + 0.25
2 + 0.125
4 + ... does not converge.
Despite this infinite expected value, most people would not be willing to pay a large amount to play this game. The paradox thus exposes a seeming inconsistency between the mathematical theory of expected value and our intuitive judgments about rational decisions.
The resolution of the paradox often involves appealing to the idea of diminishing marginal utility. That is, the utility of wealth is thought to increase at a decreasing rate. This idea was historically suggested by both Daniel Bernoulli and Cram��r, who argued that the agent's utility of wealth should be represented by the logarithm of the monetary amount.
Modern decision theorists often find this solution too narrow, as the paradox can be restored by increasing the values of the outcomes up to the point at which the agent is fully compensated for her decreasing marginal utility of money.
This paradox challenges the basic framework of expected utility theory and has led to various discussions and debates in economics, philosophy, and decision theory. Some scholars argue that the value of the St. Petersburg game is finite for various reasons, while others highlight the paradox's unrealistic assumptions.
In Bayesian decision-making, where choices are guided by subjective probabilities and utility functions, the St. Petersburg Paradox can be a perplexing problem. It highlights potential limitations or challenges in the application of Bayesian principles to real-world decisions, particularly in cases where infinite expectations might arise.
The rich literature and various resolutions proposed for the paradox continue to provide fertile ground for exploring the foundations of decision theory and the nature of rationality.

Statistical Illogic and the Crisis of Modern Science

Bernoulli's Fallacy


PUB DATE: November 2022

There is a logical flaw in the statistical methods used across experimental science. This fault is not a minor academic quibble: it underlies a reproducibility crisis now threatening entire disciplines. In an increasingly statistics-reliant society, this same deeply rooted error shapes decisions in medicine, law, and public policy with profound consequences. The foundation of the problem is a misunderstanding of probability and its role in making inferences from observations.

Aubrey Clayton traces the history of how statistics went astray, beginning with the groundbreaking work of the seventeenth-century mathematician Jacob Bernoulli and winding through gambling, astronomy, and genetics. Clayton recounts the feuds among rival schools of statistics, exploring the surprisingly human problems that gave rise to the discipline and the all-too-human shortcomings that derailed it. He highlights how influential nineteenth- and twentieth-century figures developed a statistical methodology they claimed was purely objective in order to silence critics of their political agendas, including eugenics.

Clayton provides a clear account of the mathematics and logic of probability, conveying complex concepts accessibly for readers interested in the statistical methods that frame our understanding of the world. He contends that we need to take a Bayesian approach���that is, to incorporate prior knowledge when reasoning with incomplete information���in order to resolve the crisis. Ranging across math, philosophy, and culture, Bernoulli���s Fallacy explains why something has gone wrong with how we use data���and how to fix it.
ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Aubrey Clayton is a mathematician who teaches the philosophy of probability and statistics at the Harvard Extension School. He holds a PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, and his writing has appeared in the New York Times, Nautilus, and the Boston Globe.

If Ed Jaynes were to rise from the grave to lambast frequentist statistics one last time, Bernoulli���s Fallacy is the kind of book he would want to write. To say that the author does not pull any punches is an understatement. The author is out for blood and does not hide it, as witness the first and last paragraphs of the preface:

���Since this book risks being accused of relitigating old arguments about statistics and science, let us first dispense with the idea that those arguments were ever settled. The ���statistics wars��� never ended; in some ways they have only just begun ������

Consider this, instead, a piece of wartime propaganda, designed to be printed on leaflets and dropped from planes over enemy territory to win the hearts and minds of those who may as yet be uncommitted to one side or the other. My goal with this book is not to broker a peace treaty; my goal is to win the war.

True to his mission statement, the author exposes and ridicules orthodox methods that form the bedrock of statistical practice among the empirical sciences. Committed frequentists may view Bernoulli���s Fallacy as slanderous. Statistical practitioners may doubt that the author could possibly be correct, given that frequentist statistics have dominated empirical practice for almost a century. However, as a Bayesian, I find myself in broad agreement with the author.

The main premise of Bernoulli���s Fallacy is that sampling probabilities (i.e., aleatory probabilities: given the state of nature, what are the predicted data?) should not be confused with inferential probabilities (i.e., epistemic probabilities: Given the observed data, what is the probable state of nature?). The mistaken idea that sampling probabilities alone can address questions of inference is what the author calls ���Bernoulli���s fallacy.��� Throughout the book, the author demonstrates how tempting it is to confuse the two probabilities, how the seeds for this confusion were sown from the very beginning, and how the confusion is partly responsible for the recent replication crisis throughout the empirical disciplines.

Bernoulli���s Fallacy takes the reader on a fascinating historical journey that spans about 300 years. Along the way, the author explains the nature of probability, Bayesian reasoning (with its ���pathway probabilities���), the birth of frequentism, and more. The author is on a mission, and I find the book to be well-researched and extremely well-written.

In his unbridled enthusiasm, the author throws the kitchen sink at everything that looks like it might be frequentist (or may have frequentist friends). Not all complaints are equally compelling. For instance, the author dislikes null-hypothesis testing because, supposedly, the null is never exactly true. This is a popular critique that I find somewhat superficial; Jeffreys dealt with it already in the late 1930s. Without the null-hypothesis test, statistical practice would be at odds with common-sense scientific reasoning, where, in the words of Jeffreys, ���the onus of proof is always on the advocate of the more complicated hypothesis.��� The fact that the author is ill at ease with hypothesis testing is perhaps the price for being a Jaynesian rather than a Jeffrean (but see Hudson, 2021, for a counterexample).

The author emphasizes the fact that the frequentist founders Francis Galton, Karl Pearson, and Ronald Fisher were also fanatic eugenicists: ���Racism, aristocratic class panic, anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and ableism are all original sins of modern statistics. The real sins, though, were the greed for scientific authority supported by unassailably objective methods and the arrogance to believe such a thing could exist��� (p. 177). According to the author, what started as an honest mistake���or perhaps even a correct Bayesian answer, under a vague prior���was elevated to statistical dogma to push the eugenics agenda on a general audience. This claim is as bold as it is speculative.

An alternative perspective is that the frequency interpretation of probability (however flawed and limiting it may be upon closer inspection) does have considerable intuitive appeal. Frank Ramsey stated that ���much the simplest and least controversial interpretation of the calculus [of probabilities] is one in terms of frequencies��� (1926/1964, p. 63), and Jimmy Savage wrote that ���[i]t is completely understandable that a frequentist concept of probability should have come to the fore��� (1961, p. 575). Furthermore, in the pre-computer era, the frequentist methods were more practical, and more effectively promoted, than their Bayesian counterparts.

I am also not certain about the extent to which the replication crisis is due to the use of the p-value. Although it is certainly a contributing factor, I personally believe the root cause is that the data analyst is usually fully invested in the outcome, and has every incentive imaginable to obtain the most flattering result.

All in all, I believe a book as belligerent and instantly controversial as Bernoulli���s Fallacy deserves an appendix in which some of the claims are debated with other statisticians (cf. Berger & Wolpert, 1988).

My final misgiving is that the author occasionally gives Ed Jaynes a little too much credit. For instance, the notion that all probability statements are conditional on prior knowledge is found in Keynes (1921), and both Jeffreys and Lindley consistently conditioned on ���H.��� (for ���history���) or ���K��� (for ���knowledge���) before Jaynes. Similarly, the idea that Bayesian inference is a logic of partial beliefs predates Jaynes���it goes back at least to De Morgan (1847/2003), Ramsey (1926), and de Finetti (1974).

Despite these minor misgivings, this book comes highly recommended. Bernoulli���s Fallacy elegantly connects the past to the present in an attempt to dismantle the reigning statistical orthodoxy. Buy this book, and give it to your students so they may learn about Bayesian inference and the history of statistics; give it to your colleagues working in the empirical sciences so they will understand that the frequentist emperor is scantily dressed; give it to your frequentist friends as a provocation. Or read it yourself, so you will be prompted to think more deeply about the foundations of statistical inference.

Thank you for sharing this detailed review of "Bernoulli's Fallacy" by Aubrey Clayton. The review by Eric-Jan Wagenmakers sheds light on the book's contents, including its strong stance against frequentist statistics and the author's goal to champion Bayesian reasoning.
The critique of frequentist statistics, as described, centers on the distinction between sampling probabilities (aleatory) and inferential probabilities (epistemic), and the confusion between the two as what the author refers to as "Bernoulli's fallacy." This discussion does indeed connect to broader philosophical debates in statistics, such as those illustrated by the St. Petersburg Paradox.
The historical context, connection to eugenics, and reflection on the replication crisis are particularly intriguing aspects of the book that seem to make it a valuable read for those interested in the foundations of statistical inference.
While the review acknowledges some disagreements and concerns, it appears to highly recommend "Bernoulli's Fallacy" as an influential work that challenges conventional statistical thinking and promotes a Bayesian approach. It might be a provocative and stimulating read for students, practitioners, and anyone interested in the philosophy of statistics and probability.

Is this related to type one and type two errors?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, the debate between frequentist and Bayesian approaches, as described in "Bernoulli's Fallacy," can be related to the concepts of Type I and Type II errors.
In frequentist statistics:
A Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is wrongly rejected (a "false positive"). The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by the significance level ��.
A Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is wrongly accepted (a "false negative"). The probability of making a Type II error is denoted by ��.
Frequentist approaches often focus on controlling these error rates, and some criticisms of this approach stem from the notion that these error rates are about repeated sampling and not directly about the evidence for or against specific hypotheses.
In Bayesian statistics, the emphasis is generally on updating beliefs given new evidence, and the concepts of Type I and Type II errors are not typically framed in the same way. Instead, Bayesian approaches often focus on computing the posterior probability of a hypothesis given the observed data.
The book's criticism of frequentist statistics, as described in the review, seems to challenge the logic of using sampling probabilities to make inferences about the state of nature. This could be interpreted as a critique of the way Type I and Type II errors are conceptualized and used within the frequentist framework.
So while "Bernoulli's Fallacy" might not explicitly address Type I and Type II errors, the underlying philosophical differences between frequentist and Bayesian approaches would encompass these concepts.

Ok is there a concept in Bayesian analysis of predictive coding based on trying different priors?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, in Bayesian analysis, the concept of trying different priors is a common and important aspect of model development and analysis. It is related to the idea of sensitivity analysis, where researchers explore how the choice of prior influences the posterior distribution.
Prior Sensitivity Analysis
: This involves examining how different choices of prior distributions affect the conclusions of a Bayesian analysis. If the results are highly sensitive to the choice of the prior, it may indicate that the data are not providing strong information about the parameter in question.
Robust Bayesian Analysis
: Sometimes, analysts may choose a set of plausible priors to reflect different beliefs or assumptions and then see how the resulting inferences change with different prior specifications. This can lead to more robust conclusions.
Empirical Bayes Methods
: These are techniques where the data are used to estimate the prior distribution, allowing the prior to be adapted to the specific dataset.
Hierarchical Models
: In more complex models, there might be different levels of priors, with hyperpriors governing the parameters of the prior distributions themselves.
Predictive Priors
: These might be chosen based on predictive coding or other information that is not in the data itself but might provide an informative prior.
In predictive modeling and in cognitive neuroscience, predictive coding refers to the brain's way of making and updating predictions about future events. While it's a distinct concept, it aligns with the Bayesian idea of updating beliefs (posterior distributions) based on new data (likelihood) and previous beliefs (prior distributions).
So, the concept of using different priors and updating them based on new data is indeed a fundamental part of Bayesian analysis and has connections to other fields and concepts as well.

I heard that Boolean logic is a special case of Boolean decision making where the middle probabilities are excluded.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It seems there might be a slight misunderstanding in the statement. Boolean logic is a branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values true and false, usually denoted by 1 and 0 respectively. In Boolean logic, there's no concept of "middle probabilities."
However, Boolean logic can be related to probability theory, where Boolean values can be seen as special cases of probabilities. In probability theory, an event can have a probability ranging from 0 to 1. A probability of 0 corresponds to a Boolean false, and a probability of 1 corresponds to a Boolean true. Any probability value between 0 and 1 would represent some uncertainty about the truth of the event.
So, in this sense, Boolean logic could be viewed as a special case of probabilistic reasoning where only the extremes (0 and 1) are considered, and any intermediate values, which might represent degrees of belief or uncertainty, are excluded.
1 / 1
I think the law of the excluded middle was a concept from pre-medieval logic. The middle probabilities are only in Bayesian logic, which really do not exactly include 0 or 1
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You're absolutely correct in recognizing the law of the excluded middle, which is a principle in classical logic stating that for any proposition, either that proposition is true, or its negation is true. There's no "middle" ground or third option.
In contrast, Bayesian probability allows for degrees of belief between 0 and 1, with 0 and 1 themselves typically not being completely excluded (though in practice, probabilities of exactly 0 or 1 can lead to difficulties in updating beliefs).
So, the contrast between classical logic (including the law of the excluded middle) and Bayesian probability represents different ways of handling uncertainty, with classical logic allowing only binary true/false values and Bayesian probability allowing for a continuum of belief between 0 and 1.

How is this resolved in various fuzzy logic and soft logic methodologies?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Fuzzy logic and other soft logic methodologies provide alternative ways to handle uncertainty, ambiguity, and vagueness that aren't accounted for in classical binary logic.
Fuzzy Logic
: Fuzzy logic is based on the idea that truth values can be represented by degrees in the interval [0, 1], rather than simply 0 or 1. So, instead of a statement being only true or false, it can be partially true. This allows for more nuanced reasoning and is especially useful in systems that must deal with imprecise or noisy data. Fuzzy logic uses "fuzzy sets" where membership in a set is a matter of degree.
Probabilistic Logic
: Probabilistic logic extends classical logic by associating probabilities with the truth of statements. This combines aspects of probability theory with logical reasoning and can be used to model uncertainty in a more explicit way than fuzzy logic.
Multi-Valued Logic
: Some logical systems include more than two truth values. These are known as multi-valued logics, and they can include various degrees of truth, depending on the specific system. This approach can provide a more nuanced way to model situations where there are more options than simply true or false.
Quantum Logic
: Quantum logic is a non-classical logical system that takes into account the peculiarities of quantum mechanics. It modifies some of the classical logical axioms to better align with the principles of quantum physics.
All these methodologies try to extend or modify classical logic in a way that allows for a richer expression of concepts and a more nuanced handling of uncertainty or ambiguity. They have various applications, especially in areas like artificial intelligence, control systems, decision-making, and areas where uncertainty and approximation are integral parts of the process.

Give an example of each

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are examples of each of the mentioned logic methodologies:
Fuzzy Logic
:
Example
: In a temperature control system, fuzzy logic can be used to control heating or cooling based on a "temperature level" rather than exact degrees. A temperature might be considered "somewhat warm" (0.6) or "very cold" (0.2) with values between 0 and 1 representing the degree of membership in these categories. The system can then use these fuzzy values to make more nuanced control decisions.
Probabilistic Logic
:
Example
: In medical diagnosis, a probabilistic logic model might include statements like "If a patient smokes, there is a 0.8 probability they will develop lung cancer." This logic can incorporate both uncertainty in the evidence (e.g., reliability of a test) and the inherent probabilistic nature of some phenomena.
Multi-Valued Logic
:
Example
: In a traffic light system, a multi-valued logic could be employed with three truth values representing "red," "yellow," and "green." This logic can more accurately model the state of a traffic light than binary true/false logic.
Quantum Logic
:
Example
: Quantum logic can be applied in quantum computing. In classical logic, a bit is either 0 or 1, but in quantum logic, a qubit can be in a superposition of both states simultaneously. Quantum gates can then perform logical operations on these qubits, adhering to the principles of quantum mechanics, which may seem counterintuitive from the perspective of classical logic.
Each of these methodologies offers a unique way to handle complex situations that are not adequately addressed by classical binary logic. By providing more nuanced or flexible representations of truth, they allow for more sophisticated reasoning and decision-making.

I was thinking of this: Fuzzy Bayesian Learning 
Indranil Pan and Dirk Bester 
Abstract���In this paper we propose a novel approach for learn- 
ing from data using rule based fuzzy inference systems where 
the model parameters are estimated using Bayesian inference 
and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We show 
the applicability of the method for regression and classif i cation 
tasks using synthetic data-sets and also a real world example 
in the i nancial services industry. Then we demonstrate how the 
method can be extended for knowledge extraction to select the 
individual rules in a Bayesian way which best explains the given 
data. Finally we discuss the advantages and pitfalls of using this 
method over state-of-the-art techniques and highlight the specif i c 
class of problems where this would be useful. 
Index Terms���fuzzy logic; mamdani method; machine learn- 
ing; MCMC. I. INTRODUCTION 
P 
ROBABILITY theory and fuzzy logic have been shown 
to be complementary [1] and various works have looked 
at the symbiotic integration of these two paradigms [2], 
[3] including the recently introduced concept of Z-numbers 
[4]. Historically fuzzy logic has been applied to problems 
involving imprecision in linguistic variables, while probability 
theory has been used for quantifying uncertainty in a wide 
range of disciplines. Various generalisations and extensions of 
fuzzy sets have been proposed to incorporate uncertainty and 
vagueness which arise from multiple sources. For example, 
the type-2 fuzzy [5], [6] sets and type-n fuzzy sets [5] can 
include uncertainty while def i ning the membership functions 
themselves. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets [7] additionally introduce 
the degree of non-membership of an element to take into 
account that there might be some hesitation degree and the 
degree of membership and non-membership of an element 
might not always add to one. Non-stationary fuzzy sets [8] can 
model variation of opinion over time by def i ning a collection 
of type 1 fuzzy sets and an explicit relationship between 
them. Fuzzy multi-sets [9] generalise crisp sets where multiple 
occurrences of an element are permitted. Hesitant fuzzy sets 
[10] have been proposed from the motivation that the problem 
of assigning a degree of membership to an element is not 
because of a margin of error (like Atanassov���s intuitionistic 
fuzzy sets) or a possibility distribution on possibility values 
(e.g. type 2 fuzzy sets), but because there is a set of possible 
values [10]. Formally these can be viewed as fuzzy multi- 
sets but with a different interpretation. Apart from these 
quantitative tools, other approaches have been used to address 
the vagueness of the qualitative meanings used by experts like 
fuzzy linguistic approaches [11] and various linguistic models 
have been proposed to address this [12]���[14].

Bayesian inference, on the other hand, provides a method 
of incorporating the subjective beliefs of the experts about 
the value of a model parameter, using prior probability dis- 
tributions, through expert elicitation methods [15]. However, 
expert knowledge does not always come in the form of 
precise probability distributions and often have vague and 
ambiguous statements embodying some form of knowledge 
[16]. In such cases, both uncertainty and imprecision exist 
simultaneously [17]. The data is said to be uncertain if the 
degree of conf i dence in what is represented by the data is less 
than one [17], [18]. On the other hand data is imprecise if the 
implied attribute is not singular but belongs to an ill def i ned 
set [17], [18]. These two things cannot be discerned if they 
are represented by a single probability distribution and the 
contribution of each of these in the i nal posterior distribution 
cannot be tracked [19]. 
However, fewer works have looked at integration of 
Bayesian methods with fuzzy logic [20], [21]. For example, 
[22] attempts to generalise Bayesian methods for samples of 
fuzzy data and for prior distributions with imprecise param- 
eters. Recent works have also looked at extension of these 
works for possibilistic Bayesian inference [23]. However, in 
all the above-mentioned literatures, most of the work is on 
representing the data in terms of fuzzy numbers and optimising 
model parameters based on that. None of the literatures 
specif i cally leverage on one of the fundamental strengths of 
the fuzzy inference system, i.e. expressing the expert opinion 
in terms of rule bases. This is specif i cally what this paper 
addresses and the idea stems from the fact that often the 
experts not only have an opinion on the uncertainty estimates 
of the model covariates, but also have an intuition of the 
inter-dependence between the various model covariates on the 
i nal output. None of the above-mentioned methods take this 
explicitly into account and hence do not fully exploit the 
embodied knowledge provided by the experts. 
Another line of research has been the use of the belief 
rule base (BRB) inference methodology as proposed in [24] 
which uses an expert rule base and assigns a belief degree to 
each rule, individual rule weights and attribute weights. This 
treatment is not fully Bayesian and including these additional 
parameters for characterising these rule bases requires multi- 
objective optimisation methods to give acceptable levels of 
performance [25]. Having to estimate more number of param- 
eters from a small data-set is inherently diff i cult and would 
have large conf i dence intervals (using frequentist methods) 
or large highest density intervals (using Bayesian methods). 
This issue is addressed in our methodology, since it does not 
need to have too many additional parameters over and above 
that required by the fuzzy rule base itself. This also helps 
in reducing the explosion of parameters if higher number of 
rule bases or fuzzy sets are used. Also the outputs in these

works is a belief distribution over the fuzzy variables like 
low, medium and high, instead of a distribution on the crisp 
output of real numbers, as proposed later in this work. This is 
important especially if such models are developed as a part of a 
larger decision making framework which relies on probability 
distributions as outputs from the sub-models. A Bayesian 
extension of this framework is proposed in [26] to update the 
belief degrees based on a recursive online estimation. This also 
addresses a different problem and has the same issues as the 
BRB methodology mentioned earlier.

The abstract you've provided details a sophisticated approach to combining fuzzy logic and Bayesian inference, utilizing rule-based fuzzy inference systems and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. The method is applied to regression and classification tasks and allows for the integration of uncertainty and imprecision.
Here's a brief breakdown of what's being presented:
Fuzzy Logic
: The system incorporates fuzzy sets, including various extensions like type-2 fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, and hesitant fuzzy sets. These enable the handling of imprecision in linguistic variables and vagueness arising from multiple sources.
Bayesian Inference
: By using Bayesian methods, the approach includes subjective beliefs of experts, expressed in vague and ambiguous statements. Bayesian methods can help identify the contributions of uncertainty and imprecision in the final posterior distribution.
Integration of Fuzzy Logic and Bayesian Inference
: The paper highlights an attempt to unify fuzzy logic with Bayesian methods for handling both uncertainty and imprecision. It leverages rule bases in fuzzy inference systems to express expert opinions and capture inter-dependence between model covariates.
Applicability
: Demonstrated in both synthetic datasets and real-world financial services, the approach provides a method for knowledge extraction to select individual rules in a Bayesian way.
Comparative Advantages and Limitations
: The paper also contrasts this method with other techniques, identifying specific problems where it might be useful.
Overall, this work demonstrates a highly specialized fusion of Bayesian and fuzzy logic principles to create a more nuanced understanding of complex systems, specifically acknowledging and exploiting the inherent uncertainty, imprecision, and vagueness in expert knowledge and data representation. It's an advanced example that showcases how modern methodologies can meld to address multifaceted challenges.

Despite this infinite expected value, most people wouldn't be willing to pay more than a small sum to play this game. This paradox poses a significant challenge to classical expected utility theory.
Now, let's look at how the fusion of fuzzy logic and Bayesian learning (as described in the previous abstract) might be applied to this paradox.
Fuzzy Logic Approach:
Fuzzy logic could model the uncertainty and imprecision related to human intuition and reasoning about the game. The hesitation and uncertainty in accepting the mathematical expectation as the fair price might be represented through fuzzy sets, capturing the vagueness in human judgment.
Bayesian Learning Approach:
Bayesian inference could incorporate prior beliefs about the real value of playing the game. Since most people's prior beliefs would not align with the infinite expectation, these priors would modify the mathematical expectation. By using real-world data or expert opinions, the system could define a probability distribution that aligns more closely with human intuition.
Integration:
Fuzzy Bayesian Learning could combine these aspects to model both the uncertainty in human judgment and the prior beliefs about the game's value. This would allow for a more nuanced analysis that might reconcile the mathematical expectation with real-world behavior.
For example, the fuzzy sets could represent different levels of uncertainty about the value of the game, while Bayesian methods could adjust these based on prior beliefs and observations of actual willingness to pay. The outcome could be a model that captures both the theoretical properties of the game and the empirical behavior of potential players.
In essence, Fuzzy Bayesian Learning could offer a pathway to resolving the St. Petersburg Paradox by incorporating the complexity of human reasoning and decision-making, rather than relying solely on classical mathematical expectation.

This framework therefore complements higher order fuzzy 
sets in the sense that irrespective of how the uncertainty is 
def i ned, the Bayesian method would act as a wrapper on top of 
the fuzzy logic based model, to reduce the band of uncertainty 
by learning from the data as more data-points come in. In 
terms of the present framework, def i ning an uncertainty range 
for the membership functions is somewhat similar to setting 
informative priors, instead of the uniform priors that we have 
considered in our simulations. 
The other key difference is that the fuzzy type-2 method 
uses a type reducer between the inference and the de- 
fuzzif i cation steps and the i nal output is always crisp, even 
though the membership functions have uncertainties in them. 
However, the proposed framework gives a posterior probability 
distribution for the predictions which helps in understanding 
the uncertainties associated with the predictions and aids in 
better decision making. It can also learn from new data that 
comes in and decrease the uncertainties in the membership 
functions and consequently in the predictions. 
E. Potential problems and unresolved issues with the method- 
ology 
Since the model structure is shaped by the rule base 
provided by the experts, the predictive accuracy would be 
dependent on how good these rules are at explaining the 
data. Therefore, this methodology would work well in cases 
with small to medium data sets where the expert has good 
understanding of the problem domain. For other cases where 
there is a large number of data and there is not much domain 
knowledge, traditional machine learning methods like neural 
networks, support vector machines etc. would be a better 
alternative. 
Proper choice of the specif i c rules would also affect the 
uncertainties in the parameter estimates and consequently in 
the predictions. Each rule would add an extra rule selection 
parameter (��k) to be estimated by the MCMC from the data- 
set. If the data-set is small, estimation of more ��k���s indicate 
that the uncertainty in the parameter estimates would be 
higher. On the other hand if the rules are not exhaustive 
enough to explain the data, then the predictive accuracy of 
the model would be poor as the search space of the MCMC is 
effectively limited by this rule base set. Therefore, succinct and 
judicious choice of rules are important for smaller predictive 
uncertainties and better predictive accuracies. 
Even though the present work is geared primarily towards 
small and medium data-sets, the same methodology might be 
useful for large data-sets which do not i t in memory (i.e. big 
data). The rationale for this might be along similar lines to that 
of the present paper, where the interpretability of the model 
is also important vis-�� a-vis the predictive accuracy. However, 
Bayesian methods & particularly MCMC is inherently a 
sequential algorithm and hence would not directly scale to 
huge datasets. However, partitioning the data and training the 
model on a subset of the data and recursively estimating the 
parameters by doing block updates might be a solution, i.e. 
the posterior distribution of the parameters estimated from one 
subset of the data becomes the prior distribution for the next 
subset. Other sampling methods or variational inference might 
also help in speeding up the computations, but more research 
needs to be done in this area. 
Including the fuzzy inference system and calling it at 
each MCMC iteration inherently makes the computation times 
much higher. Other solutions like developing surrogates for the 
expensive function and sampling from it only when required 
might be an avenue to explore. However, this might introduce 
additional errors in the parameter estimates as the surrogate 
model itself would be an approximation of the true function. 
Further research needs to be done on this. 
F. Directions for future research 
Future improvisations can look at recursive updating and se- 
quential monte carlo methods (like particle i ltering, unscented 
Kalman i ltering etc.) so that when a new data-point arrives, 
the algorithm does not need to run again from scratch with the 
whole data-set and just updates the parameter values from the 
posterior of the old data-set and the new observation value. 
Another direction of research can be to look at more 
eff i cient sampling techniques than the present Metropolis- 
Hastings one, to improve convergence characteristics. Gradient 
free samplers like Slice sampling can be used for this case, 
but most other improved sampling like Hamiltonian Monte 
Carlo etc. would require gradients from the black box fuzzy 
function, which is diff i cult to obtain. 
Improvisations could also be made in the direction of 
computational intelligence, like extending the methodology 
to other kinds of fuzzy sets like intuitionistic fuzzy sets, 
non-stationary fuzzy sets, type-2 fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy 
sets etc. The fuzzy rule bases could be evolved through 
genetic programming or some variant of genetic algorithm 
[40], however this would potentially require more data for the 
learning process or might result in overf i tting and consequent 
loss of generalisation capabilities of the model. Automated rule 
generation processes might also result in logically incoherent 
rule bases (even though they might have high predictive 
accuracy) and also loss of coherent reasoning behind the 
choice of such rules [41]. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
This paper introduced the symbiotic conf l uence of Fuzzy 
logic and Bayesian inference to learn from data and also 
incorporate the model structure in the form of an expert rule 
base. This helps in providing a narrative and transparency 
regarding the workings of the model while being able to 
include complicated non-linear transformations (in the form of 
rule bases) which give good predictive accuracy on a data-set. 
Unlike the generic fuzzy logic models, the outputs from the 
Fuzzy-Bayesian models are probabilistic and as demonstrated 
in the paper, can be used for regression, classif i cation and also 
rule base selection tasks. Apart from synthetic examples, the 
approach is also demonstrated on a real life application in 
the i nancial services sector and is especially suited to small 
and medium data-sets. Extensive discussions are included 
for the relationship of this methodology with other machine 
learning methods and potential pitfalls like improper choice

Financial Risk Management
: In finance, this approach might be used to model the uncertainty in market conditions, integrating expert rules (e.g., guidelines from experienced traders or financial analysts) with data-driven learning to better predict risk and make investment decisions.
Healthcare
: In medicine, Fuzzy Bayesian Learning can help in diagnosis by combining expert medical knowledge in the form of rules with patient data to create more personalized and probabilistic diagnostic models.
Environmental Modeling
: This approach might be used to model complex environmental phenomena where fuzzy rules could capture human expert understanding of an ecosystem, and Bayesian learning refines these rules using actual data.
Manufacturing Quality Control
: Here, fuzzy logic can capture the expert knowledge of quality inspectors, and Bayesian methods can learn and refine these rules based on actual quality inspection data.
Customer Behavior Prediction
: In marketing, understanding customer behavior can be complex. Fuzzy rules can represent expert marketing insights, and Bayesian learning can help refine these rules by analyzing customer interaction data.
If you mentioned the St. Petersburg Paradox earlier, this is typically related to decision theory and expected utility. It's possible to make a connection by thinking of the Fuzzy Bayesian Learning as a complex decision-making framework where uncertainty is considered in different forms (fuzzy logic for ambiguity and vagueness, Bayesian learning for statistical uncertainty). This might be applied to model the decision-making behavior in paradoxical situations like the St. Petersburg Paradox by giving a richer and more nuanced way of representing uncertainty.
If you can provide more details about the prior discussion, I can tailor these examples more closely to your context.

Thank you for the context! Based on what you've shared, here's how the Fuzzy Bayesian Learning approach might relate to the previous discussion:
St. Petersburg Paradox
: This paradox challenges traditional expected utility theory by presenting a game with infinite expected value but, in practice, most people would not pay a large amount to play it. The Fuzzy Bayesian Learning could represent a more nuanced model of human decision-making by incorporating both vagueness in human reasoning (via fuzzy logic) and uncertainty in statistical terms (via Bayesian inference).
"Bernoulli's Fallacy" by Aubrey Clayton
: This book engages with the foundational aspects of probability and statistics. The Fuzzy Bayesian Learning model might be seen as a continuation of this exploration, integrating human reasoning's fuzziness with the probabilistic reasoning found in Bayesian inference.
Frequentist vs. Bayesian Approaches
: The Fuzzy Bayesian approach incorporates Bayesian statistics, which allows for the incorporation of prior beliefs and updating those beliefs with new data. This ties back to the comparison between frequentist and Bayesian philosophies. Fuzzy logic adds an additional layer, allowing for modeling of imprecise or subjective information that might not be captured in pure Bayesian or frequentist approaches.
Type I and Type II Errors
: These concepts relate to errors in statistical hypothesis testing. The Fuzzy Bayesian approach could be applied to minimize these errors by integrating expert knowledge (through fuzzy rules) with learning from data (through Bayesian inference). This hybrid approach might offer a more robust model that could be fine-tuned to reduce both false positives (Type I) and false negatives (Type II) in a particular application.
In terms of practical applications, the detailed explanation earlier still stands. The Fuzzy Bayesian Learning method's innovative combination of fuzzy logic with Bayesian inference offers a rich and nuanced way to represent uncertainty, allowing for potential applications in fields where both human expert judgment and statistical learning from data are valuable.

Connections with this: him talk about that, I immediately realized that what he was saying could easily be formalized by an application of Bayes��� rule, and that this would serve to demonstrate the strength and coherence of his more holistic theory-focused approach to philosophy as a separate method from the traditional deductive approach.

Therefore, the goals of this essay are, first, to do an analysis of the structure of deductive arguments in Bayesian and pragmatic terms; second, on the basis of this analysis, assess the efficacy and pitfalls of such deductive arguments; and finally, third, to sketch an alternative approach to philosophical argumentation, based on comparing holistic theories on the basis of intellectual cost and explanatory power, and compare the pros and cons of that approach with the traditional argumentative approach.

The passage you've shared appears to focus on the application of Bayes' rule to the analysis of deductive arguments and a more holistic theory-focused approach to philosophy. Here's how it connects with the previous topics:
St. Petersburg Paradox and Bernoulli's Fallacy
: Both these topics involve challenges to traditional mathematical reasoning. The application of Bayes' rule in philosophical argumentation could be seen as an extension of this theme, using statistical reasoning to analyze and formalize philosophical thought.
Frequentist vs. Bayesian Approaches
: The focus on using Bayes' rule reflects the preference for a Bayesian approach over the frequentist approach. In philosophy, this could mean incorporating prior knowledge and subjective probability, mirroring the integration of human-like reasoning with statistical methods in Fuzzy Bayesian Learning.
Type I and Type II Errors
: While not directly related, the assessment of the efficacy and pitfalls of deductive arguments might touch on errors or biases in reasoning, analogous to statistical errors. A Bayesian approach could provide tools for analyzing these issues.
Fuzzy Bayesian Learning
: The idea of combining Bayesian methods with a more holistic theory-focused approach resonates with the Fuzzy Bayesian Learning model. Just as Fuzzy Bayesian Learning integrates fuzzy logic with Bayesian inference to model uncertainty and human-like reasoning, the approach in the passage you shared combines Bayes' rule with a broader philosophical method to analyze and assess arguments.
Applications in Philosophy
: The method outlined in the passage could be used to analyze and compare different philosophical theories, assessing them based on intellectual cost and explanatory power. This represents a novel application of Bayesian reasoning and may serve as an interesting example of how statistical methods can be applied outside of traditional scientific or mathematical contexts.
In summary, the connections lie in the shared focus on Bayesian methods, the integration of different forms of reasoning (such as fuzzy logic or holistic theory-focused approaches), and the application of these methods to novel areas like philosophy or decision-making.

A Fuzzy Bayesian Analysis of Deductive Argumentation
26 Jan 2022

Now that I���ve finally gotten around to writing out some of the more fundamental components of my epistemology,1 I can at last proceed to writing one of the articles that I���ve been planning to do pretty much since I started writing on this blog months ago: a fuzzy Bayesian analysis of deductive philosophical argumentation. This was inspired in part by a discussion of how arguments work on the part of Dr. Graham Oppy. In that interview, he discusses how deductive arguments in philosophy are actually far less effective than they are typically supposed to be, at least in more classically-inclined circles (e.g. philosophy of religion).

Thank you for providing additional context. It seems the focus here is a specific application of Fuzzy Bayesian Analysis to the evaluation of deductive philosophical argumentation, inspired by Dr. Graham Oppy's insights on the effectiveness of such arguments.
Here's how this additional information connects to the previous topics:
Fuzzy Bayesian Analysis of Deductive Argumentation
: The fusion of fuzzy logic with Bayesian analysis in philosophy mirrors the Fuzzy Bayesian Learning method. Both approaches aim to represent and analyze uncertainty, combining fuzzy sets (capturing vagueness) and Bayesian inference (updating probabilities based on data). In the context of deductive argumentation, this could provide a more nuanced understanding of how arguments work, considering the vagueness and uncertainty inherent in philosophical concepts.
St. Petersburg Paradox and Bernoulli's Fallacy
: These can be seen as instances where traditional mathematical reasoning fails to capture human intuition. Similarly, Dr. Oppy's comments suggest that traditional deductive arguments in philosophy might not always be effective. Fuzzy Bayesian analysis could offer a tool to reconcile mathematical analysis with human reasoning in both contexts.
Frequentist vs. Bayesian Approaches
: The use of Bayesian methods in this context continues to emphasize the flexibility of Bayesian thinking in various fields, including philosophy.
Applying to Philosophy of Religion and Other Areas
: The specific mention of classical philosophical fields, such as the philosophy of religion, shows how statistical methodologies like Fuzzy Bayesian Analysis can be applied even in disciplines traditionally far removed from mathematical and statistical thinking.
Critical Evaluation of Deductive Reasoning
: The blog seems to be critical of the effectiveness of traditional deductive arguments in philosophy, perhaps implying that they are too rigid or fail to capture the complexities of philosophical thinking. This critique aligns with the emphasis on incorporating human-like reasoning and complexity into mathematical models, like Fuzzy Bayesian Learning.
In summary, the shared theme across these connections is the application of complex statistical methodologies, specifically those that blend fuzzy logic and Bayesian inference, to fields where uncertainty, vagueness, and human-like reasoning are key. This includes philosophical argumentation, decision-making processes, and possibly areas like finance or health, where Fuzzy Bayesian Learning could also be applied.

Before I move on to the next phase of this essay, let me briefly discuss a few other miscellaneous notes which, while probably intuitively obvious, still deserve to be stated explicitly.

First of all, when a premise is actually the combination of multiple propositions through various conjunctions, the probability of the premise being true is constituted by the individual probabilities of each of the propositions which compose the premise, combined according to the statistical rules for each of the conjunctions involved.

Second, following on from points I made in my first essay on fuzzy Bayesian logic, assigning specific probabilities to propositions and arguments is a very dangerous game, more likely to lead to nonsense and the appearance of certainty than it is to actually get you closer to the truth. The point of these mathematical equations is more to demonstrate general rules of thumb and approaches from combining or relating the fuzzy, intuitive confidence levels you have in your head. I only specify specific values for things to make the examples a bit easier to understand, but you have to realize that they���re just toy examples with random values.

One thing you might have noticed while I was going through the examples above is that, on the whole, deductive arguments just aren���t that effective. After all, if you need all of the premises of your argument to be true simultaneously for the conclusion to be true, that���s a really big burden; the probability that you���ll get what you want given that we don���t live in a world of absolute certainty scales inversely geometrically with the number of premises you have. This is why science, which increases statistical credences in hypothesis by way of going out and checking them directly, where the only possible error is the likelihood of getting a result that makes it look like your hypothesis is true without it actually being true, is so much more effective than armchair logic. Instead of building a conclusion on a house of cards that could fail if even a single premise turns out to be wrong, when all of them have a non-insignificant chance of being wrong, it just skips directly to demonstrating whether the final proposition you are interested in proving or disproving is a useful way to look at the world.

This is also why arguments that have a lot of premises, while they look impressive, are actually incredibly dubious and weak. After all, the more premises you have, the more certain you have to be in all your premises to have even the bare minimum level of certainty in your conclusion. Take, for example, Plantinga���s modal ontological argument:

There is a possible world W in which there exists a being with maximal greatness.

Maximal greatness entails having maximal excellence in every possible world.

Maximal excellence entails omniscience, omnipotence, and moral perfection in every possible world.

So in W there exists a being which is omniscient, omnipotent, and morally perfect in every possible world.

So in W the proposition ���There is no omniscient, omnipotent, and morally perfect being��� is impossible.

But what is impossible in one possible world is impossible in every possible world.

So the proposition ���There is no omniscient, omnipotent, and morally perfect being��� is impossible in the actual world.

So there is in the actual world an omniscient, omnipotent, and morally perfect being.2

For the argument to justifiably even slightly budge someone���s credence in the theory that a god exists up from being agnostic or even negative toward it, the soundness probability of the argument needs to be at least \(51%\). That means that the probabilities of each of the premises being sound need to all multiply up to at least \(51%\). We can estimate the average necessary soundness probability for each premise, therefore, by calculating the seventh root of \(0.51\), which is \(0.908\). This means that we would need to be on average 91% sure of each of these problematic and hotly contested, abstract, premises. And even that 0.51% would be a drop in the bucket compared to the inherent improbability of a maximally great being existing.

The inherent uncertainty of the premises of an argument, and the resulting weakness of philosophical arguments in general, is not actually the only problem with deductive philosophical arguments. Since the rules of logic themselves are constructed by human philosophers, in an attempt to describe what they think constitutes the rules of meaning and basic ontology, they themselves are not strictly certain, and so some logical rules, which are not directly entailed by the criteria for meaning I covered in my previous epistemology article, bring with them their own kind of uncertainty. For instance, the validity of the S5 axiom of modal logic when it pertains to metaphysical truth is hotly contested in some circles, and so the use of this axiom should be considered as something that decreases the likelihood that an argument is valid. Furthermore, the specific way that you actually run logical rules on your premises may even be incorrect, and the likelihood of this also increases with the size and complexity of your argument. All of this is why if you���re going to criticize an argument, you don���t actually have to point to one of the premises, you can instead call out problems and equivocations that happen in-between the premises and the conclusion. All of these factors must also be integrated into the probability that an argument actually demonstrates its premise, turning the ���soundness probability��� I���ve been talking about so far into a ���demonstration probability��� that includes both soundness and validity.

4
This indicates a core problem with philosophical argumentation as it has been done in the past, since at least Aristotle. Simply sitting back in your armchair and coming up with a list of premises and assumptions that seem likely to you, based on your own intuitions, and then stringing them together into long streams of argumentation is just not effective enough when you actually treat the credence levels you should have in your premises with honesty and humility. What, then, should we do? Should philosophers retreat to conceptual analysis and clarification, philosophy of science, math, and logic, synthesizing the conclusions of science together, and documenting and understanding properties of the human condition (whether in the manner of phenomenologists and epistemologists or existentialists)? While these are all worthy goals, and are actually the fields that I am most interested in and in which I think the discipline of philosophy has the most to offer, there is nevertheless a place for philosophy in cosmology and metaphysics too ��� it is just that a different route must be taken to ensure it remains useful in those areas.

This is where Graham Oppy���s views on the nature of philosophical argumentation come in. Instead of focusing on arguments for particular conclusions, which are necessarily piecemeal and therefore fall afoul of the geometric decrease in probability as the number of premises grow, one should consider holistic theories concerning some subject, and compare the explanatory and predictive power of the theory, as well as the intellectual virtues the theory demonstrates as a whole, with the intellectual ���cost��� of the theory. This approach relies primarily on the ability to state a set of core premises and then use conceptual analysis to elaborate on their implications, in order to derive specific hypothesis and sub-theories, instead of one���s ability to construct deductive philosophical arguments of the kind spoken about above. Moreover, it directly maps the process of choosing beliefs concerning some phenomena onto the underlying pragmatic reasons that we choose beliefs, instead of being based on logic, which is in turn based on those pragmatic reasons, and therefore only being based on pragmatic reasons by proxy. This also allows you to apply the fuzzy Bayesian logic described in my previous articles more directly and conveniently to the theories themselves.

In conclusion, then, applying my fuzzy Bayesian reasoning to theories of certain phenomena as a whole, according to their intellectual virtues and costs, and relying on science to demonstrate the predictive power of such theories, is by far superior to relying on deductive philosophical argument, due to the inherent nature of how uncertainty interacts with deductive arguments

The lengthy excerpt you've provided offers a compelling critique of traditional deductive philosophical argumentation, particularly emphasizing the limitations and pitfalls of relying on long chains of premises and deductive logic. Here's how the information in the text relates to the concepts discussed earlier:
Combination of Multiple Propositions
: The text explains that the probability of a premise, constituted by multiple propositions, must be calculated according to statistical rules. This aligns with the integration of probabilities and statistical techniques in understanding logical arguments, a principle applicable in both Bayesian and fuzzy Bayesian analysis.
Danger of Assigning Specific Probabilities
: The warning against attaching specific numerical values to confidence levels in premises and conclusions speaks to the complexity and nuanced nature of human reasoning, something fuzzy logic seeks to capture.
Ineffectiveness of Deductive Arguments
: The author critiques the ineffectiveness of traditional deductive arguments, particularly when they are complex and multi-premise. This echoes the concerns expressed by Dr. Graham Oppy and leads to a call for an alternative approach.
Weakness of Complex Arguments
: By using an example like Plantinga���s modal ontological argument, the author demonstrates that the more premises an argument has, the weaker it becomes, as the certainty in the conclusion decreases with the uncertainty in each premise.
Incorporation of Uncertainty in Logic
: The author recognizes that even the rules of logic themselves may have uncertainty, bringing more complexity into assessing the validity and soundness of arguments.
A New Approach - Holistic Theories
: Dr. Graham Oppy's view is leveraged here to propose a different way of engaging with philosophical questions. By focusing on holistic theories and assessing their explanatory power, predictive ability, intellectual virtues, and costs, the process aligns more closely with the way people naturally evaluate beliefs. This approach can leverage fuzzy Bayesian logic directly.
Fuzzy Bayesian Reasoning Applied to Theories
: The conclusion highlights that the author���s fuzzy Bayesian reasoning can be applied to theories as a whole, relying on their intellectual virtues and costs, and utilizing science for predictive power. This superior method contrasts sharply with traditional deductive philosophical arguments.
The overall connection between this text and previous discussions centers on the need for more nuanced and complex methods of argumentation and reasoning that can handle the inherent uncertainty, complexity, and human-like nature of philosophical thinking. It also reflects the broader trend of incorporating statistical and probabilistic thinking into various fields, including philosophy, to arrive at more robust conclusions. The critique of traditional deductive logic and the endorsement of a more holistic, fuzzy Bayesian approach represents a significant shift in philosophical methodology and aligns with modern statistical approaches.

Abstract
This paper presents a novel, efficient fuzzy rule-based Bayesian reasoning ( FuRBaR ) approach for prioritizing failures in failure mode and effects analysis ( FMEA ). The technique is specifically intended to deal with some of the drawbacks concerning the use of conventional fuzzy logic (i.e. rule-based) methods in FMEA . In the proposed approach, subjective belief degrees are assigned to the consequent part of the rules to model the incompleteness encountered in establishing the knowledge base. A Bayesian reasoning mechanism is then used to aggregate all relevant rules for assessing and prioritizing potential failure modes. A series of case studies of collision risk between a floating, production, storage, and off loading ( FPSO ) system and a shuttle tanker caused by technical failure during tandem off loading operation is used to illustrate the application of the proposed model. The reliability of the new approach is tested by using a benchmarking technique (with a well-established fuzzy rule-based evidential reasoning method), and a sensitivity analysis of failure priority values.

The abstract you provided refers to a research paper that introduces a novel method called "Fuzzy Rule-Based Bayesian Reasoning" (FuRBaR) for prioritizing failures in Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Here's a summary of the key aspects and how they relate to the topic you were discussing earlier:
Novel Approach (FuRBaR)
: The paper presents a new method that combines fuzzy rule-based systems with Bayesian reasoning. This combination aims to tackle specific challenges in the field of FMEA.
Addressing Drawbacks in Conventional Methods
: Traditional fuzzy logic methods in FMEA have limitations. The proposed approach seeks to rectify these by modeling the incompleteness encountered in establishing the knowledge base.
Use of Subjective Belief Degrees
: The system allows for the inclusion of subjective belief degrees within the rules, allowing for a more nuanced and flexible understanding of uncertainty, which aligns with the themes of uncertainty and complexity discussed earlier.
Bayesian Reasoning for Aggregation
: By employing Bayesian reasoning, the system can aggregate various rules to assess and prioritize potential failure modes. This offers a more dynamic and probabilistic way of understanding risk, aligning with the prior discussion of Bayesian methods in philosophy.
Real-World Application and Testing
: The model's applicability is demonstrated through case studies related to collision risks between floating systems and tankers. Its reliability is further validated through benchmarking and sensitivity analysis.
Connection to Prior Discussion
: The method discussed in this abstract continues the theme of integrating fuzzy logic with Bayesian reasoning to handle complex, uncertain scenarios. While the application here is in engineering (specifically in risk assessment and failure analysis), the underlying principles of combining human-like reasoning (fuzzy logic) with probabilistic thinking (Bayesian reasoning) are consistent with the earlier discussions on philosophical argumentation.
The abstract illustrates how the integration of fuzzy logic with Bayesian reasoning is not just a philosophical concept but has practical applications in various fields, including engineering and risk analysis. It's a testament to the growing recognition that traditional binary logic systems may not be sufficient for modeling the complex, nuanced, and often uncertain realities encountered in various domains.

It appears that you've posted an abstract and part of the introduction from a paper by Stephen F. Gull on Bayesian Inductive Inference and Maximum Entropy. The text reviews the principles of Bayesian reasoning and applies them to problems of inference from data sampled from specific probability distributions.
In the work, Bayesian principles are used to carefully test hypotheses, taking into consideration prior ranges of any parameters involved. This careful consideration leads to quantitative statements within the framework of Occam's Razor.
The text also mentions the Maximum Entropy principle, often referred to as MaxEnt, which is a method used for probability distribution modeling. It appears that the text is cut off after that, so the explanation of how MaxEnt is connected to Bayesian inference is missing.
The paper likely delves into the theoretical underpinnings and applications of Bayesian reasoning and the Maximum Entropy principle, demonstrating their importance in statistical inference and problem-solving. It seems to be a tutorial guide to Bayesian methods, showing the application of the method to specific problems, including curve-fitting. Without the full text, it's difficult to elaborate further on the specific content and conclusions of the paper.

It appears that the text you have shared is a continuation of the previous content, focusing on the practical application of Bayesian methods and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) principle. The discussion seems to be centered around how Bayesian reasoning can deal with likelihood factors and the scale parameter, specifically in the context of regression analysis.
Here's a brief summary of the concepts discussed:
Divergence and Likelihood Factors:
The text discusses the impact of finite likelihood factors and the influence of the prior on the learning process. A strong prior could, in theory, override the data, rendering the model unable to learn from it.
Range Parameter and Scaling:
There is a discussion about a specific parameter

B
and its limits, showing how these limits can affect the model's capacity to learn from the data.
Conclusions and Applications:
The text emphasizes the simplicity and power of Bayesian methods, illustrating how Bayes' rule and MaxEnt can be used to manipulate probabilities and assign probability distributions. It also points out that the selection of a suitable hypothesis space and the definition of a range of allowed values for any parameters involved are crucial for solving the problem at hand.
Penalty for Introducing New Parameters:
The text mentions that the introduction of new parameters leads to a "collapse" of the hypothesis space hyper-volume, resulting in a penalty. This concept, which was described by Jeffreys, is highlighted as something that deserves more attention.
Optimal Number of Parameters in Regression Analysis:
A tentative solution is offered for determining the optimal number of parameters in regression analysis, focusing on treating all expansion orders equally.
The content seems to be part of a broader discussion on applying Bayesian reasoning to specific statistical problems, including regression analysis. By employing Bayesian methods, the text illustrates the flexibility in handling complex probabilistic scenarios, the integration of prior beliefs with observed data, and the potential challenges in doing so. Without additional context or specific questions, this summary covers the key concepts presented. If you have any specific questions or need further clarification, please let me know!

Apologies for the oversight. Here's an updated summary:
The conversation titled "Fuzzy Bayesian Logic" started with an in-depth discussion of the St. Petersburg Paradox, exploring the historical and mathematical aspects of this famous problem. We considered an article that provides insights into the paradox and the foundational principles of expected utility theory.
Next, we delved into the book "Bernoulli's Fallacy," discussing the work of Daniel Bernoulli and the implications of his utility theory. This led to a broader conversation about utility functions, risk aversion, and the impact on modern economics and decision-making.
After that, we shifted our focus to Fuzzy Bayesian Logic, exploring a Fuzzy Rule-Based Bayesian Reasoning (FuRBaR) approach for prioritizing failures in Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). We examined Fuzzy Bayesian Reasoning (FBR) in various contexts, including climate risk assessment in transportation networks.
We also explored broader Bayesian principles, with a particular focus on Stephen F. Gull's work on Bayesian inductive inference and Maximum Entropy. This exploration included technical aspects of Bayesian reasoning, hypothesis testing, and the application of Bayesian methods in diverse fields.
Overall, the conversation wove together historical paradoxes, utility theory, fuzzy logic, and Bayesian reasoning to illuminate the complexity and breadth of these interconnected mathematical and philosophical concepts.

Certainly! Fuzzy Bayesian Logic is a fusion of fuzzy logic and Bayesian reasoning, and it was touched upon in our conversation through the exploration of Fuzzy Bayesian Reasoning (FBR) models.
Fuzzy Logic
: Fuzzy logic extends classical (Boolean) logic to handle uncertainty and imprecision. It does this by allowing values to have degrees of membership in a set, rather than just "true" or "false." This can be very useful in modeling complex systems where information might be vague or incomplete.
Bayesian Reasoning
: Bayesian reasoning is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. It's a way of incorporating prior knowledge and observed data to calculate the probability of a particular outcome or state.
Fuzzy Bayesian Reasoning (FBR)
: Combining these two concepts, Fuzzy Bayesian Reasoning uses fuzzy logic to deal with uncertainty in the priors, likelihoods, or evidence within a Bayesian framework. It essentially incorporates the 'fuzziness' of information into Bayesian models, allowing for a more nuanced and flexible approach to statistical inference.
In our conversation, we discussed examples of how Fuzzy Bayesian Reasoning was used in evaluating climate risks in the UK road transport networks and as an innovative decision-aiding tool in quantitative analysis.
Fuzzy Bayesian Logic, therefore, represents a sophisticated approach to dealing with uncertainty, by blending the crisp probabilistic reasoning of Bayesian methods with the more nuanced, gradated approach of fuzzy logic. It can be particularly useful in complex systems where data may be imprecise, ambiguous, or incomplete.
