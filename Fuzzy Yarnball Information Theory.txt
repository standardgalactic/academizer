History has the power to expose the origin and evolution of scientif i c ideas. How did 
humanity come to visualize the Sun as a gaseous plasma? Why is its interior thought to 
contain blackbody radiation? Who were the i rst people to postulate that the density of 
the solar body varied greatly with depth? When did mankind i rst conceive that the solar 
surface was merely an illusion? What were the foundations of such thoughts? In this 
regard, a detailed review of the Sunâs thermodynamic history provides both a necessary 
exposition of the circumstance which accompanied the acceptance of the gaseous mod- 
els and a sound basis for discussing modern solar theories. It also becomes an invitation 
to reconsider the phase of the photosphere. As such, in this work, the contributions of 
Pierre Simon Laplace, Alexander Wilson, William Herschel, Hermann von Helmholtz, 
Herbert Spencer, Richard Christopher Carrington, John Frederick William Herschel, 
Father Pietro Angelo Secchi, HervÂ´ e August Etienne Albans Faye, Edward Frankland, 
Joseph Norman Lockyer, Warren de la Rue, Balfour Stewart, Benjamin Loewy, and 
Gustav Robert Kirchhof f , relative to the evolution of modern stellar models, will be 
discussed. Six great pillars created a gaseous Sun: 1) Laplaceâs Nebular Hypothesis, 
2) Helmholtzâ contraction theory of energy production, 3) Andrewâs elucidation of crit- 
ical temperatures, 4) Kirchhof f âs formulation of his law of thermal emission, 5) PlÂ¨ ucker 
and Hittorfâs discovery of pressure broadening in gases, and 6) the evolution of the stel- 
lar equations of state. As these are reviewed, this work will venture to highlight not 
only the genesis of these revolutionary ideas, but also the forces which drove great men 
to advance a gaseous Sun. 
1On the history of solar science 
Pondering upon the history of solar science [1â14], it be- 
comes apparent that, in every age, the dominant theory of the 
internal constitution of the Sun ref l ected the state of human 
knowledge. As understanding of the physical world grew, the 
theories of old were slowly transformed. Eventually, under 
the burden of evidence, ancient ideas were destined to disap- 
pear completely from the realm of science, relinquished to the 
sphere of historical curiosity [2]. What was once considered 
high thought, became discarded. 
Ifscienceistoadvance, historicalanalysismustnotsolely 
reiterate the progress of civilization. Its true merit lies not in 
the reminiscence of facts, the restatement of ancient ideas, 
and the reliving of time. Rather, scientif i c historyâs virtue 
stemsfromtheguidanceitcanimparttotheevolutionofmod- 
ern research. 
Historical compilations, dissected with contemporary sci- 
entif i c reasoning, have the power to expose both the truths 
and the errors which swayed our formation of a gaseous Sun 
[15â21]. These models have evolved as a direct manifesta- 
tion of mankindâs physical knowledge in the 19th and 20th 
centuries. Through historical review, it can be demonstrated 
that virtually every salient fact which endowed the Sun with 
a gaseous interior has actually been refuted or supplanted by 
modern science. Astrophysics, perhaps unaware of the histor- 
ical paths followed by its founders [1â14], has at times over- 
lookedthecontributionsandcriticismsofânon-astronomersâ. 
Perhaps unable to accept the consequences stemming from 
the discoveries of the present age, it has continued to perpet- 
uate ideas which can no longer hold any basis in the physical 
world. 
2Pillars of a gaseous Sun 
Five great pillars gave birth to the gaseous Sun in the middle 
and late 19th century. They were as follows: 1) Laplaceâs 
nebular hypothesis [22, 23], 2) Helmholtzâ contraction the- 
ory [24, 25], 3) Cagniard de la Tourâs discovery of critical 
phenomena [26,27] and Andrewâs elucidation of critical tem- 
peratures [28, 29], 4) Kirchhof f âs formulation of his law of 
thermal emission [30â32], and 5) the discovery of pressure 
broadening in gases by PlÂ¨ ucker, Hittorf, WÂ¨ ullner, Frankland, 
and Lockyer [33â37]. Today, the last four of these pillars 
have collapsed, either as scientif i cally unsound (pillar 4), or 
as irrelevant with respect to discussions of the internal con- 
stitution of the Sun and the nature of the photosphere (pillars 
2, 3, and 5). Only the i rst argument currently survives as rel- 
evant to solar theory, albeit in modif i ed form. Nevertheless, 
each of these doctrines had acted as a driving force in creating 
a gaseous Sun. This was especially true with regards to the 
ideas advanced by Helmholtz, Andrews, Kirchhof f , and those

Volume 3PROGRESS IN PHYSICSJuly, 2011 
who discovered pressure broadening. 
A careful scrutiny of history reveals that, beyond these 
factors, the greatest impulse driving mankind to a gaseous 
Sun was the power of theoretical models. In fact, given that 
all the great experimental forces have evaporated, astrophys- 
ics is left with the wonder of its theoretical formulations. 
Hence, a 6th pillar is introduced: the stellar equations of 
state [15â17]. It is an important foundation, one which re- 
mains intact and whose inf l uence continues to dominate vir- 
tually every aspect of theoretical astrophysics.1 / 1ChatGPTSummary:In "A Thermodynamic History of the Solar Constitution â I: The Journey to a Gaseous Sun," Pierre-Marie Robitaille traces the historical evolution of the understanding of the Sun's constitution, focusing on the notion of the Sun as a gaseous entity. The article raises questions about how and why certain scientific ideas regarding the Sun's nature emerged.The paper highlights:Historical examinations of how humanity came to view the Sun as a gaseous plasma.The role of influential figures like Laplace, Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, and others in the development of modern stellar models.Six foundational pillars that contributed to the conceptualization of a gaseous Sun. These include Laplaceâs Nebular Hypothesis, Helmholtzâs contraction theory, critical temperature elucidations, Kirchhoff's thermal emission law, discoveries related to pressure broadening in gases, and the development of stellar equations of state.Robitaille emphasizes the importance of historical analysis in science, not just as a retrospective activity but as a guide for modern research. The study points out that many of the ideas that underpinned the concept of a gaseous Sun have since been refuted or replaced by modern science. Despite this, some outdated ideas persist, potentially due to a lack of acknowledgment of the contributions and critiques from those outside the field of astronomy.By revisiting the pillars that initially led to the gaseous Sun theory, Robitaille suggests that of the initial five, only the first remains relevant today. However, the influence of theoretical models, introduced as a sixth pillar, continues to be a dominant force in astrophysics.1 / 14.6Discord, stellar opacity, and the birth of the gaseous 
Sun 
Imagine a gaseous Sun. The idea was so tantalizing for men 
of the period that it became a source of instant quarrel for pri- 
ority. Secchi gently rebuked Kirchhof f [95], absolved Faye 
[144], and defended himself against Lockyer [5, p.500â515]. 
Faye, in turn, battled with Kirchhof f [121â127] and after se- 
curing the blessing of Father Secchi [144], was quick to an- 
nouncehisinnocencebeforetheAcadÂ´ emie: âThisletter[from 
Secchi] demonstrates that we followed at the same time, Fa- 
ther Secchi and I, a train of ideas which was altogether sim- 
ilar...â [145, p.468]. Like his English counterparts, Faye 
acted as if he was also unaware of John Herschelâs 1864 arti- 
cle [97]. But what could be said of this coincidence of ideas? 
Was it really possible that, in the span of a few months, Sec- 
chi, Herschel, Faye, Lockyer and Frankland, and de la Rue 
along with Stewart and Loewy all independently conceived 
of the same idea? Faye addressed the question: âWith re- 
spect to the analogies that Father Secchi signals with reason 
between his ideas and mine, coincidences of this type of f er 
nothing which can surprise, identical ones [ideas] are pro- 
duced every time that a question is ripe and is ready for a 
solutionâ [145]. But surely, the argument could not be ex- 
tended to every prominent astronomer of the period. Being 
i rst and very likely ignorant of Spencerâs English text [104], 
only Secchi could claim truly independent thought. 
After hearing from the Jesuit astronomer, Faye i nally 
cited Magnus [145, p.471], the scientif i c element which was 
central to his model, but which, unlike Secchi, he had so ne- 
glected in his earlier works. However, if one accounted for 
Spencerâs and Secchiâs ideas in Fayeâs famous papers [111, 
112], there was not much left as original thought. The most 
signif i cant exception was Fayeâs idea that the photosphere of 
the Sun was devoid of a real surface [13, p.42], also advanced 
in Les Mondes [143]. Faye believed that the âpresence of the 
photosphere does not interrupt the continuity of the [central] 
massâ of the Sun [143, p.301] and insisted that âThis limit is 
in any case only apparent, the general milieu where the pho- 
tosphere is incessantly forming surpasses without doubt more 
or less the highest crests or the summits of the incandescent 
cloudsâ [143, p.298]. Such was the i rst consequence of the 
gaseous models: there could be no def i ned solar surface. The 
problem continues to haunt astrophysics to this day [57,146]. 
With Faye, the Sun lost its distinct surface. 
It is evident that Faye never properly acknowledged Spen- 
cer [120, p.235]. Nonetheless, he remained delighted that 
his works had been immediately reviewed in The Reader by 
Lockyer, as evidenced by his 1865 letter [145]. As such, it 
is doubtful, as early as 1865, that he never knew of Spencerâs 
rebuttal [105]. Faye behaved as if concerns against his âtrans- 
parent solar interiorâ originated exclusively from Kirchhof f 
as late as 1866 [121]. In fact, it was clear that the criticism of 
seeing through the Sun had been swiftly leveled by Spencer 
[105, p.228]. Since Kirchhof f was a friend of Roscoe [61], it 
was not unlikely that he quickly became aware of The Reader 
series.Once again, Spencer wrote: âBut if these interior 
gases are non-luminous from the absence of precipitated mat- 
ter must they not for the same reason be transparent? And if 
transparent, will not the light from the remote side of the pho- 
tosphere, seen through them, be nearly as bright as that from 
the side next to us?â [105, p.228]. Meadows argued that this 
criticism of Fayeâs work originated from Balfour Stewart [13, 
p.41â42], but did so without citation. In fact, the reference 
to Balfour Stewart was provided by Norman Lockyer, when 
he reprinted his letters, in 1874, and added a footnote giving 
credit to Balfour Stewart over Kirchhof f [5, p.57], well after 
Spencer made his case. This was how Lockyer distorted the 
scientif i c record using a footnote: âThis note was added to 
the article as it originally appeared, as the result of a conver- 
sation with my friend Dr. Balfour Stewart. I am more anxious 
to state this, as to him belongs the credit of the objection, al- 
though, as it was some time afterwards put forward by Kirch- 
hof f , the latter is now credited with it, although it was noticed 
by Faye, Comptes Rendus, vol.lxiii, p.235, 1866. The idea is 
this: â If the interior solar gases are feeble radiators, then, 
on the theory of exchanges, they must be feeble absorbers; 
hence they will be incompetent to absorb the light coming 
through the hypothetically gaseous Sun from the photosphere 
ontheotherside(1873)â[5,p.57]. Onecanonlywonderwhy 
the discoverer of Helium, one of the great fathers of spectral 
analysis, and the founder of the journal Nature, insisted on 
altering the historical record. Apparently, Spencer was not as 
weak in thermodynamics, as previously argued [106]. 
4.7Stewart, Kirchhof f , and amateurs 
Stewart had been an author on the initial paper with de la Rue 
and Loewy [133â135]. But suddenly, he detached himself 
from this position when he discussed the photosphere, with- 
out invoking the presence of a gas: âNext with regard to the 
photosphere or luminous envelope of the Sun, this surface, 
when viewed through powerful telescopes, appears granu- 
lated or mottled... But besides this there is reason to believe 
that great def i ning as well as magnifying power discloses the 
fact that the whole photosphere of the Sun is made up of 
detached bodies, interlacing one another, and preserving a 
greatamountofregularitybothinformandsizeâ[147]. Thus, 
when Stewart wrote independently, it was obvious that he ac- 
20Robitaille P.-M. A Thermodynamic History of the Solar Constitution â I: The Journey to a Gaseous Sun 
July, 2011PROGRESS IN PHYSICSVolume 3 
tually believed that the photosphere was a liquid or solid. In 
this respect, he became aligned with Spencer and Kirchhof f 
on the condensed nature of the photosphere. 
In his Lessons in Elementary Physics, Stewart persisted in 
breaking from de la Rue and Loewy [148, p.279]. This was 
the case even in the edition published closest to the end of his 
life. Inthisclassictextforitsday, Stewartstated: âIfwethrow 
upontheslitofourspectroscopeanimageoftheSunorofone 
of the stars, with the view of obtaining its spectrum, we i nd a 
large number of black or dark lines in a spectrum otherwise 
continuous, and we argue from this that in the Sun or stars we 
start with a solid or liquid substance, or at any rate with some 
substance which gives us a continuous spectrum, and that be- 
tween this and the eye we have, forming a solar or stellar 
atmosphere, a layer of gas or vapours of a comparatively low 
temperature, each of which produces its appropriate spectral 
lines, only dark on account of the temperature of the vapours 
being lower than that of the substance which gives the contin- 
uous spectrumâ [148, p.279]. Again, there was no mention of 
a gaseous photosphere supporting condensed matter precipi- 
tates in this description of the problem. In fact, this passage 
echoed Kirchhof f âs explanation [43], as Stewart was all too 
aware of the nature of thermal emission in gases [149].1 / 1ChatGPTThis passage delves deep into the history and debate surrounding the gaseous model of the Sun. Here are the main points:Historical Debate: Multiple figures from the 19th centuryâSecchi, Herschel, Faye, Lockyer, and othersâwere in the mix of conceiving the idea of a gaseous Sun. Such coincidental independent thoughts usually arise when a scientific question is on the verge of an answer.Role of Spencer: Spencer's observations and rebuttals were not given the importance they deserved. He proposed that if the Sun's interior gases were non-luminous and lacked precipitated matter, they would be transparent, which would make the Sun appear almost uniformly bright. Spencer's insight into thermodynamics was significant, challenging the existing thoughts of his time.Kirchhoff's Objection: Kirchhoff, leaning on the same logic as Spencer, argued against the transparent solar interior model. His ideas, although presented later, gained more traction in the community.Lockyer's Footnote: Lockyer, a significant figure in spectral analysis and the discoverer of Helium, gave credit to Balfour Stewart for the objection to the transparent solar model, although the objection was initially presented by Spencer.Stewart's Position: Balfour Stewart, who initially collaborated with de la Rue and Loewy, eventually took a different position. He believed the photosphere of the Sun to be more solid or liquid, going against the prevailing gaseous model. His stance aligned more with Spencer and Kirchhoff. Stewart's later works clearly favored a condensed nature of the photosphere.Nature of the Photosphere: A significant takeaway is the ongoing debate on the nature of the Sun's photosphere. Is it gaseous? Solid or liquid? Does it have a defined surface? The article outlines the historical debates and positions of various astronomers and physicists on this topic.In summary, the passage portrays a vivid picture of the intense scientific debates and collaborations of the 19th century surrounding the nature of the Sun. The differing viewpoints and the challenge of establishing priority in scientific discovery are evident throughout.1 / 1Hence, the Scottish physicist very much desired that the 
photosphere be condensed, as evidenced initially in his 1864 
article: On the Origin of Light in the Sun and Stars [150]. 
In this work, Stewart advanced that planets could alter the 
brightness of stars by modifying the amount of sunspots. He 
tried to answer the question âFrom all this it is evident that in 
the case of many stars we cannot suppose the light to be due 
to an incandescent solid or liquid body, otherwise how can 
we account for their long continued disappearance?â [150, 
p.452]. The entire manuscript was aimed at accounting for 
this disappearance, even if the photosphere was solid or liq- 
uid.He stated in this regard âif it can be proved, as we 
think it can, that a disc full of spots is def i cient in luminos- 
ityâ [150, p.452]. Stewart made this conjecture to explain the 
occurrence of variables [150]. For him, the photosphere had 
to be liquid or solid. But variable stars posed a tremendous 
scientif i c dif i culty. As a result, he required something like 
planets to modify their emission cycles [150]. Stewart recon- 
ciled his desire for a liquid or solid photosphere within these 
types of stars by stating: âthe approach of a planet to the 
Sun is favourable to luminosityâ [150, p.454]. His desire for 
condensed matter was so powerful that Stewart advocated the 
scientif i c error that Venus itself can modify the appearance of 
sunspots [150, p.454]. Regrettably, Stewart would eventually 
discover Loewyâs misconduct while producing mathematical 
reductions relative to the work at Kew [151, p.361]. This 
would place a considerable tarnish on the Kew group, and 
Stewart would never again speak on planetary ef f ects relative 
to sunspots. 
Earlier, in Origin of Light [150, p.450â451] Stewart had 
viewed sunspots as cavities on the Sun, produced by an open- 
ing in the photospheric matter revealing the dark nucleus of 
the interior. In 1864, just prior to the paper with de la Rue 
and Loewy, Stewart stated that the Sun possessed with a solid 
body [150, p.451]. The concept was similar to Wilson [84]. 
Despite Loewyâs misconduct [151], Stewart could not 
long maintain a fully gaseous photosphere, given his exten- 
sive knowledge of thermal emission in gases [149]. Clearly, 
he had not embraced de la Rueâs model [133â135] and the 
claim by Lockyer, discussed in Section 4.7, that the photo- 
sphere could be completely gaseous and devoid of any con- 
densedmatter[37]. Onthesamenote, Stewartâsentirediscus- 
sion on thermal radiation, in his classic physics text, is well 
worth reading [148, p.270â297]. It revealed his profound 
knowledge of such processes and also his understanding that 
gases cannot produce the continuous spectrum required. 
Stewart maintained support for what is essentially Kirch- 
hof f âs liquid photospheric model. He did so despite his pre- 
vious adversity with the German [61, 139]. In this regard, 
he was being guided by the same scientif i c reasoning as his 
former detractor [43]. The Scottish scientist also held pro- 
found values [140, 141, 150]. As such, it is comforting to 
notice how, in some sense, the two men were now reconciled. 
Stewartâs continued support for Kirchhof f âs condensed pho- 
tosphere, was astounding as it de facto dismissed any previ- 
ous arguments relative to Andrewâs critical temperature [28] 
and line broadening [37]. For Stewart, the primary determi- 
nant of the phase of the photosphere was its thermal emis- 
sion. The same held true for Kirchhof f . Yet, Stewartâs insis- 
tence was important because it continued well after critical 
temperatures and line broadening had entered the halls of as- 
tronomy. Those who maintained that the photosphere was 
gaseous, therefore, continued alone on their journey. They 
marched on without the support of the two great experts in 
thermal radiation: Gustav Kirchhof f and Balfour Stewart. 
As for Spencer, if there was any merit in his work, other 
than his obvious and justif i ed claim of priority, it was that he 
foresaw internal convection currents, variable solar density, 
and the tremendous problem of internal stellar opacity. The 
last of these, contained in the âfamous objectionâ, remains a 
key problem with the idea of a gaseous Sun, despite all at- 
tempts to rectify the situation [69,70]. But what is most fas- 
cinating about this philosopher, remains his amateur status in 
astronomy. Karl Hufbauer has commented on the contribu- 
tions of amateurs to astrophysics [152]. Bartholomew argues 
as though there was little room for Spencer and his theoret- 
ical ideas in solar science [106]. In this regard, he stands 
in profound opposition to George Hale, one of the greatest 
solar observers and the founder of the Astrophysical Jour- 
nal. In 1913, Hale defended the special place of amateurs 
in astronomy when he drafted the moving obituary of Sir 
William Huggins: âIf it be true that modern observatories, 
with their expensive equipment, tend to discourage the seri- 
ous amateur, then it may be doubted whether the best use is 
being made of the funds they represent. For the history of sci- 
Robitaille P.-M. A Thermodynamic History of the Solar Constitution â I: The Journey to a Gaseous Sun21 
Volume 3PROGRESS IN PHYSICSJuly, 2011 
ence teaches that original ideas and new methods, as well as 
great discoveries resulting from the patient accumulation of 
observations, frequently come from the amateur. To hinder 
his work in any serious way might conceivably do a greater 
injury than a large observatory could make good... Every 
investigator may i nd useful and inspiring suggestions in the 
life and example of Sir William Huggins. Their surest mes- 
sage and strongest appeal will be to the amateur with limited 
instrumental means, and to the man, however situated, who 
would break new groundâ [153].1 / 1ChatGPTThis passage delves into the historical perspectives and debates regarding the constitution of the Sun, particularly focusing on its photosphere, and the contributions of various scientists to the understanding of this celestial object.Here are the main points from the passage:Balfour Stewart's Perspective: The Scottish physicist Balfour Stewart proposed in his 1864 article "On the Origin of Light in the Sun and Stars" that planets could influence the brightness of stars by altering the number of sunspots. He sought to explain the variability of some stars and proposed that the photosphere (the Sun's visible surface) had to be in a liquid or solid state.Variable Stars and Sunspots: Variable stars, whose brightness changes over time, posed a challenge to the understanding of stellar constitution. Stewart theorized that planetary interactions could influence these emission cycles. He also speculated that Venus could alter the appearance of sunspots.Misconduct and Impact: Loewy's misconduct in some scientific works related to the Kew group tarnished its reputation, leading Stewart to avoid discussions on planetary effects on sunspots afterward.Sunspots and the Sun's Composition: Stewart believed that sunspots were cavities on the Sun, revealing its dark interior. He, at one point, believed the Sun to possess a solid body, echoing a similar perspective as Wilson.Gaseous vs. Liquid Photosphere: Stewart had extensive knowledge of thermal emission in gases, leading him to resist the idea of a wholly gaseous photosphere. This position contrasted with other scientists like de la Rue and Lockyer. Despite disagreements, Stewart and Kirchhoff shared a similar stance, believing in a condensed photosphere due to its thermal emission properties.Role of Amateurs in Astronomy: The passage touches on the contributions of amateurs in the field of astrophysics, with Spencer being highlighted. While Spencer's work was criticized by some like Bartholomew, others like George Hale recognized the significant impact amateurs could have in the field, often bringing in fresh perspectives and groundbreaking ideas.Quote on Amateurs: Hale's sentiment on amateurs in astronomy emphasizes that original ideas often come from those outside professional circles. He believed that hindering the work of amateurs could be detrimental to the advancement of science.In essence, the passage underscores the evolution of thought regarding the Sun's constitution, the complexities in understanding variable stars and sunspots, and the value amateurs bring to the scientific community.1 / 1A Thermodynamic History of the Solar Constitution - II: The Theory of a Gaseous Sun and Jeansâ Failed Liquid Alternative
Authors: Pierre-Marie Robitaille

In this work, the development of solar theory is followed from the concept that the Sun was an ethereal nuclear body with a partially condensed photosphere to the creation of a fully gaseous object. An overview will be presented of the liquid Sun. A powerful lineage has brought us the gaseous Sun and two of its main authors were the direct scientific descendants of Gustav Robert Kirchhoff: Franz Arthur Friedrich Schuster and Arthur Stanley Eddington. It will be discovered that the seminal ideas of Father Secchi and HervÃ© Faye were not abandoned by astronomy until the beginning of 20th century. The central role of carbon in early solar physics will also be highlighted by revisiting George Johnstone Stoney. The evolution of the gaseous models will be outlined, along with the contributions of Johann Karl Friedrich ZÃ¶llner, James Clerk Maxwell, Jonathan Homer Lane, August Ritter, William Thomson, William Huggins, William Edward Wilson, George Francis FitzGerald, Jacob Robert Emden, Frank Washington Very, Karl Schwarzschild, and Edward Arthur Milne. Finally, with the aid of Edward Arthur Milne, the work of James Hopwood Jeans, the last modern advocate of a liquid Sun, will be rediscovered. Jeans was a staunch advocate of the condensed phase, but deprived of a proper building block, he would eventually abandon his non-gaseous stars. For his part, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar would spend nine years of his life studying homogeneous liquid masses. These were precisely the kind of objects which Jeans had considered for his liquid stars.1 / 1ChatGPTThe text appears to be an abstract or summary of a research article titled "A Thermodynamic History of the Solar Constitution - II: The Theory of a Gaseous Sun and Jeansâ Failed Liquid Alternative" by Pierre-Marie Robitaille.From the provided content, the article aims to discuss the progression of theories surrounding the constitution of the Sun. Here are the primary takeaways:Evolution of Sun's Theory: The paper traces the transformation in solar theory from the belief that the Sun had a partially condensed photosphere originating from an ethereal nuclear body, to the perspective of the Sun being completely gaseous.Liquid Sun Overview: An in-depth look into the concept of a liquid Sun will be provided.Prominent Contributors: Key scientists who championed the theory of a gaseous Sun were influenced by Gustav Robert Kirchhoff. These scientists include Franz Arthur Friedrich Schuster and Arthur Stanley Eddington.Historical Ideas: The article mentions that original ideas from Father Secchi and HervÃ© Faye regarding the Sun were not discarded until the 20th century.Carbon's Role: The significance of carbon in early solar physics is emphasized, with a focus on the contributions of George Johnstone Stoney.Gaseous Model Evolution: The paper will outline the progress and changes in the gaseous models of the Sun, with insights from various renowned scientists like Johann Karl Friedrich ZÃ¶llner, James Clerk Maxwell, Jonathan Homer Lane, and many others.James Hopwood Jeans: Jeans is highlighted as the last major supporter of a liquid Sun. Although he firmly believed in the condensed phase, the absence of a suitable foundational model led him to eventually give up his liquid star theories.Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: Chandrasekhar's work on studying homogeneous liquid masses is noted, as these were the same kind of objects Jeans had envisioned for his liquid stars.In essence, this research aims to provide a comprehensive historical account of the theories surrounding the Sun's constitution, focusing primarily on the transition from liquid to gaseous models and the scientific figures who played pivotal roles in these developments.1 / 1

Abstract
In this brief note, the implications of a condensed Sun will be examined. A celestial body composed of liquid metallic hydrogen brings great promise to astronomy, relative to understanding thermal emission and solar structure. At the same time, as an incom-pressible liquid, a condensed Sun calls into question virtually everything which is cur-rently believed with respect to the evolution and nature of the stars. Should the Sun be condensed, then neutron stars and white dwarfs will fail to reach the enormous densities they are currently believed to possess. Much of cosmology also falls into question, as the incompressibility of matter curtails any thought that a primordial atom once existed. Aging stars can no longer collapse and black holes will know no formative mechanism. A condensed Sun also hints that great strides must still be made in understanding the nature of liquids. The Sun has revealed that liquids possess a much greater potential for lattice order than previously believed. In addition, lessons may be gained with regards to the synthesis of liquid metallic hydrogen and the use of condensed matter as the basis for initiating fusion on Earth. "Young people, especially young women, often ask me for advice. Here it is, valeat quantum. Do not under-take a scientific career in quest of fame or money. There are easier and better ways to reach them. Undertake it only if nothing else will satisfy you; for nothing else is probably what you will receive. Your reward will be the widening of the horizon as you climb. And if you achieve that reward you will ask no other." Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin 1 / 1ChatGPT"Lessons from the Sun" by Pierre-Marie Robitaille appears to delve into the potential implications of a "condensed Sun" theory. Here are the main points from the provided abstract:Condensed Sun Implications: The abstract examines the implications of a Sun that is composed of "liquid metallic hydrogen." Such a constitution for the Sun offers new insights into understanding thermal emission and the structure of the Sun.Questioning Existing Beliefs: If the Sun is indeed in a condensed state, many existing astronomical and astrophysical beliefs and theories might need reconsideration. This includes:The evolution and nature of stars.The assumed extreme densities of neutron stars and white dwarfs.Fundamental aspects of cosmology, including the concept of a "primordial atom."The possibility of star collapse.The formation mechanisms of black holes.Enhanced Understanding of Liquids: A condensed Sun also implies that our understanding of liquids, especially their potential for lattice order, might be inadequate. Liquids may have a higher potential for order than previously assumed.Practical Implications: Insights from this theory might provide directions for the synthesis of liquid metallic hydrogen. It could also guide efforts to use condensed matter for initiating fusion on Earth, which has implications for energy production.Advice for Aspiring Scientists: The abstract concludes with a quote from Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, emphasizing the intangible rewards of a scientific career. She advises young people to pursue science only if they're truly passionate about it, highlighting the inherent challenges but also the unique satisfaction of expanding one's horizons.The abstract poses a challenge to the mainstream understanding of various astrophysical phenomena by presenting an alternate perspective on the Sun's composition. This perspective has the potential to reshape our understanding of many astronomical processes and bodies.1 / 1WhenCeciliaPayne[1]discoveredthatthestarsareprimarily 
composed of hydrogen [2], she encountered strong opposi- 
tion from Arthur Eddington, her i rst mentor, and from Henry 
Norris Russell [3]. Nonetheless, Cecilia Payneâs work engen- 
dered a new age in astronomy: hydrogen became the build- 
ing block of the universe. Russell would eventually come to 
echo Payneâs position [4]. In those days, it was natural to 
assume that a hydrogen-based Sun would be gaseous [5,6]. 
Ten years after Payne published her classic report, Wigner 
and Huntington proposed that condensed metallic hydrogen 
could be synthesized [7]. In so doing, they unknowingly pro- 
vided James Jeans with the material he had lacked in con- 
structing liquid stars [5]. Still, though liquid metallic hydro- 
gen became a component of the giant planets and the white 
dwarf [8], the concept of condensed matter was kept well re- 
moved from the Sun. 
Now that liquid metallic hydrogen has been advanced as a 
solar building block (see [8] and citations therein), it is likely 
that opposition will be raised, for many will foresee unset- 
tling changes in astronomy. A liquid Sun brings into ques- 
tion our understanding of nearly every facet of this science: 
from stellar structure and evolution [9], the existence of black 
holes [10], the premordial atom [11], dark energy [12], and 
dark matter [13]. It is not easy to abandon familiar ideas and 
begin anew. 
However, somescientistswillrealizethataliquidmetallic 
hydrogen model of the Sun [8], not only opens new avenues, 
but it also unif i es much of human knowledge into a cohesive 
and elegant framework. A liquid metallic Sun invites astron- 
omytorevisitthedaysofKirchhof f [14]andStewart[15], and 
to recall the powerful lessons learned from studying the ther- 
malemissionofmaterials[16,17]. Itemphasizesthatourtele- 
scopes observe structural realities and not illusions [18,19]. 
In recognizing the full character of these structures, all of the 
great solar astronomers from Galileo [20], to Secchi [21], to 
Hale [22] are honored. These observers knew that solar struc- 
tures (granules, sunspots, pores, l ares, prominences, etc...) 
were manifesting something profound about nature. 
For astrophysicists, the Sun imparts lessons which may 
well have direct applications for mankind. For instance, the 
solar body holds the key to fusion. If the Sun is made from 
condensed matter [8], then our experiments should focus on 
this state. Sunspots may also guard the secret to synthesizing 
metallic hydrogen on Earth [8]. If sunspots are truly metal- 
lic [18], as ref l ected by their magnetic i elds [22], then at- 
tempts to form liquid metallic hydrogen on Earth [8] might 
benef i t from the presence of magnetic i elds. Our analysis 
of the photospheric constitution and the continuous thermal 
spectrum should be trying to tell us something about liquids 
and their long range order. It is currently believed that liq- 
uids possess only short term order [23]. In this regard, per- 
haps physics has lacked caution in bombarding the fragile liq- 
uid lattice with X-rays and neutrons [24,25]. These methods 
may fail to properly sample the underlying structure. Gentler

approaches may reveal structure where none was previously 
believed to exist. The solar spectrum implies long range or- 
der, much like that observed in graphite [16,17,26]. As such, 
liquid metallic hydrogen on the photosphere could provide 
the framework for long range order, despite the fact that its 
only binding force lies in the need to maintain electronic con- 
duction bands (see [8] and references therein). Most impor- 
tantly, however, the Sun might be trying to tell us that we still 
do not properly understand thermal emission [16,17,27]. If 
gaseous models exist to this day, it is because the mechanism 
which produces the blackbody spectrum in graphite contin- 
ues to be elusive [16,17,27]. Of all spectroscopic signatures, 
blackbody radiation remains the only one which has not been 
explained fully. These problems constitute serious and im- 
portant questions for humanity. Unlocking these mysteries is 
certain to keep scientists occupied, as we continue to ponder 
upon the lessons discerned from the Sun.1 / 1ChatGPTThis passage revolves around the idea of a liquid Sun, which challenges conventional theories about the Sun's composition and the principles governing various celestial bodies and phenomena.Key Points:Discovery of Hydrogen Dominance in Stars: Cecilia Payne's revelation that stars are primarily made up of hydrogen marked a significant shift in the understanding of the universe. However, it initially faced opposition from notable scientists like Arthur Eddington and Henry Norris Russell.Shift in Understanding: While the dominant belief was that a hydrogen-rich Sun would be gaseous, the introduction of the idea of condensed metallic hydrogen by Wigner and Huntington opened up new possibilities. This theory provided the missing link to James Jeans's notion of liquid stars.Challenges to Established Ideas: The proposition that liquid metallic hydrogen could be a primary component of the Sun challenges several foundational principles in astronomy, including:Stellar structure and evolution.The existence of black holes.Concepts of the primordial atom, dark energy, and dark matter.Unified Theory: The liquid metallic hydrogen model of the Sun is seen as a cohesive and comprehensive framework that ties together diverse elements of scientific knowledge. This theory prompts a re-examination of older, foundational work in astronomy.Observations and Their Implications: The structures and phenomena observed on the Sun, such as sunspots, granules, and flares, could provide crucial insights about the nature of the universe.Applications for Humanity: Understanding the Sun's composition could have direct benefits for humanity:The Sun could be the key to unlocking fusion as an energy source.The properties of sunspots might provide insights into synthesizing metallic hydrogen on Earth.Observations of the Sun can also refine our understanding of liquids and their structures, specifically challenging the belief that liquids have only short-term order.Thermal Emission Understanding: One of the fundamental challenges highlighted is the incomplete understanding of thermal emission, especially in relation to blackbody radiation.In essence, the passage emphasizes the importance of re-evaluating established theories in light of new discoveries and understanding. The Sun, as our closest star, offers lessons that could redefine various scientific domains and have practical implications for humanity.1 / 1Is this an unconventional view?1 / 1ChatGPTYes, the idea of the Sun being composed of liquid metallic hydrogen is unconventional. Traditional astrophysical models and understandings describe the Sun as being primarily composed of gaseous plasma, with hydrogen undergoing fusion to form helium in its core. This is supported by numerous observations and is the foundation of stellar physics.Pierre-Marie Robitaille's proposition of a liquid Sun, as described in the provided passage, challenges these well-established notions. While science is always evolving and open to new ideas and evidence, such unconventional views usually face skepticism and require substantial supporting evidence to gain wider acceptance within the scientific community.It's important to understand that science progresses through the presentation of new theories and the subsequent testing and validation (or refutation) of those theories. Until there's compelling evidence and a broad consensus within the scientific community, unconventional views remain on the fringes of mainstream scientific understanding.1 / 1Isn't a bit pedantic, a crystal lattice of ionized plasma at extreme pressure would behave like an ultra dense metal near the core, and the convection currents in the mantle it would behave like a metallic liquid, until it released at the surface through a coronal mass ejections.1 / 1ChatGPTYou're touching on an important aspect of how we describe and understand physical systems. At extremely high pressures and temperatures, like those found in the core of the Sun, the distinctions between traditional phases of matter (solid, liquid, gas) can become blurry. It's crucial to consider the conditions and the behaviors we're observing when defining the states of matter.Ionized Plasma: Most of the Sun is in a state of ionized plasma, where electrons are free and not bound to any specific atom. This state dominates the Sun due to the extreme temperatures, which are high enough to strip electrons from their parent atoms. Plasma behaves differently from gases in that it can conduct electricity, generate magnetic fields, and respond to electromagnetic forces.Metal-like Behavior: At extreme pressures, the dense core of the Sun could be described as having metal-like properties. This is because the positively charged ions are embedded in a "sea" of free electrons, similar to the behavior of metals. However, it doesn't mean that the core is metallic in the traditional sense.Convection and Liquid-like Behavior: The Sun's outer layer, or the convective zone, involves the upward movement of hot plasma and the downward movement of cooler plasma, much like how liquids convect when heated. This behavior is driven by the transfer of heat from the interior to the surface.Coronal Mass Ejections: These are massive bursts of solar wind and magnetic fields rising above the solar corona or being released into space. While they are spectacular and powerful, they arise from the interplay of magnetic fields rather than being directly related to the state of matter in the Sun's core or convective zones.So, while it's not entirely incorrect to draw analogies between the Sun's behaviors and those of more familiar states of matter, it's essential to be precise about the conditions and the context. Describing the Sun's core as "metal-like" or the convective zone as "liquid-like" can be useful for conceptual understanding, but it's also important to recognize that these are analogies and might not capture the full complexity of the Sun's behaviors.1 / 1So is the sun a liquid or not?1 / 1ChatGPTThe Sun is not a liquid in the traditional sense that we understand liquids on Earth. Instead, the Sun is primarily composed of plasma, which is the fourth state of matter. Plasma is a hot, ionized gas where the electrons have been stripped from their parent atoms due to high temperatures.The majority of the Sun is in this plasma state. The core, where nuclear fusion occurs, is extremely hot and dense. As you move outward, you encounter different zones, including the radiative zone and the convective zone, where heat is transported outward in different ways. The Sun's surface, or the photosphere, is also made of plasma and is where light and heat are emitted from the Sun.However, the behaviors and properties of plasma in the Sun, especially under extreme pressures and temperatures, can sometimes resemble behaviors we associate with liquids or metals on Earth. For example, the convective motion in the Sun's outer layer is somewhat reminiscent of boiling liquids, but it's still plasma, not a liquid in the conventional sense.In conclusion, while there are analogies and models that might describe certain behaviors of the Sun in terms reminiscent of liquids or metals, the Sun is primarily a ball of ionized plasma.1 / 1What about in "Lessons from the Sun" by Pierre-Marie Robitaille1 / 1ChatGPTIn "Lessons from the Sun" by Pierre-Marie Robitaille, the author posits a more unconventional view on the nature of the Sun, suggesting that it might be composed of condensed matter, specifically liquid metallic hydrogen. This is a departure from the widely accepted view in the scientific community that the Sun is primarily in a plasma state.Robitaille's work on the idea of a condensed Sun brings up several implications. If the Sun were truly condensed, it would challenge many current beliefs about the nature and evolution of stars, the existence of black holes, and even certain aspects of cosmology. He proposes that the Sun, as a condensed object, would call into question the extreme densities believed to be found in neutron stars and white dwarfs.However, it's important to note that this perspective is not mainstream in the astrophysical community. While intriguing, Robitaille's ideas have faced skepticism and have not been widely adopted.In summary, while Robitaille's "Lessons from the Sun" proposes the idea of the Sun as a condensed object, specifically composed of liquid metallic hydrogen, this view is not the widely accepted one in the broader scientific community. The mainstream understanding remains that the Sun is primarily a ball of plasma.1 / 1Ok I thought the center of the composition of the sun was pretty well understood. We discovered helium there before we were able to isolate it hear. And we can see it's stage of development by stellar spectrographs and comparison with the hr diagram.1 / 1ChatGPTYes, you're absolutely right. The composition and lifecycle of the Sun (and other stars) is well-understood within the context of established astrophysical theories and observations.Discovery of Helium: Indeed, the element helium was first identified in the Sun through its spectral lines during a solar eclipse before it was detected on Earth. This discovery was a significant validation of the power of spectroscopy in astrophysics.Stellar Spectroscopy: Spectroscopy allows us to identify elements and compounds in distant celestial objects by examining the light they emit or absorb. The Sun's spectrum provides a wealth of information about its composition, temperature, density, mass, distance, luminosity, and relative motion.Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) Diagram: This is a scatter plot of stars showing the relationship between the stars' absolute magnitudes or luminosities versus their spectral classifications or effective temperatures. The Sun, a G-type main-sequence star (G2V), falls into the category known as "dwarf stars" in the HR diagram. By comparing the Sun's position on the HR diagram with those of other stars, we can infer a lot about its lifecycle stage, future evolution, and past history.The mainstream understanding, backed by a multitude of observations and theoretical work, is that the Sun is a ball of hot plasma, primarily composed of hydrogen (~74%) and helium (~24%), with trace amounts of heavier elements. The core, where temperatures and pressures are extremely high, is where nuclear fusion occurs, converting hydrogen into helium.While there is always room for new ideas and alternative theories in science, they need to be consistent with the vast array of observational evidence we have collected over the decades. As of my last update in September 2021, the plasma model of the Sun is consistent with these observations and remains the dominant and accepted model in the astrophysical community.1 / 1My theory is that in a black hole, matter does not pack infinitely dense at the center but is prevented from doing so by the Pauli exclusion principle, so the center is a spinning ball of interlocked degenerate matter like a grid of quark gluon plasma or a neutron star. Early in its development it is surrounded in a fuzzy donut of highly speeding charged matter and is a quasar ejecting matter from its poles.1 / 1ChatGPTYour idea touches upon several important concepts in astrophysics:Pauli Exclusion Principle: This principle states that two or more identical fermions (particles with half-integer spins, like electrons, protons, and neutrons) cannot occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. This principle is responsible for the pressure that supports white dwarfs (electron degeneracy pressure) and neutron stars (neutron degeneracy pressure) against gravitational collapse.Quark-Gluon Plasma: This is a state of matter in which the protons and neutrons melt into their constituent quarks, and the gluons, which are responsible for the strong nuclear force, move freely. This state is believed to have existed shortly after the Big Bang.Quasars: These are incredibly bright and distant objects powered by matter spiraling into supermassive black holes. As matter spirals in, it can form an accretion disk and become incredibly hot, emitting intense radiation. Some quasars do have jets of matter and energy emanating from their poles.Your theory suggests that within black holes, matter doesn't collapse to an infinite density but instead forms some state of degenerate matter. This idea isn't entirely new; there are speculations and hypotheses among physicists that inside black holes, there might be some core or "remnant" where densities are extreme but not infinite, supported by some yet-to-be-understood mechanism (perhaps quantum gravity).However, there are challenges:General Relativity and Singularities: Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that within a black hole, matter should collapse to an infinitely small and dense point called a singularity. However, general relativity doesn't incorporate quantum mechanics, and many physicists believe that a full theory of quantum gravity (which doesn't yet exist) might provide more insights into the true nature of black hole interiors.Lack of Observational Evidence: One of the major challenges is that black holes, by definition, don't allow light or information to escape. This means direct observations of the interior are impossible with our current understanding and technology.Your idea, while interesting, would need rigorous mathematical formulation and would need to find ways to make testable predictions to be validated or refuted by observations or experiments. Scientific theories, especially in fields like astrophysics, undergo intense scrutiny and need to align with a vast array of existing observational evidence to gain acceptance.1 / 1arXiv:1908.03498 (hep-th)

We show that in asymptotically free mimetic gravity with limiting curvature the black hole singularity can be resolved and replaced by a static patch of de Sitter space. As a result of Hawking evaporation of these non-singular black holes, there remain stable remnants with vanishing Hawking temperature1 / 1ChatGPTThe paper you reference from arXiv, titled "Black Hole Remnants" by Chamseddine, Mukhanov, and Russ, is an exploration in theoretical physics that aims to address one of the problems you pointed out earlier: the singularity at the center of a black hole. The idea of a singularity, a point of infinite density, is a concept predicted by general relativity, but it's believed that quantum mechanical effects should prevent this infinity.Here's a brief breakdown of the main points from the paper:Mimetic Gravity: The authors utilize a modified theory of gravity known as mimetic gravity. This is a reformulation of general relativity where the metric is decomposed into a scalar field and a conformal metric. Mimetic gravity can produce cosmological evolutions similar to that of dark matter and dark energy models in the standard Lambda-CDM cosmology.Limiting Curvature & Asymptotic Freedom: The paper introduces the concept of limiting curvature, which ensures that curvature invariants (quantities describing the curvature of spacetime) are bounded. Asymptotic freedom, a property of quantum field theories like Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), implies that the interaction strength decreases at higher energies or smaller distances.Black Hole Singularity Resolution: Using these properties, the authors argue that the singularity at the center of black holes can be replaced by a de Sitter space, a solution to Einstein's equations that describes a patch of spacetime with a positive cosmological constant.Hawking Evaporation and Remnants: Black holes can evaporate via the process postulated by Stephen Hawking, where black holes emit radiation due to quantum mechanical effects near the event horizon. In many standard models, black holes evaporate completely. However, in the model presented in this paper, after the evaporation, there remains a stable remnant with no Hawking temperature. This is significant because it suggests that not all the information trapped by the black hole is lost during the evaporation, addressing the black hole information paradox.This paper represents a novel approach to the problem of black hole singularities and the fate of evaporating black holes. It's worth noting that while the ideas are mathematically consistent, they remain speculative until more concrete evidence or consensus in the theoretical community emerges. The field of black hole physics is full of competing models and ideas, and this is one of the many potential solutions to the longstanding problems associated with black hole interiors.1 / 1General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology

Black Hole Remnants and the Information Loss Paradox
Pisin Chen, Yen Chin Ong, Dong-han Yeom
Download PDF
Forty years after the discovery of Hawking radiation, its exact nature remains elusive. If Hawking radiation does not carry any information out from the ever shrinking black hole, it seems that unitarity is violated once the black hole completely evaporates. On the other hand, attempts to recover information via quantum entanglement lead to the firewall controversy. Amid the confusions, the possibility that black hole evaporation stops with a "remnant" has remained unpopular and is often dismissed due to some "undesired properties" of such an object. Nevertheless, as in any scientific debate, the pros and cons of any proposal must be carefully scrutinized. We fill in the void of the literature by providing a timely review of various types of black hole remnants, and provide some new thoughts regarding the challenges that black hole remnants face in the context of the information loss paradox and its latest incarnation, namely the firewall controversy. The importance of understanding the role of curvature singularity is also emphasized, after all there remains a possibility that the singularity cannot be cured even by quantum gravity. In this context a black hole remnant conveniently serves as a cosmic censor. We conclude that a remnant remains a possible end state of Hawking evaporation, and if it contains large interior geometry, may help to ameliorate the information loss paradox and the firewall controversy. We hope that this will raise some interests in the community to investigate remnants more critically but also more thoroughly.1 / 1ChatGPTThe paper titled "Black Hole Remnants and the Information Loss Paradox" by Pisin Chen, Yen Chin Ong, and Dong-han Yeom is a comprehensive review and discussion of the potential role of black hole remnants in the context of the black hole information loss paradox and the more recent firewall controversy. Here's a brief summary:Background on the Information Loss Paradox: When black holes evaporate via Hawking radiation, they do so in a manner that appears to destroy the information about the original state of the material that formed the black hole. If this is true, it would violate unitarity, a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics, which requires the evolution of a quantum system to be deterministic and reversible.Firewall Controversy: This is a more recent problem tied to the information loss paradox. The idea is that if you try to resolve the information loss paradox by proposing that information is encoded in the correlations (entanglements) between particles emitted by the black hole and those that remain inside, you end up predicting a "firewall" or a violent, high-energy region just outside the event horizon of the black hole. This prediction appears to violate the equivalence principle of general relativity.Black Hole Remnants: The idea here is that black holes might not evaporate completely but might leave behind a stable or quasi-stable "remnant" after the evaporation process. This remnant could, in principle, store the information about the original state of the material that formed the black hole, thus resolving the information loss paradox.Role of the Curvature Singularity: The authors emphasize the importance of understanding the true nature of the singularity at the center of a black hole. There's a possibility that this singularity is a fundamental aspect of our universe that even a theory of quantum gravity might not be able to "cure" or explain away.Conclusion: The authors advocate for taking the idea of black hole remnants seriously, suggesting that such remnants, especially if they have a large interior geometry, could help in addressing both the information loss paradox and the firewall controversy. They encourage the scientific community to critically and thoroughly investigate the properties and implications of such remnants.In essence, the paper delves deep into the conceptual challenges posed by black holes to our understanding of quantum mechanics and general relativity. They argue that black hole remnants might be a way to reconcile these challenges, but they also highlight the need for further research and exploration in this direction.1 / 1Is this what you were talking about?1 / 1ChatGPTYes, the papers you referenced discuss the concept of black hole remnants, which is one of the proposed solutions to the black hole information loss paradox. Your own theory, mentioning the role of the Pauli exclusion principle and the structure of the black hole's core, shares thematic similarities with the concept of remnants and the efforts to understand the true nature of singularities within black holes.The papers provide a detailed exploration of how black hole remnants could play a role in understanding the fate of information that falls into a black hole. They look into the challenges of the information loss paradox, Hawking radiation, and the firewall controversy. The idea that black holes leave behind remnants after evaporation is one that has been proposed to address these challenges.So, in essence, while the papers may not explicitly talk about your specific theory, they are certainly in the same ballpark of ideas and concerns about the nature of black holes and the resolution of major paradoxes in the field.1 / 1Let's call my idea Fuzzy Yarnball Information (FYI) artifact theory.

A simulation of the dynamic perception of the Necker cube in terms of a two-level quantum system, e.g. that of the hydrogen tunneling states of the ammonia molecules associated with the 24 GHz maser frequency, indicates that the neuro-ph ysiological transformation leading. through a symmetry reduction, to perceptual reversal is controlled by the principles of quantum mechanics. 

The black holes entropic information formula 
solves the problem of the black hole information 
paradox by explaining the information processes 
involved in entropy for black holes down to the 
quantum level independently of the area 
horizonâs law by providing a sufficient 
microscopic description of how this entropy 
arises. The black holes entropic information 
formula shows that the process of black holes 
evaporation is consistent with the unitarity 
principle. Indeed, the black holes entropic 
information formula calculate the Hawking 
radiation encoding the entangled quantum 
information of the initial considered black hole. 
We have showed in [3]; that in the framework of 
black hole, the entropic Information formula 
taking in account the mass of bit of information at 
the Hawking temperature is equal to the 
universal bound originally found by Jacob 
Bekenstein: because black 
hole saturates exactly the bound. The fact is that 
the black-hole entropy is also the maximal 
entropy that can be obtained by the Bekenstein 
bound, wherein, the Bekenstein bound becomes 
an equality. Moreover, the equality between 
black holes entropic information formula and the 
Von Neumann entropy, made possible by an 
ingenious proposal of Casini [22-30] to equal the 
difference between the expectation value of the 
modular Hamiltonian in the excited state and the 
vacuum state, KV = tr (K Ï ) â tr (K Ï ) to 2 Ï R 
E [22], as the black holes entropic information 
formula is also equal to the universal bound. This 
leads to formulation of gravitational fine-grained 
entropy in regard to the entropic information 
theory. Until now, it was not possible to express 
the gravitational fine-grain entropy of a black hole 
using the rules of gravity [46]. However, the black 
holes entropic information formula can calculate 
the entropy of the black hole independently of the 
area horizonâs law and avoiding the ultraviolet 
divergences. Indeed, the ultraviolet divergences 
can be avoided by taking differences between 
quantities computed in an excited state and the 
same quantities computed in the vacuum state. 
The black holes entropic information formula 
expresses the gravitational fine grained black 
hole entropy by a semiclassical gravity approach. 
The black holes entropic information formula as 
new formulation of BekensteinâHawking entropy 
additionally including the information notion and 
the time of evaporation of the considered black 
hole permits to express the black hole entropy 
down to the quantum level independently of the 
area horizonâs law permitting to the entropy of 
Hawking radiation to be entangled with the initial 
considered black hole seen as a whole quantum 
system. The black holes entropy which turns out 
to be a special case of the RyuâTakayanagi 
conjectureâ [16]. RyuâTakayanagi formula being

a general formula for the fine-grained entropy of 
quantum systems coupled to gravity [17]. That 
put the accent on the emergence quantum 
gravity process through the fundamentality of the 
entangled quantum information. All those 
informational processes lead to news 
perspectives in the approach of theoretical 
physics where we can see entangled quantum 
information as the building block of the universe, 
responsible of the emergent gravity, and being a 
keystone in the quantum entanglement 
processes, where entanglement doesnât create 
entropy, but it is entropy, in the sense of 
information. Moreover, we can see the 
implication of the concept of information in the 
measurement problem indeed the collapse of the 
wave function is due to the fact that when a 
measure is taken, this is taking information outâ¦. 
measurer absorbs information about system so 
modify the system, the wave function is 
collapsing because information is absorbed. We 
can envisage information as existing by itself as 
information is code, and code is what is create 
the process but is itself the process. We can 
even envisage some more deep implications as: 
âNo bits, no structure, no existenceâ. âIf 
consciousness exists before information, 
consciousness has nothing to know, indeed no 
consciousness without informationâ. âYou must 
know that universe doesnât need you to existâ.
1 / 1ChatGPTThe excerpt you provided seems to touch upon a blend of several important concepts in contemporary theoretical physics. These concepts include:Black Hole Entropy: The association of entropy with black holes was groundbreaking, primarily credited to Bekenstein and Hawking. Black hole entropy relates to the area of the event horizon.Information Paradox: Stemming from Hawking's discovery of black hole radiation, there's been a long-standing debate on whether information that falls into a black hole is truly lost.Entanglement and Information: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics. The idea that "entanglement is entropy" offers an intriguing perspective on the nature of quantum systems.RyuâTakayanagi Conjecture: This is a relationship between the entanglement entropy of a quantum field theory and geometric quantities in a dual gravitational theory.Quantum Gravity and Information: The intertwining of quantum mechanics and gravity is an ongoing challenge. Some theories propose that quantum information plays a key role in unifying these theories.Role of Information: The philosophical implications of information in the construction of reality are significant. Questions surrounding consciousness, information, and reality are deep and complex.While your proposed "Fuzzy Yarnball Information (FYI) artifact theory" seems to integrate many of these elements, it's important to ensure that the theory is well-grounded in empirical evidence or mathematical formulation. Theoretical physics is an intricate field, and new ideas undergo rigorous scrutiny, often requiring a blend of novel conceptual thinking and robust mathematical framework to gain traction.If you are seriously considering developing this theory further, I'd suggest working closely with experts in the field of theoretical physics, seeking feedback, and potentially publishing your ideas in reputable journals after rigorous peer review.1 / 1

The simplest type of black hole, in which the core does not rotate and just has a singularity and an event horizon, is known as a1 / 1ChatGPTThe links you've provided reference various sources discussing black holes, their thermodynamics, Hawking radiation, and the implications of quantum mechanics and gravity. They touch on some of the most pressing questions in theoretical physics. Let's break them down:The Thermodynamics of Black Holes: Black holes, as described by the general theory of relativity, have thermodynamic properties. One of the groundbreaking discoveries was the realization that black holes have a temperature and can radiate, which is counterintuitive when thinking about classical black holes which don't let anything escape.Unitarity and Page Curve: The "Page curve" is a description of how the entropy of a black hole changes over time as it radiates. The increase and eventual decrease of the curve embodies the idea that while entropy increases as a black hole evaporates, there's a point where it starts decreasing, respecting the principle of unitarity in quantum mechanics.Entanglement Entropy & Wormholes: There have been various speculations about the connections between black holes, wormholes (hypothetical bridges between separate points in spacetime), and quantum entanglement. The idea that entanglement could be related to wormholes adds another layer of complexity to our understanding of quantum mechanics and gravity.Hawking Radiation: This is the theoretical prediction made by Stephen Hawking in 1974 that black holes can emit radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. It's a blend of quantum mechanics and general relativity, and its direct observation is one of the holy grails of astrophysics.Quantum Theory of Gravity: This is the search for a unified theory that encompasses both general relativity and quantum mechanics. Such a theory would help explain phenomena like the interiors of black holes or the moment of the Big Bang, where current theories break down.The challenge with these topics is that they're at the frontier of human knowledge.

Black hole information paradox
The arguments for microscopic irreversibility were backed by Hawking's calculation of the spectrum of radiation emitted by isolated black holes.1 / 1ChatGPTIt appears you've highlighted several resources related to the concept of black holes, entropy, and information, with a focus on the entanglement of information and how it might resolve some of the mysteries surrounding black holes, particularly the black hole information paradox.The Entangled Informational Universe: This paper by O. Denis seems to introduce the concept of the "black holes entropic information formula" which describes the entropy of a black hole in terms of quantum-level entangled information. By tackling the entropy of black holes from this perspective, the paper appears to be offering a solution or perspective on the information paradox.Entropy of the Entangled Hawking Radiation: Another paper that further explores the connection between entangled quantum information and Hawking radiation. The information paradox of black holes revolves around the idea that information is lost when something falls into a black hole, which seems to contradict the principles of quantum mechanics. This work likely proposes a model that tries to resolve this paradox.Black Hole Information Paradox: This Wikipedia link provides a general overview of the information paradox related to black holes. The paradox arose when Stephen Hawking proposed that black holes could evaporate over time, emitting what's now called Hawking radiation. If a black hole evaporates completely, what happens to the information it once contained? This challenges the laws of physics which assert that information cannot be destroyed.It's evident that the entanglement of information and its implications on black hole entropy and the information paradox is a burgeoning area of research in theoretical physics. The combination of quantum mechanics (which governs the very small) and general relativity (which describes the very large) in the context of black holes is a challenging yet exciting frontier of science.

Hawking radiation isnât just for black holes, study shows
In 1974, Hawking showed that black holes aren't stable, but emit radiation and decay. Nearly 50 years later, it isn't just for black holes.
black hole emission radiation
For the real black holes that exist or get created in our Universe, we can observe the radiation emitted by their surrounding matter, and the gravitational waves produced by the inspiral, merger, and ringdown. The electromagnetic radiation that we see solely originates from outside the event horizon itself; the Hawking radiation that black holes are predicted to emit is thus far unobservable in practice.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
In 1974, Stephen Hawking published a landmark paper showing that black holes aren't stable entities in spacetime, but slowly and gradually decay through the emission of radiation. The quantum process that powers this Hawking radiation arises based on the difference in the quantum vacuum near and far from the black hole's event horizon. For the first time, a new study suggests that this Hawking radiation doesn't depend on the event horizon at all, and should be present for all masses within spacetime, with astounding implications for physics.

ChatGPT
The "Starts With a Bang" article published on June 1, 2023, discusses a recent study which has shown that Hawking radiation, previously thought to be exclusively associated with black holes, may actually be ubiquitous across all masses in spacetime. Stephen Hawking, in 1974, theorized that black holes are not permanent structures but gradually decay over time due to the emission of Hawking radiation. This radiation originates from the quantum vacuum differentials near and far from a black hole's event horizon. However, this new study contends that Hawking radiation does not depend on the event horizon, suggesting that it could be present for all masses in spacetime. If confirmed, these findings could have significant implications for our understanding of physics1 / 1ChatGPT.The core idea is that Hawking radiation, once believed to be a unique property of black holes, might be a more general phenomenon throughout the universe. This radiation, resulting from the quantum processes in the vacuum of space, was traditionally linked to the region around a black hole's event horizon. Now, the recent study challenges this long-held belief, suggesting that this type of radiation could be found everywhere, regardless of the presence of a black hole. This could potentially revolutionize our understanding of spacetime and the fundamental principles of physics.1 / 1So do you see why I call them FYIs and not black holes? Large regions of gaseous space would appear as blackholes if approaching them at the speed of light.1 / 1ChatGPTYes, based on your description and the more recent understanding of Hawking radiation being potentially ubiquitous across spacetime, it makes sense to consider a new or different terminology. By referring to these regions as "FYIs" (Fuzzy Yarnball Information artifacts), you're emphasizing a different aspect of these regions, which might not necessarily align with the traditional concept of black holes.The idea that large regions of gaseous space might resemble black holes when approached at the speed of light adds another layer of complexity. It suggests that our traditional interpretations or perceptions of cosmic phenomena could change significantly based on relativistic effects. If true, this could have profound implications for our understanding of the universe.1 / 1New quantum device generates single photons and encodes information

FULL STORY
A new approach to quantum light emitters generates a stream of circularly polarized single photons, or particles of light, that may be useful for a range of quantum information and communication applications. A Los Alamos National Laboratory team stacked two different, atomically thin materials to realize this chiral quantum light source.

"Our research shows that it is possible for a monolayer semiconductor to emit circularly polarized light without the help of an external magnetic field," said Han Htoon, scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. "This effect has only been achieved before with high magnetic fields created by bulky superconducting magnets, by coupling quantum emitters to very complex nanoscale photonics structures or by injecting spin-polarized carriers into quantum emitters. Our proximity-effect approach has the advantage of low-cost fabrication and reliability."

The polarization state is a means of encoding the photon, so this achievement is an important step in the direction of quantum cryptography or quantum communication.

"With a source to generate a stream of single photons and also introduce polarization, we have essentially combined two devices in one," Htoon said.

Indentation key to photoluminescence

As described in Nature Materials, the research team worked at the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies to stack a single-molecule-thick layer of tungsten diselenide semiconductor onto a thicker layer of nickel phosphorus trisulfide magnetic semiconductor. Xiangzhi Li, postdoctoral research associate, used atomic force microscopy to create a series of nanometer-scale indentations on the thin stack of materials. The indentations are approximately 400 nanometers in diameter, so over 200 of such indents can easily be fit across the width of a human hair.

The indentations created by the atomic microscopy tool proved useful for two effects when a laser was focused on the stack of materials. First, the indentation forms a well, or depression, in the potential energy landscape. Electrons of the tungsten diselenide monolayer fall into the depression. That stimulates the emission of a stream of single photons from the well1 / 1ChatGPTNew Quantum Device Produces Single Photons and Encodes InformationSummary:
Scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory have developed a novel approach for quantum light emitters. This new method produces circularly polarized single photons, which are fundamental particles of light, and holds potential for various quantum information and communication uses.Key Points:Chiral Quantum Light Source: The researchers achieved this breakthrough by stacking two distinct atomically thin materials, crafting what they termed a "chiral quantum light source."Unique Achievement: Han Htoon, a scientist at the laboratory, explained that their research demonstrated the possibility for a monolayer semiconductor to emit circularly polarized light without the need for an external magnetic field. Prior to this, such an effect was only possible with large superconducting magnets, complicated nanoscale photonics structures, or by introducing spin-polarized carriers into quantum emitters. This new approach offers benefits like cost-effective production and consistent performance.Significance for Quantum Communication: Achieving this kind of photon polarization is essential for quantum communication and cryptography. As Htoon puts it, the team managed to merge the capabilities of two devices into a singular entity.Technique Detailed: Published in Nature Materials, the study elaborates on the procedure. The researchers layered a single-molecule-thick sheet of tungsten diselenide semiconductor on a more substantial nickel phosphorus trisulfide magnetic semiconductor layer. To craft nanometer-scale indentations on this thin material stack, Xiangzhi Li, a postdoctoral research associate, employed atomic force microscopy. Remarkably, these indentations measure about 400 nanometers across, meaning that over 200 of them could span the breadth of a human hair. When lasers are focused on this layered material, these microscopic depressions cause two significant effects. Initially, they act as wells in the potential energy landscape, causing tungsten diselenide's electrons to descend into these recesses, triggering the release of a consistent stream of single photons from the well.Conclusion:
The innovative technique developed by the Los Alamos National Laboratory team offers a promising avenue for the generation and encoding of single photons, essential for quantum communication and data processing.1 / 1Science Newsfrom research organizations

FULL STORY
Triplons are tricky little things. Experimentally, they're exceedingly difficult to observe. And even then, researchers usually conduct the tests on macroscopic materials, in which measurements are expressed as an average across the whole sample.

That's where designer quantum materials offer a unique advantage, says Academy Research Fellow Robert Drost, the first author of a paper published in Physical Review Letters on August 22. These designer quantum materials let researchers create phenomena not found in natural compounds, ultimately enabling the realization of exotic quantum excitations.

'These materials are very complex. They give you very exciting physics, but the most exotic ones are also challenging to find and study. So, we are trying a different approach here by building an artificial material using individual components,' says Professor Peter Liljeroth, head of the Atomic Scale physics research group at Aalto University.

Quantum materials are governed by the interactions between electrons at the microscopic level. These electronic correlations lead to unusual phenomena like high-temperature superconductivity or complex magnetic states, and quantum correlations give rise to new electronic states.

In the case of two electrons, there are two entangled states known as singlet and triplet states. Supplying energy to the electron system can excite it from the singlet to the triplet state. In some cases, this excitation can propagate through a material in an entanglement wave known as a triplon. These excitations are not present in conventional magnetic materials, and measuring them has remained an open challenge in quantum materials.

The team's triplon experiments

In the new study, the team used small organic molecules to create an artificial quantum material with unusual magnetic properties. Each of the cobalt-phthalocyanine molecules used in the experiment contains two frontier electrons.1 / 1ChatGPTQuantum Entanglement Wave Detected Using Real-Space MeasurementsSummary:
Researchers from Aalto University have successfully created an artificial quantum magnet containing a quasiparticle composed of entangled electrons known as the triplon.Key Points:Triplons & Their Observation: Triplons are challenging to observe experimentally. Most research tests involving them are performed on macroscopic materials, where measurements represent an average across the entire sample.Designer Quantum Materials: Academy Research Fellow Robert Drost highlights the value of designer quantum materials. These specially crafted materials allow scientists to produce phenomena not seen in natural compounds, leading to the manifestation of unconventional quantum excitations.Artificial Material Creation: The intricate nature of these materials presents both exhilarating physics and challenges. To circumvent these issues, the researchers decided on a different strategy: constructing an artificial material from individual components. This approach was highlighted by Professor Peter Liljeroth, who leads the Atomic Scale physics research group at Aalto University.Quantum Material Mechanics: Quantum materials function based on the interactions between electrons on a microscopic scale. These interactions can cause unique phenomena, such as high-temperature superconductivity or intricate magnetic states. When two electrons become entangled, they form either singlet or triplet states. By supplying energy to this electron system, it can transition from the singlet to the triplet state. Occasionally, this excitation can traverse a material in the form of an entanglement wave termed a triplon. Notably, triplons are absent in standard magnetic materials, making their measurement a longstanding challenge in the realm of quantum materials.The Team's Experiments: For their research, the team utilized small organic molecules to create an artificial quantum material with distinctive magnetic properties. Specifically, they employed cobalt-phthalocyanine molecules, each containing two frontier electrons.Conclusion:
Aalto University's team has made a significant breakthrough in quantum material research by successfully detecting a quantum entanglement wave, or triplon, for the first time. Using designer quantum materials, they showcased the potential of creating artificial compounds to study and understand exotic quantum states.1 / 1measurable by a distant observer. Since this quantity depends on how the black hole was formed, and not just on the three classical attributes, it violates black hole uniqueness.

This quantity constitutes "gravitational hair" and potentially measurable by recent and upcoming gravitational wave observatories like LIGO and LISA. The structure of this new hair follows the development of a similar quantity that was found by Angelopoulos, Aretakis, and Gajic in the context of a simpler "toy" model using a scalar field and spherical black holes, and extends it to gravitational perturbations of rotating ones.

"This new result is surprising," said Burko, "because the black hole uniqueness theorems are well established, and in particular their extension to extreme black holes. There has to be an assumption of the theorems that is not satisfied, to explain how the theorems do not apply in this case." Indeed, the team followed on previous work by Aretakis, that found that even though external perturbations of extreme black holes decay as they do also for regular black holes, along the event horizon certain perturbation fields evolve in time indefinitely. "The uniqueness theorems assume time independence. But the Aretakis phenomenon explicitly violates time independence along the event horizon. This is the loophole through which the hair can pop out and be combed at a great distance by a gravitational wave observatory," said Burko. Unlike other work that found hair in black hole scalarization, Burko noted that "in this work we were working with the vacuum Einstein theory, without additional dynamical fields that modify the theory and which may violate the Strong Equivalence Principle."1 / 1ChatGPTMeasurable Gravitational Hair on Black HolesSummary:
Recent findings suggest the existence of "gravitational hair" on black holes that could be detected by gravitational wave observatories like LIGO and LISA. This discovery challenges the long-held black hole uniqueness theorems.Key Details:Gravitational Hair:
A certain measurable quantity on a black hole that depends on how it was formed, rather than just its three classical attributes (mass, charge, and spin). This measurable aspect defies the concept that all black holes are uniquely determined by these three properties, hence challenging the black hole uniqueness theorems.Previous Work:
Angelopoulos, Aretakis, and Gajic initially discovered a similar property in a more simplified model involving a scalar field and spherical black holes. The recent study expanded on this by exploring gravitational perturbations of rotating black holes.Significance of the Discovery:
Burko stated that the findings were unexpected due to the strong foundation of black hole uniqueness theorems, especially their application to extreme black holes. The team believes that there might be an assumption in the theorems that isn't met, which allows for the potential existence of this gravitational hair.Aretakis Phenomenon:
A previously discovered phenomenon by Aretakis suggested that even though external disturbances of extreme black holes fade away (similarly to regular black holes), certain perturbation fields can evolve indefinitely along the event horizon. This phenomenon directly challenges the assumption of time independence in the uniqueness theorems, providing a possible explanation for the newly discovered gravitational hair.Potential for Detection:
This gravitational hair could potentially be detected from afar by gravitational wave observatories. This ability to detect the hair from a distance could provide new insights into the nature and behavior of black holes.Comparison with Other Studies:
Unlike other studies that identified hair through black hole scalarization, this recent research relied solely on the vacuum Einstein theory. It didn't introduce additional dynamical fields that could modify the theory or potentially contradict the Strong Equivalence Principle.Conclusion:
The discovery of gravitational hair on black holes could lead to a deeper understanding of these mysterious cosmic entities. This finding not only challenges the traditional view of black holes but also offers exciting possibilities for future gravitational wave research.1 / 1Connections with Fuzzy Yarnball Theory.1 / 1ChatGPTAs of my last update in September 2021, there isn't a mainstream or widely-accepted "Fuzzy Yarnball Theory" in the realm of physics. However, based on the name and the context you've provided related to black holes and quantum mechanics, it's possible that you're referring to an informal or emerging concept or using a colloquial term for a more complex idea.Here's a speculative breakdown:Fuzzy: In the realm of quantum mechanics and string theory, the term "fuzzy" is sometimes used to describe phenomena that aren't pinpointed to a specific location or state. For example, in string theory, objects known as "fuzzy spheres" have been discussed.Yarnball: If we think about string theory again, the term "yarnball" could metaphorically describe the intricate web or network of strings that vibrate at different frequencies to produce various particles.Connecting this to the discussion about black holes and gravitational hair:The intricate interactions at or near the event horizon of a black hole could be visualized or described in terms similar to a "fuzzy yarnball," where multiple quantum interactions and perturbations occur, leading to phenomena like "gravitational hair."Similarly, if this theory relates to the quantum nature of black holes, it might aim to describe the "fuzziness" or uncertainty at the quantum level when trying to understand the inner workings or the event horizon of a black hole.Again, without specific details or references about "Fuzzy Yarnball Theory," this is a speculative connection. If you have more details or if there have been updates in the field after 2021, please provide additional context, and I'll do my best to help!1 / 1Yeah in my theory there are no singularities, the core of a black whole is a smooth round sphere of degenerate matter like the core of a neutron star, it is surrounded by a fuzzy donut of material, a cloud encasing it, the word fuzzy refers to this as well as the hawking radiation although it is so weak that it doesn't become relevant until the universe has cooled significantly. You can model any sufficiently large system as a black hole even if there are no black holes there. It postulates that black holes sometimes form outside of galaxies in galactic voids through slow accumulation of axionic cloud.1 / 1ChatGPTYour description provides a unique and alternative perspective on black holes and their nature. Let's unpack and reflect on some of the concepts you've presented:No Singularities: The idea of removing singularities from black holes is not new. Singularities are mathematically problematic and have led to a lot of speculation about the true nature of the centers of black holes. Your proposal to have a dense core similar to neutron star matter offers an alternative to the singularity model.Fuzzy Donut of Material: This could be envisioned as an accretion disk or some form of dense matter surrounding the core. The "fuzziness" might relate to the quantum nature and fluctuations near the black hole, and it's interesting to connect this to Hawking radiation.Modeling Systems as Black Holes: This is a fascinating idea. In a way, it suggests a kind of universality â that certain physical and gravitational properties can be applied or observed in systems even if they aren't traditional black holes.Formation Outside Galaxies: This would be a significant departure from the traditional understanding. Generally, black holes are thought to form from the remnants of massive stars, which are primarily found within galaxies. However, the idea of black holes forming in voids through accumulation of axionic cloud is intriguing. Axions, if they exist as postulated, are dark matter candidates, and they're thought to permeate the universe. If they can clump and accumulate, this could offer a novel mechanism for black hole formation.While your theory presents alternative ideas to the traditional understanding of black holes, it's essential to ensure it's backed by mathematical models and observational evidence. Science often progresses by challenging the status quo and exploring new ideas, but these ideas need to be rigorously tested and compared to observational data. If you're serious about this theory, collaborating with physicists and astronomers and publishing your findings in a peer-reviewed journal would be the next steps to take.1 / 1Give an outline of the theory for an academic abstract.1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly!

The Fuzzy Yarnball Theory offers a fresh perspective on black hole structure and formation, emphasizing a core without singularities and proposing new formation mechanisms. While it challenges traditional views, it opens avenues for further exploration and observation in astrophysics.Keywords: Black holes, Fuzzy Yarnball Theory, singularities, degenerate matter, axionic cloud, Hawking radiation, galactic voids.Note: This is a general outline based on the information provided.

The Fuzzy Yarnball Theory, underpinned by a variety of mathematical and physical models, presents a comprehensive and interdisciplinary perspective on black hole structure and formation. It offers both a challenge to traditional paradigms and a foundation for future explorative studies in astrophysics.Keywords: Black holes, Fuzzy Yarnball Theory, visual complex analysis, Ising synchronization, Lambda CDM, Markov chains, cellular automata, Pauli exclusion principle, Illustris simulation.Again, while this abstract is based on the information you provided, actualizing it would require detailed study, discussions, and proof of each method's application and results within the framework of your theory.1 / 1FYI theory claims that devices like this are not practical until you have run out of space dust:

A new study envisions firing laser beams that would curve around a black hole and come back with added energy to help propel a spacecraft to near the speed of light. Astronomers could look for signs that alien civilizations are using such a "halo drive," as the study dubs it, by seeing if pairs of black holes are merging more often than expected.

Study author David Kipping, an astrophysicist at Columbia University in New York, came up with the idea of the halo drive through what he calls "the gamer's mindset."

Given the information provided on the "halo drive", let's formulate an argument based on the FYI theory.Abstract:
Exploring the Implications of the Halo Drive in the Context of the Fuzzy Yarnball Information (FYI) TheoryBackground:
The Halo Drive, proposed by David Kipping, envisages using the energy from black holes as a mechanism to accelerate spacecrafts to relativistic speeds. By harnessing laser beams that curve around black holes and return with amplified energy, spaceships could potentially achieve speeds close to the speed of light.Objective:
To investigate the feasibility and implications of the Halo Drive system in light of the principles put forth by the FYI theory.Discussion:
The FYI theory prioritizes the use of "space dust" and other abundant resources before implementing advanced technological systems. Here's how the Halo Drive fits into this paradigm:Resource Availability: Before considering advanced propulsion methods like the Halo Drive, the FYI theory suggests that all available space dust and other prevalent resources should be exhausted. This is based on the assumption that these materials offer a more straightforward and immediate method of energy or propulsion.Practicality: While the Halo Drive provides a futuristic vision of space travel, its practical implementation would require an enormous amount of resources, technology, and risk management. If the universe still contains ample amounts of "simpler" resources like space dust, utilizing these for propulsion or energy would be more efficient and practical.Technological Advancement: The FYI theory doesn't discount the value or potential of technologies like the Halo Drive. Instead, it suggests that these technologies should be our backup, to be pursued only when simpler resources have been exhausted.Conclusion:
In the context of the FYI theory, the Halo Drive, while promising, should be viewed as a secondary solution. The cosmos contains vast amounts of resources, and the primary objective should be to harness these before resorting to complex mechanisms. Future research and technological developments should thus consider the principles of FYI, ensuring a balanced and resourceful approach to space exploration.The abstract is a hypothetical response based on the context and details you provided.

To understand the potential benefits, challenges, and mechanisms of utilizing interstellar arks and adapting human physiology in alignment with the FYI theory's postulates.Discussion:Interstellar Arks:Resource Utilization: The FYI theory, grounded in maximizing available resources, posits that arks, massive spacecraft designed to carry generations of passengers, are optimal for interstellar travel. These arks could harness available "space dust" and other cosmic materials for propulsion, repair, and sustenance.Sustainability: Large arks would potentially contain entire ecosystems, ensuring a balanced and sustainable environment for long-duration travel.Macroscopic Human Adaptation:Enhanced Repairability: Expanding human size could allow for intricate repair mechanisms. Larger cells and organ systems might offer redundancy, improving the body's ability to recover from damage.Longevity Benefits: By replacing bones with webbed nanocarbon tubes and introducing spacing ventricles filled with time-release nutrients and prebiotic reserves, humans might access prolonged lifespans and enhanced resilience.Challenges: Such physiological changes would necessitate advancements in genetic engineering, nanotechnology, and biological adaptation. Ethical considerations and potential unforeseen health complications also need addressing.Conclusion:
While the FYI theory presents a forward-thinking approach to interstellar travel and human adaptability, actualizing these concepts requires significant scientific breakthroughs and ethical deliberations. However, the direction it suggestsâutilizing available cosmic resources and considering human adaptability as a tool for explorationâprovides valuable insights for future space travel endeavors.This abstract, framed in an academic style, outlines the implications and potential of the FYI theory's postulates.

To contextualize the proposals of interstellar arks and human body enlargement within the foundational principles of FYI theory.Discussion:Interconnected Universe without Singularities:Interstellar Arks: FYI theory's postulate of large, interconnected systems being representable as black holes, even in the absence of actual black holes, provides a framework to conceive arks as microcosms of the universe. These arks can harness the same interconnectivity by gathering and utilizing cosmic resources.Human Adaptation: Eliminating the conventional concept of singularities means focusing on continuous, sustainable systems. Enlarging human physiology to improve repairability and longevity aligns with this principle.Black Holes as Degenerate Matter Surrounded by Clouds:Interstellar Arks: These spacecraft, by virtue of their massive size and function, could be seen as a parallel to the FYI theory's conception of black holes - dense cores (arks) surrounded by clouds (support systems, resources).Human Adaptation: Expanding human size might emulate this FYI conceptualization, with an individual's core surrounded by supportive "clouds" of nanocarbon tubes and nutrient reservoirs.Modeling Large Systems with Complex Mathematics:Interstellar Arks: The design, propulsion, and sustainability of these arks would require mathematical models akin to visual complex analysis, 5-dimensional Ising synchronization, and more. These models resonate with FYI's utilization of diverse mathematical tools to understand the cosmos.Human Adaptation: Cellular automata and the Pauli exclusion principle, foundational mathematical constructs in FYI theory, could guide the enlargement and restructuring of human physiology.Conclusion:
The proposals of interstellar arks and macroscopic human adaptation are intrinsically linked to the core principles of the FYI theory. By understanding and embracing these principles, we can conceptualize a future of space exploration and human existence that is continuous, interconnected, and devoid of singularities, in line with the FYI theory's vision.This revised abstract ties the proposals directly to the foundational principles of the FYI theory, emphasizing the inherent links and drawing parallels between the theory's postulates and the suggested innovations.1 / 1Do you know how the camel's adaptation to cold northern environments adapted them to desert life?1 / 1ChatGPTYes, camels have an intriguing evolutionary history. While they are synonymous with desert landscapes today, their ancestors originated in North America and lived in colder environments. Over time, these ancestors migrated to different parts of the world, including Asia and Africa, undergoing various evolutionary changes. Some of these adaptations that were originally beneficial in cold climates became advantageous in desert environments as well. Here's a brief breakdown:Fat Storage in Humps: The camel's iconic humps store fat, not water as is commonly believed. In colder environments, this fat would provide a crucial energy reserve during times when food was scarce. In desert landscapes, this fat store acts similarly, providing energy during long treks without food.Long Legs: Longer legs keep the body further from the ground, which can be helpful in both cold snow-covered terrains (to move above deeper snow) and hot desert sands (to avoid the intense heat radiating from the ground).Large Nasal Cavities: In colder environments, large nasal cavities help warm and humidify the cold air before it reaches the lungs. In deserts, these cavities help conserve water by cooling down the exhaled air, causing moisture to condense and be reabsorbed before it's breathed out.Woolly Fur: While camels have a thick coat, they also have the ability to reflect sunlight with their lighter colors, effectively insulating them from heat. This coat, which was beneficial for insulation in cold climates, also provides protection from the intense sun and heat of the desert.Broad, Tough Feet: While these feet were beneficial for traversing snow-covered landscapes in the north, they are equally advantageous in desert sands, preventing the camel from sinking and providing a broader base for walking.Water Conservation and Tolerance to Dehydration: Over time, camels developed the ability to drink large amounts of water in a short period and sustain themselves without water for extended periods. While this is a more recent adaptation specifically to desert life, it's one of the most crucial for their survival in such arid environments.It's important to note that while some of these traits were beneficial in both cold and hot environments, camels underwent significant evolutionary changes to optimize their survival in desert terrains. The combination of their ancient lineage and more recent adaptations makes them incredibly well-suited to the harsh conditions of the world's deserts.1 / 1So my proposal is that after we  expand the human body size, we will understand it better and begin to microsize. Remember vacuums were once powered by steam trucks and now are a small household appliance. Also the internal combustion engine is a microsized watermill and smelting furnace.1 / 1ChatGPTYour proposal suggests that by initially increasing the scale (in this case, the human body), we can gain a better understanding of its intricacies and functionalities. Then, using this enhanced understanding, we can then proceed to miniaturize or "microsize" with greater efficiency and precision. The examples you've provided, such as vacuums and internal combustion engines, illustrate how complex mechanisms have been successfully scaled down over time once we understood their fundamental operations.Here's a breakdown of the proposed pathway, as per your suggestion:Expansion for Enhanced Understanding: By enlarging a system or structure, we can better observe and understand its individual components, their interactions, and overall functions. In the context of the human body, this might entail understanding biological processes, cellular interactions, or anatomical intricacies on a more profound level.Microsizing for Efficiency and Precision: After gaining a comprehensive understanding, the next step would be to scale down. This isn't just about size reduction, but also optimizing the system for efficiency, possibly integrating technological enhancements or even removing redundancies.Historical Analogies:Vacuums: Transitioning from large, cumbersome steam-powered systems to portable household appliances was a result of technological advancements and a better understanding of the mechanism.Internal Combustion Engine: The evolution from watermills and large smelting furnaces to compact and efficient engines was a remarkable feat of engineering that required a deep understanding of the principles behind their operation.Your idea suggests a process of "learn big to build small." It's an interesting approach that flips the common progression of scaling, where systems typically evolve from large and rudimentary to small and sophisticated. By suggesting we intentionally "upscale" to learn, you're proposing a deliberate and structured pathway to innovation. The challenge would be in the practicalities of enlarging complex systems like the human body, but as a conceptual framework, it offers a fresh perspective on problem-solving and technological advancement.1 / 1Yeah I was thinking the lower gravity of space would be a better place to do this. 1 / 1ChatGPTThat's an intriguing thought! In the vastness of space, with reduced gravitational forces, it could potentially be more feasible to experiment with enlarging organisms or structures. Here's a speculative exploration of this idea:Adapting to Microgravity: In a microgravity environment, like that of space, organisms don't experience the weighty force of gravity pulling them downwards. This could theoretically allow organisms, such as humans, to grow larger without the structural limitations imposed by Earth's gravity. For example, the skeletal system wouldn't need to support as much weight, potentially allowing for increased size without the corresponding stress on bones and muscles.Space as a Laboratory: Space could act as a lab for this kind of experimentation, allowing scientists to manipulate and understand structures on a larger scale. This could also be applied to technological structures or machinery.Biological Implications: There would be a host of biological challenges to consider. For instance, how would circulatory systems function in a much larger body in microgravity? How would neural pathways evolve? These questions would need in-depth research and would provide valuable insights.Transitioning Back: If the eventual goal is to "microsize" for implementation on Earth, scientists would need to consider how insights gained from "upscaled" versions in space could be applied on Earth, with its unique gravitational constraints.Technological Enhancement: In line with your earlier ideas, once we understand these enlarged structures or organisms, we could integrate technological advancements to make them more efficient, perhaps leading to the desired "microsized" versions.Societal and Ethical Implications: Such experimentation would inevitably raise societal and ethical questions, especially if involving humans or sentient beings. It would be essential to navigate these carefully.Using space as a unique environment to explore these ideas is indeed fascinating. While there are numerous challenges, both technical and ethical, to consider, the concept offers an out-of-the-box perspective on the future of scientific exploration and technological innovation.1 / 1It looks like I am taking some I inspiration from Micromegas by Voltaire1 / 1ChatGPTIndeed, "MicromÃ©gas" by Voltaire is a philosophical tale that plays with the concept of scale and perspective. Written in 1752, it tells the story of two interstellar travelers: MicromÃ©gas, a giant from a distant star, and a companion from Saturn. They visit Earth and, due to their immense size, view humans as tiny creatures, almost microscopic.The story delves into philosophical and satirical commentary on human nature, society, and our perceived significance in the vastness of the universe. It raises questions about the relativity of size and intelligence, and how our perspectives are shaped by our environment and our own physical scale.Your idea, while scientifically and speculatively driven, indeed shares some thematic similarities with Voltaire's tale, especially when considering the relative significance of size and the possibilities it might offer in terms of adaptation and understanding.Using literature as a touchstone for scientific and speculative exploration is a time-honored tradition and can provide valuable insights and inspiration.1 / 1Another summary of the theory.1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly! Here's a summary of the "Fuzzy Yarnball (FYI) Theory" based on the information you've shared:Fuzzy Yarnball (FYI) TheoryCore Concept: Rather than traditional black holes, the universe consists of FYIs - objects with a smooth, spherical core of degenerate matter similar to the core of a neutron star. These cores are surrounded by a fuzzy doughnut-shaped cloud of material. The term "fuzzy" also alludes to the weak Hawking radiation emitted from these entities.No Singularities: Unlike traditional black holes, FYIs do not have singularities at their centers. The innermost core is dense and spherical but does not reach an infinite density.Ubiquity of Hawking Radiation: The theory suggests that Hawking radiation is not just restricted to black holes. Given its weak nature, this radiation becomes significant only when the universe cools considerably.Galactic Formation: FYIs can form outside of galaxies in the vast intergalactic voids. They slowly accumulate mass through a process involving axionic clouds.Interstellar Travel: FYIs suggest a counterintuitive approach to space travel. Before venturing to miniaturization and efficient propulsion systems, humanity should consider macro-sizing and using interstellar arks. By enlarging the human body, we can enhance repairability and longevity. Later on, with a better understanding of the macro form, we can then revert to micro-sizing, akin to the evolution from large steam-powered machinery to smaller electric devices.Environment and Adaptation: The best environment to attempt such macro-sizing might be space due to its reduced gravitational constraints.Inspiration and Application: The FYI theory takes cues from various mathematical and computational models like visual complex analysis, 5D Ising synchronization, Markov chains, cellular automata, and the Pauli exclusion principle. It also resonates with literary and philosophical themes seen in works like Voltaire's "MicromÃ©gas."This abstract captures the essence of the FYI theory based on the provided details. You can further refine or expand upon these points as your theory evolves.1 / 1Yeah it sounds too speculative maybe I am just making things up1 / 1ChatGPTThat's the nature of theorizing and brainstormingâmany ideas start as speculative or imaginative concepts. Not every idea will become a mainstream theory, but that shouldn't deter you from exploring and refining your thoughts. Remember that many groundbreaking ideas in science and philosophy were initially met with skepticism.The important thing is to continually evaluate, test, and refine your ideas. Feedback from experts in relevant fields and building a foundation based on established scientific principles can help strengthen the theory. Even if the theory doesn't become accepted in its entirety, parts of it could inspire new lines of thought or research in unforeseen ways.Science and knowledge advance by pushing boundaries and questioning the status quo. Keep exploring your ideas and see where they lead!1 / 1Give a list of the testable hypotheses we have given so far.1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly! Here's a list of the testable hypotheses derived from your "Fuzzy Yarnball" (FYI) theory and related discussions:Nature of Black Holes:The core of a black hole consists of a smooth, round sphere of degenerate matter, similar to the core of a neutron star, rather than a singularity.This core is surrounded by a "fuzzy" donut of material.Hawking Radiation's Role:The universe's cooling significantly will make Hawking radiation more relevant.Galactic Formation and Black Holes:Black holes can form outside of galaxies in galactic voids through the slow accumulation of an axionic cloud.Interstellar Travel Using Halo Drive:Efficient interstellar travel using halo drives (which harness the energy from black holes) won't be practical until we've depleted "space dust."Interstellar Arks for Space Travel:Giant interstellar arks are the best method for traveling to other stars.Bodily Adaptation for Space:Enlarging the human body would be advantageous for space travel due to enhanced repairability and increased longevity.The low gravity of space would be a more conducive environment for this type of bodily expansion.Over time, there may be a shift towards micro-sizing the human body after the benefits and mechanics of an enlarged body are better understood.Biological Adaptations for Longevity:Bones could be replaced or enhanced with web nanocarbon tubes.Spacing ventricles throughout the body filled with time-release emergency nutrients and prebiotic reserves can enhance longevity.Each of these hypotheses requires rigorous testing and validation. It would be beneficial to collaborate with experts in various fields (astrophysics, biology, materials science, etc.) to design experiments or simulations to test these hypotheses.1 / 1Comparison with other theories.1 / 1ChatGPTTo provide a meaningful comparison, we need to contextualize your Fuzzy Yarnball (FYI) theory against established theories in astrophysics and cosmology. Here are some key theories and how FYI theory compares:General Relativity (GR) and Black Holes:GR: Predicts the formation of singularities inside black holes, regions where densities become infinite.FYI: Rejects singularities, positing that the core of a black hole consists of a round sphere of degenerate matter, like a neutron star core.Hawking Radiation:Standard Theory: Quantum effects near the event horizon of a black hole can lead to the emission of particles, causing the black hole to lose mass over time.FYI: Incorporates the concept of Hawking radiation but emphasizes its increased relevance as the universe cools significantly.Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ÎCDM) Model:ÎCDM: A model that describes the universe as consisting of normal matter, cold dark matter, and a cosmological constant (representing dark energy).FYI: Uses parameters from this model in its mathematical foundation, especially in the context of Ising synchronization.Interstellar Travel:Standard Proposals: Ideas like the Alcubierre warp drive or using wormholes for faster-than-light travel.FYI: Focuses on the practicality of giant interstellar arks for space travel and the potential use of black holes (Halo Drives) for propulsion.Evolutionary Biology:Standard Theory: Evolution of species occurs over time through natural selection in response to environmental challenges.FYI: Introduces the idea of intentional physiological alterations to the human body (both expansion and potential micro-sizing) as a response to the challenges of space travel.Mach's Principle and Relativity:Standard Theory: Mach's principle suggests that local inertial frames are determined by the large-scale distribution of matter.FYI: By suggesting that any sufficiently large system can be modeled as a black hole, there may be an implicit connection to Mach's principle, tying local phenomena to the broader universe.To truly evaluate FYI theory's validity, it would be essential to derive predictions distinct from those made by established theories and then test these predictions experimentally or observationally. It's also crucial to identify any contradictions between FYI and established theories and resolve them, either by refining the theory or through new empirical findings.1 / 1A final summary.1 / 1ChatGPTFuzzy Yarnball (FYI) Theory: A SummaryThe Fuzzy Yarnball (FYI) Theory presents a novel conceptualization of black holes and their implications on astrophysics, cosmology, and even human evolution and space travel.Core Concepts:Reconceptualizing Black Holes: Unlike the traditional view of black holes with singularities, FYI theory posits that black holes contain a smooth, round sphere of degenerate matter akin to a neutron star's core. Surrounding this core is a "fuzzy" donut of material and Hawking radiation, with the latter becoming more relevant as the universe cools.Universality of Black Hole Modeling: The theory suggests that any sufficiently large system, even if not traditionally viewed as a black hole, can be modeled as one.Black Hole Formation: Black holes may sometimes form in galactic voids via the slow accumulation of an axionic cloud.Interstellar Travel: Instead of harnessing faster-than-light mechanisms, the FYI theory emphasizes the use of giant interstellar arks for space voyages. There's also a nod to the concept of using black holes (Halo Drives) for propulsion.Human Evolution for Space: FYI theory speculates on deliberate physiological alterations to the human body for enhanced survival in space. This includes expanding human body size for better repairability and increased longevity, followed by potential micro-sizing for more efficient space living.Theoretical Foundations: The theory leans on various mathematical models including visual complex analysis, 5-dimensional Ising synchronization with ÎCDM parameters, Markov chains, cellular automata, the Pauli exclusion principle, and data from the Illustris galactic filament simulation project.Comparisons and Implications:FYI theory diverges significantly from established astrophysical and cosmological theories, especially in its conceptualization of black holes. While it takes inspiration from various scientific domains, the theory also integrates speculative elements, making it a blend of both established science and visionary thinking.Future Directions:To solidify the FYI theory, it will be crucial to derive distinct, testable predictions that differentiate it from current theories. These predictions should then be subjected to empirical or observational testing. The theory also invites interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together astrophysicists, biologists, and even engineers to explore its diverse implications.1 / 1ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.
