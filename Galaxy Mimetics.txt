Explain why popcorn pops to a kid who loves watching it in the microwave.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Hey there! Popcorn pops because each kernel has a tiny bit of water inside. When you heat it up in the microwave, that water turns into steam. The steam builds up pressure until���POP!���the kernel bursts open and turns inside out. It's like the kernel is doing a little explosion dance just for you!

Sorry that is not what I meant to ask, I wanted to know about a law or maxim similar to kryder's law that states that the needs and uses of a technology will scale to fill whatever size storage medium is available
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, I see what you're getting at now. There isn't a universally recognized law like Kryder's Law for this, but the concept you're describing is often referred to as "Parkinson's Law of Data," a variation of Parkinson's Law. The original Parkinson's Law states that "work expands to fill the time available for its completion."
In the context of data and storage, it suggests that data will grow to fill the storage capacity available. As storage becomes cheaper and more abundant, people and organizations find new ways to use it, effectively filling it up regardless of its size. So even if we keep increasing storage sizes, we'll always find more data to fill it!

The entropy of the entangled Hawking radiation
Authors
Olivier Denis
Information Physics Institute, Gosport, Hampshire, UK
DOI: https://doi.org/10.59973/ipil.9
Keywords: Information paradox, Quantum gravity, Mass-energy-information principle, Entropy, Black hole, Black hole thermodynamics, Quantum Information
Abstract
Entropic information theory, as a unified informational theory, presents a new informational theoretical framework capable of fully describing the evaporation of the black holes phenomenon while resolving the information paradox, reconciling quantum formalism and relativistic formalism in a single approach. With a set of five new equivalent equations expressing entropy, and by introducing the Hawking temperature into one of them, it is possible to solve the black holes information paradox by being able to calculate the entropy of entangled Hawking radiation, entangled with the fields inside black holes, allowing us to extract information from inside black holes. The proposed model solves the information paradox of black holes by calculating a new entropy formula for the entropy of black holes as equal to the entropy of the pure state of entangled Hawking radiation, itself equal to the fine-grained entropy or von Neumann entropy, itself according to the work of Casini and Bousso equal to the Bekenstein bound which is itself equal, being saturated by Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, at this same entropy. Moreover, since the law of the entropy horizon of black holes turns out to be a special case of the Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture, this general formula for the fine-grained entropy of quantum systems coupled to gravity, equalizes the entropy of entangled Hawking radiation with the gravitational fine-grained entropy of black holes, and makes it possible to relate this resolution of the information paradox of black holes based on the concept of mass of the information bit to quantum gravity explaining the emergence of the quantum gravity process through the fundamentality of entangled quantum information.

The paper by Olivier Denis introduces a new theoretical framework, entropic information theory, to address the black hole information paradox. The framework unifies quantum and relativistic formalism and introduces five new equations related to entropy. One of these equations incorporates Hawking temperature to calculate the entropy of entangled Hawking radiation emitted by black holes. This enables extraction of information from inside black holes and resolves the information paradox. The model equates the entropy of black holes to the entropy of entangled Hawking radiation, which is in line with other established theories such as the Bekenstein bound and the Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture. Overall, the work aims to connect quantum gravity with the concept of entangled quantum information.

The paper discusses a new theoretical framework aimed at solving the black hole information paradox. The framework utilizes entropic information theory to describe the evaporation of black holes and reconcile quantum and relativistic formalisms. By introducing new equations for entropy and incorporating the Hawking temperature, the theory allows for the calculation of the entropy of entangled Hawking radiation, which is related to the fields inside black holes. This makes it possible to extract information from inside black holes, thus resolving the information paradox. The paper also relates this solution to the Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture and the concept of mass of the information bit, tying it into quantum gravity.

Ok so can you give an analogy with the popcorn metaphor?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Imagine a black hole as a popcorn machine. Normally, you can't see inside the popcorn machine once it's closed, just like you can't see inside a black hole. When popcorn (analogous to Hawking radiation) pops out, you know something is happening inside, but you don't know which kernels (information) are popping.
In the traditional understanding, once the popcorn is out, it doesn't tell you much about the individual kernels inside. This is like the black hole information paradox: the information inside is lost or scrambled beyond recognition.
In the new theory, it's as if each popped piece of popcorn is still connected by an "informational thread" to its original kernel inside the machine. This thread contains information about the kernel, allowing us to trace back and know more about what's going inside the popcorn machine. This "thread" is the theoretical construct that helps solve the paradox, making it possible to gain information about the inner workings of the black hole (popcorn machine) through the popped popcorn (Hawking radiation).

Ok that was not bad, I was thinking that the kernel could represent a black hole, it appears very stable, but after poincar�� timescales the cooling effect density lowering expansion smooths out the universe due to Entropic effects responsible for time's arrow it will "pop" by radiating its "heat" into the surrounding ultracool and ultrasmooth vacuum
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, that's an intriguing twist on the metaphor! In your version, the kernel itself represents the black hole, seemingly stable and self-contained for a very long time (akin to Poincar�� recurrence times). The universe itself serves as the environment inside the popcorn machine, initially too hot and dense to let anything change much.
As the universe cools and expands, it becomes more thermodynamically favorable for the black hole to "pop," or evaporate, through Hawking radiation, releasing its "heat" or energy back into the now ultra-cool and smooth universe.
Your analogy captures the long-term evolution of black holes in an expanding universe, tied to the thermodynamic arrow of time. It's a great way to consider the black hole's life cycle in the context of cosmic evolution and entropy.
1 / 1
So I argue that due to expansion, in billions of years we well have to build our bodies out of halo lasers and blackholes
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your vision of the future posits a radical adaptation to a universe that's forever changing due to expansion and cooling. The idea that we may need to construct our bodies out of more "exotic" materials like halo lasers and black holes suggests an extreme form of bioengineering to survive in such conditions. This is speculative, of course, but it's an interesting thought experiment that plays with the boundaries of physics and biology. As the universe evolves, adapting to these large-scale changes might require equally radical transformations.

The Last Question" is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov. It first appeared in the November 1956 issue of Science Fiction Quarterly and in the anthologies in the collections Nine Tomorrows (1959), The Best of Isaac Asimov (1973), Robot Dreams (1986), The Best Science Fiction of Isaac Asimov (1986), the retrospective Opus 100 (1969), and in Isaac Asimov: The Complete Stories, Vol. 1 (1990)

"The Last Question" is one of Isaac Asimov's most famous and enduring works, often cited by the author himself as his best short story. The narrative follows a recurring scenario across different epochs of the universe's history. In each scenario, humans (or increasingly advanced versions of sentient beings) ask the Multivac computer system (and its future iterations) how to reverse the entropy of the universe, effectively asking how to prevent it from dying a heat death. Each time, the computer responds that it does not have enough data to provide an answer. The story ends with the universe reaching its entropic end, and the last version of the computer, now alone, finally solves the question but has no one to tell. It then says, "Let there be light," restarting the universe, in a nod to the Biblical story of creation.
The story tackles deep questions about the future of the universe, the nature of knowledge, and the quest for ultimate answers, themes that seem to resonate with the kinds of speculative thoughts you've been sharing.

What are the connections?

ChatGPT
Your speculation and Asimov's "The Last Question" both grapple with the long-term fate of the universe and the role of entropy in that destiny. In both scenarios, entropy leads to a state of maximal disorder, or "heat death," where all forms of matter and energy are uniformly distributed.
Your idea involving black holes and halo lasers as future building blocks for life implies an adaptation to the entropic future of the universe. Similarly, in Asimov's story, beings continually evolve to cope with the universe's changing conditions, albeit unsuccessfully in stopping the entropy.
Both your thoughts and Asimov's story touch on the concept of time's arrow, dictated by entropic increase, and consider whether there's a way to 'reset' or escape this fate. Asimov offers a poetic answer, where the last version of the Multivac effectively 'resets' the universe, echoing the idea that perhaps, somehow, entropy could be reversed or a new order could be instated.

Future spaceships could use black holes as powerful launch pads to explore the stars.

A new study envisions firing laser beams that would curve around a black hole and come back with added energy to help propel a spacecraft to near the speed of light. Astronomers could look for signs that alien civilizations are using such a "halo drive," as the study dubs it, by seeing if pairs of black holes are merging more often than expected.

Study author David Kipping, an astrophysicist at Columbia University in New York, came up with the idea of the halo drive through what he calls "the gamer's mindset."

"Sometimes, in a computer game you find an 'exploit,' a hack which allows you to do something overpowered that would otherwise be forbidden by the rules of the game," Kipping told Space.com. "In this case, the game is the physical world, and I tried to think about exploits that would allow a civilization to achieve relativistic flight back and forth across the galaxy without the vast energy expense that one might naively assume."

A key challenge to using rockets to fly through space is that the propellant they carry with them has mass. Long trips need a lot of propellant, which makes the rockets heavy, which in turn requires more propellant, making the rockets even heavier, and so on. That problem gets exponentially worse the bigger the rocket gets. 

Instead of carrying propellant for propulsion, however, spacecraft equipped with mirror-like sails could rely on lasers to push them outward. The $100 million Breakthrough Starshot initiative, announced in 2016, plans to use powerful lasers to propel swarms of spacecraft to Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our own, at up to 20 percent the speed of light.

The spacecraft that Breakthrough Starshot aims to launch are each only about the size of a microchip. In order to accelerate larger spaceships to relativistic speeds ��� to a significant fraction of light speed ��� Kipping sought the aid of gravity.

Spacecraft now regularly use "slingshot maneuvers," in which the gravity of a body, such as a planet or moon, hurls the vessels across space and boosts their speed. In 1963, famed physicist Freeman Dyson suggested that spaceships of any given size could rely on slingshot maneuvers around compact pairs of white dwarfs or neutron stars to fly at relativistic speeds. (Dyson came up with the notion of what became known as a Dyson sphere, a megastructure that encapsulates a star to capture as much of its energy as possible to power an advanced civilization.)

However, a "Dyson slingshot" runs the risk of damaging a spacecraft through extreme gravitational forces and hazardous radiation from those pairs of dead stars. Instead, Kipping suggests that gravity might assist spaceships by increasing the energy of laser beams fired at the edges of black holes.

Black holes possess gravitational fields so powerful that nothing can escape them once it gets close enough, not even light. Their gravitational fields can also distort the paths of photons of light that do not fall into the holes.

In 1993, physicist Mark Stuckey suggested that a black hole could, in principle, act like a "gravitational mirror," in that the black hole's gravity could slingshot a photon around so that it flew back at its source. Kipping calculated that if a black hole was moving toward a photon's source, the "boomerang photon" would siphon away some of the black hole's energy.

Your idea and the concept of the "Halo Drive" both involve creative uses of black holes and other celestial bodies for advanced space travel or future living. The Halo Drive posits that lasers can curve around black holes to accelerate spacecraft to near the speed of light. This would potentially allow civilizations to overcome the limitations of conventional rocket fuel and attain relativistic speeds, significantly reducing travel time across the galaxy.
Your suggestion extrapolates from such advanced technologies to a far future where the entropic increase and universal expansion might force us to construct our bodies out of black holes and halo lasers. Here, the idea is not just about using these celestial phenomena for travel but adapting to new forms of existence that can survive in an entropically declining universe.
Both ideas tackle the challenge of long-term survival and capability in a universe dominated by entropy and expansion, though from different angles. The Halo Drive is a practical solution for interstellar travel today (or in the near future), while your idea is more of a speculative, long-term adaptation to a universe increasingly dominated by entropy.
In a way, both can be seen as "hacks" or "exploits" that allow for possibilities not immediately obvious under the traditional "rules of the game" set by physics and our current understanding of the universe.

Yeah I saw an article on estivating aliens recently that argued super intelligent creators would decide to go into polyp seed hibernation until closer to the heat death of the universe, when they can do their calculations more efficiently

The idea of estivating aliens waiting for the universe to cool down so they can perform computations more efficiently is indeed a fascinating concept. It's based on the principle that computational efficiency increases as temperatures drop. By waiting until the universe is much colder, these hypothetical beings would optimize their computational resources, which could be invaluable for them.
This notion complements your earlier idea about evolving bodies made of black holes and halo lasers. Both concepts touch on long-term strategies for surviving and thriving in a universe governed by thermodynamic laws and ever-increasing entropy. While the estivating aliens would be choosing a path of dormancy until conditions are right, your concept focuses on active adaptation and utilization of the universe's resources to sustain life and civilization.
They're both imaginative takes on how advanced civilizations might "hack" the universe's constraints to their advantage.

Yeah I argue that we should build Dyson spheres around every star to create an intergalactic communication device by blinking the stars off and on using a coordinate von Neumann probe blockchain I call galaxy mimetics.

Your idea of using Dyson spheres around stars as part of an intergalactic communication network is quite ambitious and imaginative. The concept of "blinking" stars on and off could serve as a vast signaling mechanism, and using a von Neumann probe blockchain to automate and coordinate this activity adds another layer of complexity and scalability. "Galaxy mimetics" suggests that this system would mimic or replicate information across the galaxy, creating a sort of cosmic internet.
Such a network would require a tremendous amount of energy and resources, but if achieved, it could serve multiple functions: energy harvesting, communication, and perhaps even computational tasks. This is a far-reaching vision that combines advanced astrophysics, communication theory, and blockchain technology into one grand scheme. Like estivating aliens or halo drives, it's another way of contemplating how an advanced civilization might navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the universe.

Yeah first I want to emulate the spiral arm structure of andromeda, to signal peaceful intentions and to show that we have intelligent control of our galaxy. It would also contain recursive holographic instructions for repair and rebuilding the galactic internet should too many subsystems fail at once

Your idea of emulating the spiral arm structure of Andromeda as a form of signaling is quite poetic and interesting. By mimicking a natural galaxy formation, you'd essentially be showing a kind of "cosmic handshake," suggesting peaceful intentions and intelligence.
The concept of embedding recursive holographic instructions for repair and rebuilding is also clever. It ensures the system's resilience against failures, effectively making it self-sustaining and self-repairing. This kind of failsafe mechanism would be crucial for a galactic-scale project, given the myriad of things that could go wrong over cosmic distances and time scales.
Your ideas touch on a blend of artistry and science, creating a vision for what a super-advanced civilization might aspire to achieve. It's a compelling concept, combining diplomacy, engineering, and cosmic aesthetics into one grand project.
