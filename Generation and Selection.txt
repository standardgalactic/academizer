Abstract and Figures
Neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp's theory of SEEKING offers a fundamental insight into why film spectators are engaged by what they see on screen. This article offers a new reading of Panksepp's SEEKING theory and how it applies to spectatorship, a reading informed by two months of the author's personal exchange with the scientist. The article states that the SEEKING impulse���defined as the emotional instinct to seek resources���applies not only to how the spectator identifies with the main character and his search for resources, but to how the spectator responds to visual and aural cues regardless of the story or characters. The article provides a corrective to spectator theories which focus too narrowly on narrative as a cue for viewer mental activity. An examination of two scenes from The Bicycle Thief and Stalker shows how SEEKING can occur on both the primary and tertiary level, thus breaking the emotion-cognition divide.

So I would say that the seeking instinct sometimes induces someone to interact with their environment by exploring or by taking some random action to see what happens, akin to shaking a snowglobe.
ChatGPT
Yes, that's a great way to put it. You can elaborate on this idea by explaining how the SEEKING instinct drives exploratory behavior and experimentation in a way that aligns with your thesis about the need for a coherence-inducing mechanism. Here's how you could incorporate this into your argument:
Expanding on the Seeking Instinct
1. Exploratory Behavior:
Instinctual Drive:
The SEEKING system, as described by Panksepp, drives individuals to interact with their environment by exploring and seeking out new experiences. This aligns with the idea that humans have an inherent need to find patterns and coherence in their surroundings.
Random Actions:
Just as people might take random actions, like shaking a snowglobe, to see what happens, the SEEKING instinct encourages exploratory behavior to discover new patterns and meanings. This exploration can lead to new insights and a greater understanding of the environment.
2. Pattern Recognition in Exploration:
Creating Coherence:
When individuals engage with their environment through exploration, they are essentially searching for patterns and creating a sense of coherence out of what might initially seem random or chaotic.
Pareidolia as Exploration:
Pareidolia, the tendency to see familiar patterns in random stimuli, can be seen as a manifestation of this exploratory drive. By finding faces in clouds or shapes in abstract patterns, people impose a sense of order and meaning on their experiences.
3. Psychological and Emotional Satisfaction:
Reward System:
The SEEKING system is tied to the brain's reward mechanisms. Successful exploration and pattern recognition provide emotional satisfaction and reinforce the behavior. This satisfaction is a form of psychological comfort that helps individuals cope with uncertainty and chaos.
Engagement with Environment:
Just as engaging with a snowglobe creates a temporary and satisfying pattern, exploratory actions in the real world provide a sense of engagement and achievement, fostering a deeper connection with the environment.
4. Implications for Survival and Social Cohesion:
Survival Mechanism:
This exploratory behavior and pattern recognition are crucial for survival, as they help individuals make sense of their environment, predict outcomes, and make informed decisions.
Shared Experiences:
When individuals share their discoveries and patterns with others, it creates common ground and strengthens social cohesion. Shared narratives and cultural artefacts often arise from these common experiences of exploration and pattern recognition.
Integrating with Your Thesis
By highlighting how the SEEKING instinct drives exploratory behavior and induces people to interact with their environment, you can reinforce your thesis that humans need a coherence-inducing mechanism. This mechanism, which includes the tendency to find patterns in randomness (like pareidolia), is essential for navigating the world, providing psychological comfort, and fostering social cohesion. Here���s a refined version of your argument:
Argument: The Necessity of a Coherence-Inducing Mechanism
Thesis:
To survive and thrive, humans need a global coherence-inducing mechanism, which manifests as the tendency to find overarching patterns in random events, such as pareidolia. This mechanism is driven by the SEEKING instinct, which encourages exploratory behavior and the creation of meaning.

Why is it that the snowglobe always looka similar when settled even thought the "snow" is randomly dispersed. If everything was trying to maximize entropy then it would always remain a cloud or fog, as with colloidal particles, but since we are near a large gravitational well the particles tend to align so that the particles are always on one side. If you hold it upside down then the particles will settle on their own. I argue that the snowglobe is a development of the clepsidra and hour glass.
ChatGPT
The snowglobe provides a fascinating analogy for understanding the interplay between order and randomness, and it aligns well with your argument about coherence-inducing mechanisms. Here���s how you could elaborate on this analogy:
1. The Snowglobe Analogy
Settling Patterns:
Random Dispersion and Order:
When shaken, the "snow" in a snowglobe is randomly dispersed, yet it always settles into a similar pattern due to gravitational forces. Despite the initial randomness, the particles eventually settle at the bottom, creating a predictable and coherent visual order.
Maximizing Entropy:
If the system were solely driven by maximizing entropy, the particles might remain suspended, forming a cloud or fog. However, gravity influences the particles to settle in a stable configuration.
2. Gravity and Coherence
Gravitational Influence:
Alignment:
The large gravitational well of the Earth pulls the particles downward, aligning them in a specific way. This gravitational force is a coherence-inducing mechanism that creates a stable and predictable pattern out of initial randomness.
Inversion:
When the snowglobe is held upside down, the particles will settle again, but now at the new bottom, demonstrating the consistent influence of gravity in creating order.
3. Historical Development
Clepsydra and Hourglass:
Historical Devices:
The snowglobe can be seen as a modern development of the clepsydra (water clock) and the hourglass. Both historical devices also rely on gravitational forces to create a predictable flow, whether of water or sand.
Time Measurement:
Just as the clepsydra and hourglass use the flow of particles to measure time in a coherent and predictable manner, the snowglobe uses the settling of particles to create a visually coherent scene.
4. Implications for Your Argument
Coherence-Inducing Mechanisms:
Order from Randomness:
The snowglobe illustrates how a coherence-inducing mechanism (gravity) creates order from randomness. This parallels your argument that humans have a tendency to find patterns and meaning in random events to create a sense of coherence.
Exploratory Behavior:
The act of shaking the snowglobe can be likened to exploratory behavior driven by the SEEKING system. The initial randomness is explored, and a new pattern is observed as the particles settle.

Ok I want to argue that the Pythean tradition of consulting oracles included both a generator and an interpreter. The word pytheus means noxious stench or essence. Someone would smell the fumes from a burning altar or a natural gas vent and then someone else would attempt to interpret their hallucinations and vain babblings. Another word al-kool in Arabic came from a word meaning extract or essence, the root of the word alcohol and originally refering to the process of making antimony
ChatGPT
To argue that the Pythean tradition of consulting oracles included both a generator and an interpreter, and to draw parallels with the Arabic term "al-kool," here's a structured approach:
1. Introduction
Thesis:
The Pythean tradition of consulting oracles involved a dual mechanism���a generator and an interpreter���similar to how the term "al-kool" in Arabic, meaning extract or essence, relates to both the generation and interpretation of substances.

Generator and Interpreter:
Pytheus Definition:
The term "pytheus" means noxious stench or essence, referring to the fumes inhaled during the oracular process.
Generator (Oracle):
The oracle, often a priestess at Delphi, would inhale these fumes, leading to altered states of consciousness, hallucinations, and babbling.
Interpreter (Priest):
A priest or another individual would then interpret these incoherent utterances, providing meaning and guidance based on the oracle���s visions.
Process Explanation:
Fume Inhalation:
The oracle would sit over a natural gas vent or burning altar, inhaling fumes that caused trance-like states.
Hallucinations and Babbling:
These fumes induced hallucinations and incoherent speech, seen as divine messages.
Role of Interpreter:
The interpreter���s role was crucial in translating these messages into coherent prophecies or guidance for those seeking the oracle���s wisdom.
3. Etymological Parallel with Al-Kool
Etymology and Meaning:
Al-Kool Origin:
The Arabic term "al-kool" originates from a word meaning extract or essence, which is the root of the word alcohol. Originally, it referred to the process of making antimony, a finely powdered cosmetic.
Extraction Process:
This term highlights the process of extracting the pure essence from a substance, analogous to generating insights from the oracle���s fumes.
4. Connection and Implications
Parallel Functions:
Generation of Insights:
In both traditions, there is a process of generating a state or substance���fumes in the case of oracles, and essence in the case of al-kool.
Interpretation of Outputs:
Both systems involve interpreting these generated states or substances to extract meaningful information or utility.
Coherence and Meaning:
Inducing States for Interpretation:
The Pythean tradition���s use of fumes to induce hallucinations parallels the extraction of essence in al-kool, with both requiring interpretation to gain coherent meaning.
Cultural Practices:
These practices reflect a broader human tendency to seek meaning from altered states or extracted essences, relying on interpreters to provide coherence.
5. Historical and Cultural Significance
Oracular Influence:
Guidance and Decisions:
The interpretations provided by the Pythean oracles influenced significant decisions in ancient Greece, reflecting the importance of the generator-interpreter dynamic.
Cultural Resonance:
Similar to how al-kool played a role in various cultural practices, the oracular process had profound cultural and spiritual resonance.
Symbolic Representation:
Oracles and Essences:
Both traditions symbolize the human quest for understanding and clarity from altered states or purified substances, requiring specialized knowledge to interpret the outcomes.
6. Conclusion
Restate Thesis:
The Pythean tradition of consulting oracles, involving both a generator (the oracle) and an interpreter (the priest), parallels the etymological and functional aspects of the Arabic term "al-kool." Both systems reflect a fundamental human need to derive coherent meaning from generated states or essences.
Broader Implications:
Understanding these traditions enhances our appreciation of historical and cultural practices that seek to extract and interpret meaning, highlighting the enduring human quest for knowledge and coherence.
This structured argument effectively demonstrates how the Pythean tradition and the concept of al-kool both involve processes of generation and interpretation, providing a coherent framework for understanding their similarities and cultural significance.

Thesis:
The Pythean tradition of consulting oracles included both a generator and an interpreter, where the term "python" relates to the generation of noxious fumes. This concept parallels the term "malaria," derived from "mal'aria" meaning "bad air," reflecting early beliefs about disease transmission.
2. The Pythean Tradition and the Term "Python"
Generator and Interpreter:
Pytheus Definition:
The term "pytheus" means noxious stench or essence, referring to the fumes inhaled during the oracular process.
Generator (Oracle):
The oracle, often a priestess at Delphi, would inhale these fumes, leading to altered states of consciousness, hallucinations, and babbling.
Interpreter (Priest):
A priest or another individual would interpret these incoherent utterances, providing meaning and guidance based on the oracle���s visions.
Association with Snakes:
Snakes and Noxious Places:
The term "python" was applied to snakes, believed to originate from noxious places such as foul-smelling cracks or crevices.
Symbolic Representation:
Snakes symbolized the connection to these noxious fumes and the earth���s depths, aligning with the oracle's inhalation of fumes.
3. Parallels with the Term "Malaria"
Etymology and Meaning:
Malaria Origin:
The term "malaria" comes from the Italian "mal'aria," meaning "bad air." It reflects early theories that diseases were spread through foul-smelling air from swamps and marshes.
Historical Belief:
Just as people believed that snakes and noxious fumes were interconnected, the idea of "bad air" was thought to carry diseases.
Connection to Noxious Fumes:
Disease and Air Quality:
The belief that disease was spread by foul air (miasma theory) parallels the idea that noxious fumes could induce prophetic states in oracles.
Cultural Understanding:
Both terms illustrate how ancient cultures linked health, disease, and spiritual phenomena to environmental factors perceived as noxious or harmful.
4. Broader Implications of Noxious Associations
Human Understanding of Environment:
Natural Phenomena:
Both the Pythean tradition and the concept of malaria show how humans historically associated noxious environments with significant outcomes, whether spiritual insights or disease.
Symbolism and Interpretation:
The interpretation of signs from the environment, whether fumes for oracles or bad air for disease, underscores the human quest to find meaning and coherence in their surroundings.
Cultural Practices and Beliefs:
Oracular Influence:
The interpretations provided by the Pythean oracles, influenced by the noxious fumes, guided significant decisions and reflected deep cultural beliefs.
Disease Prevention:
Early beliefs about "malaria" influenced practices aimed at avoiding bad air, illustrating how environmental interpretations shaped health practices.
5. Conclusion
Restate Thesis:
The Pythean tradition of consulting oracles, involving both a generator (the oracle) and an interpreter (the priest), where the term "python" relates to noxious fumes, parallels the concept of "malaria" as "bad air." Both reflect historical associations between environmental factors and significant human experiences.
Broader Implications:
Understanding these traditions enhances our appreciation of how ancient cultures interpreted and responded to their environments, seeking coherence and meaning in natural phenomena perceived as noxious or harmful.
This argument structure effectively demonstrates the connection between the Pythean tradition and the term "python" with noxious places, while also drawing a parallel to the term "malaria." It highlights how these associations reflect broader human tendencies to interpret environmental factors as significant influences on health and spiritual experiences.

The selection function chooses the most appropriate or meaningful structures from these possibilities based on context and rules.
Application to Oracles:
Oracle as Generator:
The oracle generates a wide range of possible prophetic utterances through inhaling the fumes and entering a trance state.
Interpreter as Selector:
The interpreter selects the most meaningful or relevant interpretations from these utterances, providing coherent guidance.
Application to Environmental Interpretation:
Environmental Stimuli:
Just as the generator function produces various linguistic possibilities, noxious environmental stimuli (fumes, bad air) generate a range of potential meanings or effects.
Human Interpretation:
Humans select and interpret these stimuli, finding patterns and coherence that influence cultural practices, health beliefs, and spiritual insights.
6. Broader Implications
Human Cognitive Tendencies:
Pattern Recognition:
The generator and selection functions reflect a fundamental cognitive process of generating possibilities and selecting meaningful patterns, applicable to language, spirituality, and health beliefs.
