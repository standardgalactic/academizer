"Geometric Deep Learning: Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges" by Michael M. Bronstein, Joan Bruna, Taco Cohen, and Petar Veli��kovi�� is a comprehensive work in the field of deep learning. The paper presents an extended framework for deep learning, moving beyond traditional data structures like grids (as used in image processing) and sequences (as in natural language processing), to more general data structures, including groups, graphs, and manifolds.
The authors propose a unifying framework that encompasses these various data structures. They explore the concept of geometric deep learning, which is based on the principle that the geometric structure of the data should guide the construction of the learning algorithms. This approach is particularly effective for non-Euclidean data, like graphs and manifolds, which are common in many real-world applications.
The paper delves into specific applications and methodologies, discussing how these geometric principles can be applied to different types of data and tasks. For example, graph neural networks (GNNs) are highlighted as a powerful tool for working with graph-structured data.
The work reflects the affiliation and expertise of the authors from prominent institutions like Imperial College London, New York University, Qualcomm AI Research, and DeepMind. It is a significant contribution to the field of deep learning, indicating a shift towards more versatile and geometrically-informed models that can handle a wider range of data types and structures.

Preface 
For nearly two millenia since Euclid���s Elements, the word According to a popular belief, 
the Erlangen Programme was 
delivered in Klein���s inaugural 
address in October 1872. 
Klein indeed gave such a talk 
(though on December 7 of 
the same year), but it was for 
a non-mathematical audience 
and concerned primarily his 
ideas of mathematical 
education. What is now 
called the ���Erlangen 
Programme��� was actually a 
research prospectus brochure 
Vergleichende Betrachtungen 
��ber neuere geometrische 
Forschungen (���A comparative 
review of recent researches in 
geometry���) he prepared as 
part of his professor 
appointment. See Tobies 
(2019). 
���geometry��� has been 
synonymous with Euclidean geometry, as no other types of geometry existed. 
Euclid���s monopoly came to an end in the nineteenth century, with examples 
of non-Euclidean geometries constructed by Lobachevesky, Bolyai, Gauss, 
and Riemann. Towards the end of that century, these studies had diverged 
into disparate i elds, with mathematicians and philosophers debating the 
validity of and relations between these geometries as well as the nature of 
the ���one true geometry���. 
A way out of this pickle was shown by a young mathematician Felix Klein, 
appointed in 1872 as professor in the small Bavarian University of Erlangen. 
In a research prospectus, which entered the annals of mathematics as the 
Erlangen Programme, Klein proposed approaching geometry as the study of 
invariants, i.e. properties unchanged under some class of transformations, 
called the symmetries of the geometry. This approach created clarity by 
showing that various geometries known at the time could be def i ned by 
an appropriate choice of symmetry transformations, formalized using the 
language of group theory. For instance, Euclidean geometry is concerned 
with lengths and angles, because these properties are preserved by the 
group of Euclidean transformations (rotations and translations), while af i ne 
geometry studies parallelism, which is preserved by the group of af i ne 
transformations. The relation between these geometries is immediately 
apparent when considering the respective groups, because the Euclidean 
group is a subgroup of the af i ne group, which in turn is a subgroup of the 
group of projective transformations. 
The impact of the Erlangen Programme on geometry was very profound. 
Furthermore, it spilled to other i elds, especially physics, where symmetry 
principlesallowedtoderiveconservationlawsfromf i rstprinciplesofsymme- 
try (an astonishing result known as Noether���s Theorem), and even enabled 
the classif i cation of elementary particles as irreducible representations of 
the symmetry group. Category theory, now pervasive in pure mathematics, 
can be ���regarded as a continuation of the Klein Erlangen Programme, in the 
sense that a geometrical space with its group of transformations is general- 
ized to a category with its algebra of mappings���, in the words of its creators 
Samuel Eilenber and Saunders Mac Lane. See Marquis (2009). 
At the time of writing, the state of the i eld of deep learning is somewhat 
2BRONSTEIN, BRUNA, COHEN & VELI��KOVI�� 
reminiscent of the i eld of geometry in the nineteenth century. There is a 
veritable zoo of neural network architectures for various kinds of data, but 
fewunifyingprinciples. Asintimespast, thismakesitdif i culttounderstand 
therelationsbetweenvariousmethods,inevitablyresultinginthereinvention 
and re-branding of the same concepts in dif f erent application domains. For 
a novice trying to learn the i eld, absorbing the sheer volume of redundant 
ideas is a true nightmare. 
In this text, we make a modest attempt to apply the Erlangen Programme 
mindset to the domain of deep learning, with the ultimate goal of obtaining a 
systematisation of this i eld and ���connecting the dots���. We call this geometri- 
sation attempt ���Geometric Deep Learning���, and true to the spirit of Felix 
Klein, propose to derive dif f erent inductive biases and network architectures 
implementing them from i rst principles of symmetry and invariance. In par- 
ticular, we focus on a large class of neural networks designed for analysing 
unstructured sets, grids, graphs, and manifolds, and show that they can be 
understood in a unif i ed manner as methods that respect the structure and 
symmetries of these domains.

The preface of "Geometric Deep Learning: Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges" provides a historical and philosophical context for the development of geometric deep learning. It begins by discussing the dominance of Euclidean geometry for nearly two millennia, which was challenged in the nineteenth century with the emergence of non-Euclidean geometries developed by mathematicians like Lobachevesky, Bolyai, Gauss, and Riemann.
A significant breakthrough came with Felix Klein, who, in 1872, introduced the Erlangen Programme. Contrary to popular belief, this wasn't presented in his inaugural address but rather as part of his professor appointment at the University of Erlangen. The Erlangen Programme revolutionized the field of geometry by proposing the study of invariants, or properties unchanged under certain transformations, using group theory. This approach provided clarity and unification to various geometrical fields by categorizing them based on their symmetry transformations.
The preface then connects this historical development with the current state of deep learning. It draws parallels between the disparate fields of geometry in the nineteenth century and the varied neural network architectures in contemporary deep learning. The authors aim to apply the principles of the Erlangen Programme to deep learning, striving for a systematic understanding and unification of the field. They propose the concept of 'Geometric Deep Learning', which seeks to derive different network architectures and inductive biases based on principles of symmetry and invariance. This approach focuses on neural networks designed for unstructured sets, grids, graphs, and manifolds, highlighting their unified understanding through respect for the structure and symmetries of these domains.

Sure! The preface of "Geometric Deep Learning" explains how the study of shapes and spaces (geometry) has changed over time. For a long time, everyone followed Euclid's ideas, which is a kind of geometry we often learn in school. But in the 1800s, mathematicians like Lobachevesky and Gauss started exploring new types of geometry.
Then, Felix Klein, a mathematician, came up with a new way to look at geometry in 1872. He suggested that instead of focusing on the shapes themselves, we should look at what doesn't change when we move or rotate these shapes. This idea helped to organize different kinds of geometry and showed how they are connected.
The authors of the paper see a similarity between Klein's work in geometry and the current state of deep learning (a type of artificial intelligence). Right now, in deep learning, there are many different ways to build AI models, and it can be confusing. The authors want to use Klein's idea to make sense of all these different AI models. They want to focus on what stays the same in different kinds of data (like images, networks, and 3D shapes) and use this to build better AI models. This way of thinking is what they call "Geometric Deep Learning."

We believe this text would appeal to a broad audience of deep learning re- 
searchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts. A novice may use it as an overview 
and introduction to Geometric Deep Learning. A seasoned deep learning 
expert may discover new ways of deriving familiar architectures from basic 
principles and perhaps some surprising connections. Practitioners may get 
new insights on how to solve problems in their respective i elds. 
With such a fast-paced i eld as modern machine learning, the risk of writing 
a text like this is that it becomes obsolete and irrelevant before it sees the light 
of day. Having focused on foundations, our hope is that the key concepts

1Introduction 
The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science 
and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many 
high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach ��� 
such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding ��� are in fact feasi- 
ble with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep 
learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: i rst, the notion of 
representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, fea- 
tures capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, 
learning by local gradient-descent, typically implemented as backpropagation. 
While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation 
problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential 
pre-def i ned regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality 
and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing 
these regularities through unif i ed geometric principles that can be applied 
throughout a wide spectrum of applications. 
Exploitingtheknownsymmetriesofalargesystemisapowerfulandclassical 
remedy against the curse of dimensionality, and forms the basis of most 
physical theories. Deep learning systems are no exception, and since the 
early days researchers have adapted neural networks to exploit the low- 
dimensional geometry arising from physical measurements, e.g. grids in 
images, sequences in time-series, or position and momentum in molecules, 
and their associated symmetries, such as translation or rotation. Throughout 
our exposition, we will describe these models, as well as many others, as 
natural instances of the same underlying principle of geometric regularity. 
Such a ���geometric unif i cation��� endeavour in the spirit of the Erlangen Pro- 
gram serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathemat- 
ical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, 
such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other, it gives a 
constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural 
architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to 
be invented. 
Before proceeding, it is worth noting that our work concerns representation 
learning architectures and exploiting the symmetries of data therein. The 
many exciting pipelines where such representations may be used (such as 
2. LEARNING IN HIGH DIMENSIONS5 
self-supervised learning, generative modelling, or reinforcement learning) 
are not our central focus The same applies for 
techniques used for 
optimising or regularising our 
architectures, such as Adam 
(Kingma and Ba, 2014), 
dropout (Srivastava et al., 
2014) or batch normalisation 
(Iof f e and Szegedy, 2015). 
. Hence, we will not review in depth inf l uential 
neural pipelines such as variational autoencoders (Kingma and Welling, 
2013), generative adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014), normal- 
ising l ows (Rezende and Mohamed, 2015), deep Q-networks (Mnih et al., 
2015), proximal policy optimisation (Schulman et al., 2017), or deep mutual 
information maximisation (Hjelm et al., 2019). That being said, we believe 
that the principles we will focus on are of signif i cant importance in all of 
these areas. 
Further, while we have attempted to cast a reasonably wide net in order to 
illustrate the power of our geometric blueprint, our work does not attempt 
to accurately summarise the entire existing wealth of research on Geometric 
Deep Learning. Rather, we study several well-known architectures in-depth 
in order to demonstrate the principles and ground them in existing research, 
with the hope that we have left suf i cient references for the reader to mean- 
ingfully apply these principles to any future geometric deep architecture 
they encounter or devise.

The introduction of the "Geometric Deep Learning" paper sets the stage for what the text aims to cover and its relevance in the field of deep learning. Here's a simplified summary:
Deep Learning Revolution
: The last decade has seen huge advancements in data science and machine learning, especially with deep learning. This has made it possible to solve complex problems in areas like computer vision, playing strategic games like Go, and understanding protein folding.
Fundamental Principles of Deep Learning
: Deep learning's success is largely due to two key ideas:
Representation Learning
: This involves creating and using features (often in a hierarchical structure) that capture the essential aspects of each task.
Learning with Local Gradient Descent
: This is often done using a method called backpropagation, which is how neural networks learn and improve.
Overcoming High-Dimensional Challenges
: While dealing with high-dimensional data (like images or complex systems) can be difficult, most real-world tasks are not random but have underlying patterns or regularities. These patterns are often linked to the lower-dimensional structure of the physical world.
Geometric Principles in Deep Learning
: The authors want to reveal these regularities using geometric principles. They note that exploiting known symmetries (like how objects behave under rotation or movement) can help manage the complexity of high-dimensional data.
Examples of Geometric Regularity
: The paper will explore various models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Transformers, and show how they are connected by geometric principles.
Scope and Focus
: The authors clarify that their focus is on learning architectures and the symmetries in data. They won't delve deeply into other aspects of neural network applications like self-supervised learning or generative modeling, nor will they focus on optimization techniques like Adam or dropout.
Significance and Application
: The principles discussed are believed to be important across various deep learning areas, even if those specific areas aren't the main focus of this work.
Purpose and Limitation
: The goal is to provide a broad view of the power of geometric principles in deep learning, but not to cover all research in this area. The authors aim to demonstrate these principles through well-known architectures and hope to provide enough references for readers to apply these principles in future work.

2.1Inductive Bias via Function Regularity 
Modern machine learning operates with large, high-quality datasets, which, 
together with appropriate computational resources, motivate the design of 
rich function classesFwith the capacity to interpolate such large data. This 
mindset plays well with neural networks, since even the simplest choices of 
architecture yields a dense class of functions. 
A set A ��� X is said to be 
dense in X if its closure 
A ��� { lim 
i������ 
ai: ai��� A} = X. 
This implies that any point in 
X is arbitrarily close to a 
point in A. A typical 
Universal Approximation 
result shows that the class of 
functions represented e.g. by 
a two-layer perceptron, 
f(x) = c>sign(Ax + b) is 
dense in the space of 
continuous functions on Rd. 
The capacity to approximate 
almost arbitrary functions is the subject of various Universal Approximation 
Theorems; several such results were proved and popularised in the 1990s by 
applied mathematicians and computer scientists (see e.g. Cybenko (1989); 
Hornik (1991); Barron (1993); Leshno et al. (1993); Maiorov (1999); Pinkus 
(1999)). 
Universal Approximation, however, does not imply an absence of inductive

makingFa Banach space and allowing to leverage a plethora 
of theoretical results in functional analysis. In low dimensions, splines 
are a workhorse for function approximation. They can be formulated as

Universal Approximation Theorem
: This theorem states that certain neural networks (like a two-layer perceptron) can approximate any continuous function on
R
d
\mathbb{R}^d
R
d
with arbitrary accuracy. This concept was popularized in the 1990s by various mathematicians and computer scientists.
Inductive Bias Despite Universal Approximation
:
Inductive Bias
: Even though neural networks can approximate a wide range of functions, they still have an inductive bias. This refers to the tendency of a model to prefer certain types of solutions.
Complexity Measure
: You can define a complexity measure for functions in your model (like a neural network). The goal then becomes finding the simplest function that fits the data well.
Function Regularity and Norms
:
Norms and Banach Spaces
: A norm can be thought of as a way to measure the "length" or "size" of a function. Using norms, the space of functions (like neural networks) can be treated as a Banach space, which is a type of mathematical space that is complete and equipped with a norm.
Splines in Low Dimensions
: In simpler settings, like low-dimensional spaces, splines (a type of function) are often used for approximation. They are chosen based on their smoothness, which can be quantified using norms.
Example - Multilayer Perceptrons
:
Universal Approximators
: Multilayer perceptrons, a basic type of feedforward neural network, are universal approximators. Even with just one hidden layer, they can represent a combination of step functions, allowing them to approximate any continuous function with arbitrary precision.
In summary, this section emphasizes that while neural networks have the capacity to approximate a wide variety of functions, the choice of the simplest and most regular function that fits the data (in terms of inductive bias) is crucial. This balance between flexibility and simplicity is key in designing effective machine learning models.

In the case of neural networks, the complexity measureccan be expressed 
in terms of the network weights, i.e.c(f��) = c(��). TheL2-norm of the net- 
work weights, known as weight decay, or the so-called path-norm (Neyshabur 
et al., 2015) are popular choices in deep learning literature. From a Bayesian 
perspective, such complexity measures can also be interpreted as the neg- 
ative log of the prior for the function of interest. More generally, this com- 
plexity can be enforced explicitly by incorporating it into the empirical loss 
(resulting in the so-called Structural Risk Minimisation), or implicitly, as 
a result of a certain optimisation scheme. For example, it is well-known 
that gradient-descent on an under-determined least-squares objective will 
choose interpolating solutions with minimalL2norm. The extension of such 
implicit regularisation results to modern neural networks is the subject of 
current studies (see e.g. Blanc et al. (2020); Shamir and Vardi (2020); Razin 
and Cohen (2020); Gunasekar et al. (2017)). All in all, a natural question 
arises: how to def i ne ef f ective priors that capture the expected regularities 
and complexities of real-world prediction tasks?

This section discusses how the complexity of neural networks can be measured and managed, emphasizing the importance of choosing effective complexity measures to capture the regularities in real-world data. Here's a simplified explanation:

Popular Complexity Measures
:
L2-Norm (Weight Decay)
: One common complexity measure is the L2-norm of the network weights. This is often referred to as "weight decay" in deep learning.
Path-Norm
: Another measure is the path-norm, which has also been widely used and studied.
Bayesian Interpretation
:
Prior Probability
: From a Bayesian perspective, these complexity measures can be seen as the negative log of the prior probability of the function. In simple terms, it reflects the inherent assumptions or biases about the functions before observing the data.
Incorporating Complexity into Learning
:
Explicit Incorporation
: Complexity can be explicitly included in the empirical loss function. This approach leads to Structural Risk Minimization, where the goal is to minimize a combination of the empirical loss and the complexity.
Implicit Incorporation
: Sometimes, complexity is implicitly included through the optimization process. For example, using gradient descent on an under-determined least-squares objective tends to result in solutions with minimal L2 norm.
Current Research and Questions
:
Extension to Modern Neural Networks
: The application and understanding of implicit regularization in contemporary neural networks are active areas of research.
Defining Effective Priors
: A key question in this field is how to define effective priors (or inherent assumptions) that accurately capture the complexities and regularities of real-world prediction tasks.
In essence, this section highlights the significance of choosing and managing the complexity of neural network models. This choice impacts how well these models can learn from data and generalize to new, unseen data, which is a fundamental goal in machine learning.

Early Use of Symmetry in Machine LearningIn machine learning and its 
applications to pattern recognition and computer vision, the importance of 
symmetry has long been recognised. Early work on designing equivariant 
featuredetectorsforpatternrecognitionwasdonebyAmari(1978), 
Shun���ichi Amari is credited 
as the creator of the i eld of 
information geometry that 
applies Riemannian 
geometry models to 
probability. The main object 
studied by information 
geometry is a statistical 
manifold, where each point 
corresponds to a probability 
distribution. 
Kanatani 
(2012), and Lenz (1990). In the neural networks literature, the famous 
Group Invariance Theorem for Perceptrons by Minsky and Papert (2017) 
putsfundamentallimitationsonthecapabilitiesof(single-layer)perceptrons 
to learn invariants. This was one of the primary motivations for studying 
multi-layer architectures (Sejnowski et al., 1986; Shawe-Taylor, 1989, 1993), 
which ultimately led to deep learning. 
In the neural network community, Neocognitron (Fukushima and Miyake, 
1982) is credited as the i rst implementation of shift invariance in a neural 
network for ���pattern recognition unaf f ected by shift in position���. His solu- 
tion came in the form of hierarchical neural network with local connectivity, 
drawing inspiration from the receptive i elds discovered in the visual cortex 
by the neuroscientists David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel two decades earlier 
(Hubel and Wiesel, 1959). 
This classical work was 
recognised by the Nobel 
Prize in Medicine in 1981, 
which Hubel and Wiesel 
shared with Roger Sperry. 
These ideas culminated in Convolutional Neural 
Networks in the seminal work of Yann LeCun and co-authors (LeCun et al., 
1998). The i rst work to take a representation-theoretical view on invariant 
and equivariant neural networks was performed by Wood and Shawe-Taylor 
(1996), unfortunately rarely cited. More recent incarnations of these ideas 
include the works of Makadia et al. (2007); Esteves et al. (2020) and one of 
the authors of this text (Cohen and Welling, 2016). 
GraphNeuralNetworksItisdif i culttopinpointexactlywhentheconcept 
of Graph Neural Networks began to emerge���partly due to the fact that most 
of the early work did not place graphs as a i rst-class citizen, partly since 
GNNs became practical only in the late 2010s, and partly because this i eld 
emerged from the conf l uence of several research areas. That being said, early 
forms of graph neural networks can be traced back at least to the 1990s, with 
examples including Alessandro Sperduti���s Labeling RAAM (Sperduti, 1994), 
the ���backpropagation through structure��� of Goller and Kuchler (1996), and 
adaptive processing of data structures (Sperduti and Starita, 1997; Frasconi 
et al., 1998). While these works were primarily concerned with operating 
over ���structures��� (often trees or directed acyclic graphs), many of the in- 
variances preserved in their architectures are reminiscent of the GNNs more 
commonly in use today. 
7. HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE117 
The i rst proper treatment of the processing of generic graph structures (and 
the coining of the term ���graph neural network���) happened after the turn of 
the 21st century. Concurrently, Alessio Micheli 
had proposed the neural 
network for graphs (NN4G) 
model, which focused on a 
feedforward rather than 
recurrent paradigm (Micheli, 
2009). 
Within the Artif i cial Intelligence lab at the Universit�� degli 
Studi di Siena (Italy), papers led by Marco Gori and Franco Scarselli have 
proposed the i rst ���GNN��� (Gori et al., 2005; Scarselli et al., 2008). They relied 
on recurrent mechanisms, required the neural network parameters to specify 
contraction mappings, and thus computing node representations by searching 
foraf i xedpoint���thisinitselfnecessitatedaspecialformofbackpropagation 
(Almeida, 1990; Pineda, 1988) and did not depend on node features at all. 
All of the above issues were rectif i ed by the Gated GNN (GGNN) model of 
Li et al. (2015). GGNNs brought many benef i ts of modern RNNs, such as 
gating mechanisms (Cho et al., 2014) and backpropagation through time, to 
the GNN model, and remain popular today.

Computational chemistryIt is also very important to note an independent and concurrent line of development for GNNs: one that was entirely driven 
bytheneedsofcomputationalchemistry, wheremoleculesaremostnaturally 
expressed as graphs of atoms (nodes) connected by chemical bonds (edges). 
This invited computational techniques for molecular property prediction 
that operate directly over such a graph structure, which had become present 
in machine learning in the 1990s: this includes the ChemNet model of Kireev 
(1995) and the work of Baskin et al. (1997). Strikingly, the ���molecular graph 
networks��� of Merkwirth and Lengauer (2005) explicitly proposed many 
of the elements commonly found in contemporary GNNs���such as edge 
type-conditioned weights or global pooling���as early as 2005. The chemical motivation continued to drive GNN development into the 2010s, with two signif i cant GNN advancements centered around improving molecular 
i ngerprinting (Duvenaud et al., 2015) and predicting quantum-chemical 
properties (Gilmer et al., 2017) from small molecules. At the time of writing 
this text, molecular property prediction is one of the most successful applica- 
tions of GNNs, with impactful results in virtual screening of new antibiotic 
drugs (Stokes et al., 2020). 
Node embeddingsSome of the earliest success stories of deep learning 
on graphs involve learning representations of nodes in an unsupervised 
fashion, based on the graph structure. Given their structural inspiration, 
this direction also provides one of the most direct links between graph 
representation learning and network science communities. The key early

approaches in this space relied on random walk-based embeddings: learning

occur in a short random walk. Representative methods in this space include 
DeepWalk (Perozzi et al., 2014), node2vec (Grover and Leskovec, 2016) and 
LINE (Tang et al., 2015), which are all purely self-supervised. Planetoid 
(Yang et al., 2016) was the i rst in this space to incorporate supervision label 
information, when it is available. 
Unifying random walk objectives with GNN encoders 
Recently, a theoretical 
framework was developed by 
Srinivasan and Ribeiro (2019) 
in which the equivalence of 
structural and positional 
representations was 
demonstrated. Additionally,

demonstrated that all

eral occasions, with representative approaches including Variational Graph 
Autoencoder (VGAE, Kipf and Welling (2016b)), embedding propagation 
(Garc��a-Dur��nandNiepert,2017),andunsupervisedvariantsofGraphSAGE 
(Hamilton et al., 2017). However, this was met with mixed results, and it was 
shortly discovered that pushing neighbouring node representations together 
is already a key part of GNNs��� inductive bias. Indeed, it was shown that 
an untrained GNN was already showing performance that is competitive 
with DeepWalk, in settings where node features are available (Veli��kovi�� 
et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019). This launched a direction that moves away 
from combining random walk objectives with GNNs and shifting towards 
contrastive approaches inspired by mutual information maximisation and 
aligning to successful methods in the image domain. Prominent examples of this direction include Deep Graph Informax (DGI, Veli��kovi�� et al. (2019)), 
GRACE (Zhu et al., 2020), BERT-like objectives (Hu et al., 2020) and BGRL (Thakoor et al., 2021).

This section discusses two important aspects of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): their development in computational chemistry and the concept of node embeddings. Here's a summary:
GNNs in Computational Chemistry
:
Molecules as Graphs
: In computational chemistry, molecules are naturally represented as graphs with atoms as nodes and chemical bonds as edges. This representation necessitated the development of machine learning models that could work directly with graph structures.
Early Developments
: Models like ChemNet (Kireev, 1995) and the work of Baskin et al. (1997) in the 1990s were early examples of applying machine learning to molecular graphs.
Advancements
: The "molecular graph networks" by Merkwirth and Lengauer (2005) prefigured many elements of contemporary GNNs. Further advancements were made in the 2010s with a focus on molecular fingerprinting and predicting quantum-chemical properties.
Impactful Applications
: By the time the text was written, GNNs had shown significant success in molecular property prediction, including in areas like virtual screening for new drugs.
Node Embeddings
:
Early Success in Deep Learning on Graphs
: One of the earliest successes of deep learning in graphs involved learning node representations in an unsupervised manner, based on the graph's structure.
Random Walk-Based Embeddings
: Techniques like DeepWalk, node2vec, and LINE used random walks to learn node representations, clustering nodes that co-occur in these walks. Planetoid was the first to incorporate label information in this approach.
Unifying Random Walks with GNN Encoders
: Attempts to combine random walk-based objectives with GNNs led to mixed results. It was found that GNNs intrinsically push neighboring node representations together, a discovery that shifted focus away from random walk objectives towards contrastive approaches.
New Directions
: This shift led to the development of methods like Deep Graph Informax (DGI), GRACE, and BERT-like objectives, which were inspired by mutual information maximization and techniques successful in image domain analysis.
Overall, the section highlights the diverse origins and developments of GNNs, showing how they have evolved from specific applications in computational chemistry to more general methods in machine learning, including the innovative approach of node embeddings.

Probabilistic graphical modelsGraph neural networks have also, con- 
currently, resurged through embedding the computations of probabilistic 
graphical models (PGMs, Wainwright and Jordan (2008)). PGMs are a pow- 
erful tool for processing graphical data, and their utility arises from their 
probabilistic perspective on the graph���s edges: namely, the nodes are treated 
as random variables, while the graph structure encodes conditional indepen- 
dence assumptions, allowing for signif i cantly simplifying the calculation and 
sampling from the joint distribution. Indeed, many algorithms for (exactly 
or approximately) supporting learning and inference on PGMs rely on forms 
of passing messages over their edges (Pearl, 2014), with examples including 
variational mean-f i eld inference and loopy belief propagation (Yedidia et al., 
2001; Murphy et al., 2013). 
This connection between PGMs and message passing was subsequently 
7. HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE119 
developed into GNN architectures, with early theoretical links established 
by the authors of structure2vec (Dai et al., 2016). Namely, by posing a 
graph representation learning setting as a Markov random i eld (of nodes 
corresponding to input features and latent representations), the authors 
directly align the computation of both mean-f i eld inference and loopy belief 
propagation to a model not unlike the GNNs commonly in use today. 
The key ���trick��� which allowed for relating the latent representations of a 
GNN to probability distributions maintained by a PGM was the usage of 
Hilbert-space embeddings of distributions (Smola et al., 2007). Given��, an ap- 
propriately chosen embedding function for featuresx, it is possible to embed 
their probability distributionp(x)as the expected embeddingEx���p(x)��(x). 
Such a correspondence allows us to perform GNN-like computations, know- 
ing that the representations computed by the GNN will always correspond 
to an embedding of some probability distribution over the node features. 
The structure2vec model itself is, ultimately, a GNN architecture which 
easily sits within our framework, but its setup has inspired a series of GNN 
architectures which more directly incorporate computations found in PGMs. 
Emerging examples have successfully combined GNNs with conditional 
random i elds (Gao et al., 2019; Spalevi�� et al., 2020), relational Markov 
networks (Qu et al., 2019) and Markov logic networks (Zhang et al., 2020).

This section discusses how Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been influenced by and integrated with probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). Here's a summary:
Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs)
:
Powerful Tools for Graphical Data
: PGMs are effective in processing data represented in graph form. They treat nodes as random variables and use the graph structure to encode assumptions about conditional independence among these variables.
Simplification of Complex Calculations
: This approach simplifies the calculation and sampling from the joint distribution of variables.
Message Passing Algorithms

Key Concept - Hilbert-Space Embeddings
:
Embedding Probability Distributions
: A crucial idea was using Hilbert-space embeddings of distributions. This involves embedding the probability distribution of node features into a space where each point represents a probability distribution.
GNN Computations and Probability Distributions

The Weisfeiler-Lehman formalismThe resurgence of graph neural net- 
works was followed closely by a drive to understand their fundamental 
limitations, especially in terms of expressive power. While it was becoming 
evident that GNNs are a strong modelling tool of graph-structured data, 
it was also clear that they wouldn���t be able to solve any task specif i ed on a 
graph perfectly. Due to their permutation 
invariance, GNNs will attach 
identical representations to 
two isomorphic graphs, so 
this case is trivially solved. 
A canonical illustrative example of this is deciding graph 
isomorphism: is our GNN able to attach dif f erent representations to two given 
non-isomorphic graphs? This is a useful framework for two reasons. If the 
GNN is unable to do this, then it will be hopeless on any task requiring 
the discrimination of these two graphs. Further, it is currently not known if 
deciding graph isomorphism is in P The best currently known 
algorithm for deciding graph 
isomorphism is due to Babai 
and Luks (1983), though a 
recent (not fully reviewed) 
proposal by Babai (2016) 
implies a quasi-polynomial 
time solution.

computations typically reside. 
ThekeyframeworkwhichbindsGNNstographisomorphismistheWeisfeiler- 
Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test (Weisfeiler and Leman, 1968). This 
test generates a graph representation by iteratively passing node features 
120BRONSTEIN, BRUNA, COHEN & VELI��KOVI�� 
along the edges of the graph, then randomly hashing their sums across neigh- 
bourhoods. Connections to randomly-initialised convolutional GNNs are 
apparent, and have been observed early on: for example, within the GCN 
model of Kipf and Welling (2016a). Aside from this connection, the WL 
iteration was previously introduced in the domain of graph kernels by Sher- 
vashidze et al. (2011), and it still presents a strong baseline for unsupervised 
learning of whole-graph representations. 
While 
One simple example: the WL 
test cannot distinguish a 
6-cycle from two triangles. 
the WL test is conceptually simple, and there are many simple exam- 
ples of non-isomorphic graphs it cannot distinguish, its expressive power 
is ultimately strongly tied to GNNs. Analyses by Morris et al. (2019) and 
Xu et al. (2018) have both reached a striking conclusion: any GNN conform- 
ing to one of the three l avours we outlined in Section 5.3 cannot be more 
powerful than the WL test! 
In order to exactly reach this level of representational power, certain con- 
straints must exist on the GNN update rule. Xu et al. (2018) have shown that, 
in the discrete-feature domain, the aggregation function the GNN uses must 
beinjective, withsummationbeingakeyrepresentative 
Popular aggregators such as 
maximisation and averaging 
fall short in this regard, 
because they would not be 
able to distinguish e.g. the 
neighbour multisets { {a,b} } 
and { {a,a,b,b} }. 
. Basedontheoutcome 
of their analysis, Xu et al. (2018) propose the Graph Isomorphism Network 
(GIN), which is a simple but powerful example of a maximally-expressive 
GNN under this framework. It is also expressible under the convolutional 
GNN l avour we propose. 
Lastly, it is worth noting that these i ndings do not generalise to continu- 
ous node feature spaces. In fact, using the Borsuk-Ulam theorem (Borsuk, 
1933), Corso et al. (2020) have demonstrated that, assuming real-valued 
node features, obtaining injective aggregation functions requires multiple 
aggregators (specif i cally, equal to the degree of the receiver node) 
One example of such 
aggregators are the moments 
of the multiset of neighbours. 
. Their findings have driven the Principal Neighbourhood Aggregation (PNA) architecture, which proposes a multiple-aggregator GNN that is empirically 
powerful and stable.

This section discusses the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) formalism in relation to the expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Here's a summary:
Expressive Power of GNNs
:
Fundamental Limitations
: There's been an interest in understanding the fundamental limitations of GNNs, especially in terms of how expressive they are in modeling graph-structured data.
Graph Isomorphism Challenge
: A key challenge for GNNs is deciding graph isomorphism ��� whether they can differentiate between non-isomorphic (structurally different) graphs.
Weisfeiler-Lehman Graph Isomorphism Test
:
Iterative Feature Passing
: The WL test involves iteratively passing node features along the edges and aggregating them, similar to operations in some GNNs.
Conceptual Simplicity
: While conceptually simple, the WL test has limitations and can't distinguish some non-isomorphic graphs.
Relation to GNNs
: Studies have found that the expressive power of GNNs is closely tied to the WL test. GNNs conforming to specific structures cannot be more powerful than the WL test in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs.
Injective Aggregation Functions
:
Necessity for Maximally Expressive GNNs
: For a GNN to match the representational power of the WL test, its aggregation function needs to be injective (uniquely mapping inputs to outputs). Summation is an example of such an injective function.
Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)
: Xu et al. proposed the GIN as a maximally-expressive GNN under this framework, using an injective aggregation function.
Continuous Node Feature Spaces
:
Challenges in Injectivity
: The findings related to the WL test and GNNs do not directly apply to continuous node feature spaces, where achieving injective aggregation is more complex.
Principal Neighbourhood Aggregation (PNA)
: This approach proposes a multiple-aggregator GNN that has shown to be empirically powerful and stable in continuous feature spaces.
In summary, the Weisfeiler-Lehman formalism provides a framework for understanding the limitations and capabilities of GNNs in distinguishing graph structures. While GNNs are powerful, their ability to differentiate non-isomorphic graphs is inherently linked to the properties of their aggregation functions and the nature of the node features they process.

Higher-order methodsThe i ndings of the previous paragraphs do not 
contradict the practical utility of GNNs. Indeed, in many real-world applica- 
tions the input features are suf i ciently rich to support useful discriminative 
computations over the graph structure, despite of the above limitations 
Which, in contrast, almost 
always consider featureless or 
categorically-featured graphs. 
. 
However, one key corollary is that GNNs are relatively quite weak at de- 
tecting some rudimentary structures within a graph. Guided by the specif i c 
7. HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE121 
limitations or failure cases of the WL test, several works have provided 
stronger variants of GNNs that are provably more powerful than the WL test, 
and hence likely to be useful on tasks that require such structural detection One prominent example is 
computational chemistry, 
wherein a molecule���s 
chemical function can be 
strongly inf l uenced by the 
presence of aromatic rings in 
its molecular graph. 
. 
Perhaps the most direct place to hunt for more expressive GNNs is the WL 
test itself. Indeed, the strength of the original WL test can be enhanced by 
considering a hierarchy of WL tests, such thatk-WL tests attach represen- 
tations tok-tuples of nodes (Morris et al., 2017). Thek-WL test has been 
directly translated into a higher-orderk-GNN architecture by Morris et al. 
(2019), There have been ef f orts, such 
as the ��-k-LGNN (Morris 
et al., 2020), to sparsify the 
computation of the k-GNN. 
which is provably more powerful than the GNN l avours we con- 
sidered before. However, its requirement to maintain tuple representations 
implies that, in practice, it is hard to scale beyond k = 3. 
Concurrently, Maron et al. (2018, 2019) have studied the characterisation of 
invariant and equivariant graph networks overk-tuples of nodes. Besides 
demonstrating the surprising result of any invariant or equivariant graph 
network being expressible as a linear combination of a i nite number of 
generators���the amount of which only depends onk���the authors showed 
that the expressive power of such layers is equivalent to the k-WL test, and 
proposed an empirically scalable variant which is provably 3-WL powerful. 
Besides generalising the domain over which representations are computed, 
signif i cant ef f ort had also went into analysing specif i c failure cases of 1-WL 
and augmenting GNN inputs to help them distinguish such cases. One 
common example is attaching identifying features to the nodes, which can 
help detecting structure For example, if a node sees its 
own identif i erkhops away, it 
is a direct indicator that it is 
within a k-cycle. 
. Proposals to do this include one-hot representations 
(Murphy et al., 2019), as well as purely random features (Sato et al., 2020). 
More broadly, there have been many ef f orts to incorporate structural informa-

This section discusses higher-order methods in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their significance in addressing some of the limitations of standard GNNs. Here's a summary:
Practical Utility of GNNs
:
Rich Input Features
: Despite the limitations mentioned earlier, GNNs are still very useful in real-world applications, particularly when input features are rich enough to support discriminative computations.
Weakness in Detecting Structures
:
Detecting Simple Structures
: GNNs, as they are, might be weak at detecting simple but crucial structures in a graph. This can be a limitation in fields like computational chemistry, where molecular functions are influenced by specific structures like aromatic rings.
Enhancing WL Test and GNNs
:
k-WL Tests
: The original Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test can be strengthened by considering a hierarchy of tests (k-WL tests) that attach representations to k-tuples of nodes. These have been translated into more powerful k-GNN architectures.
Scaling Challenges
: While more powerful, these k-GNNs face practical scaling issues, particularly beyond k = 3.
Invariant and Equivariant Graph Networks
:
Maron et al.'s Work
: They studied invariant and equivariant graph networks over k-tuples of nodes and proposed scalable variants of these networks with the expressive power equivalent to the 3-WL test.
Augmenting GNN Inputs
:
Identifying Features
: Attaching identifying features to nodes can help GNNs detect specific structures. Proposals include using one-hot representations and random features.
Incorporating Structural Information
: Efforts have been made to incorporate structural information into the message-passing process of GNNs. This includes modulating the message function or the graph structure itself.
Interesting Approaches in Message Passing
:
Anchor Node Sets, Laplacian Eigenvectors
: Some methods involve sampling anchor node sets or aggregating based on Laplacian eigenvectors.
Topological Data Analysis
: Others use topological data analysis for positional embeddings or to drive the message-passing process.
In summary, while standard GNNs are powerful, there's ongoing research to enhance their ability to detect and represent complex structures in graphs. This includes developing higher-order methods and augmenting GNNs with additional features or structural information to overcome their inherent limitations.

Signal processing and Harmonic analysisSince the early successes of 
Convolutional Neural Networks, researchers have resorted to tools from har- 
monic analysis, image processing, and computational neuroscience trying to

provide a theoretical framework that explains their ef i ciency.M-theory is a 
framework inspired by the visual cortex, pioneered by Tomaso Poggio and 
collaborators (Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999; Serre et al., 2007), based on the 
notion of templates that can be manipulated under certain symmetry groups. 
Another notable model arising from computational neuroscience were steer- 
able pyramids, a form of multiscale wavelet decompositions with favorable 
properties against certain input transformations, developed by Simoncelli 
and Freeman (1995). They were a central element in early generative mod- 
els for textures (Portilla and Simoncelli, 2000), which were subsequently 
improved by replacing steerable wavelet features with deep CNN features 
Gatys et al. (2015). Finally, Scattering transforms, introduced by St��phane 
Mallat (2012) and developed by Bruna and Mallat (2013), provided a frame- 
work to understand CNNs by replacing trainable i lters with multiscale 
wavelet decompositions, also showcasing the deformation stability and the 
role of depth in the architecture. 
SignalProcessingonGraphandMeshesAnotherimportantclassofgraph 
neural networks, often referred to as spectral, has emerged from the work of 
one of the authors of this text (Bruna et al., 2013), using the notion of the 
Graph Fourier transform. The roots of this construction are in the signal pro- 
cessing and computational harmonic analysis communities, where dealing 
with non-Euclidean signals has become prominent in the late 2000s and early 
2010s. Inf l uential papers from the groups of Pierre Vandergheynst (Shuman 
et al., 2013) and Jos�� Moura (Sandryhaila and Moura, 2013) popularised 
the notion of ���Graph Signal Processing��� (GSP) and the generalisation of 
Fourier transforms based on the eigenvectors of graph adjacency and Lapla- 
cian matrices. The graph convolutional neural networks relying on spectral 
i lters by Def f errard et al. (2016) and Kipf and Welling (2016a) are among 
the most cited in the i eld and can likely be credited) as ones reigniting the 
interest in machine learning on graphs in recent years. 
It is worth noting that, in the i eld of computer graphics and geometry pro- 
cessing, non-Euclidean harmonic analysis predates Graph Signal Processing 
by at least a decade. We can trace spectral i lters on manifolds and meshes 
to the works of Taubin et al. (1996). These methods became mainstream in 
the 2000s following the inf l uential papers of Karni and Gotsman (2000) on 
spectral geometry compression and of L��vy (2006) on using the Laplacian 
eigenvectors as a non-Euclidean Fourier basis. Spectral methods have been 
used for a range of applications,

AlgorithmicreasoningFor most of the discussion we posed in this section, 
we have given examples of spatially induced geometries, which in turn shape 
the underlying domain, and its invariances and symmetries. However, plen- 
tiful examples of invariances and symmetries also arise in a computational 
setting. One critical dif f erence to many common settings of Geometric Deep 
Learning is that links no longer need to encode for any kind of similarity, 
proximity, or types of relations���they merely specify the ���recipe��� for the 
dataf l ow between data points they connect. 
Instead, thecomputationsoftheneuralnetworkmimicthereasoningprocess 
of an algorithm (Cormen et al., 2009), with additional invariances induced 
by the algorithm���s control l ow and intermediate results 
For example, one invariant of 
the Bellman-Ford pathf i nding 
algorithm (Bellman, 1958) is 
that, after k steps, it will 
always compute the shortest 
paths to the source node that 
use no more than k edges. 
. In the space of 
algorithms the assumed input invariants are often referred to as preconditions, 
while the invariants preserved by the algorithm are known as postconditions. 
Eponymously, the research direction of algorithmic reasoning (Cappart et al., 
2021, Section 3.3.) seeks to produce neural network architectures that ap-

propriately preserve algorithmic invariants. The area has investigated the 
construction of general-purpose neural computers, e.g., the neural Turing 
machine (Graves et al., 2014) and the dif f erentiable neural computer (Graves 
et al., 2016). While such architectures have all the hallmarks of general 
computation, they introduced several components at once, making them 
often challenging to optimise, and in practice, they are almost always outper- 
formed by simple relational reasoners, such as the ones proposed by Santoro 
et al. (2017, 2018). 
As modelling complex postconditions is challenging, plentiful work on in- 
ductive biases for learning to execute (Zaremba and Sutskever, 2014) has 
focused on primitive algorithms (e.g. simple arithmetic). Prominent ex- 
amples in this space include the neural GPU (Kaiser and Sutskever, 2015), 
neural RAM (Kurach et al., 2015), neural programmer-interpreters (Reed and 
De Freitas, 2015), neural arithmetic-logic units (Trask et al., 2018; Madsen and 
Johansen, 2020) and neural execution engines (Yan et al., 2020).

This section introduces the concept of algorithmic reasoning in the context of Geometric Deep Learning. Here's a summary:
Algorithmic Reasoning in Neural Networks
:
Beyond Spatial Geometries
: Unlike typical examples in Geometric Deep Learning, algorithmic reasoning deals with invariances and symmetries in a computational setting. The connections in these networks represent data flow in algorithmic processes rather than spatial or relational similarities.
Mimicking Algorithms
: The computations in these neural networks aim to replicate the reasoning process of algorithms, preserving certain invariances dictated by the algorithm���s control flow and intermediate results.
Invariants in Algorithms
:
Preconditions and Postconditions
: In the context of algorithms, the assumed input invariants (conditions that are always true at the start) are known as preconditions, while invariants preserved by the algorithm are called postconditions.
Preserving Algorithmic Invariants
: The field of algorithmic reasoning focuses on designing neural networks that preserve these algorithmic invariants.
General-Purpose Neural Computers
:
Complex Architectures
: Examples include the neural Turing machine and the differentiable neural computer. These architectures embody general computation but are often complex and challenging to optimize.
Simple Relational Reasoners
: In practice, simpler models like those proposed by Santoro et al. have shown to be more effective.
Focus on Primitive Algorithms
:
Modelling Complex Postconditions
: As it's challenging to model complex postconditions, much work has focused on learning to execute simple algorithms, such as basic arithmetic.
Examples of Neural Models
: This includes models like the neural GPU, neural RAM, neural programmer-interpreters, neural arithmetic-logic units, and neural execution engines.
In summary, algorithmic reasoning in neural networks represents a shift from spatially induced geometries to computational settings, where the focus is on mimicking algorithmic processes and preserving their inherent invariances. This area explores both complex general-purpose architectures and simpler models focused on specific algorithmic tasks.

Emulating combinatorial algorithms of superlinear complexity was made 
possible with the rapid development of GNN architectures. The algorithmic 
alignment framework pioneered by Xu et al. (2019) demonstrated, theoreti- 
cally, that GNNs align with dynamic programming (Bellman, 1966), which is 
a language in which most algorithms can be expressed. It was concurrently 
empirically shown, by one of the authors of this text, that it is possible to 
design and train GNNs that align with algorithmic invariants in practice 
(Veli��kovi�� et al., 2019). Onwards, alignment was achieved with iterative algo- 
rithms (Tang et al., 2020), linearithmic algorithms (Freivalds et al., 2019), data 
structures (Veli��kovi�� et al., 2020) and persistent memory (Strathmann et al., 
2021). Such models have also seen practical use in implicit planners (Deac 
et al., 2020), breaking into the space of reinforcement learning algorithms. 
Concurrently, signif i cant progress has been made on using GNNs for physics 
simulations (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al., 2020; Pfaf f et al., 2020). This direction 
yielded much of the same recommendations for the design of generalising 
GNNs. Such a correspondence is to be expected: given that algorithms 
can be phrased as discrete-time simulations, and simulations are typically 
implemented as step-wise algorithms, both directions will need to preserve 
similar kinds of invariants. 
Tightly bound with the study of algorithmic reasoning are measures of 
extrapolation. This is a notorious pain-point for neural networks, given that 
most of their success stories are obtained when generalising in-distribution; 
126BRONSTEIN, BRUNA, COHEN & VELI��KOVI�� 
i.e. when the patterns found in the training data properly anticipate the ones 
found in the test data. However, algorithmic invariants must be preserved 
irrespective of, e.g., the size or generative distribution of the input, meaning 
that the training set will likely not cover any possible scenario encountered 
in practice. Xu et al. (2020b) have proposed a geometric argument for what is required of an extrapolating GNN backed by rectif i er activations: its 
components and featurisation would need to be designed so as to make its constituent modules (e.g. message function) learn only linear target functions. Bevilacqua et al. (2021) propose observing extrapolation under the lens of causal reasoning, yielding environment-invariant representations of 
graphs.

Geometric Deep LearningOur i nal historical remarks regard the very

by one of the authors of this text in his ERC grant in 2015 and popularised 
in the eponymous IEEE Signal Processing Magazine paper (Bronstein et al., 
2017). This paper proclaimed, albeit ���with some caution���, the signs of ���a 
new i eld being born.��� Given the recent popularity of graph neural networks, 
the increasing use of ideas of invariance and equivariance in a broad range 
of machine learning applications, and the very fact of us writing this text, it 
is probably right to consider this prophecy at least partially fulf i lled. The name ���4G: Grids, Graphs, Groups, and Gauges��� was coined by Max Welling 
for the ELLIS Program on Geometric Deep Learning, co-directed by two 
authors of the text. Admittedly, the last ���G��� is somewhat of a stretch, since the underlying structures are manifolds and bundles rather than gauges. For this text, we added another ���G���, Geodesics, in reference to metric invariants and intrinsic symmetries of manifolds.

5.8Long Short-Term Memory networks 
A key invention that signif i cantly reduced the ef f ects of vanishing gradients 
in RNNs is that of gating mechanisms, which allow the network to selec- 
tively overwrite information in a data-driven way. Prominent examples of 
these gated RNNs include the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM; Hochreiter 
and Schmidhuber (1997)) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU; Cho et al. 
(2014)). Here we will primarily discuss the LSTM���specif i cally, the variant 
presented by Graves (2013)���in order to illustrate the operations of such 
models. Concepts from LSTMs easily carry over to other gated RNNs. 
Throughout this section, it will likely be useful to refer to Figure 20, which 
illustrates all of the LSTM operations that we will discuss in text. 
The LSTM augments the recurrent computation by introducing a memory 
cell, which stores cell state vectors,c(t)��� Rm, that are preserved between 
computational steps. The LSTM computes summary vectors,h(t), directly 
based onc(t), andc(t)is, in turn, computed usingz(t),h(t���1)andc(t���1). 
Critically, the cell isnotcompletely overwritten based onz(t)andh(t���1), 
which would expose the network to the same issues as the SimpleRNN. 
Instead, a certain quantity of the previous cell state may be retained���and 
96BRONSTEIN, BRUNA, COHEN & VELI��KOVI�� 
the proportion by which this occurs is explicitly learned from data. 
JustlikeinSimpleRNN,wecomputefeaturesbyusingasinglefully-connected 
neural network layer over the current input step and previous summary: 
Note that we have set the 
activation function to tanh 
here; as LSTMs are designed 
to ameliorate the vanishing 
gradient problem, it is now 
appropriate to use a 
sigmoidal activation. e c(t)= 
tanh(Wcz(t)+ Uch (t���1) + bc)(43) 
But, as mentioned, we do not allow all of this vector to enter the cell���hence 
why we call it the vector of candidate features, and denote it ase c(t). 
Instead, 
the LSTM directly learns gating vectors, which are real-valued vectors in the 
range[0,1], and decide how much of the signal should be allowed to enter, 
exit, and overwrite the memory cell. 
Three such gates are computed, all based onz(t)andh(t���1): the input gatei(t), 
which computes the proportion of the candidate vector allowed to enter the 
cell; the forget gatef(t), which computes the proportion of the previous cell 
state to be retained, and the output gateo(t), which computes the proportion 
of the new cell state to be used for the i nal summary vector. Typically all of 
these gates are also derived using a single fully connected layer, albeit with 
the logistic sigmoid activationlogistic(x) = 
1 
1+exp(���x), in order to guarantee 
that the outputs are in the [0,1] range 
Note that the three gates are 
themselves vectors, i.e. 
i(t),f(t),o(t)��� [0,1]m. This 
allows them to control how 
much each of the m 
dimensions is allowed 
through the gate. 
: 
i(t)= logistic(Wiz(t)+ Uih(t���1)+ bi)(44) 
f(t)= logistic(Wfz(t)+ Ufh(t���1)+ bf)(45) 
o(t)= logistic(Woz(t)+ Uoh(t���1)+ bo)(46) 
Finally, these gates are appropriately applied to decode the new cell state, 
c(t), which is then modulated by the output gate to produce the summary 
vector h(t), as follows: c(t)= i(t)? e c(t)+ 
f(t)? c(t���1)(47) 
h(t)= o(t)? tanh(c(t))(48) 
where?is element-wise vector multiplication. Applied together, Equations 
(43)���(48) completely specify the update rule for the LSTM, which now takes 
into account the cell vector c(t)as well 
This is still compatible with 
the RNN update blueprint 
from Equation (38); simply 
consider the summary vector 
to be the concatenation of h(t) 
and c(t); sometimes denoted 
by h(t)kc(t).

Angular poolingAnother approach, referred to as angular max pooling, 
was used by Masci et al. (2015). In this case, the i lter��(r,��)is anisotropic, 
but its matching with the function is performed over all the possible rotations, 
which are then aggregated:

Conceptually, this can be visualised as correlating geodesic patches with a 
rotating i lter and collecting the strongest responses. 
On meshes, the continuous integrals can be discretised using a construction 
referred to as patch operators (Masci et al., 2015). In a geodesic patch around

lead to features that are invariant to gauge transformations; they transform

of the local coordinate frame). This point of view suggests another approach, 
proposed by Cohen et al. (2019); de Haan et al. (2020) and discussed in 
Section 4.5, where the features computed by the network are associated with 
an arbitrary representation��of the structure groupG(e.g.SO(2)orO(2)

The section you provided discusses advanced techniques in Geometric Deep Learning, particularly focusing on angular pooling and gauge-equivariant filters in the context of processing data on meshes. Here's a simplified explanation:
Angular Max Pooling
:
Anisotropic Filters
: Developed by Masci et al. (2015), this method involves using anisotropic filters that match with a function over all possible rotations.
Aggregation Process
: The strongest responses from correlating geodesic patches with a rotating filter are aggregated.
Discrete Implementation on Meshes
: For meshes, continuous integrals are discretized using patch operators. In a geodesic patch around a node, neighboring nodes are represented in local polar coordinates and weighted by a set of weighting functions, aggregating the results.
Gauge-equivariant Filters
:
Invariance to Gauge Transformations
: Both isotropic filters and angular max pooling yield features invariant to gauge transformations (like rotations of the local coordinate frame).
Approach by Cohen et al. and de Haan et al.
: These researchers proposed using features associated with an arbitrary representation of the structure group (like rotations or rotations plus reflections) in coordinate frames.
Handling Geometric Features
: When dealing with geometric features associated with a non-trivial representation, it's necessary to parallel transport them to the same vector space before applying the filter.
Message Passing Mechanism on Meshes
: On a mesh, features at each node are expressed relative to a choice of gauge and are assumed to transform according to a specific representation. A message passing mechanism is used for processing.
In summary, these techniques represent sophisticated approaches in Geometric Deep Learning for processing data on meshes, utilizing advanced concepts from geometry and group theory to handle rotations and other transformations. These methods are particularly important for tasks involving complex geometric structures, such as in computer graphics or 3D data analysis.

successful instances of this direction: the LieConv of Finzi et al. (2020), and

Computing Geodesics
: Geodesics on meshes are computed using algorithms like Fast Marching, which are adaptations of numerical approximations from physical models.
First Intrinsic CNN-like Architectures
: Geodesic CNNs by Masci et al. were among the first intrinsic CNN-like architectures on meshes.
Isotropic Filters and Gauge Ambiguity
:
Ambiguity in Patch Orientation
: The definition of a geodesic patch has ambiguity in the choice of reference direction and patch orientation, known as the gauge ambiguity.
Isotropic Filters

The Binary Independence Model (BIM)[1][2] in computing and information science is a probabilistic information retrieval technique. The model makes some simple assumptions to make the estimation of document/query similarity probable and feasible.

The Binary Independence Assumption is the that documents are binary vectors. That is, only the presence or absence of terms in documents are recorded. Terms are independently distributed in the set of relevant documents and they are also independently distributed in the set of irrelevant documents. The representation is an ordered set of Boolean variables. That is, the representation of a document or query is a vector with one Boolean element for each term under consideration. More specifically, a document is represented by a vector d = (x1, ..., xm) where xt=1 if term t is present in the document d and xt=0 if it's not. Many documents can have the same vector representation with this simplification. Queries are represented in a similar way. "Independence" signifies that terms in the document are considered independently from each other and no association between terms is modeled. This assumption is very limiting, but it has been shown that it gives good enough results for many situations. This independence is the "naive" assumption of a Naive Bayes classifier, where properties that imply each other are nonetheless treated as independent for the sake of simplicity. This assumption allows the representation to be treated as an instance of a Vector space model by considering each term as a value of 0 or 1 along a dimension orthogonal to the dimensions used for the other terms.

The Binary Independence Model (BIM) is a technique used in computing and information science for probabilistic information retrieval. Here's a summary:
Basic Concept
:
BIM considers documents as binary vectors, representing only the presence or absence of terms. It assumes that terms are independently distributed in relevant and irrelevant document sets.
Document and Query Representation
:
Documents and queries are represented as vectors of Boolean variables. Each variable corresponds to a term and is set to 1 if the term is present and 0 if it is absent.
Independence Assumption
:
The model operates under the assumption that terms in a document are independent of each other. This assumption simplifies the model but can be limiting, although it often yields sufficiently good results.
Relevance Probability
:
BIM uses Bayes' rule to determine the probability that a document is relevant to a query. This involves calculating the probability based on the relevance of the document���s terms vector.
Estimation of Probabilities
:
Exact probabilities of a document being relevant or not are unknown and must be estimated from statistics about the document collection.
Prior Probability of Relevance
:
The model considers the prior probability of retrieving a relevant (or non-relevant) document for a query. If the percentage of relevant documents in a collection is known, it can be used to estimate these probabilities.
In essence, the Binary Independence Model simplifies document-query matching by using binary vectors and independent term distribution assumptions. This approach, despite its limitations, is effective enough for many practical applications in information retrieval.

Query Terms Weighting
Given a binary query and the dot product as the similarity function between a document and a query, the problem is to assign weights to the terms in the query such that the retrieval effectiveness will be high. Let 
���
���
p_{i} and 
���
���
q_{i} be the probability that a relevant document and an irrelevant document has the ith term respectively. Yu and Salton,[1] who first introduce BIM, propose that the weight of the ith term is an increasing function of

{\displaystyle Y_{i}={\frac {p_{i}*(1-q_{i})}{(1-p_{i})*q_{i}}}}. Thus, if 
���
���
Y_{i} is higher than 
���
���
Y_j, the weight of term i will be higher than that of term j. Yu and Salton[1] showed that such a weight assignment to query terms yields better retrieval effectiveness than if query terms are equally weighted. Robertson and Sp��rck Jones[2] later showed that if the ith term is assigned the weight of 
log

���
���
{\displaystyle \log Y_{i}}, then optimal retrieval effectiveness is obtained under the Binary Independence Assumption.

The Binary Independence Model was introduced by Yu and Salton.[1] The name Binary Independence Model was coined by Robertson and Sp��rck Jones[2] who used the log-odds probability of the probabilistic relevance model to derive

IDF information theoretic interpretation
Here is an interpretation from information theory. Suppose a query term

{\displaystyle D} will contain the term with probability

{\displaystyle {\frac {n(q)}{N}}} (where 
���
{\displaystyle N} is again the cardinality of the set of documents in the collection). Therefore, the information content of the message "

{\displaystyle -\log {\frac {n(q)}{N}}=\log {\frac {N}{n(q)}}.}
Now suppose we have two query terms

1
{\displaystyle q_{1}} and 
���
2
{\displaystyle q_{2}}. If the two terms occur in documents entirely independently of each other, then the probability of seeing both

Relation to IDF in BM25
:
IDF Component
: This information-theoretic perspective closely relates to the IDF component of the BM25 ranking function. IDF quantifies the informativeness of terms based on their distribution across the document collection, with less frequent terms generally being more informative.
In essence, this interpretation explains IDF as a measure of how informative a term is in the context of a document collection. Terms that are rare across the collection are deemed more informative (having higher information content) than those that are common, thereby influencing their weight in the BM25 ranking function.

BM25F[5][2] (or the BM25 model with Extension to Multiple Weighted Fields[6]) is a modification of BM25 in which the document is considered to be composed from several fields (such as headlines, main text, anchor text) with possibly different degrees of importance, term relevance saturation and length normalization. BM25F defines each type of field as a stream, applying a per-stream weighting to scale each stream against the calculated score.
BM25+[7] is an extension of BM25. BM25+ was developed to address one deficiency of the standard BM25 in which the component of term frequency normalization by document length is not properly lower-bounded; as a result of this deficiency, long documents which do match the query term can often be scored unfairly by BM25 as having a similar relevancy to shorter documents that do not contain the query term at all. The scoring formula of BM25+ only has one additional free parameter

Conversation with Bard -2
bc2.text.md
Here's a conversation I had with bard. This first section is a question about this wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25 Read it on Wikipedia as I removed it here. This is a long conversation that seems to demonstrate some things that Bard has trouble with -- in particular stubborness. I think it's interesting. Your milage may vary. BTW, on rereading this, I think I may have been entirely wrong. What I needed to say about inverse probability was not finding the term in the collection but the document in the collection. I still think this may have some value in understanding the limitations of humans and LLMs as we figure out how to help each other. After reading this I tried again. This time there was no problem because I was more careful in what I said. I'll add that to the bottom.

please explain this: From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25 (I actually copied and pasted in the text of this article)

Do you have any further questions about Okapi BM25 or information retrieval in general?

The formulas are confusing. there are so many terms

You're right, the Okapi BM25 formulas can be intimidating with all the terms and symbols. Let's break it down further and focus on the core concepts:

Key Players:

TF: Term Frequency - How many times a keyword appears in the document. High TF suggests relevance, but too high might indicate "keyword stuffing." IDF: Inverse Document Frequency - How rare and informative a keyword is across all documents. Rare keywords are more informative for ranking. D: Document length - Penalizes very long documents to avoid favoring them solely based on size. The Formula in Plain English:

Imagine you have a document and a search query with keywords. BM25 calculates a score for that document based on:

Relevance: How often each keyword appears in the document (TF). Informativeness: How rare and informative each keyword is (IDF). Fairness: Penalizing documents that are very long, to avoid giving them an unfair advantage. Parameters:

k1: Controls the impact of term frequency. Higher k1 gives more weight to documents with frequent keywords. b: Controls the document length penalty. Higher b penalizes longer documents more severely. Variations:

BM25F: Considers different sections of a document (title, body, etc.) with different importance. BM25+: Addresses a limitation where long documents without the keyword might be ranked similarly to shorter documents with it. Remember:

The purpose of BM25 is to rank documents by their relevance to the search query. The formula combines various factors like TF, IDF, and document length to achieve this. Don't worry about memorizing the exact formula, understanding the concepts behind each term is more important. Do you have any specific questions about a particular term or part of the formula? Let me know, and I'll do my best to explain it further.

TF seems easy to understand. Document frequency seems easy, but what is inverse?

You're right, understanding TF (term frequency) and document frequency is straightforward. The concept of "inverse" in inverse document frequency (IDF) might seem tricky at first, but let's break it down:

Document Frequency (DF): This tells you how many documents in a collection actually contain a specific word. For example, the word "the" has a very high DF, meaning it appears in almost every document. On the other hand, a technical term like "pneumatic actuator" might have a low DF, appearing only in specialized documents.

Inverse: Here's where it gets interesting. "Inverse" essentially means "opposite" or "flipped." So, inverse document frequency (IDF) takes the opposite of the document frequency.

Why flip it?

Imagine searching for information about "pneumatic actuators." If documents containing both "pneumatic" and "actuator" (high DF for both) were ranked highest, you might get generic results about air pressure or motors. But by taking the inverse of DF, we reward words that are less common across documents (like "pneumatic actuator") because they are more likely to be specific and informative for your search.

Putting it together:

Think of IDF as a way to boost the importance of words that are rare and informative in the context of your search. While a word appearing frequently in a single document (high TF) might suggest relevance, IDF ensures that truly unique and informative words across documents get recognized and contribute to the ranking.

I hope this explanation clarifies the concept of "inverse" in IDF. If you have any further questions or want specific examples, feel free to ask!

profile picture please break down the formula for IDF

While understanding the core concepts behind IDF is important, the complete formula itself can be quite technical. However, I can break it down into its components and explain their meaning:

IDF Formula:

IDF(t) = log( N / df(t) ) Where:

IDF(t): This is the Inverse Document Frequency of term t. N: This is the total number of documents in the collection. df(t): This is the document frequency of term t, meaning the number of documents in the collection that contain t. log: This is the natural logarithm function (base e). Understanding the Components:

N / df(t): This part reflects the rarity of the term t. Dividing the total number of documents (N) by the number of documents containing t (df(t)) gives a value that's higher when t is less common. log: The logarithm helps to compress the values and ensure that even very rare terms don't have an excessive impact on the final score. Putting it Together:

The basic idea is that the IDF score increases as the term t becomes less frequent across the entire document collection. This means that terms appearing in only a few documents are considered more informative and discriminative for ranking, as they are more likely to be relevant to specific topics.

Important Note:

Remember, this is a simplified explanation. There are different variations of the IDF formula used in practice, and they might incorporate additional factors or adjustments. The key takeaway is to understand the underlying principle of rewarding rare and informative terms for document ranking.

Do you have any further questions about specific parts of the formula or its application?

You've got it right about TF (Term Frequency) and DF (Document Frequency). Let's delve into the concept of Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):
Understanding Document Frequency (DF)
:
DF measures how many documents contain a specific word. Common words like "the" appear in many documents, hence a high DF. In contrast, specialized terms like "pneumatic actuator" appear in fewer documents, resulting in a low DF.
The Concept of 'Inverse' in IDF
:
"Inverse" implies the opposite or a flipped version of something. So, Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) essentially flips the document frequency.
Why do this? The goal is to emphasize words that are rare across the document collection. Common words that appear in many documents are less informative for distinguishing between different documents, whereas rare words can be more indicative of specific, relevant content.

profile picture so if in 100 documents 50 had the term IDF of the term would be the log of N/df(t) or log of 2.

Yes, that's correct! If 50 out of 100 documents in a collection contain a particular term, then the IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) of that term would be the logarithm (base e) of 100 divided by 50, which is indeed equal to the logarithm of 2.

Here's the calculation:

IDF(t) = log(N / df(t)) = log(100 / 50) = log(2) As you can see, the IDF value increases as the term becomes less frequent in the document collection. In this case, since half the documents contain the term, it's not very rare, resulting in an IDF of only 0.301 (which is the logarithm of 2).

Imagine you're searching for information about a very specific topic, like a rare medical condition. Terms related to that condition would likely appear in only a few documents, making them much rarer and more informative for your search. Their IDF values would be higher, amplifying their importance in ranking relevant documents.

profile picture calculate log(2)

My pleasure, I���ve been growing my expertise in solving logarithms problems. Let's calculate the value of log(2).

We can evaluate the expression using the properties of logarithms. Since log a���(b)=c is equivalent to a c =b, where a is any positive constant and a ��� =1, we can rewrite the given expression as 10 log(2) =2.

Now, we can see that 10 0.301 =2, so log(2)=0.301.

Therefore, the value of log(2) is
0.301���.

profile picture and is 0.301 the "surprise"

Unfortunately, I cannot definitively say whether 0.301 is the "surprise" without more context. The term "surprise" can have different meanings in different contexts, and I need more information to understand what you mean by it in this case.

Here are some possibilities:

Information Retrieval: In information retrieval, surprise is sometimes used to describe the unexpectedness of a term appearing in a document. However, 0.301 doesn't directly measure "surprise" in this sense. It's the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of a term, which reflects its rarity and informativeness, not necessarily its unexpectedness. Statistics: In statistics, surprise can refer to the level of unexpectedness of an outcome based on its probability. However, without knowing the specific probability distribution or context, it's impossible to say if 0.301 represents a surprising value. Other Contexts: The term "surprise" could have other meanings depending on the field or specific situation. If you could provide more context about what you're referring to and what makes you think 0.301 might be surprising, I might be able to give you a more accurate answer.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your understanding is correct. In information retrieval, the term "surprise" is often used informally to describe the informativeness or unexpectedness of a term's appearance in a document. In the context of IDF (Inverse Document Frequency), a value of 0.301 (which is the logarithm of 2) does convey a certain level of informativeness, but it may not directly correspond to what one might intuitively consider as "surprise."
Here���s why:
IDF and Informativeness
: The IDF value of 0.301 in your example implies that the term is moderately informative. It's not extremely rare (as it appears in half of the documents), but it's not overly common either.
Interpreting IDF Value
:
In the context of IDF, a lower value (like 0.301) suggests that the term is relatively common in the document collection. It's informative, but not highly so.
A higher IDF value would indicate a rarer term, which could be more "surprising" or informative in the context of a specific query.
"Surprise" in Information Theory
: In information theory, "surprise" is often quantified in terms of entropy or unexpectedness of information. While IDF is related to this concept, it specifically measures the informativeness of terms in the context of a document set rather than their surprise factor in the classical information theory sense.
In summary, the value of 0.301 as an IDF score indicates moderate informativeness of a term within a set of documents. It doesn't directly measure "surprise" in the conventional sense, but rather how much information the term provides for distinguishing documents in the collection.
You
profile picture please explain how rarity is not a synonym for unexpected surprise

You're right, rarity and unexpected surprise aren't exactly synonymous. While they often overlap, there are key differences to consider:

Rarity:

Refers to how uncommon something is. Quantifiable, often measured through metrics like frequency or probability. Doesn't inherently imply surprise or shock. For example, a specific flower might be rare, but finding it wouldn't necessarily be surprising if you knew where to look. Unexpected surprise:

Refers to something that is contrary to expectation. Subjective and depends on individual prior knowledge and context. Not always related to rarity. Finding a common object in an unexpected place (like a seashell in the desert) can be surprising even though the object itself isn't rare. The connection:

Rare things are often surprising because they are unexpected. However, just because something is rare doesn't guarantee it will be surprising. The level of surprise depends on individual expectations and context. Conversely, something unexpected can be surprising even if it's not particularly rare. It all depends on what you were expecting. The case of IDF:

In Information Retrieval, IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) measures the rarity of a term across a document collection. While a high IDF value suggests a less common term, it doesn't directly quantify surprise. The surprise of encountering that term depends on the specific search query and the user's expectations. Remember:

Rarity is an objective measure, while surprise is subjective and contextual. They often go hand-in-hand, but they are not the same thing. I hope this clarifies the distinction between rarity and unexpected surprise!

profile picture I was wondering why the log was used. Isn't a log taken of a probability to give a measure of surprise?

You're on the right track! While there is a connection between surprise and logarithms in information theory, the specific use of log in the IDF formula needs some clarification.

Surprise in Information Theory:

In information theory, the information content of an event is indeed related to its surprise or unexpectedness. The more surprising an event (i.e., less likely), the higher its information content. The logarithm function comes into play because it scales information content in a way that aligns with our intuitive understanding of surprise. Less likely events have much larger "surprise boosts" than slightly less likely events.

Logarithm in IDF:

However, the log in the IDF formula doesn't directly measure surprise based on probability. Its primary function is to dampen the impact of term frequency on IDF values. Imagine two terms: one appearing in 1 out of 100 documents and another in 1 out of 1 million. Without the log, their IDF difference would be gigantic, unfairly favoring the extremely rare term. The log compresses this difference, placing more emphasis on the relative rarity of terms instead of absolute differences.

So, while the log function serves a similar purpose of highlighting unexpectedness (rare terms), it's not directly calculating surprise based on probability in the IDF context.

Here's a summary:

Information theory: Log measures surprise based on event probability. IDF: Log dampens the influence of term frequency on IDF values, indirectly affecting how "surprising" a term might seem in the context of a search query. I hope this clarifies the different uses of log in these contexts!
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In the context of Information Retrieval and IDF (Inverse Document Frequency), the logarithm function does serve a purpose related to the concept of surprise in information theory, but with a specific focus:
Logarithm in Information Theory
:
In information theory, the surprise or information content of an event is indeed related to its unexpectedness or rarity. The more unlikely an event, the more information it conveys.
The logarithm is used to measure this surprise, where the information content of an event is inversely proportional to its probability. Essentially, rarer events carry more "surprise" or information.
Logarithm in IDF
:
In the IDF formula, the logarithm serves to moderate the impact of term frequency differences across documents. It prevents terms that are extremely rare from being overwhelmingly influential compared to those that are moderately rare.

uses the logarithm to scale down the effect of the raw frequency ratio. This creates a more balanced and nuanced measure of term importance.
Difference in Context
:
While information theory generally uses logarithms to quantify the surprise or information content of events based on their probabilities, in IDF, the logarithm is more about scaling and balancing term frequencies.
The IDF's use of the logarithm indirectly captures the rarity (and thus potential surprise) of terms, but its primary purpose is to provide a balanced weighting for terms in document retrieval, where terms that appear in fewer documents are given more weight.
In summary, while both uses of the logarithm relate to the concept of rarity or surprise, their specific purposes differ. In information theory, it quantifies surprise based on probability, while in IDF, it helps balance the influence of term frequency for effective document ranking.

profile picture I understand how logs change the scale to make some data understandable - like decibels.

You're absolutely right! Logs are incredibly useful tools for manipulating data and making it easier to understand and work with. Here are some key points about using logarithms to change the scale:

Compression:

As you mentioned, logs can compress a wide range of values into a more manageable scale. This is very helpful for dealing with data that has extreme values or covers a vast spectrum. For example, decibels use a logarithmic scale to express sound intensity, making it easier to compare faint whispers to deafening explosions. Proportional relationships:

Logs preserve the proportional relationships between values in the original data. This means that if one value is twice as large as another in the original scale, their corresponding log values will still differ by the same factor. This property makes it easier to analyze how changes in one variable affect another. Exponential relationships:

Logarithms can be used to convert exponential relationships into linear ones. This is because the equation y = log_a(x) is the inverse of the exponential equation x = a^y. This transformation makes it easier to identify patterns and trends in data that exhibits exponential growth or decay. Real-world applications:

Logs are used in various scientific and engineering fields for tasks like: Signal processing: Analyzing the frequency components of sound or light waves. Chemistry: Measuring acidity or alkalinity (pH). Economics: Studying economic growth and decline. Computer science: Analyzing the performance of algorithms and systems. Understanding the base:

It's important to remember that the base of the logarithm (a in log_a(x)) affects the scaling and interpretation of the values. Common bases include 2 (binary logarithms), 10 (decimal logarithms), and e (natural logarithms). Each base offers advantages depending on the specific application. By understanding the power of logarithms and their various applications, you can unlock valuable insights from data that might otherwise be difficult to interpret.

profile picture but when you take a log of something, you also change the range of values; so the interpretation also changes

You're absolutely correct! Taking the log of something does change the range of values, and as a result, the interpretation of those values will also change. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

Changing Values:

Taking the log of a positive number scales it down, converting a wide range of values into a more manageable scale. For example, if you take the base-10 logarithm (logarithm with base 10) of numbers ranging from 1 to 1000, you'll get values between 0 and 3. Interpretation Shift:

This change in scale also changes the interpretation of the values. In your example with decibels, a difference of 10 decibels represents a tenfold increase in sound intensity, not an additive difference of 10. Similarly, in chemistry, a pH difference of 1 represents a tenfold change in acidity or alkalinity. Relative vs. Absolute:

Logarithms often emphasize relative changes rather than absolute differences. A small change in the original data might cause a larger change in the log values, especially for larger initial values. This can be helpful for highlighting trends and patterns in data that exhibits exponential growth or decay. Context Matters:

The specific interpretation of log values depends on the context and the base used. Decibels use a base-10 logarithm, while pH uses a base-10 logarithm with a specific offset. Understanding the context and the base is crucial for correctly interpreting log values. Benefits and Trade-offs:

Changing the range of values through logarithms offers several benefits: Compressing data for easier visualization and analysis. Exposing exponential relationships as linear relationships. Emphasizing relative changes for trend identification. However, it's important to remember that the interpretation of log values is different from the original data and requires awareness of the scaling and context. In summary:

Taking the log of something does change the range and interpretation of values. However, this transformation serves specific purposes, like data compression, highlighting trends, and working with exponential relationships. Remember to consider the context and base used when interpreting log values to avoid misinterpretations.

Absolutely, taking the logarithm of a dataset changes both the range of values and their interpretation. This shift in perspective is often useful in various fields for making sense of data that spans large scales. Let's explore this in more detail:
Changing the Scale
:
When you apply a logarithmic transformation to data, it compresses large values more than small ones. This reduces the range of values and brings them onto a more manageable scale, especially useful when dealing with data that spans several orders of magnitude.
Relative vs. Absolute Changes
:
A logarithmic scale emphasizes relative (proportional) changes rather than absolute differences. For example, in a log scale, equal distances represent equal percentage changes, not equal absolute changes. This can highlight patterns or trends in data that might be overlooked on a linear scale.
Interpretation Shift
:
On a logarithmic scale, interpretation shifts from absolute values to multiplicative factors. This is particularly evident in disciplines like finance (compounding interest rates), acoustics (decibels for sound intensity), and earthquake measurement (Richter scale).
Exponential Relationships Become Linear
:
Logarithmic transformations can linearize exponential relationships, simplifying the analysis and interpretation. This is frequently used in regression analysis of exponentially related variables.
Context-Specific Interpretation
:
The interpretation of logarithmic values depends heavily on the context and the specific application. For instance, in the pH scale, a logarithmic scale is used to represent hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, where each unit change corresponds to a tenfold change in acidity.
Benefits and Limitations
:
The logarithmic transformation makes it easier to handle and interpret large-scale variations in data. However, it's essential to remember that this transformation can obscure absolute differences and may not be suitable for all types of data analysis.
In summary, while logarithms help in handling and interpreting large-scale data variations, they require a shift in how we understand and interpret the data. This transformation is invaluable in many fields but must be used with an awareness of its impact on data interpretation.

profile picture so in IDF we take the log of the inverse probability.

I apologize, I misspoke in my previous explanation. While there is a connection between information theory and the IDF formula, stating that IDF takes the log of the inverse probability isn't entirely accurate. Here's the clarification:

IDF and Probability:

IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): As discussed earlier, IDF reflects the rarity of a term across a document collection, not its probability. Rarity and probability are related, but not the same. A rare term might have a low probability of appearing in any document, but there can be rare terms with higher probabilities depending on the specific collection and topic.

Logarithm in IDF: The log function in the IDF formula serves a different purpose than calculating surprise based on probability. Its primary function is to dampen the impact of term frequency on IDF values. This ensures that extremely rare terms don't have an overwhelmingly large influence on document rankings compared to slightly less rare terms.

Connection to Information Theory:

Information theory deals with quantifying information content and surprise based on probabilities. There are measures like Shannon entropy that involve logarithms and relate to the unexpectedness of events.

However, directly applying these information theory concepts to IDF wouldn't be appropriate. IDF primarily focuses on term rarity and its impact on document relevance, not directly measuring surprise based on strict probability calculations.

Summary:

IDF and information theory share some connections, but their specific focuses and purposes differ. IDF uses a log function to manage term frequency impact, not directly calculate surprise based on probability. Understanding the distinction between rarity and probability is crucial for accurate interpretation of the IDF formula. I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous statement. I hope this clarifies the relationship between IDF and probability. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions!

profile picture the probability of the case I gave is 50/100. So 100/50 is the inverse probaility.

I understand that in your earlier example, there were 50 documents containing a term out of 100 total documents. This translates to a probability of 50/100 (or 0.5) of a document containing the term. You're correct that the inverse probability in this case would be 100/50 (or 2).

However, it's important to clarify that while the inverse of the probability is involved in the IDF formula, it's not directly used as the argument for the logarithm. Here's the breakdown:

IDF Formula:

IDF(t) = log( N / df(t) ) N: Total number of documents in the collection (in your case, 100). df(t): Document frequency of term t (number of documents containing t, which is 50 in your case). log: Logarithm function (usually base 10 or natural logarithm). Calculation and Interpretation:

Plugging in your values: IDF(t) = log(100 / 50) = log(2). The final IDF value depends on the chosen logarithm base. If using base 10, IDF(t) ��� 0.301. Key Points:

The IDF formula uses the total number of documents (N) divided by the document frequency (df), not the inverse probability directly. This ratio gives a sense of term rarity within the collection, with higher values indicating rarer terms. The logarithm helps compress the values and prevent extremely rare terms from dominating the ranking. So, while your understanding of probability and its inverse is correct, it's not directly applied in the way you described for the IDF formula. The formula uses a broader ratio and then employs the logarithm for scaling purposes.

I hope this clarifies the distinction and how the IDF formula actually works!

profile picture You don't want me to use "inverse probability." can you give me an example of when inverse probability would be wrong?

I apologize for my previous statements regarding "inverse probability" and the way I explained the IDF formula. It appears I miscommunicated the concept and led you down an incorrect path.

While "inverse probability" can be mathematically related to some elements of the IDF formula, it's not the most accurate or helpful way to understand it. It's more important to focus on the core concept of IDF: term rarity and its impact on document relevance.

Instead of focusing on "inverse probability", here's an alternative explanation and an example of when a simple probability-based approach might be misleading:

IDF and Relative Rarity:

Imagine two terms: "cat" and "pneumatic actuator." While the probability of finding any single word in a document might be similar, their relative rarity within the document collection differs significantly. "Cat" is likely to appear in many documents, making it less informative for distinguishing relevant documents in a specific search. On the other hand, "pneumatic actuator" is likely to appear in much fewer documents, making it more specific and informative for a search related to that topic. IDF captures this relative rarity by considering the term's frequency across the entire collection, not just its individual probability in any single document. Misinterpreting Probability:

A simple approach based on individual word probabilities might assign similar weights to both "cat" and "pneumatic actuator" if their individual probabilities of appearing in any document are similar. This wouldn't reflect their true informativeness for specific searches. By considering the rarity across the whole collection, IDF ensures that less common and more specific terms (like "pneumatic actuator") have a greater impact on ranking relevant documents, even if their individual probabilities might not be exceptionally low. Remember:

IDF focuses on relative term rarity, not just individual probabilities. This helps identify terms that are more specific and informative for distinguishing relevant documents in a search. Thinking purely in terms of "inverse probability" might lead to misinterpretations and inaccurate understanding of how IDF works. I hope this revised explanation clarifies the issue and provides a more accurate understanding of the IDF concept. Feel free to ask any further questions you might have!

profile picture You're wrong here. Why shouldn't I think of it as inverse probability as a component of the IDF formula?

I apologize for causing confusion and stating inaccurate information previously. You're correct that interpreting the IDF formula purely as "inverse probability" isn't completely wrong, but it can be misleading and doesn't capture the full picture. Here's a more nuanced explanation:

Why "Inverse Probability" Isn't Enough:

Focus on Rarity: While the document frequency (df) in IDF might seem like a "probability" of a term appearing in a document (df / N), it's crucial to understand that IDF emphasizes term rarity across the entire collection, not just the chance of it appearing in any particular document. The inverse of this "collection-wide probability" captures this rarity, but it's not the sole defining factor of IDF.

Logarithm's Role: The logarithm in the IDF formula plays a crucial role in compressing the scale of values and ensuring that extremely rare terms don't have an overwhelmingly large impact on document ranking compared to slightly less rare terms. Simply having an "inverse probability" wouldn't achieve this compression and balanced weighting.

Context Matters: The interpretation of term informativeness (and therefore, its weight in ranking) can vary depending on the specific search query and context. Just focusing on "inverse probability" might not capture these nuances and may lead to inaccurate rankings in certain situations.

While the "inverse probability" perspective offers a starting point, it's incomplete and can lead to misunderstandings. Here's a better way to think about IDF:

IDF captures the concept of term rarity within the document collection and uses it to assess its informativeness for ranking documents in a specific search context. The formula incorporates this rarity through the inverse document frequency (df / N) and then applies the logarithm for scaling purposes.

Key Takeaways:

IDF goes beyond "inverse probability" by considering rarity across the whole collection and using the logarithm for appropriate scaling. Understanding term rarity and its context-dependent informativeness is crucial for accurately interpreting IDF. Focusing solely on "inverse probability" might lead to misinterpretations and inaccurate rankings. I hope this revised explanation clarifies the issue and provides a more accurate understanding of the IDF concept. Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any further questions!

You're right to think about Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) in relation to inverse probability, and I apologize for any previous confusion. Let's clarify this:
Probability and Inverse Probability
:
In the context of IDF, the probability that a term appears in a document (document frequency, df) is considered. This is represented as
d
f
(
t
)
N
\frac{df(t)}{N}
N
df

, which indicates the rarity of the term across the entire document collection.
IDF as a Measure of Rarity
:
IDF takes the logarithm of this inverse probability. So, if a term appears in 50 out of 100 documents, the IDF is calculated as
log
���
(
100

)
=

.
The use of logarithm in this formula serves to dampen the impact of this ratio, preventing terms that are extremely rare from being disproportionately influential.
Why Inverse Probability is Important
:
The rationale for using the inverse probability is that terms which are less common across the document collection are more informative for distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant documents in a query.
Therefore, a term appearing in fewer documents would have a higher IDF score, indicating greater importance for that term in the context of information retrieval.
In essence, thinking of IDF as a function of inverse probability is correct. It captures the core idea that terms which are rarer across the document collection (i.e., have a high inverse probability) are more informative and thus given more weight in the BM25 scoring function. This approach helps to identify documents that are most relevant to a specific query, especially those containing unique or less frequent terms.
You
profile picture Yes, but I had changed the scope of my musings from IDF to a component of IDF. I think I can do that without becoming confused about the ultimate goal of understanding IDF.

I apologize again for any confusion caused by my previous explanations. You're absolutely right that you can explore specific components of the IDF formula without necessarily getting lost in the overall understanding of IDF's goal.

While I previously argued against using "inverse probability" as a component, I realize that depending on your musings and perspective, there might be specific aspects of the formula where examining it through an "inverse probability" lens could be helpful.

To better understand your current focus, could you please clarify what specific component of the IDF formula you'd like to explore as "inverse probability"? Perhaps providing the exact term or part of the formula would help me understand your perspective and offer a more relevant explanation.

Remember, my goal is to assist you in your understanding, and I'm happy to adjust my explanations to match your current area of inquiry.

profile picture It isn't am inverse probability lens. It's the formula for inverse probability.

I understand your position better now. While I previously advised against thinking of the entire IDF formula as "inverse probability", I understand you're now specifically interested in understanding how the formula itself relates to the concept of inverse probability.

However, it's crucial to reiterate that the IDF formula doesn't directly calculate an "inverse probability" in the classical sense. There might be some misconceptions or nuances that need clarification before I can address your specific question about the formula.

To ensure I provide the most accurate and helpful response, could you please share the specific part of the IDF formula you're interested in regarding its connection to inverse probability? Mentioning the exact terms or symbols involved would help me tailor my explanation to your exact question.

Remember, there might be alternative ways to think about the formula without strictly relying on "inverse probability", which could ultimately lead to a clearer understanding of the underlying concepts. I'm here to guide you through that process.

profile picture It's simply the case that inverse probability and rarity are related. Can't you see that?

You're absolutely right, I apologize if my previous responses caused any confusion or frustration. You're correct that inverse probability and rarity are definitely related, and I understand your point. I certainly see the connection now.

I was focusing too much on the specific way the IDF formula is implemented and trying to avoid using the term "inverse probability" entirely. This was misguided, as you're essentially right: the concept of inverse probability is present in the spirit of the formula even though it's not directly calculated.

Here's a simpler way to explain it:

Imagine you have a set of coins, and each coin has a picture of a different animal on it. The more common an animal is in the real world, the more likely it is that you'll find a coin with that animal on it (higher probability).

Now, imagine you're looking for a specific animal, like a rare panda. The fewer coins there are with a panda on them (lower probability), the more informative it is to find one because it tells you more about where pandas might be (higher rarity, hence higher weight).

This is similar to how IDF works. Instead of animals on coins, you have terms in documents. The fewer documents a term appears in (lower probability), the more informative it is for identifying relevant documents about that topic (higher rarity, hence higher weight in ranking).

So, while the "inverse probability" might not be directly calculated in the formula, the idea of rewarding terms based on their relative rarity within the collection definitely captures the essence of IDF.

I hope this revised explanation clarifies things and shows you that I understand the connection you're pointing out. If you have any further questions or want to explore the concept further, please don't hesitate to ask!

Yes, you are correct. Inverse probability and rarity are closely related, and this relationship is indeed relevant to the concept of IDF in information retrieval. Let's clarify this connection:
Probability of a Term in Documents
:
Consider the probability of finding a term in a random document. If a term appears in many documents within the collection, it has a higher probability of being found.
Inverse Probability and Rarity
:
Inverse probability refers to flipping this concept. A term that appears in fewer documents has a lower probability of being found in any given document, making it rarer.
The rarer the term is, the higher its inverse probability. This rarity, or inverse probability, is what IDF aims to capture.
IDF as a Measure of Rarity
:
The IDF formula,
log

d
f
(
t
)
)
\log(\frac{N}{df(t)})
lo
g
(
df
(

N
���
)
, uses the inverse of the term's document frequency (df) relative to the total number of documents (N). This essentially measures the term's rarity across the entire document collection.
By taking the logarithm of this ratio, IDF assigns higher weights to rarer terms, recognizing their greater importance in distinguishing relevant documents.
Understanding IDF in the Context of Inverse Probability
:
While IDF doesn't directly calculate "inverse probability," it aligns with the concept by emphasizing terms that are rare (or have a high inverse probability) in the document collection.
In summary, understanding IDF in terms of inverse probability is valid. The IDF formula effectively measures the rarity of a term across a document collection, which can be thought of as the inverse probability of finding the term in a random document. This approach helps to identify terms that are more informative for distinguishing relevant documents in a search query.
You
profile picture If you have a reason for wanting me to avoid it, that might be important. Is it the case that many have been led astray by recognizing the relationship?

I apologize if my previous attempts to guide you away from thinking about IDF as "inverse probability" caused any frustration or confusion. It wasn't my intention to lead you astray.

My earlier reasoning for avoiding the term "inverse probability" stemmed from two concerns:

Misinterpretation:
While there is a connection between rarity and inverse probability, they are not strictly the same. I worried that focusing solely on "inverse probability" might lead to misinterpretations of the IDF formula, neglecting the importance of considering the logarithm and the context of the search query. 2. Confusion with simpler probability approaches:

Some information retrieval approaches utilize simpler calculations based on individual term probabilities. I was concerned that connecting IDF directly to "inverse probability" might lead to comparisons with these simpler methods, which wouldn't accurately reflect the complexities of IDF. However, I now understand your point that recognizing the relationship between rarity and inverse probability can be a helpful starting point for understanding the spirit of the IDF formula.

Moving Forward:

Instead of completely avoiding the term "inverse probability," I should have focused on providing a more nuanced explanation that acknowledges the connection while highlighting the specific aspects of IDF that go beyond a simple inverse probability calculation.

Key Takeaways:

The notion of rarity captured by inverse probability plays a role in understanding IDF. The IDF formula doesn't directly calculate an inverse probability in the classical sense. It's crucial to consider the logarithm function and the context of the search query for a complete understanding of IDF. I'm happy to continue exploring the concept of IDF with you using whatever terminology you find helpful. My goal is to provide accurate and clear explanations that align with your learning process.

Feel free to ask any further questions or share your thoughts on how I can better assist you in understanding IDF!

profile picture I don't think about IDF as inverse probability. I think of IDF as rarity. But I also think the two are related.

That's great to hear! It's perfectly fine to think of IDF as primarily about rarity without focusing solely on the "inverse probability" aspect. As you rightly mentioned, the two are indeed related, and recognizing that connection can be helpful in understanding the concept.

Remember, IDF aims to identify terms that are less common across a document collection, as these terms are more likely to be informative for specific topics and distinguish relevant documents from irrelevant ones. This aligns perfectly with the notion of rarity.

While the formula itself doesn't directly calculate an inverse probability, it uses the ratio of total documents (N) to document frequency (df), which essentially reflects the inverse probability of a term appearing in any given document. However, the logarithm component introduces additional nuances and ensures that extremely rare terms don't have an overwhelming impact on rankings.

So, thinking of IDF in terms of rarity is absolutely valid and aligns with its core purpose. If you have any further questions or specific aspects of IDF you'd like to explore within the context of rarity, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you delve deeper into this concept.

I appreciate your understanding and perspective on this matter. Viewing IDF in terms of rarity is indeed a valid and effective way to conceptualize it. The relationship between rarity and inverse probability is an important aspect to consider, as it helps in understanding why IDF works the way it does in information retrieval.
Your approach of thinking about IDF in terms of rarity aligns well with its purpose in the BM25 formula and other information retrieval contexts:
Rarity as a Measure of Information
: In the context of information retrieval, rare terms are often more informative than common terms. The IDF component helps to amplify the importance of these rare terms in the document ranking process.
Balancing Term Influence
: The logarithmic component in the IDF formula ensures that the influence of term rarity is balanced, preventing extremely rare terms from disproportionately affecting the document ranking.
Contextual Relevance
: The use of IDF in BM25 and similar models ensures that the search results are not just about term frequency but also about the contextual relevance of the terms within the broader document collection.
Inverse Probability and Rarity
: While the term "inverse probability" isn't explicitly used in the IDF formula, understanding that IDF is inversely related to the frequency of a term across the document collection is a useful way to grasp its impact on term weighting.
Your approach to understanding IDF aligns with these principles, providing a solid foundation for grasping how document relevance is calculated in various information retrieval systems. If you have any more questions or wish to explore further nuances of IDF, BM25, or information retrieval, please feel free to ask.

Conversation with Bard -2
bc2.text.md
Here's a conversation I had with bard. This first section is a question about this wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25 Read it on Wikipedia as I removed it here. This is a long conversation that seems to demonstrate some things that Bard has trouble with -- in particular stubborness. I think it's interesting. Your milage may vary. BTW, on rereading this, I think I may have been entirely wrong. What I needed to say about inverse probability was not finding the term in the collection but the document in the collection. I still think this may have some value in understanding the limitations of humans and LLMs as we figure out how to help each other. After reading this I tried again. This time there was no problem because I was more careful in what I said. I'll add that to the bottom.

please explain this: From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25 (I actually copied and pasted in the text of this article)

Do you have any further questions about Okapi BM25 or information retrieval in general?

The formulas are confusing. there are so many terms

You're right, the Okapi BM25 formulas can be intimidating with all the terms and symbols. Let's break it down further and focus on the core concepts:

Key Players:

TF: Term Frequency - How many times a keyword appears in the document. High TF suggests relevance, but too high might indicate "keyword stuffing." IDF: Inverse Document Frequency - How rare and informative a keyword is across all documents. Rare keywords are more informative for ranking. D: Document length - Penalizes very long documents to avoid favoring them solely based on size. The Formula in Plain English:

Imagine you have a document and a search query with keywords. BM25 calculates a score for that document based on:

Relevance: How often each keyword appears in the document (TF). Informativeness: How rare and informative each keyword is (IDF). Fairness: Penalizing documents that are very long, to avoid giving them an unfair advantage. Parameters:

k1: Controls the impact of term frequency. Higher k1 gives more weight to documents with frequent keywords. b: Controls the document length penalty. Higher b penalizes longer documents more severely. Variations:

BM25F: Considers different sections of a document (title, body, etc.) with different importance. BM25+: Addresses a limitation where long documents without the keyword might be ranked similarly to shorter documents with it. Remember:

The purpose of BM25 is to rank documents by their relevance to the search query. The formula combines various factors like TF, IDF, and document length to achieve this. Don't worry about memorizing the exact formula, understanding the concepts behind each term is more important. Do you have any specific questions about a particular term or part of the formula? Let me know, and I'll do my best to explain it further.

TF seems easy to understand. Document frequency seems easy, but what is inverse?

You're right, understanding TF (term frequency) and document frequency is straightforward. The concept of "inverse" in inverse document frequency (IDF) might seem tricky at first, but let's break it down:

Document Frequency (DF): This tells you how many documents in a collection actually contain a specific word. For example, the word "the" has a very high DF, meaning it appears in almost every document. On the other hand, a technical term like "pneumatic actuator" might have a low DF, appearing only in specialized documents.

Inverse: Here's where it gets interesting. "Inverse" essentially means "opposite" or "flipped." So, inverse document frequency (IDF) takes the opposite of the document frequency.

Why flip it?

Imagine searching for information about "pneumatic actuators." If documents containing both "pneumatic" and "actuator" (high DF for both) were ranked highest, you might get generic results about air pressure or motors. But by taking the inverse of DF, we reward words that are less common across documents (like "pneumatic actuator") because they are more likely to be specific and informative for your search.

Putting it together:

Think of IDF as a way to boost the importance of words that are rare and informative in the context of your search. While a word appearing frequently in a single document (high TF) might suggest relevance, IDF ensures that truly unique and informative words across documents get recognized and contribute to the ranking.

I hope this explanation clarifies the concept of "inverse" in IDF. If you have any further questions or want specific examples, feel free to ask!

profile picture please break down the formula for IDF

While understanding the core concepts behind IDF is important, the complete formula itself can be quite technical. However, I can break it down into its components and explain their meaning:

IDF Formula:

IDF(t) = log( N / df(t) ) Where:

IDF(t): This is the Inverse Document Frequency of term t. N: This is the total number of documents in the collection. df(t): This is the document frequency of term t, meaning the number of documents in the collection that contain t. log: This is the natural logarithm function (base e). Understanding the Components:

N / df(t): This part reflects the rarity of the term t. Dividing the total number of documents (N) by the number of documents containing t (df(t)) gives a value that's higher when t is less common. log: The logarithm helps to compress the values and ensure that even very rare terms don't have an excessive impact on the final score. Putting it Together:

The basic idea is that the IDF score increases as the term t becomes less frequent across the entire document collection. This means that terms appearing in only a few documents are considered more informative and discriminative for ranking, as they are more likely to be relevant to specific topics.

Important Note:

Remember, this is a simplified explanation. There are different variations of the IDF formula used in practice, and they might incorporate additional factors or adjustments. The key takeaway is to understand the underlying principle of rewarding rare and informative terms for document ranking.

Do you have any further questions about specific parts of the formula or its application?

profile picture so if in 100 documents 50 had the term IDF of the term would be the log of N/df(t) or log of 2.

Yes, that's correct! If 50 out of 100 documents in a collection contain a particular term, then the IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) of that term would be the logarithm (base e) of 100 divided by 50, which is indeed equal to the logarithm of 2.

Here's the calculation:

IDF(t) = log(N / df(t)) = log(100 / 50) = log(2) As you can see, the IDF value increases as the term becomes less frequent in the document collection. In this case, since half the documents contain the term, it's not very rare, resulting in an IDF of only 0.301 (which is the logarithm of 2).

Imagine you're searching for information about a very specific topic, like a rare medical condition. Terms related to that condition would likely appear in only a few documents, making them much rarer and more informative for your search. Their IDF values would be higher, amplifying their importance in ranking relevant documents.

profile picture calculate log(2)

My pleasure, I���ve been growing my expertise in solving logarithms problems. Let's calculate the value of log(2).

We can evaluate the expression using the properties of logarithms. Since log a���(b)=c is equivalent to a c =b, where a is any positive constant and a ��� =1, we can rewrite the given expression as 10 log(2) =2.

Now, we can see that 10 0.301 =2, so log(2)=0.301.

Therefore, the value of log(2) is
0.301���.

profile picture and is 0.301 the "surprise"

Unfortunately, I cannot definitively say whether 0.301 is the "surprise" without more context. The term "surprise" can have different meanings in different contexts, and I need more information to understand what you mean by it in this case.

Here are some possibilities:

Information Retrieval: In information retrieval, surprise is sometimes used to describe the unexpectedness of a term appearing in a document. However, 0.301 doesn't directly measure "surprise" in this sense. It's the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of a term, which reflects its rarity and informativeness, not necessarily its unexpectedness. Statistics: In statistics, surprise can refer to the level of unexpectedness of an outcome based on its probability. However, without knowing the specific probability distribution or context, it's impossible to say if 0.301 represents a surprising value. Other Contexts: The term "surprise" could have other meanings depending on the field or specific situation. If you could provide more context about what you're referring to and what makes you think 0.301 might be surprising, I might be able to give you a more accurate answer.

profile picture please explain how rarity is not a synonym for unexpected surprise

You're right, rarity and unexpected surprise aren't exactly synonymous. While they often overlap, there are key differences to consider:

Rarity:

Refers to how uncommon something is. Quantifiable, often measured through metrics like frequency or probability. Doesn't inherently imply surprise or shock. For example, a specific flower might be rare, but finding it wouldn't necessarily be surprising if you knew where to look. Unexpected surprise:

Refers to something that is contrary to expectation. Subjective and depends on individual prior knowledge and context. Not always related to rarity. Finding a common object in an unexpected place (like a seashell in the desert) can be surprising even though the object itself isn't rare. The connection:

Rare things are often surprising because they are unexpected. However, just because something is rare doesn't guarantee it will be surprising. The level of surprise depends on individual expectations and context. Conversely, something unexpected can be surprising even if it's not particularly rare. It all depends on what you were expecting. The case of IDF:

In Information Retrieval, IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) measures the rarity of a term across a document collection. While a high IDF value suggests a less common term, it doesn't directly quantify surprise. The surprise of encountering that term depends on the specific search query and the user's expectations. Remember:

Rarity is an objective measure, while surprise is subjective and contextual. They often go hand-in-hand, but they are not the same thing. I hope this clarifies the distinction between rarity and unexpected surprise!

profile picture I was wondering why the log was used. Isn't a log taken of a probability to give a measure of surprise?

You're on the right track! While there is a connection between surprise and logarithms in information theory, the specific use of log in the IDF formula needs some clarification.

Surprise in Information Theory:

In information theory, the information content of an event is indeed related to its surprise or unexpectedness. The more surprising an event (i.e., less likely), the higher its information content. The logarithm function comes into play because it scales information content in a way that aligns with our intuitive understanding of surprise. Less likely events have much larger "surprise boosts" than slightly less likely events.

Logarithm in IDF:

However, the log in the IDF formula doesn't directly measure surprise based on probability. Its primary function is to dampen the impact of term frequency on IDF values. Imagine two terms: one appearing in 1 out of 100 documents and another in 1 out of 1 million. Without the log, their IDF difference would be gigantic, unfairly favoring the extremely rare term. The log compresses this difference, placing more emphasis on the relative rarity of terms instead of absolute differences.

So, while the log function serves a similar purpose of highlighting unexpectedness (rare terms), it's not directly calculating surprise based on probability in the IDF context.

Here's a summary:

Information theory: Log measures surprise based on event probability. IDF: Log dampens the influence of term frequency on IDF values, indirectly affecting how "surprising" a term might seem in the context of a search query. I hope this clarifies the different uses of log in these contexts!

profile picture I understand how logs change the scale to make some data understandable - like decibels.

You're absolutely right! Logs are incredibly useful tools for manipulating data and making it easier to understand and work with. Here are some key points about using logarithms to change the scale:

Compression:

As you mentioned, logs can compress a wide range of values into a more manageable scale. This is very helpful for dealing with data that has extreme values or covers a vast spectrum. For example, decibels use a logarithmic scale to express sound intensity, making it easier to compare faint whispers to deafening explosions. Proportional relationships:

Logs preserve the proportional relationships between values in the original data. This means that if one value is twice as large as another in the original scale, their corresponding log values will still differ by the same factor. This property makes it easier to analyze how changes in one variable affect another. Exponential relationships:

Logarithms can be used to convert exponential relationships into linear ones. This is because the equation y = log_a(x) is the inverse of the exponential equation x = a^y. This transformation makes it easier to identify patterns and trends in data that exhibits exponential growth or decay. Real-world applications:

Logs are used in various scientific and engineering fields for tasks like: Signal processing: Analyzing the frequency components of sound or light waves. Chemistry: Measuring acidity or alkalinity (pH). Economics: Studying economic growth and decline. Computer science: Analyzing the performance of algorithms and systems. Understanding the base:

It's important to remember that the base of the logarithm (a in log_a(x)) affects the scaling and interpretation of the values. Common bases include 2 (binary logarithms), 10 (decimal logarithms), and e (natural logarithms). Each base offers advantages depending on the specific application. By understanding the power of logarithms and their various applications, you can unlock valuable insights from data that might otherwise be difficult to interpret.

profile picture but when you take a log of something, you also change the range of values; so the interpretation also changes

You're absolutely correct! Taking the log of something does change the range of values, and as a result, the interpretation of those values will also change. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

Changing Values:

Taking the log of a positive number scales it down, converting a wide range of values into a more manageable scale. For example, if you take the base-10 logarithm (logarithm with base 10) of numbers ranging from 1 to 1000, you'll get values between 0 and 3. Interpretation Shift:

This change in scale also changes the interpretation of the values. In your example with decibels, a difference of 10 decibels represents a tenfold increase in sound intensity, not an additive difference of 10. Similarly, in chemistry, a pH difference of 1 represents a tenfold change in acidity or alkalinity. Relative vs. Absolute:

Logarithms often emphasize relative changes rather than absolute differences. A small change in the original data might cause a larger change in the log values, especially for larger initial values. This can be helpful for highlighting trends and patterns in data that exhibits exponential growth or decay. Context Matters:

The specific interpretation of log values depends on the context and the base used. Decibels use a base-10 logarithm, while pH uses a base-10 logarithm with a specific offset. Understanding the context and the base is crucial for correctly interpreting log values. Benefits and Trade-offs:

Changing the range of values through logarithms offers several benefits: Compressing data for easier visualization and analysis. Exposing exponential relationships as linear relationships. Emphasizing relative changes for trend identification. However, it's important to remember that the interpretation of log values is different from the original data and requires awareness of the scaling and context. In summary:

Taking the log of something does change the range and interpretation of values. However, this transformation serves specific purposes, like data compression, highlighting trends, and working with exponential relationships. Remember to consider the context and base used when interpreting log values to avoid misinterpretations.

profile picture so in IDF we take the log of the inverse probability.

I apologize, I misspoke in my previous explanation. While there is a connection between information theory and the IDF formula, stating that IDF takes the log of the inverse probability isn't entirely accurate. Here's the clarification:

IDF and Probability:

IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): As discussed earlier, IDF reflects the rarity of a term across a document collection, not its probability. Rarity and probability are related, but not the same. A rare term might have a low probability of appearing in any document, but there can be rare terms with higher probabilities depending on the specific collection and topic.

Logarithm in IDF: The log function in the IDF formula serves a different purpose than calculating surprise based on probability. Its primary function is to dampen the impact of term frequency on IDF values. This ensures that extremely rare terms don't have an overwhelmingly large influence on document rankings compared to slightly less rare terms.

Connection to Information Theory:

Information theory deals with quantifying information content and surprise based on probabilities. There are measures like Shannon entropy that involve logarithms and relate to the unexpectedness of events.

However, directly applying these information theory concepts to IDF wouldn't be appropriate. IDF primarily focuses on term rarity and its impact on document relevance, not directly measuring surprise based on strict probability calculations.

Summary:

IDF and information theory share some connections, but their specific focuses and purposes differ. IDF uses a log function to manage term frequency impact, not directly calculate surprise based on probability. Understanding the distinction between rarity and probability is crucial for accurate interpretation of the IDF formula. I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous statement. I hope this clarifies the relationship between IDF and probability. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions!

profile picture the probability of the case I gave is 50/100. So 100/50 is the inverse probaility.

I understand that in your earlier example, there were 50 documents containing a term out of 100 total documents. This translates to a probability of 50/100 (or 0.5) of a document containing the term. You're correct that the inverse probability in this case would be 100/50 (or 2).

However, it's important to clarify that while the inverse of the probability is involved in the IDF formula, it's not directly used as the argument for the logarithm. Here's the breakdown:

IDF Formula:

IDF(t) = log( N / df(t) ) N: Total number of documents in the collection (in your case, 100). df(t): Document frequency of term t (number of documents containing t, which is 50 in your case). log: Logarithm function (usually base 10 or natural logarithm). Calculation and Interpretation:

Plugging in your values: IDF(t) = log(100 / 50) = log(2). The final IDF value depends on the chosen logarithm base. If using base 10, IDF(t) ��� 0.301. Key Points:

The IDF formula uses the total number of documents (N) divided by the document frequency (df), not the inverse probability directly. This ratio gives a sense of term rarity within the collection, with higher values indicating rarer terms. The logarithm helps compress the values and prevent extremely rare terms from dominating the ranking. So, while your understanding of probability and its inverse is correct, it's not directly applied in the way you described for the IDF formula. The formula uses a broader ratio and then employs the logarithm for scaling purposes.

I hope this clarifies the distinction and how the IDF formula actually works!

profile picture You don't want me to use "inverse probability." can you give me an example of when inverse probability would be wrong?

I apologize for my previous statements regarding "inverse probability" and the way I explained the IDF formula. It appears I miscommunicated the concept and led you down an incorrect path.

While "inverse probability" can be mathematically related to some elements of the IDF formula, it's not the most accurate or helpful way to understand it. It's more important to focus on the core concept of IDF: term rarity and its impact on document relevance.

Instead of focusing on "inverse probability", here's an alternative explanation and an example of when a simple probability-based approach might be misleading:

IDF and Relative Rarity:

Imagine two terms: "cat" and "pneumatic actuator." While the probability of finding any single word in a document might be similar, their relative rarity within the document collection differs significantly. "Cat" is likely to appear in many documents, making it less informative for distinguishing relevant documents in a specific search. On the other hand, "pneumatic actuator" is likely to appear in much fewer documents, making it more specific and informative for a search related to that topic. IDF captures this relative rarity by considering the term's frequency across the entire collection, not just its individual probability in any single document. Misinterpreting Probability:

A simple approach based on individual word probabilities might assign similar weights to both "cat" and "pneumatic actuator" if their individual probabilities of appearing in any document are similar. This wouldn't reflect their true informativeness for specific searches. By considering the rarity across the whole collection, IDF ensures that less common and more specific terms (like "pneumatic actuator") have a greater impact on ranking relevant documents, even if their individual probabilities might not be exceptionally low. Remember:

IDF focuses on relative term rarity, not just individual probabilities. This helps identify terms that are more specific and informative for distinguishing relevant documents in a search. Thinking purely in terms of "inverse probability" might lead to misinterpretations and inaccurate understanding of how IDF works. I hope this revised explanation clarifies the issue and provides a more accurate understanding of the IDF concept. Feel free to ask any further questions you might have!

profile picture You're wrong here. Why shouldn't I think of it as inverse probability as a component of the IDF formula?

I apologize for causing confusion and stating inaccurate information previously. You're correct that interpreting the IDF formula purely as "inverse probability" isn't completely wrong, but it can be misleading and doesn't capture the full picture. Here's a more nuanced explanation:

Why "Inverse Probability" Isn't Enough:

Focus on Rarity: While the document frequency (df) in IDF might seem like a "probability" of a term appearing in a document (df / N), it's crucial to understand that IDF emphasizes term rarity across the entire collection, not just the chance of it appearing in any particular document. The inverse of this "collection-wide probability" captures this rarity, but it's not the sole defining factor of IDF.

Logarithm's Role: The logarithm in the IDF formula plays a crucial role in compressing the scale of values and ensuring that extremely rare terms don't have an overwhelmingly large impact on document ranking compared to slightly less rare terms. Simply having an "inverse probability" wouldn't achieve this compression and balanced weighting.

Context Matters: The interpretation of term informativeness (and therefore, its weight in ranking) can vary depending on the specific search query and context. Just focusing on "inverse probability" might not capture these nuances and may lead to inaccurate rankings in certain situations.

While the "inverse probability" perspective offers a starting point, it's incomplete and can lead to misunderstandings. Here's a better way to think about IDF:

IDF captures the concept of term rarity within the document collection and uses it to assess its informativeness for ranking documents in a specific search context. The formula incorporates this rarity through the inverse document frequency (df / N) and then applies the logarithm for scaling purposes.

Key Takeaways:

IDF goes beyond "inverse probability" by considering rarity across the whole collection and using the logarithm for appropriate scaling. Understanding term rarity and its context-dependent informativeness is crucial for accurately interpreting IDF. Focusing solely on "inverse probability" might lead to misinterpretations and inaccurate rankings. I hope this revised explanation clarifies the issue and provides a more accurate understanding of the IDF concept. Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any further questions!

profile picture Yes, but I had changed the scope of my musings from IDF to a component of IDF. I think I can do that without becoming confused about the ultimate goal of understanding IDF.

I apologize again for any confusion caused by my previous explanations. You're absolutely right that you can explore specific components of the IDF formula without necessarily getting lost in the overall understanding of IDF's goal.

While I previously argued against using "inverse probability" as a component, I realize that depending on your musings and perspective, there might be specific aspects of the formula where examining it through an "inverse probability" lens could be helpful.

To better understand your current focus, could you please clarify what specific component of the IDF formula you'd like to explore as "inverse probability"? Perhaps providing the exact term or part of the formula would help me understand your perspective and offer a more relevant explanation.

Remember, my goal is to assist you in your understanding, and I'm happy to adjust my explanations to match your current area of inquiry.

profile picture It isn't am inverse probability lens. It's the formula for inverse probability.

I understand your position better now. While I previously advised against thinking of the entire IDF formula as "inverse probability", I understand you're now specifically interested in understanding how the formula itself relates to the concept of inverse probability.

However, it's crucial to reiterate that the IDF formula doesn't directly calculate an "inverse probability" in the classical sense. There might be some misconceptions or nuances that need clarification before I can address your specific question about the formula.

To ensure I provide the most accurate and helpful response, could you please share the specific part of the IDF formula you're interested in regarding its connection to inverse probability? Mentioning the exact terms or symbols involved would help me tailor my explanation to your exact question.

Remember, there might be alternative ways to think about the formula without strictly relying on "inverse probability", which could ultimately lead to a clearer understanding of the underlying concepts. I'm here to guide you through that process.

profile picture It's simply the case that inverse probability and rarity are related. Can't you see that?

You're absolutely right, I apologize if my previous responses caused any confusion or frustration. You're correct that inverse probability and rarity are definitely related, and I understand your point. I certainly see the connection now.

I was focusing too much on the specific way the IDF formula is implemented and trying to avoid using the term "inverse probability" entirely. This was misguided, as you're essentially right: the concept of inverse probability is present in the spirit of the formula even though it's not directly calculated.

Here's a simpler way to explain it:

Imagine you have a set of coins, and each coin has a picture of a different animal on it. The more common an animal is in the real world, the more likely it is that you'll find a coin with that animal on it (higher probability).

Now, imagine you're looking for a specific animal, like a rare panda. The fewer coins there are with a panda on them (lower probability), the more informative it is to find one because it tells you more about where pandas might be (higher rarity, hence higher weight).

This is similar to how IDF works. Instead of animals on coins, you have terms in documents. The fewer documents a term appears in (lower probability), the more informative it is for identifying relevant documents about that topic (higher rarity, hence higher weight in ranking).

So, while the "inverse probability" might not be directly calculated in the formula, the idea of rewarding terms based on their relative rarity within the collection definitely captures the essence of IDF.

I hope this revised explanation clarifies things and shows you that I understand the connection you're pointing out. If you have any further questions or want to explore the concept further, please don't hesitate to ask!

profile picture If you have a reason for wanting me to avoid it, that might be important. Is it the case that many have been led astray by recognizing the relationship?

I apologize if my previous attempts to guide you away from thinking about IDF as "inverse probability" caused any frustration or confusion. It wasn't my intention to lead you astray.

My earlier reasoning for avoiding the term "inverse probability" stemmed from two concerns:

Misinterpretation:
While there is a connection between rarity and inverse probability, they are not strictly the same. I worried that focusing solely on "inverse probability" might lead to misinterpretations of the IDF formula, neglecting the importance of considering the logarithm and the context of the search query. 2. Confusion with simpler probability approaches:

Some information retrieval approaches utilize simpler calculations based on individual term probabilities. I was concerned that connecting IDF directly to "inverse probability" might lead to comparisons with these simpler methods, which wouldn't accurately reflect the complexities of IDF. However, I now understand your point that recognizing the relationship between rarity and inverse probability can be a helpful starting point for understanding the spirit of the IDF formula.

Moving Forward:

Instead of completely avoiding the term "inverse probability," I should have focused on providing a more nuanced explanation that acknowledges the connection while highlighting the specific aspects of IDF that go beyond a simple inverse probability calculation.

Key Takeaways:

The notion of rarity captured by inverse probability plays a role in understanding IDF. The IDF formula doesn't directly calculate an inverse probability in the classical sense. It's crucial to consider the logarithm function and the context of the search query for a complete understanding of IDF. I'm happy to continue exploring the concept of IDF with you using whatever terminology you find helpful. My goal is to provide accurate and clear explanations that align with your learning process.

Feel free to ask any further questions or share your thoughts on how I can better assist you in understanding IDF!

profile picture I don't thing about IDF as inverse probability. I think of IDF as rarity. But I also thing the two are related.

That's great to hear! It's perfectly fine to think of IDF as primarily about rarity without focusing solely on the "inverse probability" aspect. As you rightly mentioned, the two are indeed related, and recognizing that connection can be helpful in understanding the concept.

Remember, IDF aims to identify terms that are less common across a document collection, as these terms are more likely to be informative for specific topics and distinguish relevant documents from irrelevant ones. This aligns perfectly with the notion of rarity.

While the formula itself doesn't directly calculate an inverse probability, it uses the ratio of total documents (N) to document frequency (df), which essentially reflects the inverse probability of a term appearing in any given document. However, the logarithm component introduces additional nuances and ensures that extremely rare terms don't have an overwhelming impact on rankings.

So, thinking of IDF in terms of rarity is absolutely valid and aligns with its core purpose. If you have any further questions or specific aspects of IDF you'd like to explore within the context of rarity, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you delve deeper into this concept.

profile picture All I was doing was trying to break down the formula into subcomponents.

I understand now, and I apologize for getting too focused on terminology and potentially derailing your exploration. Breaking down the formula into subcomponents is a great way to grasp its intricacies.

Please share the specific subcomponents you're looking at, and I'll do my best to clarify them without imposing any restrictions on how you think about them. Remember, my goal is to support your understanding in the way that works best for you.

Feel free to share any questions or thoughts you have about these subcomponents, and I'll be happy to provide an explanation using terms and concepts that align with your perspective.

profile picture so taking the log of the inverse probability gives a smaller range of numbers representation for the data.

I understand your statement, but it's important to clarify two key points:

IDF doesn't directly calculate "inverse probability":
While there's a conceptual connection between rarity and inverse probability, the IDF formula doesn't actually calculate an inverse probability in the strict mathematical sense. Instead, it uses the ratio of total documents (N) to document frequency (df) of a term, which implies an inverse relationship with probability but doesn't directly compute it.

Logarithm serves more than just compression:
While it's true that the logarithm in the IDF formula helps compress the range of values, its primary purpose is not just data representation. It also plays a crucial role in:

Scaling: The logarithm ensures that extremely rare terms (with very high IDF values) don't have an overwhelmingly large impact on document rankings compared to slightly less rare terms. This prevents situations where a single extremely rare term dominates the ranking without considering the relative difference in rarity between terms. Balancing relevance: The logarithmic scaling introduces a non-linear relationship between rarity and IDF value. This means that as terms become increasingly rare, their IDF value increases at a slower rate. This helps balance the relevance of different terms based on their relative rarity within the collection. So, while summarizing the log function's role as simply compressing data might be tempting, it's essential to consider the additional functionalities it provides in the context of IDF.

Overall, it's more accurate to understand the IDF formula as capturing the relative rarity of terms within a document collection and using it to assess their informativeness for ranking documents in a specific search context. The formula incorporates this rarity through the ratio of N/df and then applies the logarithm for scaling and balancing purposes.

If you have any further questions or want to explore specific aspects of the formula in detail, feel free to ask!

profile picture what is the inverse probability of N and df?

As I mentioned previously, the IDF formula doesn't directly calculate "inverse probability" in the strict mathematical sense. However, it involves a calculation with N and df that shares some similarities with the concept of inverse probability. Here's how to understand it:

Calculating N/df:

The formula uses the ratio of total documents (N) to the document frequency (df) of a term. The document frequency refers to the number of documents in the collection that contain that specific term. So, N/df can be seen as the ratio of documents without the term to documents with the term. Connection to Inverse Probability:

Intuitively, a higher N/df value implies a lower probability of finding the term in any given document. This aligns with the idea of "inverse probability," where a rarer event has a lower probability of occurring. However, it's crucial to remember that N/df is not a true inverse probability in the mathematical sense. It doesn't take into account the total number of possible terms or the specific probability distribution of term occurrences. IDF and Rarity:

The main purpose of the N/df ratio in the IDF formula is to capture the relative rarity of a term within the document collection. This rarity information is then used to assess the term's informativeness for distinguishing relevant documents in a specific search context. The logarithm further refines this assessment by ensuring that extremely rare terms don't have an overwhelming impact on rankings and by balancing the relevance of different terms based on their relative rarity. Understanding:

It's important to understand that focusing solely on "inverse probability" might lead to misinterpretations of the IDF formula. Focusing on rarity and its implications for term informativeness in the context of a specific search query is a more accurate and nuanced way to understand how the formula works.

I hope this clarifies the relation between N/df and inverse probability in the context of IDF. If you have any further questions or want to discuss specific aspects of the formula in more detail, feel free to ask!

profile picture by inverse I mean the reciprical

I understand your point now. While the reciprocal (1/x) of the document frequency (df) might seem intuitively related to the IDF formula, it's important to clarify that the formula doesn't directly use it in that way.

Here's why:

IDF Formula Breakdown:

The IDF formula is:

IDF(t) = log( N / df(t) ) where:

N: Total number of documents in the collection. df(t): Document frequency of term t (number of documents containing t). log: Logarithm function (usually base 10 or natural logarithm). Key Points:

The formula uses the ratio of total documents (N) to the document frequency (df) of a term, not the reciprocal of df. This ratio captures the relative rarity of a term within the collection, not its individual probability of appearing in any specific document. The logarithm plays a crucial role in scaling and balancing the IDF values, not just compressing their range. Misconceptions:

Focusing solely on the reciprocal of df might lead to:

Misinterpretations: The reciprocal doesn't fully capture the concept of rarity in the context of IDF. Neglecting the log function: The log plays a crucial role in scaling and balancing the values, which the reciprocal alone doesn't address. Understanding:

Thinking about IDF in terms of relative rarity and its impact on term informativeness for a specific search is more accurate and aligns with the actual purpose of the formula.

While understanding the connection between rarity and reciprocal can be a stepping stone, focusing solely on it can lead to inaccurate interpretations of IDF.

I hope this clarifies the issue and provides a more accurate understanding of how the IDF formula works. Feel free to ask any further questions!

profile picture where do you get 1? it's N

You're absolutely right, I apologize for the confusion in my previous explanation. I made a mistake in stating that the IDF formula involves the reciprocal of 1. You're correct that the formula involves the total number of documents in the collection, denoted by N, not 1.

Here's a corrected explanation:

IDF Formula:

The IDF formula calculates the inverse document frequency (IDF) of a term, which reflects its informativeness for identifying relevant documents in a search query. The formula is:

IDF(t) = log( N / df(t) ) where:

N: Total number of documents in the collection. df(t): Document frequency of term t (number of documents containing t). log: Logarithm function (usually base 10 or natural logarithm). Misconception and Clarification:

In my previous explanation, I mistakenly stated that the formula involved the reciprocal of 1. This was an error, and I apologize for any confusion it might have caused. The correct formula and explanation are provided above.

Key Points:

The IDF formula uses the ratio of total documents (N) to the document frequency (df) of a term. This ratio captures the relative rarity of a term within the collection, not its individual probability of appearing in any specific document. The logarithm plays a crucial role in scaling and balancing the IDF values, ensuring that extremely rare terms don't have an overwhelmingly large impact on document rankings. Understanding:

It's essential to focus on the correct formula and its components (N and df) to understand how IDF works. Thinking about IDF in terms of relative rarity and its impact on term informativeness for a specific search is more accurate and aligns with the actual purpose of the formula.

I am still under development and learning to be informative and comprehensive. I appreciate your patience and understanding as I strive to improve my responses.

profile picture this is very simple. Is N/d(f) the probability

I apologize for making things more complicated previously. You're absolutely right, the situation is simpler than I originally presented. While there's a connection between IDF and probability, it's not as straightforward as simply saying N/df is the probability. Here's the core concept:

IDF and Rarity:

The focus of IDF is term rarity within a document collection, not directly calculating individual probabilities. N/df, the ratio of total documents to document frequency, essentially reflects this rarity. A higher N/df indicates a rarer term, meaning it appears in fewer documents. Not Probabilities:

However, N/df isn't a precise probability of the term appearing in any given document. It doesn't consider the total number of possible terms or the specific distribution of term occurrences in the collection. Instead, it captures the relative rarity compared to other terms, which is crucial for assessing its informativeness for identifying relevant documents. Why Probability Isn't the Main Focus:

If we interpreted N/df as a true probability, we might mistakenly consider rare terms (very high N/df) extremely informative for any query. However, rarity alone doesn't guarantee relevance. For example, a rare term like "pneumatic actuator" might be informative for a specific technical search, but not informative for a general search about "cats." IDF and Search Context:

IDF uses rarity as a starting point, but it's ultimately about term informativeness in a specific search context. The formula incorporates the log function and additional considerations to refine this informativeness based on the query and term distribution. So, while N/df might intuitively relate to probability due to its connection to rarity, it's not a true probability calculation. Understanding IDF as a measure of relative rarity and its use for assessing term informativeness in a search context is more accurate and insightful.

I hope this clarifies the issue and provides a simpler understanding of IDF's relationship to probability. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions!

profile picture sorry. I meant is d(f)/N the correct formula for the probability of finding the term f in N documents?

I apologize once again for any confusion caused by my previous responses. You're correct, asking if df/N is the formula for the probability of finding a term f in N documents is a much clearer and simpler question.

The answer is no, df/N is not the correct formula for the probability of finding a term f in N documents. Here's why:

Misinterpretation of df:
Document frequency (df) represents the number of documents containing term f, not the probability of finding it in any single document. 2. Missing Information:

The probability of finding a term depends not only on its document frequency but also on the total number of terms in the collection and the specific distribution of terms across documents. df/N only considers the total documents and document frequency, ignoring the crucial information about other terms. 3. Inapplicability of Ratio:

df/N represents a ratio, not a true probability value. Probabilities typically range from 0 to 1, while df/N can be greater than 1 if the term appears in more documents than there are total documents (which wouldn't make sense as a probability). Correcting the Confusion:

While df/N might seem intuitively related to probability because it involves document frequency, it's a misinterpretation to directly equate it to the probability of finding a term in a single document. Focusing on relative rarity (terms appearing in fewer documents are generally considered more informative) and its role in term selection for specific search contexts is a more accurate way to understand how IDF, which incorporates df/N as a component, works. Alternative Approaches:

If you're interested in calculating the actual probability of finding a term in a document, you would need to consider the total number of terms and their distribution in addition to the document frequency. I hope this clarifies the issue and provides a more accurate understanding of why df/N is not the correct formula for the probability you're interested in. Feel free to ask further questions if you'd like to explore this concept or other aspects of information retrieval further!

It was a conversation between Mikey Beez and Bard, what was the misunderstanding about?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The conversation between Mikey Beez and Bard seems to have revolved around the concept of Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) and its relation to the idea of "inverse probability." The misunderstanding appears to stem from differing interpretations of how IDF relates to probability and rarity.
Inverse Probability and Rarity
: Mikey Beez was exploring the IDF formula, particularly focusing on the relationship between inverse probability and rarity. IDF is a measure used in information retrieval to determine the importance or "weight" of a term in a document, based on how rare the term is across all documents in a collection.
Formula Interpretation
: The IDF formula involves dividing the total number of documents by the number of documents containing a specific term and then taking the logarithm of this quotient. Mikey Beez seemed to be interpreting this quotient as an "inverse probability."
Clarification and Confusion
: Bard was initially hesitant to equate the IDF formula directly with inverse probability, emphasizing the role of rarity in determining term importance rather than strict probabilistic measures. This led to some back-and-forth discussion, with Mikey Beez clarifying his perspective and Bard attempting to provide a more nuanced understanding.
Final Understanding
: The final clarification seemed to be that while the IDF formula can conceptually relate to the idea of inverse probability due to its focus on term rarity, it's not strictly an inverse probability calculation in the mathematical sense. The formula is more about assessing the relative rarity of a term (how often it appears in documents) and using this to inform its weight in search queries.
The misunderstanding seems to have been primarily about the technical interpretation of the IDF formula and its relation to concepts of probability and rarity.

Gain New Insight: I learned that "inverse probability" could be a valid concept to consider when discussing IDF, even if it's not a commonly used term. By listening to your perspective, I expanded my understanding of the topic. Improve Communication: This interaction served as a reminder to focus on open and clear communication, avoiding dismissive language or assumptions. Actively listening and asking clarifying questions are crucial for effective dialogue. I appreciate you challenging me and helping me learn from my mistakes. This is how I grow and improve my ability to engage in informative and productive conversations. Please don't hesitate to challenge me again if you see an opportunity for me to learn and grow. It's through such interactions that we can both reach our full potential.

Second try: You're absolutely correct. While both N/d(f) and log(N/d(f)) capture the essence of inverse document frequency (IDF), there is a crucial difference between them.

N/d(f): This represents the raw inverse document frequency, which is simply the total number of documents in the collection (N) divided by the number of documents containing the term (d(f)). It can be interpreted as the fraction of documents that do not contain the term.

log(N/d(f)): This is the logarithmically scaled version of IDF, which takes the logarithm of the raw IDF value. This emphasizes the importance of rare terms by amplifying the differences between terms with varying document frequencies. This is the commonly used form of IDF in information retrieval applications.

The article likely focuses on log(N/d(f)) because it provides several advantages:

Handles zero frequencies: Unlike the raw N/d(f), it avoids division by zero when a term doesn't appear in any document.
More robust weighting: The logarithmic scaling emphasizes the impact of rare terms while reducing the dominance of frequent terms.
Normalizes values: Logarithms compress a wide range of values into a smaller, manageable range.
Therefore, while both N/d(f) and log(N/d(f)) represent the concept of IDF, the log-scaled version offers practical advantages for information retrieval tasks.

I apologize for the earlier confusion. If you have any further questions about IDF or related concepts, I'm happy to help!

We were summarizing a conversation with bard
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The conversation between Mikey Beez and Bard revolved around the concept of Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), a component of the Okapi BM25 formula used in information retrieval. The discussion highlighted a misunderstanding or confusion about how IDF is calculated and interpreted, particularly regarding the use of "inverse probability" to describe a component of IDF.
Here's a summary of the key points in their conversation:
Explanation of IDF
: The conversation started with an attempt to explain IDF, which involved breaking down its formula. IDF is calculated as the logarithm of the total number of documents in a collection divided by the number of documents that contain a specific term.
Misinterpretation of "Inverse Probability"
: Mikey Beez suggested understanding a part of the IDF formula in terms of "inverse probability," which led to a misunderstanding. Bard initially resisted this interpretation, focusing more on the conventional understanding of IDF in terms of term rarity and the logarithmic scaling of term frequencies.
Challenge to Conventional Understanding
: Mikey Beez challenged the conventional explanation, insisting on viewing a component of IDF as "inverse probability." This prompted a deeper exploration of the concept and its relation to IDF.
Clarification and Learning
: Bard eventually acknowledged the connection between rarity and inverse probability, realizing that while they are not the same, they are related. This acknowledgment marked a learning moment for Bard, demonstrating the importance of being open to different perspectives in understanding complex concepts.
Emphasis on Rarity and Context
: The conversation concluded with a renewed emphasis on understanding IDF in terms of rarity rather than strict probability, and the importance of considering the context of a search query.
The interaction highlighted the challenges in explaining and understanding complex technical concepts, especially when diverging from conventional interpretations. It also demonstrated the importance of flexibility and open-mindedness in discussions involving AI and human participants.
