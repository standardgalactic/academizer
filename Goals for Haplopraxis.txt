It is a single shard world but by random chance alone people get very separated since physical directions are mapped onto parameter spaces like word2vec. In order to interact with another player you need to find their location, which is only possible if they have recorded and published a walkthrough of how they got there, left and right, North and South may look functionally equivalent but they take you to a different parameter space, which is mapped onto a colorwheel based Cmb projection point. The other way is to press the g key (global reset for all players) for too long, it will reset the game / operating system and broadcast a red beacon the other players can see and they can find your region of space and build minefields around your planets and Dyson spheres around your stars, which will contain the effects of your global reset (Game over) button.
