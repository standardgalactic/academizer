I wanted to discuss unrealistic plot points in the movie The beast from 20,000 fathoms
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" is a classic science fiction film from the 1950s that involves some notable unrealistic plot points, a common trait in movies of its genre and era. Let's discuss a few of these elements:
Prehistoric Creature Revival
: The film's central premise involves the awakening of a prehistoric creature, the Rhedosaurus, by nuclear bomb testing. In reality, the chance of a dormant prehistoric creature surviving for millions of years and then being revived is scientifically implausible.
Radioactivity Effects
: The movie suggests that nuclear radiation can revive or mutate ancient creatures. In reality, radiation exposure is more likely to cause damage or death to living organisms rather than reviving or significantly altering them.
Creature's Size and Physiology
: The Rhedosaurus, like many monsters in 50s sci-fi, is depicted as an enormous, aggressive creature. The logistical challenges of an animal of such size—like its dietary needs, movement, and structural support—are generally overlooked in the film.
Destruction and Combat
: The film shows the creature rampaging through a city and being difficult to stop. While this makes for dramatic visuals, the practicalities of such a scenario—like military response, evacuation, and public safety—are often simplified or exaggerated for dramatic effect.
Scientific Response
: The way scientists and authorities handle the creature's threat often leans towards the dramatic rather than realistic, with solutions and strategies that might not align with real-world crisis management.
These elements, while unrealistic, are part of what gives classic sci-fi its charm and appeal. They reflect the era's fascination with nuclear technology and prehistoric life, as well as a desire for spectacle over scientific accuracy.

Ok the movie does not use the word dinosaur but yet they look through charts and drawings and go to interview eye-witnesses. It makes you wonder because they act like are being very thorough but it comes off as kindergarteners play-acting
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your observation highlights an interesting aspect of "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" and similar vintage science fiction films. The filmmakers often aimed to create a sense of scientific legitimacy and thoroughness, but with limited knowledge or resources, the result could sometimes feel simplistic or naive to modern audiences.
"Scientific" Investigation
: The characters in the movie engage in what is portrayed as scientific investigation, like examining charts and interviewing eyewitnesses. However, their methods and conclusions can seem overly simplistic or theatrical, reflecting a less sophisticated understanding of science compared to today's standards.
Dramatic License Over Accuracy
: The filmmakers were more focused on storytelling and spectacle than on scientific accuracy. This approach often led to scenes where the characters' actions resemble a child's interpretation of how scientists work, rather than a realistic portrayal.
Era-Specific Representation of Science
: The representation of scientific investigation in these older films is also a product of its time. During the 1950s, the general public's understanding of science was more limited, and the dramatic representation of science in films was less scrutinized for accuracy.
Suspension of Disbelief
: Films like this often require a suspension of disbelief from the audience. They are not meant to be realistic portrayals of science or nature, but rather, they are meant to entertain and captivate with extraordinary scenarios.
Cultural and Historical Context
: It's also important to view these films within their cultural and historical context. They reflect the fears, fascinations, and scientific understanding of their time, offering a window into the era's popular culture and public psyche.
In summary, while "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" and similar films try to portray a thorough scientific process, they do so in a way that might seem rudimentary or overly dramatic to modern viewers. This portrayal is part of the film's charm and reflects the era's approach to science fiction storytelling.

Here's a line from the movie:

You know Lee, there's something very compensating in having to wait 30 years for a holiday - because when it finally comes the joy of anticipation is multiplied by just that many years.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
This line from "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" reflects a sentiment that's quite profound and relatable. It speaks to the value of patience and how long-awaited events or experiences can feel more rewarding due to the anticipation built over time. Let's break down the meaning and implications of this quote:
Value of Anticipation
: The character suggests that the joy of anticipation is an integral part of the experience. Waiting for something, especially for a significant period like 30 years, can make the eventual realization of that experience feel much more satisfying and meaningful.
Patience and Reward
: The line also touches on the theme of patience. In a fast-paced world, where instant gratification is often the norm, this quote reminds us of the deeper satisfaction that can come from patiently waiting and working towards a goal or a dream.
Reflective and Philosophical Tone
: This quote adds a reflective and somewhat philosophical tone to the movie. It suggests a deeper layer of thought beyond the primary plot of a monster movie, offering a moment of introspection and wisdom.
Contrast with the Film's Theme
: In a film that primarily deals with action, suspense, and science fiction elements, such a line provides a contrast, offering a moment of quiet contemplation amidst the excitement and drama.
Resonance with Life Experiences
: The sentiment expressed in this quote can resonate with many life experiences, where long-awaited achievements, reunions, or milestones often feel more profound due to the time and effort invested in reaching them.
In essence, this line from the movie offers a moment of introspection and a reminder of the joys and rewards that come with patience and the passage of time. It's a nice example of how even a science fiction film can weave in universal themes and emotions that resonate with viewers on a deeper level.

The plot contains numerous elements that have gone on to become monster movie clichés, including the earnest young scientist whose warnings go unheeded (Christian), the older scientist who obstinately rejects the evidence (Cecil Kellaway), the romantic subplot between the earnest young scientist and the clear-eyed woman who believes and advocates for him, the monster's destructive rampage through populated areas, the military's failed attempt to combat it with conventional means and the eventual discovery of a vulnerability through which to defeat it.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The plot of "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" indeed established several elements that have become clichés in the monster movie genre. These include:
The Earnest Young Scientist
: The character of Christian, who is the young scientist whose warnings about the monster are initially ignored.
The Older, Skeptical Scientist
: Cecil Kellaway portrays an older scientist who obstinately rejects evidence of the monster's existence, a common trope in such films.
Romantic Subplot
: The film features a romantic subplot involving the earnest young scientist and a clear-eyed woman who believes in and advocates for him.
Monster's Rampage
: A hallmark of the genre, the film showcases the monster's destructive rampage through populated areas, creating chaos and destruction.
Military's Failed Attempts
: The plot includes the military's unsuccessful efforts to stop the monster using conventional means, another frequent element in monster movies.
Discovery of a Vulnerability
: The story concludes with the discovery of a specific vulnerability that allows the characters to finally defeat the monster​
​.
These elements, which might seem formulaic now, were fresher at the time of the film's release and contributed to the development of the monster movie genre. The film's blend of scientific intrigue, romantic drama, and thrilling monster action set a template that many later films in the genre would follow.

It makes me think that the movie not about actual monsters but about the unreliability of memory and imagination.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your interpretation of "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" as a metaphor for the unreliability of memory and imagination is an intriguing one. While the film on the surface is a classic monster movie, it can also be seen as a commentary on how people perceive and remember extraordinary events:
Unreliable Memory
: The film's unfolding events, like the sightings of the creature, could be interpreted as a metaphor for how memory can distort reality, especially when it comes to recalling extraordinary or traumatic experiences.
Power of Imagination
: The monster itself, a product of scientific imagination in the film, can be seen as a symbol of how imagination can create realities that, while not physically real, have significant impact on perception and behavior.
Subjectivity of Experience
: The different reactions of the characters to the monster, from disbelief to fear, might represent the subjective nature of human experience and how different individuals can interpret the same event in vastly different ways.
Interplay of Fear and Reality
: The film also explores the theme of fear and how it can shape one's perception of reality. The monster, as a manifestation of fear, challenges the characters' understanding of what is real and what is imagined.
This interpretative layer adds depth to the film, suggesting that it's not just about a literal monster, but also about the metaphorical 'monsters' of memory and imagination that can distort human perception and understanding.

They way they are so certain that it is this creature that lived was a Rhedosaurus, that it lived 100 million years ago, because of eye witness testimony and a sketch. More dialogue from the movie:

Didn't professor Edmunds write a paper on that just last year? Yes. Yes.  If we could only be sure, without a shadow of a doubt. Dr. Elzen, what further proof do you need?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The dialogue you've mentioned from "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" further illustrates the theme of the unreliability of memory and knowledge. The characters' certainty about the creature's identity based on limited evidence—eye-witness testimony and a sketch—reflects a broader commentary on how people often form conclusions with insufficient proof. This exchange encapsulates the tension between scientific desire for absolute certainty and the often ambiguous nature of evidence, especially in extraordinary situations. Such scenes highlight the challenges in discerning truth from myth, especially in a world where fantastical events start to unfold.
You
Another line: there have been all kinds of stories, stories of sea serpents, stories of the world coming to an end, stories of flying saucers.

ChatGPT
This line from "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" reflects on the human tendency to create and believe in extraordinary stories, like those of sea serpents, apocalyptic events, or flying saucers. It points to the fascination with the unknown and the fantastical, a common theme in science fiction and monster movies. This dialogue could be seen as a nod to the power of myths and legends in human culture, and how they often reflect deeper fears, hopes, and curiosities. The film, through such lines, subtly comments on the nature of storytelling and the human inclination towards the mysterious and unexplained.

I heard HG Wells got paid 2,000 bucks for one of his short stories which got made into one of the scenes
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Indeed, H.G. Wells was not directly involved in "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms." It was Ray Bradbury's short story about a dinosaur destroying a lighthouse that was adapted into the film. Bradbury received an offer of $2,000 for the film rights to this story. Following the sale, the movie's title was changed to "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms," and Bradbury later renamed his story "The Fog Horn"​
​.
This adaptation process reflects the common practice in the film industry of transforming literary works into cinematic productions, often with changes in titles and details to suit the medium and audience expectations.

Apparently it was stop motion, the roars are actually a large cat
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, the special effects in "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms," particularly the depiction of the monster, were achieved using stop-motion animation. This technique was a hallmark of special effects in early sci-fi and fantasy films. The roar of the monster being created from the sounds of a large cat is another example of the innovative and creative methods used in filmmaking at that time to bring fantastical elements to life. These techniques contributed significantly to the charm and enduring appeal of classic monster movies.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
This scene from "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" showcases a mix of seriousness and light-heartedness that's characteristic of many classic science fiction films. The dialogue captures the tension between the urgency of the situation and the skepticism often faced by characters who are aware of an impending threat. The playful banter, especially the quip about "standing on my head," adds a touch of humor to the otherwise tense narrative, balancing the film's dramatic elements with moments of levity. This blend of tones is part of what makes these older films engaging and memorable.
You
Yeah it I think it is too broad to ask for reports of anything unusual or unexplained
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Indeed, asking for reports of "anything unusual or unexplained" is quite broad and could encompass a vast range of incidents. In a real-world context, such a request could lead to an overwhelming amount of information, much of which might be irrelevant to the specific inquiry. However, in the context of a movie like "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms," this kind of broad request serves to advance the plot by indicating the character's search for any sign of the extraordinary events they suspect are occurring. It adds to the sense of mystery and uncertainty that drives the narrative forward.
You
Yeah I kind of think the writers and actors aren't even aware of it. They don't seem to act like there is anything ironic or unusual about the level hyperbole. The consider themselves very scientific and restrained, he is questioning his superior are you on the the level seems to me equivalent to are you out of your mind, it's clear he doesn't want to investigate the accident, it's only from my perspective as a viewer living 70 years later thinking this would bring back an overwhelming amount of data and spurious results that aren't relevant.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your perspective highlights a common aspect of older films like "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms," where the dialogue and actions of characters might not fully align with modern views on science and investigation. The characters, being products of their time, often don't exhibit awareness of the hyperbole or irony in their statements. The phrase "are you on the level" indeed reflects skepticism, yet the character's reluctance to investigate broadly might not account for the modern understanding of data overload or relevance. This discrepancy between the film's context and contemporary perspectives adds an interesting layer to watching and analyzing classic cinema.

Now they are investigating the ocean floor by descending in a diving bell.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The use of a diving bell to investigate the ocean floor in "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" is another example of how the film incorporates elements of adventure and exploration into its narrative. Diving bells were, historically, one of the earliest methods of exploring underwater environments. Including such a scene adds a sense of realism and scientific exploration to the film, despite its fantastical elements. It's a nod to the spirit of discovery and the lengths to which the characters go to understand and confront the unknown threat. Such scenes contribute to the film's blend of science fiction, adventure, and suspense.

The inclusion of a thermos with coffee, along with sightings of octopuses and sharks during the diving bell scene in "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms," adds a touch of everyday reality and maritime atmosphere to the scene. It's these small, relatable details that can enhance the viewer's immersion into the story, balancing the extraordinary elements of the plot with more familiar, down-to-earth aspects. This mix of the mundane and the fantastical is a key aspect of effective storytelling in science fiction and adventure genres.

Watching an ironic remix with comedic commentary and a narrator who points out flaws can definitely influence how you perceive "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms." This type of presentation, often found in formats like Mystery Science Theater 3000 or similar shows, adds a layer of humor and critique that can change the way the original film is experienced. It highlights and often exaggerates the movie's more absurd or dated elements, leading to a viewing experience that is more about enjoying the commentary and the humor derived from the film's quirks and inconsistencies, rather than taking the film's narrative and scientific portrayals at face value.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" contains several elements that can be seen as ironic, especially from a modern perspective:
Advanced Technology vs. Primitive Monster
: The irony of advanced scientific endeavors, like nuclear testing, inadvertently reviving a prehistoric creature.
Human Arrogance
: The film showcases human arrogance in believing they can control nature or the outcomes of their scientific experiments, only to face unforeseen consequences.
Misplaced Priorities
: Characters in the film often prioritize personal or bureaucratic concerns over the imminent danger of the monster, reflecting a common human tendency to overlook serious issues.
Science vs. Myth
: The film blurs the line between scientific exploration and mythical creatures, creating an ironic contrast between the two.
Military Might vs. Nature
: The irony in the military's inability to defeat the creature using conventional weapons, highlighting the limitations of human technology against natural forces.
These elements add layers of meaning and complexity to the film, making it more than just a simple monster movie.

Death by Adaptation: The Beast itself. In the short story that the film was inspired by, it survives and goes back to the sea peacefully.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept of "Death by Adaptation" applies to "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms," where the film's ending differs significantly from the original short story it was inspired by. In Ray Bradbury's story, the creature returns to the sea peacefully, while in the film adaptation, the creature meets its demise. This change reflects a common practice in film adaptations where story elements are altered for dramatic effect or to align better with cinematic storytelling conventions. The film's choice to have the creature die instead of returning to the sea adds a definitive conclusion to its narrative, which is often favored in movie adaptations.

The analogies are very overblown. While they are firing at the beast, they are standing in front of a gift shop, advertising China and porcelain, as if to reference the bull in a chinashop metaphor.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The scene you describe from "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms," where characters fire at the beast while standing in front of a gift shop selling China and porcelain, does seem to play into the "bull in a china shop" metaphor. This setting choice can be seen as an overblown or on-the-nose analogy to the creature's destructive rampage, akin to a bull causing chaos in a delicate environment. Such visual metaphors, while perhaps heavy-handed, add a layer of symbolic meaning to the scene and contribute to the film's overall dramatic and thematic impact.
You
So do you think the movie seems cliche because it has inspired so many films?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" might seem cliché today largely because it was so influential in shaping the monster movie genre. Many of its elements were novel at the time of its release but have since been widely adopted and adapted by numerous films. This repetition over time can make the original seem cliché, even though it was innovative in its era. The film's pioneering use of special effects, narrative tropes, and thematic elements set a template that many later movies followed, contributing to their now-familiar feel.

I am wondering if you can write on the paradox of too much novelty in film, it can become unwatchable if it's too avant garde
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The paradox of too much novelty in film is a fascinating topic. When a film is excessively avant-garde, it can become challenging for audiences to engage with or comprehend. While innovation and originality are often praised in cinema, there's a delicate balance to be struck. Films that push the boundaries of conventional storytelling, narrative structure, or visual style can sometimes alienate viewers who seek familiarity or coherence in their cinematic experiences. On the other hand, films that adhere too closely to established norms risk being labeled cliché or unoriginal. Striking the right balance between novelty and accessibility is key to creating a film that is both innovative and watchable.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In "Grabby Aliens Attack," the discovery of the Rhyzomeres' expansionist intentions can be a pivotal plot element:
Plot Element
:
While on the mission to the alien ambassador's planet, Sam, the AI, and the ambassador come across a deserted space station. Investigating it, they find holographic records left by the Rhyzomeres. These records reveal the Rhyzomeres' past: once a peaceful race, their planet was devastated by a natural disaster, forcing them to become nomadic.
As they traveled through space, the Rhyzomeres adopted an expansionist ideology, believing that their survival depended on finding new worlds to inhabit, even if it meant displacing other species. This revelation is shocking to the crew, but the AI, with its human-like empathy, suggests they try to understand the Rhyzomeres' perspective.
Their mission takes on a new goal: to find a peaceful solution that respects the needs of the Rhyzomeres while protecting other civilizations. This leads to a dramatic climax where Sam and the team confront the Rhyzomeres, using diplomacy and empathy to avert a potential interstellar crisis.
This plot element adds depth to the Rhyzomeres, portraying them not just as invaders, but as a species driven by desperation and survival, setting the stage for a nuanced resolution that aligns with the film's themes of understanding and peaceful conflict resolution.

: In the film, the Rhyzomeres, initially perceived as aggressive and expansionist, are later understood to be acting out of a need for survival after a disaster on their home planet. This mirrors the legal principle in the text, examining whether actions taken out of natural instinct or necessity can be judged by the same standards as those taken with deliberate intent.
Moral and Ethical Dilemmas
: The film could explore the moral and ethical implications of judging the Rhyzomeres' actions, similar to how Roman law would assess the actions of animals. This can lead to a deeper discussion within the film about understanding and empathy, challenging the characters (and the audience) to consider the circumstances that drive others to desperate actions.
Conflict Resolution
: In resolving the conflict with the Rhyzomeres, the characters might apply a principle similar to that in Finestres i de Monsalvo's text: understanding the nature and reasons behind actions as a crucial part of seeking a peaceful and fair solution.
Reflection on Human Nature
: The film, through this plot element, can also reflect on human nature and our own reactions when faced with survival situations, drawing a parallel to the Rhyzomeres and their actions.
By integrating these concepts, "Grabby Aliens Attack" can provide not just a sci-fi adventure but also a thoughtful exploration of themes like natural instinct, responsibility, and the complexity of moral judgments.

Scene Setup
: Sam, the AI, and the alien ambassador are in a meeting with the Rhyzomeres on their ship. The atmosphere is tense as they discuss the Rhyzomeres' expansionist actions.
Sam
: "We understand your planet faced a catastrophe. But taking over others' worlds... isn't that just trading one tragedy for another?"
Rhyzomere Leader
: "Our actions are driven by survival, not malice. When your back is against the wall, what choices do you really have?"
AI
: "In ancient Earth history, there was a concept. Animals, acting out of their inherent nature, were not judged as humans were. Your actions, are they not a reflection of this instinct to survive?"
Ambassador
: "But where does it leave those whose homes you claim? Do they not also have a right to survive and thrive?"
Rhyzomere Leader
: "And what would you have us do? Fade quietly into the darkness of space?"
Sam
: "No, that's not what we're saying. There's always a middle ground. A way to coexist, to understand each other's needs and find a solution that doesn't harm others."
Rhyzomere Leader
: (pauses, reflecting) "Perhaps... we've been so focused on our own survival, we've forgotten others are trying to survive too."
AI
: "It's a lesson many have learned through the ages. Survival doesn't have to come at the expense of others. We can help you find another way."
This dialogue encapsulates the moral and ethical dilemmas faced by the Rhyzomeres and the protagonists, reflecting the themes of survival, instinct, and the pursuit of peaceful coexistence.

I think the audience might fall asleep, how can you make it more subtle?

To make the dialogue more subtle and engaging, we can infuse it with indirect references and emotional undertones, rather than direct exposition. This way, the scene becomes more about the characters' reactions and less about overtly stating the themes.
Scene Setup
: Aboard the Rhyzomeres' ship, Sam, the AI, and the ambassador are in a tense negotiation.
Sam
(looking at a hologram of the Rhyzomeres' ruined planet): "It must have been beautiful once."
Rhyzomere Leader
(softly): "It was our home. Now, we're just searching for a new one."
AI
(gazing out a window into space): "There's a saying where I come from — survival often writes its own rules."
Ambassador
(to Sam, sotto voce): "But whose rules do we break in the process?"
Rhyzomere Leader
(catching the ambassador's words): "We never wanted to be rule-breakers... just survivors."
Sam
: "Maybe surviving isn't just about finding a new home, but how we find it."
Rhyzomere Leader
(pausing, thoughtful): "Your words... they hold truth."
This more subtle approach uses imagery, indirect dialogue, and emotional expressions to convey the themes, creating a scene that's more about the unsaid and the felt, engaging the audience on a deeper, more intuitive level.

It's not exactly now subtle. Maybe the pretext the meeting is that they want to make a deal to gain an air-protein device and they have a complete database of DNA scans of all of the planet's life forms, but it comes out in the conversation that the Rhyzomeres plan to shut down all stars in the systems they consider uninhabited and unterraformable.

Incorporating a more nuanced plot element, like the negotiation over an air-protein device and the revelation of the Rhyzomeres' plans, can add depth and subtlety to the scene. Here's how the dialogue might unfold:
Scene Setup
: In a negotiation room on the Rhyzomeres' ship, Sam, the AI, and the ambassador are discussing the trade of an air-protein device with the Rhyzomere Leader. The atmosphere is diplomatic but tense.
Sam
: "This air-protein technology could revolutionize how you sustain yourselves. It's a significant gesture of peace."
Rhyzomere Leader
: "Indeed, and in exchange, we offer you access to our comprehensive DNA database. A treasure trove of biological knowledge."
AI
(examining the database): "Your scans are remarkably detailed. But there's something unusual here... these systems marked 'uninhabitable'... what about them?"
Rhyzomere Leader
(casually): "Oh, those are to be collapsed. No use wasting resources on uninhabitable systems."
Ambassador
(alarmed): "Collapsed? You mean, extinguishing stars?"
Rhyzomere Leader
: "It's a standard procedure. Why preserve what cannot sustain life?"
Sam
: (thoughtfully) "But who defines what life is 'sustainable'? There's a broader impact to consider..."
The conversation subtly unfolds to reveal the Rhyzomeres' controversial plan, prompting a deeper ethical dialogue without overt exposition. This approach keeps the audience engaged, inviting them to ponder the implications along with the characters.
