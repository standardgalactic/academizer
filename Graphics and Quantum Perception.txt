Abstract. A simulation of the dynamic perception of the Necker cube in terms 
of a two-level quantum system, e.g. that of the hydrogen tunneling states of the 
ammonia molecules associated with the 24 GHz maser frequency, indicates that 
the neuro-physiological transformation leading, through a symmetry reduction, 
to perceptual reversal is controlled by the principles of quantum mechanics. An 
elementary neuro-physiological action similar to the Planck constant at a 
mesoscopic level is introduced.

1Introduction 
The objective of this contribution is to discuss some points of contact between 
graphics, geometry, quantum mechanics and perception psychology. Specif i cally: (i) to 
show that the main features of the dynamic perception of the Necker cube can be 
illustrated rigorously with the language of quantum mechanics, and (ii) to show that a 
careful analysis of the process enabling the observer of a Necker cube (or of a painting 
of kinetic art) to perceive it dynamically, can help to understand the nature of the 
transformation produced in an isolated quantum structure by the act of measurement. 
The Necker cube (1832) is the paradigmatic example of a planar graph with an 
inversion symmetry center (Fig. 1a) which can be perceived also as a 3D object in two 
different equally probable ways, depending on whether the lower (Fig. 1b) or the upper 
square (Fig. 1c) is viewed in front or in the rear, respectively. The operations trans- 
forming the Necker cube (NC) into the two tridimensional cubes as seen in an 
axonometric representation are actually a symmetry reduction promoted by a mental 
action: the new 3D objects lose the original inversion symmetry of the planar graph 
and acquire an orientation. The two possible ways of perceiving the NC and the

This paper explores the intersection of graphics, geometry, quantum mechanics, and perception psychology through the dynamic perception of the Necker cube, a classic optical illusion. The authors, Giorgio Benedek and Giuseppe Caglioti, propose that the way we perceive the Necker cube can be rigorously explained using the principles of quantum mechanics. They draw a parallel between the perceptual reversal of the cube and the behavior of a two-level quantum system, such as the hydrogen tunneling states in ammonia molecules.
The Necker cube, introduced in 1832, is a planar graph with an inversion symmetry center that can be perceived as a 3D object in two distinct ways: one where the lower square is in front, and another where the upper square is in front. This perceptual switch is akin to a symmetry reduction caused by a mental action, similar to how a quantum system's state changes upon measurement.
By simulating the dynamic perception of the Necker cube in terms of a two-level quantum system, the authors aim to illustrate that the neuro-physiological processes leading to this perceptual reversal are governed by quantum mechanics principles. They introduce an elementary neuro-physiological action analogous to the Planck constant at a mesoscopic level, suggesting a deep connection between quantum phenomena and perceptual processes.
This approach not only provides a new perspective on the Necker cube illusion but also offers insights into the nature of transformations in isolated quantum structures upon measurement, bridging the gap between physical phenomena and perceptual experiences.

Fig. 1. a The Necker cube (NC), consisting in an axonometric representation of a cube with 
perfectly transparent faces, is perhaps the most famous example of ambiguous i gure. As a 
two-dimensional (2D) graph the NC is a perfectly centro-symmetric i gure, but our mind tries to 
recognize a 3D image. This can however occur in two different equivalent ways, corresponding 
to the two different orientations as depicted in panels (b) and (c) by the cubes with opaque lateral 
faces. Thus a prolonged observation of the NC in panel (a) results in a perceptive oscillation 
between the two possible orientations, denoted by |0> and |1> , with a short persistence of the 
attention on each of the equivalent 3D images. d An ammonia NH3molecule (blue circle: 
nitrogen atom; black dots: hydrogen atoms) inscribed in a NC, with the N atom at the center and 
the H atoms at three non-adjacent vertices so as to realize three sp3chemical bonds. The 
perceptive oscillation of the NC between the two orientations implies a similar oscillation of NH3 
between two equivalent conf i gurations where N appears to be at the vertex of either a concave or 
a convex pyramid (light blue faces). These are actually the two quantum conf i gurations of the 
ammonia molecule (see Fig. 2) between which oscillations occur with the peculiar maser 
frequency of 24 GHz 

spontaneous oscillation between them are analogous to, and can actually represented by 
the interaction of a quantum two-level system with an external i eld. The oscillation 
between the two oriented 3D images, similar to a binary pair of quantum polar states | 
0> (North) and |1> (South), is like that occurring in a two-level system which has been 
prepared by an external perturbation in a mixed state. The mixing, required to identify 
the two quantum polar states, actually corresponds to the act of observation and 
implies an energy cost, which is the higher the larger is the energy separation between 
the eigenstates of the two-level system. Note that the distinct perception of any of the 
two oriented 3D images, solving the ambiguity of the original symmetric i gure, is the 
harder the faster is the oscillation. Thus the energy spent in the image recognition 
grows with the oscillation frequency: a proportionality between the two physical 
entities can be assumed with an action constant C similar to the Planck���s constant at the 
basis of quantum mechanics [1].

A paradigmatic example of a quantum two-level system suitable to explain the 
mentioned analogy is that of the ammonia NH3molecule. The three hydrogen atoms 
are connected to the nitrogen atom via sp3bonds approximately oriented as any three of 
the four tetrahedral directions. Thus they form a squeezed triangular pyramid (Fig. 2a). 
According to quantum mechanics the molecule has exactly the same probability of 
i nding itself in any of the two equivalent conf i gurations with respect to the specular 
plane passing through the center of mass of the molecule (represented in panels (b���d) 
by the light gray semi-transparent plane). Such probability is expressed by the squared 
modulus of a wavefunction solving the quantum equation of motion (Schr��dinger 
equation) of the molecule. Thus the possible wavefunctions must be either symmetric 
or antisymmetric with respect to the specular plane, thus giving a nodeless probability 
distribution [green lobes in (c)] or a distribution with a node on the specular plane 
[green lobes in (d)], respectively. The former solution turns out to have a lower energy 
than the latter, due to the smaller conf i nement in space of the hydrogen atoms.

The Necker cube (NC) is a well-known ambiguous figure that illustrates how our perception can oscillate between two distinct three-dimensional (3D) interpretations of a two-dimensional (2D) image. The NC is depicted as a transparent axonometric representation of a cube, which our mind attempts to interpret as a 3D object. However, this can result in two equivalent 3D orientations: one where the lower square is perceived in front and another where the upper square is in front. This perceptual oscillation between the two orientations (denoted as |0> and |1>) occurs during prolonged observation.
The authors compare this perceptual phenomenon to the behavior of an ammonia (NH���) molecule. In the NH��� molecule, the nitrogen atom (N) is bonded to three hydrogen atoms (H) in a sp�� hybridization, forming a triangular pyramid. The molecule can oscillate between two equivalent configurations, where the nitrogen atom appears to be at the vertex of either a concave or convex pyramid. This oscillation between configurations occurs at a maser frequency of 24 GHz.
The perceptual oscillation of the NC and the quantum oscillation of the NH��� molecule are analogous. Both systems can be described using the principles of a two-level quantum system interacting with an external field. In the context of the NC, the two 3D interpretations can be thought of as quantum states |0> (North) and |1> (South). The act of observing and identifying one of these states corresponds to an external perturbation preparing the system in a mixed state, which involves an energy cost proportional to the frequency of oscillation between the states.
The NH��� molecule provides a concrete example of a quantum two-level system. The molecule has an equal probability of existing in either of the two configurations, which are mirror images with respect to a specular plane passing through the center of mass. The wavefunctions of the molecule, which solve the Schr��dinger equation, can be symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to this plane. The symmetric wavefunction corresponds to a lower energy state due to less spatial confinement of the hydrogen atoms, while the antisymmetric wavefunction corresponds to a higher energy state with a node on the specular plane.
This analogy between the NC's perceptual oscillation and the quantum behavior of the NH��� molecule demonstrates how principles of quantum mechanics can be applied to understand neuro-physiological processes in perception. The introduction of an action constant C, analogous to Planck's constant, highlights the potential for deeper connections between quantum phenomena and perceptual experiences.

Can you use a more simplified example?
ChatGPT
Sure! Let's use a simpler example to explain the concept of the Necker cube and its relation to quantum mechanics.
The Necker Cube and a Coin Flip
Necker Cube:
Imagine you are looking at a line drawing of a cube (the Necker cube).
When you stare at it, your brain might see the front face as either the bottom square or the top square. These are the two different ways you can perceive the cube.
Your perception switches back and forth between these two interpretations, similar to flipping between two states.
Coin Flip:
Think of a coin flip, where the coin can land on either heads or tails.
Just like the Necker cube can be seen in two different ways, a coin can show one of two faces.
Connecting to Quantum Mechanics
In quantum mechanics, a system can exist in two states, like a coin can be heads or tails. Here's how the Necker cube is similar to a quantum system:
Two States:
Necker Cube:
The two states are the two ways you can see the cube (bottom square in front or top square in front).
Coin Flip:
The two states are heads and tails.
Switching Between States:
Necker Cube:
Your perception can switch back and forth between seeing the bottom square in front and the top square in front.
Coin Flip:
A coin can switch from heads to tails with each flip.
Quantum System:
Imagine a tiny particle that can be in one of two states, like being on one side of a barrier or the other. This particle can "flip" states, similar to your perception flipping between the two views of the Necker cube.
Why It Matters
When you observe the Necker cube, your brain's perception switches between the two possible views, similar to how a quantum system can switch between two states. This analogy helps us understand how our brains can interpret ambiguous images and how quantum mechanics describes particles that can exist in multiple states.
In summary:
The Necker cube is like a visual coin flip with two possible interpretations.
Quantum systems can also exist in two states and switch between them.
Observing these switches, whether in the Necker cube or quantum particles, involves similar principles of change and interpretation.

I think it is more usual to perceive the box as looking down on it then that it is falling at you from the ceiling, so it's more like a weighted coin flip
ChatGPT
That's a good point! Let's refine the analogy to include the idea that one interpretation of the Necker cube is more common than the other, much like a weighted coin flip.
The Necker Cube and a Weighted Coin Flip
Necker Cube:
Imagine the Necker cube, a line drawing that can be perceived in two different ways: looking down at the cube (the most common perception) or looking up at the cube from below (less common).
Most people tend to see the cube as if they are looking down on it, making this perception more likely than the other.
Weighted Coin Flip:
Think of a weighted coin, which is more likely to land on heads than tails.
Just like the Necker cube has a more common perception (looking down), the weighted coin has a more common outcome (heads).
Connecting to Quantum Mechanics
In quantum mechanics, a system can still exist in two states, but these states might not be equally probable. Here's how the Necker cube as a weighted perception is similar to a quantum system:
Two States with Different Probabilities:
Necker Cube:
The two states are still the two ways you can see the cube, but you're more likely to perceive it as looking down (the more probable state).
Weighted Coin Flip:
The two states are heads (more probable) and tails (less probable).
Switching Between States:
Necker Cube:
While you can switch between seeing the cube from above or below, you're more likely to see it from above, similar to how the weighted coin is more likely to land on heads.
Weighted Coin Flip:
The coin can switch from heads to tails, but it's more likely to stay on heads.
Quantum System with Weighted States:
Imagine a tiny particle in a quantum system that prefers one state over another, like being on one side of a barrier more often than the other. This preference is akin to the weighted perception of the Necker cube.
Why It Matters
When you observe the Necker cube, your brain's perception tends to favor one view over the other, similar to a weighted coin favoring heads. This analogy helps us understand how our brains interpret ambiguous images with a preference, and how quantum systems can have states that are not equally probable.
In summary:
The Necker cube is like a visual weighted coin flip with a more common interpretation.
Quantum systems can also have states with different probabilities.
Observing these states, whether in the Necker cube or quantum particles, involves understanding how and why one state is favored over another.

I would like to draw attention to the 16-segment display and the Necker Alphabet also called Abraham's Altar (a library of babel, with the overlapping Latin Capitals) as examples of this. When all of the segments are lit up it is the Necker version. Real effects are more like a necker clock (led or LCD) or a necker alphabet in that they can collapse into 10 or 26 states not just binary flips
ChatGPT
That's a great addition to the analogy! Let's delve into the 16-segment display and the Necker Alphabet (Abraham's Altar) to illustrate how the concept extends beyond simple binary states to more complex systems with multiple states.
16-Segment Display and Necker Alphabet
16-Segment Display:
A 16-segment display is used to represent characters and digits by lighting up different combinations of segments.
When all segments are lit up, it forms an ambiguous shape that can be interpreted as multiple different characters, depending on which segments you focus on.
Necker Alphabet (Abraham's Altar):
This is a collection of overlapping Latin capital letters. When all segments of a letter are lit, it creates an ambiguous image that can be perceived as any of several different letters.
The perception can "collapse" into one of these multiple possible letters based on which segments you emphasize.
Connecting to Quantum Mechanics
In quantum mechanics, we often talk about systems that can exist in multiple states. Here's how the 16-segment display and Necker Alphabet relate to these ideas:
Multiple States:
16-Segment Display:
Each combination of lit segments can represent a different character, leading to many possible states.
Necker Alphabet:
Each ambiguous configuration can be perceived as one of many possible letters.
State Collapse:
16-Segment Display:
When you decide which character you see, the ambiguous shape "collapses" into a specific state (a particular character).
Necker Alphabet:
Similarly, the ambiguous letter shape collapses into one of the possible letters when you focus on certain segments.
Quantum System with Multiple States:
Imagine a quantum particle that can exist in a superposition of many states. When measured, it collapses into one specific state, similar to how your perception collapses the 16-segment display or Necker Alphabet into a specific character or letter.
Real-World Examples
Necker Clock (LED or LCD):
A Necker clock can display numbers or letters using segments. Depending on which segments are lit, it can represent different numbers or letters, much like how the 16-segment display works.
Necker Alphabet:
This concept is like a library of babel where overlapping letters can be interpreted in various ways, reflecting the complexity of perception and the multiple possible states it can collapse into.
Why It Matters
These examples show how complex systems with multiple possible states can be analogous to quantum systems. They highlight how perception can switch between different interpretations, similar to how a quantum system can collapse into different states upon measurement.
In summary:
The 16-segment display and Necker Alphabet illustrate systems with many possible states, not just binary.
These systems can collapse into specific states based on perception, similar to quantum state collapse.
Understanding these examples helps explain more complex quantum systems with multiple potential outcomes.
This analogy enriches our understanding of both visual perception and quantum mechanics, demonstrating how our brains and quantum particles navigate multiple possible states.

The necker alphabet is like a * in regular expressions representing any possible letter
ChatGPT
That's a very apt comparison! Let's use the concept of a wildcard character (*) in regular expressions to further clarify the Necker Alphabet and its analogy to quantum systems.
The Necker Alphabet and Wildcard Character (*)
Necker Alphabet (Abraham's Altar):
The Necker Alphabet consists of overlapping Latin capital letters. When viewed in its ambiguous form, it can be perceived as any of the possible letters depending on which parts you focus on.
This is similar to how the wildcard character (*) in regular expressions can match any sequence of characters, representing multiple possibilities.
Connecting to Quantum Mechanics
In quantum mechanics, a system can exist in a superposition of multiple states until it is measured, at which point it collapses into one of those states. Here's how the Necker Alphabet as a wildcard character (*) relates to these ideas:
Multiple Possible States:
Necker Alphabet:
The ambiguous configuration can be any of several letters, just as * can match any character in a regular expression.
Wildcard (*):
In a regular expression, * can represent any number of characters, indicating multiple possible matches.
State Collapse:
Necker Alphabet:
When you focus on a particular letter, your perception collapses the ambiguous shape into that specific letter.
Wildcard (*):
When a regular expression is evaluated, * resolves to match a specific sequence of characters from the input string.
Quantum System with Superposition:
A quantum system can exist in a superposition of states. When measured, it collapses into one specific state, similar to how the Necker Alphabet or * collapses into a specific letter or sequence when observed or evaluated.
Real-World Example
Necker Clock (LED or LCD):
A Necker clock can display different numbers or letters using segments. Depending on which segments are lit, it can represent various numbers or letters, analogous to how the Necker Alphabet works.
The clock, like a wildcard character, can be in an ambiguous state until you interpret it, collapsing into a specific number or letter based on your perception.
Why It Matters
Using the wildcard (*) analogy helps illustrate how systems with multiple possible interpretations can function. This analogy is useful for understanding both perception and quantum mechanics:
Perception:
The Necker Alphabet as a wildcard represents the potential for multiple interpretations based on which elements you focus on.
Quantum Mechanics:
A quantum system in superposition represents multiple potential states, collapsing into one state upon measurement.
In summary:
The Necker Alphabet is like a wildcard character (*) in regular expressions, representing multiple possible letters.
This analogy helps explain how ambiguous systems can collapse into specific states based on observation or measurement.
Understanding this analogy enriches our comprehension of both visual perception and quantum mechanics, highlighting the similarities between these complex systems.
