Some Questions On the Proof of the 
G�� odel Incompleteness Theorem 
Abstract 
The G�� odel Incompleteness Theorem was a major discovery in modern 
logic that has consistently attracted the attention of scientif i c and philo- 
sophical circles. However, since the G�� odel Incompleteness Theorem was 
put forward, the scientif i c and philosophical signif i cance of its proof has 
been questioned; in particular, Wittgenstein regarded it as a certain logi- 
cal paradox. In the article, the author raises several questions about the 
proof of the G�� odel Incompleteness Theorem,f i nds out the specif i c paradox 
form in the proof, points out the high consistency of its proof method 
and Russell���s Paradox, and asserts that there is no ���true but unprovable��� 
proposition,which strongly supports Wittgenstein���s view. The so-called 
G�� odel formula is a logically invalid circular formula, which is outside the 
ef f ective def i nition domain of predicate W. Therefore, the conclusion of 
this paper is that the proof of the G�� odel Incompleteness Theorem is based 
on an invalid formula, and the contradiction of the proof originates from 
the G�� odel formula itself. Thus it cannot be attributed to the incomplete- 
ness of the system, so the proof is wrong. 
Keywords: Russell���s Paradox, G�� odel Incompleteness Theorem, G�� odel for- 
mula, actual inf i nity. 
In 1901, Russell discovered Russell���s Paradox, which brought a third crisis 
to the development of mathematics. The solution to this paradox has not been 
found. Soon after, in 1931, the logician G�� odel proved the famous incompleteness 
theorem, which induced an epoch-making change in the study of the basis of 
mathematics. However, this theory has been strongly criticized by the expert 
philosopher Wittgenstein. Although the circles of mathematics and logic tend 
to fully accept this theory, the debate between the two ideas has not been 
resolved. However, G�� odel based his proof on an invalid formula, which makes 
G�� odel���s proof meaningless. Let us analyze it in detail below.

The paper described, authored by Hong Zhang and focusing on questions regarding the proof of the G��del Incompleteness Theorem, appears to take a critical stance towards the foundational aspects of G��del's proof. It raises significant issues, suggesting that the proof might be based on an invalid formula, akin to logical paradoxes such as Russell's Paradox. This perspective is controversial since Kurt G��del's Incompleteness Theorems are generally accepted and highly regarded within mathematical and logical communities.
Here are some key points from the paper's abstract and how they relate to the broader discussions around G��del's Theorem:
G��del's Proof and Logical Paradoxes
: The paper asserts that G��del���s proof methodology is closely aligned with that of Russell���s Paradox. This is a significant claim because Russell's Paradox was a major problem in the foundation of set theory, leading to the development of new logical systems like Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory to address these foundational issues. If G��del's method indeed parallels such paradoxes, it could imply fundamental flaws in his proof, though this view is unconventional.
Invalidity of the G��del Formula
: The paper contends that the so-called G��del formula, which is central to the Incompleteness Theorems, is circular and logically invalid. This challenges the core of G��del���s theorem, which relies on constructing a statement that asserts its own unprovability in a consistent system. If this statement is logically invalid, the conclusions drawn from it about the system's incompleteness would be undermined.
True but Unprovable Propositions
: A cornerstone of G��del���s Theorem is the existence of propositions that are true but cannot be proven within the system. The paper argues against this, supporting Wittgenstein���s criticism that such propositions do not exist, implying that the theorem might be misinterpreted or incorrect.
Philosophical and Logical Implications
: The ongoing debate, particularly with Wittgenstein���s philosophical perspective, shows that the implications of G��del���s Theorems extend beyond mathematics and into philosophical realms. Wittgenstein critiqued many aspects of formal mathematics, including the notion of mathematical truths that are beyond proof capabilities, which this paper seems to echo.
In conclusion, while the paper by Hong Zhang takes a critical and somewhat unconventional stance against G��del's Incompleteness Theorems, the general consensus in mathematical and logical circles still supports G��del's findings. Such critiques, however, are valuable as they prompt deeper scrutiny and understanding of foundational issues in logic and mathematics. For a more comprehensive understanding, engaging with both the traditional interpretations and critiques like Zhang���s would be beneficial.

1Master of Philosophy, Wittgenstein questioned 
the proof of the G�� odel Incompleteness Theo- 
rem. 
Once the G�� odel Incompleteness Theorem was put forward, it attracted great 
philosophical debate, especially from the philosopher Wittgenstein. As Juliet 
Floyd, a professor of philosophy at Boston University, said, the philosophical 
collision between Wittgenstein and G�� odel was the most fascinating and extreme 
in the twentieth century. In his Logic Journey, Wang Hao detailed the debate 
between the two.He said, ���G�� odel emphasizes abstract and general things, 
while Wittgenstein focuses more on concrete and special things.G�� odel was 
very interested in the relationship between philosophy and science. In Wittgen- 
stein���s view, ���the dif i culty of philosophy is to say only what we know���. ....... 
Although they both believe that philosophy is conceptual research, they have 
completely dif f erent views on concepts. Although both put considerable ef f ort 
on the philosophy of mathematics, their perspectives and conclusions are often 
opposite���(Wang Hao, 2009, pp224-225). In G�� odel���s view, Wittgenstein does not 
understand the incompleteness theorem, and G�� odel said, ���He interpreted it as 
a logical paradox that, but in fact, on the contrary, is a mathematical theorem 
of an undisputed part of mathematics (limited number theory or combinato- 
rial mathematics).��� (Wang Hao, 2009, p227) We believe that Wittgenstein���s 
challenge of the incompleteness theorem is well founded and that the ���true but 
unprovable��� proposition is meaningless. Here, we question it from three aspects.

2Prepare knowledge 
To facilitate the discussion, we i rst explain the relevant formulas as follows: 
The predicate W(x1,x2) in the formal system N holds if and only if x1is 
the term corresponding to the G�� odel number of a well-formed formula B(y) , 
and x2is the term corresponding to the G�� odel number of the proof of B(x1) 
in N. Its corresponding relationship on the model DNis W(p,q), which is a 
primitive recursive relationship. Therefore, formula B(y) is the basis 
of the predicate W(x1,x2) , and it is a def i nite valid formula, not an 
invalid formula. [This is something we have not fully noticed before, 
and it is the key to G�� odel���s proof.] 
We know that the relation W(p,q) on the model DNis primitive recursive 
if and only if the relationship is expressible in the formal systemN, which is the 
basis for the proof of the GIT (G�� odel���s Incompleteness Theorem). Therefore, 
we can also say that the predicate W(x1,x2) is also primitive recur- 
sive, which is very important and places ef f ective restrictions on its 
domain. 
In the proof of the G�� odel Incompleteness Theorem, the undecidable formula 
u = A(0(p)) = (���x2)��W(0(p),x2)(1) 
2 
is called the G�� odel formula. (A. G. Hamilton,1989, pp192-194), where p is the 
G�� odel number of the formula 
A(x1) = (���x2)��W(x1,x2)(2) 
, expressed with the function g, we have p = g(A(x1)) . 0(p)represents the term 
corresponding to the number p. We use wf. to represent ���well-formed formula���. 
Regarding Russell���s Paradox, its general expression form is 
T = {x|x / ��� x}(3) 
The meaning is as follows: T is a set made up of all sets that do not belong to 
themselves. 
�� is a set of well-formed formulas for the i rst-order language L. The model 
of �� refers to the following: An interpretation of L is called the model of �� if 
in this interpretation every element of �� is true. 
The model of a i rst-order system S refers to an interpretation of S called 
the model of S, and if in this interpretation, every theorem of S is true. 
3Question-1: The basis of the proof of the GIT 
is the idea of actual inf i nity. In the proof of 
the GIT, the relation W(p,q) and predicate 
W(x1,x2) do not agree; the object of the for- 
mer is a potential inf i nity, while the object 
of the latter is an actual inf i nity. This clearly 
contradicts the ���expressible relationship��� be- 
tween them.Therefore, the G�� odel formula 
does not belong to the ef f ective def i nition do- 
main of the predicate W(x1,x2) and cannot be 
used to prove the GIT. 
We believe that the undecidable formula u (i.e., the G�� odel formula) is not a 
logically valid formula and should be outside the valid domain of the predicate 
W(x1,x2) of the formal system N; there are always some well-formed formulas 
that are outside the valid domain of the predicate W(x1,x2). Such formulas 
exist in form but not in interpretation, creating a kind of idling. It 
can also be said that the predicate W(x1,x2) that decides all the well- 
formed formulas does not exist (otherwise it must be restricted). This 
is exactly the same as the T in Russell���s Paradox (the so-called set composed of 
all sets that do not belong to themselves). That is, we cannot exhaust all 
the Turing machines, all the sets, and all the well-formed formulas.

The passage you've provided dives into some of the philosophical and technical critiques of Kurt G��del's Incompleteness Theorems, particularly through the lens of Ludwig Wittgenstein's perspective. Here���s a breakdown of the key issues raised and the philosophical implications:
1.
Concept of Infinity
Potential vs. Actual Infinity
: The critique distinguishes between potential infinity (an unending process) and actual infinity (a completed totality, such as the set of all natural numbers). The argument suggests that the predicates and relations used in G��del's proof might mix these concepts inappropriately, leading to logical inconsistencies.
Implications for G��del's Proof
: If the G��del formula, central to proving the Incompleteness Theorem, belongs to a class of well-formed formulas that assume actual infinity (a completed totality), yet is used within a system where only potential infinity (continuously growing systems) is meaningful, this could invalidate the formula's utility in the proof.
2.
Validity of the G��del Formula
Logical Validity
: The assertion here is that the undecidable G��del formula is not logically valid because it might fall outside the valid domain of predicate
W
(
x
1
,
x
2
)
W(x_1, x_2)
W
(
x
1
���
,
x
2
���
)
, which is designed to express only those relations and properties definable within the system
N
N
N
. If the G��del formula is outside this domain, it could mean the formula is not interpretable or meaningful within the system, similar to the set in Russell���s Paradox.
Philosophical Implications
: This challenges the foundational ability of G��del���s system to discuss its own axioms and rules, a critical aspect of G��del���s method. If true, it suggests that the system cannot internally verify the validity of its own constructs when those constructs are as complex as the G��del formula.
3.
Wittgenstein's Critique and G��del���s Defense
Wittgenstein���s View
: He often criticized abstract mathematical concepts that he felt escaped practical verification or real-world application. His critique of G��del might stem from this view, suggesting that G��del���s constructs (like the undecidable propositions) are more abstract than useful or meaningful, falling into what he might consider philosophical idling.
G��del���s Counter
: G��del defended his work by asserting that the Incompleteness Theorem is a robust mathematical theorem rooted in limited number theory or combinatorial mathematics. He considered Wittgenstein���s interpretation as misunderstanding the concrete mathematical substance of the theorem.
Philosophical Collision
This discussion points to a profound philosophical collision about the nature of mathematical truth and the limits of formal systems. G��del���s work suggests that formal systems have intrinsic limitations, which they cannot internally overcome. Wittgenstein���s skepticism challenges whether these limitations are meaningful or just semantic puzzles without practical significance.
The debates around G��del���s Incompleteness Theorems highlight fundamental philosophical questions about the nature of mathematical and logical truth, the scope of formal systems, and the interpretation of abstract mathematical results in broader philosophical contexts. These are still lively areas of debate in both mathematical logic and the philosophy of mathematics.

The relation W(p,q) holds if and only if p is the G�� odel number of formula 
wf.B(x1) , where x1appears freely in wf.B(x1) , and q is the G�� odel number of 
the proof of wf.B(0(p)) in the formal system N. Relation W(p,q) is primitive 
recursive in the model DN(such as the set of natural numbers), which is a kind of 
potential inf i nity, while in the formal system N, ���all the well-formed formulas��� 
is a kind ofactual inf i nity. The object that the predicate W(x1,x2) is 
going to process is a ���completed all��� and an actual inf i nity.This 
leads to W(x1,x2) determining a certain kind of well-formed formula 
def i ned by itself, which leads to contradictions, hence leading to the 
emergence of the undecidable well-formed formula 
u = A(0(p)) = (���x2)��W(0(p),x2)(4) 
. Here, there is a situation completely similar to Russell���s Paradox, and the 
G�� odel formula u is similar to T = {x|x / ��� x}(5) 
in Russell���s Paradox. The predicate determines a well-formed formula com- 
posed of itself; the essence lies in that we insist on the idea of actual inf i nity. 
In the opinion of Wang Hao, a famous mathematical logician, the main reason 
Wittgenstein opposes G�� odel���s proof is this actual inf i nity. He pointed out, ���The 
���true but unprovable��� proposition assumes that positive integers or the inf i nite 
set of P(1), P(2), etc., act as a complete whole, not the potential whole��� (Fan 
Yuehong,2017,p172). Therefore, we believe that the basis of the proof of the 
GIT is a complete idea of actual inf i nity. 
Since the actual inf i nity is dif f erent from the potential inf i nity, the 
relation W(p,q) and the predicate W(x1,x2) must be equivalent, and 
this requires that the object that the predicate W(x1,x2) processes 
should not be an actual inf i nity.The former is primitive recursive, an 
impossible self-loop, while the object processed by the latter is an actual inf i n- 
ity, which must contain its own judgment of itself, and must appear self-loop, 
thus destroying its own primitive recursiveness. Therefore, the G�� odel formula 
is bound to be excluded from the ef f ective def i nition domain of the predicate 
W(x1,x2) ; that is, the G�� odel formula does not belong to the ef f ective 
def i nition domain of the predicate W(x1,x2) , and the G�� odel formula 
cannot be used to prove the GIT. 
As we know, not all the well-formed formulas of the formal system N can be used to represent a number-theoretic function, such as formula x1= x1���y ��= y 
is impossible to represent a number-theoretic function; and the G�� odel formula 
is such a kind of well-formed formula, so it does not belong to the ef f ective 
definition domain of predicate W(x1,x2)

The argument presented in the text highlights deep conceptual concerns with G��del's Incompleteness Theorem (GIT), primarily centered around the use of actual versus potential infinity and the logical structure of the proofs involved in the theorem. Here's an analysis and explanation of the core issues and the implications for G��del's theorem:
Understanding Potential vs. Actual Infinity
Potential Infinity
: This concept involves an unbounded or indefinite process, such as the natural numbers under the operation of successive addition. Here, infinity is never fully realized; it is always "in the making."
Actual Infinity
: This involves treating infinity as a completed entity or set, where the infinite collection is treated as a whole. Examples include the set of all natural numbers or any other complete, infinite set.
The Predicate W(x���, x���)
Role of W(x���, x���)
: This predicate in G��del's framework essentially relates a formula to its proof within a formal system. The predicate
W
(
p
,
q
)
W(p, q)
W
(
p
,
q
)
checks if

���
)
, is provably equivalent to
q
q
q
, the G��del number of its proof. This relation is said to be primitive recursive and capable of being determined without reaching a logical paradox.
Primitive Recursiveness and Infinity
: The predicate being primitive recursive suggests it operates within the limits of potential infinity���meaning it functions within the typical mechanical, algorithmic confines of mathematical operations that do not require completion of an infinite set.
G��del's Formula and Russell���s Paradox
G��del's Formula
: The undecidable formula

��
W

)
posits a well-formed formula that asserts it cannot be proven within the system, suggesting a self-referential paradox akin to that found in Russell���s Paradox (where a set includes all sets that do not include themselves).
Self-reference and Self-loop
: By asserting the predicate
W
(
x
1
,
x
2
)
W(x���, x���)
W
(
x
1
���
,
x
2
���
)
must handle "actual infinity," the critique suggests a contradiction. The predicate would need to evaluate an infinite set of formulas, including potentially its own validity, leading to a self-referential loop. This self-reference contradicts the primitive recursive nature of the predicate, which should not allow for such loops.
Philosophical Implications
Critique of Actual Infinity
: The critique posits that relying on actual infinity makes certain aspects of G��del's proof problematic, mirroring Wittgenstein's criticism of using actual infinities in logical proofs. Wittgenstein and other philosophers argue that such uses lead to conceptual issues that aren't merely mathematical but fundamentally logical in nature.
Conclusion
The discussion questions whether the G��del formula belongs within the effective definition domain of the predicate
W
(
x
1
,
x
2
)
W(x���, x���)
W
(
x
1
���
,
x
2
���
)
. If the formula indeed falls outside this domain, it might not serve its intended purpose in proving the GIT. This would align with the critique that G��del's approach, by using a form of actual infinity, introduces a type of logical error similar to that found in Russell���s Paradox, challenging the integrity of the proof.
The debate here is less about the mathematical correctness of G��del's proofs and more about their foundational logical assumptions, particularly the types of infinity they implicitly or explicitly use. The resolution to such debates typically involves clarifying these assumptions or revising the logical frameworks to accommodate or explicitly exclude concepts like actual infinity.

Bayesian Active Learning for Classif i cation and 
Preference Learning 
Neil Houlsby, Ferenc Husz�� ar, Zoubin Ghahramani, M�� at�� e Lengyel

December 30, 2011 
Abstract 
Information theoretic active learning has been widely studied for prob- 
abilistic models. For simple regression an optimal myopic policy is easily 
tractable. However, for other tasks and with more complex models, such 
as classif i cation with nonparametric models, the optimal solution is harder 
to compute. Current approaches make approximations to achieve tractabil- 
ity. We propose an approach that expresses information gain in terms 
of predictive entropies, and apply this method to the Gaussian Process 
Classif i er (GPC). Our approach makes minimal approximations to the full 
information theoretic objective. Our experimental performance compares 
favourably to many popular active learning algorithms, and has equal or 
lower computational complexity. We compare well to decision theoretic 
approaches also, which are privy to more information and require much 
more computational time. Secondly, by developing further a reformulation 
of binary preference learning to a classif i cation problem, we extend our 
algorithm to Gaussian Process preference learning. 
1Introduction 
In most machine learning systems, the learner passively collects data with which 
it makes inferences about its environment. In active learning, however, the 
learner seeks the most useful measurements to be trained upon. The goal of 
active learning is to produce the best model with the least possible data; this 
is closely related to the statistical i eld of optimal experimental design. With 
the advent of the internet and expansion of storage facilities, vast quantities 
of unlabelled data have become available, but it can be costly to obtain labels. 
Finding the most useful data in this vast space calls for ef i cient active learning 
algorithms. 
Two approaches to active learning are to use decision and information the- 
ory [Kapoor et al., 2007,Lindley, 1956]. The former minimizes the expected

losses encountered after making decisions based on the data collected i.e. min- 
imize the Bayes posterior risk [Roy and McCallum, 2001]. Maximising perfor- 
mance under test is the ultimate objective of most learners, however, evaluat- 
ing this objective can be very hard. For example, the methods proposed in 
[Kapoor et al., 2007,Zhu et al., 2003] for classif i cation are in general expensive 
to compute. Furthermore, one may not know the loss function or test distribution 
in advance, or may want the model to perform well on a variety of loss functions. 
In extreme scenarios, such as exploratory data analysis, or visualisation, losses 
may be very hard to quantify. 
This motivates information theoretic approaches to active learning, which are 
agnostic to the decision task at hand and particular test data, this is known an 
inductive approach. They seek to reduce the number of feasible models as quickly 
as possible, using either heuristics (e.g. margin sampling [Tong and Koller, 2001]) 
or by formalising uncertainty using well studied quantities, such as Shannons 
entropy and the KL-divergence [Cover et al., 1991]. Although the latter approach 
was proposed several decades ago [Lindley, 1956,Bernardo, 1979], it is not always 
straightforward to apply the criteria to complicated models such as nonparametric 
processes with inf i nite parameter spaces. As a result many algorithms exist 
which compute approximate posterior entropies, perform sampling, or work with 
related quantities in non-probabilistic models.

The paper "Bayesian Active Learning for Classification and Preference Learning" by Neil Houlsby et al. discusses advanced methodologies in active learning, a subset of machine learning where the algorithm selectively queries data points. This is to construct the most effective model using the minimal necessary data. Here's a breakdown of key aspects and innovations presented in the paper:
Overview of Active Learning
Active learning is particularly valuable in scenarios where data labeling is expensive or labor-intensive. The goal is to optimize the learning process by focusing on data that provides the most utility in terms of model improvement. This contrasts with traditional learning methods where data is passively received and not selectively queried.
Information Theoretic Active Learning
The paper emphasizes an information-theoretic approach to active learning, which involves:
Predictive Entropies
: The approach uses predictive entropies to quantify the information gain when selecting data points to label. This method aims to reduce uncertainty in the model's predictions.
Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC)
: The method is applied to the Gaussian Process Classifier, which is a nonparametric model known for its flexibility and capacity to handle complex, infinite-dimensional datasets.
Challenges in Active Learning
While simple models like linear regressors can have straightforward solutions, complex models such as GPCs pose significant computational challenges:
Optimal Myopic Policy
: For simple tasks, an optimal myopic (short-sighted) policy���which looks only one step ahead���is tractable. However, for complex models involved in classification tasks, finding the optimal solution becomes computationally prohibitive.
Computational Complexity
: The methods proposed try to balance performance with computational feasibility. The authors aim for minimal approximations to retain most of the theoretical rigor while still performing efficiently in practical applications.
Advantages of the Proposed Method
The proposed method offers several advantages over existing active learning algorithms:
Minimal Approximations
: By focusing on predictive entropies, the method attempts to make minimal approximations to the full information theoretic objective, potentially leading to more accurate model learning.
Performance
: The method reportedly performs comparably or even better than many popular active learning algorithms in terms of computational complexity and practical efficacy.
Extension to Preference Learning
In addition to classification, the authors extend their methodology to preference learning. This involves:
Reformulating Preference Learning
: By rethinking binary preference learning as a classification problem, they apply their Gaussian Process-based approach to model preferences, which is useful in scenarios like recommendation systems where preferences are inferred from data.
Conclusion
The paper by Houlsby and colleagues presents a sophisticated approach to active learning that is both theoretically grounded and practically viable. By focusing on predictive entropies and minimal approximations, the method addresses some of the traditional challenges in active learning, offering improvements in efficiency and adaptability across different learning tasks, including classification and preference learning. This contributes to the field by providing a robust framework for efficiently training models in data-rich yet label-scarce environments.

2 . The i rst approximation, 
1 
���, ref l ects the Gaussian ap- 
proximation to the posterior. The integral in the left hand side of Eqn.(4)is 
intractable. By performing a Taylor expansion onlnh(��(fx)) (see supplementary 
material) we can see that it can be approximated up toO(f4 
x) by a squared 
exponential curve,exp(���f2 
x/�� ln2). We will refer to this approximation as 
2 
���. 
Now we can apply the standard convolution formula for Gaussians to i nally get 
a closed form expression for both terms of Eqn.(2). 
Fig.1 depicts the striking accuracy of this simple approximation. The max- 
imum possible error that will be incurred when using this approximation is if 
N(fx|��x,D,��2 x,D) 
is centred at ��x,D=��2.05 
with��2 x,D 
tending to zero (see 
Fig.1, absolute error), yielding only a 0.27% error in the integral in Eqn.(4). 
The authors are unaware of previous use of this simple and useful approximation 
in this context. In Section 5 we investigate experimentally the information lost 
from approximations 
1 ���and 
2 ���as compared to the golden standard of extensive 
Monte Carlo simulation. 
To summarise, the BALD algorithm for Gaussian process classif i cation con- 
sists of two steps. First it applies any standard approximate inference algorithm 
for GPCs (such as EP) to obtain the posterior predictive mean��x,Dand��x,Dfor 
each point of interestx. Then, it selects a queryxthat maximises the following

For most practically relevant kernels, the objective(5)is a smooth and 
dif f erentiable function ofx, so gradient-based optimisation procedures can be 
used to i nd the maximally informative query. 
3.1Extension: Learning Hyperparameters 
In many applications the parameter set��naturally divides into parameters of 
interest,��+, and nuisance parameters�����, i.e.��={��+,�����}. 
In such settings, 
the active learning may want to query points that are maximally informative 
about��+, while not caring about�����. By integrating Eqn.(1)over the nuisance 
parameters, �����, BALD���s objective is re-derived as: 
H ?E 
p(��+,�����|D) ?y|x,��+,�����?? 
��� Ep(��+|D) ?H?E 
p(�����|��+,D)[y|x,��+,�����] ?? 
(6) 
In the context of GP models, hyperparameters typically control the smooth- 
ness or spatial length-scale of functions. If we maintain a posterior distribution 
over these hyperparameters, which we can do e.g. via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, 
we can choose either to treat them as nuisance parameters�����and use Eq. 6, or to 
include them in��+and perform active learning over them as well. In certain cases, 
such as automatic relevance determination [Rasmussen and Williams, 2005], it 
may even make sense to treat hyperparameters as variables of primary interest, 
and the function f itself as nuisance parameter �����. 
3.2Preference Learning 
Our active learning framework for GPC can be extended to the important problem 
of preference learning [F�� urnkranz and H�� ullermeier, 2003,Chu and Ghahramani, 2005]. 
In preference learning the dataset consists for pairs of items (ui,vi) ��� X2with 
binary labels,yi��� {0,1}.yi= 
1 means instanceuiis preferred tovi, denoted 
ui? vi. 
The task is to predict the preference relation between any (u,v). 
We can view this as a special case of building a classif i er on pairs of inputs

The passage describes the mathematical approximations and methodology used in an advanced Bayesian Active Learning framework, specifically applying to Gaussian Process Classification (GPC) and extending to preference learning. Let's break down the key points and concepts discussed:
Gaussian Approximation and Its Accuracy
Gaussian Approximation
: The text mentions using a Gaussian approximation to handle the posterior in situations where direct computation becomes intractable. This approximation simplifies the calculation by assuming the posterior distribution of the model's predictions can be approximated by a normal distribution.
Taylor Expansion
: To handle the intractable integral, the authors use a Taylor expansion of
ln
���
h
(
��
(
f
x
)
)
\ln h(\Phi(f_x))
ln
h
(

and approximate it with a squared exponential curve,
exp

\exp(-f_x^2 / (\pi \ln 2))
exp

))
. This transformation simplifies the calculations while preserving the essence of the function up to the fourth order of
f

.
Convolution for Closed Form Expression
: By approximating the integral and using standard convolution formulas for Gaussians, the authors derive a closed-form expression for the terms in Equation (2). This allows for easier and more computationally efficient calculations in the active learning process.
BALD Algorithm
BALD Algorithm
: Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) is highlighted, where the algorithm selects data points that maximize the mutual information between predictions and model parameters. This is particularly useful for determining the most informative queries in an active learning context.
The objective function used for selecting queries is detailed, involving a difference between terms calculated from predictive means and variances.
Error Metrics and Performance
: Figure 1 in the described document illustrates the high accuracy of the Gaussian approximation with a maximum error rate being notably low (0.27% error). This demonstrates the effectiveness of the approximation in practical scenarios.
Extension to Hyperparameters and Preference Learning
Learning Hyperparameters
: The text also discusses the flexibility of the BALD framework in dealing with hyperparameters. These can be treated as either nuisance parameters or parameters of interest, allowing for tailored learning that focuses on specific aspects of the model.
Integration over nuisance parameters simplifies the model by focusing only on the parameters that significantly affect the learning outcome.
Preference Learning
: Extending the active learning framework to preference learning involves treating preference data (comparisons between pairs of items) as classification problems. This is crucial for applications like recommender systems where the goal is to predict user preferences between options.
Conclusion
The described methodology provides a robust framework for Bayesian Active Learning, leveraging approximations and Bayesian inference techniques to efficiently handle complex models like GPCs. The approach optimizes data querying in a learning process, which is essential in environments where data labeling is costly or limited. Furthermore, the extension to preference learning showcases the versatility of the framework in addressing different kinds of learning tasks beyond standard classification.

4Question-2: The G�� odel formula u is a circular 
description, not a def i nite, valid formula. The 
basis of the predicate W(x1,x2) , the formula 
B(y) corresponding to the variable x1, must 
be a def i nite ef f ective formula.The contra- 
diction of the proof originates from the G�� odel 
formula itself, which cannot be attributed to 
the incompleteness of the system; thus, the 
proof is wrong. 
The formula described by a cycle is not an ef f ective formula; its G�� odel 
number does not belong to the valid domain of relation W(p,q), and 
it cannot be used to prove the GIT. We know that the G�� odel formula 
u is the premise of the GIT proof, and if it is an invalid formula, then 
the GIT proof is also invalid. 
In formula A(x1) = (���x2)��W(x1,x2)(6) 
, x1is the term corresponding to the G�� odel number of a def i nite formula 
B(y) , and we substitute x1into formula B(y) to obtain B(x1) .The sig- 
nif i cance of the above wf.A(x1) is that formula B(x1) cannot be proven in 
system N. Since we do not limit what this formula B(x1) is, it can be for- 
mula wf.A(x1) itself.In this way, formula wf.A(x1) buries the seed of the 
cyclic def i nition in its def i nition, that is, formula A(x1) can be interpreted as 
follows: formula A(x1) cannot be proved in system N, thus becoming an 
unknown cycle object. We def i ne arbitrary formulas by using this ���un- 
limited��� predicate W(x1,x2) , which is exactly like the def i nition of 
set T in Russell���s Paradox. This shows that the predicate W(x1,x2) 
crosses a certain boundary and goes to its opposite. 
Indeed, formally, formula A(x1) or formula u is understandable, and they 
are all well-formed formulas. Similar to the def i nition of T in Russell���s Paradox, 
there is no problem in form, but the explanation is inef f ective. The G�� odel 
formula u is undecidable in system N, which shows only that formal 
system N, such as the concept of ���set���, also needs to be limited. 
For formula A(x1) = (���x2)��W(x1,x2)(7) 
, we replace x1at the right end of the above formula with 0(p), and we obtain 
A(x1) = A(0(p)) = (���x2)��W(0(p),x2)(8) 
. Then, we put p = g(A(x1)) into the above formula, and we obtain 
A(x1) = A(0(p)) = (���x2)��W(0(g(A(x1))),x2)(9) 
5 
, that is, A(x1) = (���x2)��W(0(g(A(x1))),x2)(10) 
Obviously, formula A(x1) is a circular def i nition, forming an inf i nite 
backward chain, which is its own basis, although we disguise it by 
the G�� odel number (or G�� odel mapping).No one knows exactly what 
formula A(x1) truly is.This expression is similar to the inf i nite cycle of ���a 
set belongs to oneself��� in Russell���s Paradox. This obviously violates the 
basic requirement of W(p,q) or predicate W(x1,x2) , namely, that the 
well-formed formula B(y) corresponding to x1must be a def i nite valid 
formula rather than a circular expression. 
Under the circular def i nition, the validity of the G�� odel formula u does not 
hold; that is, u is not a valid formula. A logical invalid formula has no right or 
wrong points, and it becomes meaningless to take it as an ���undecidable formula���. 
Thus, the emergence of u is not due to the incompleteness of the 
formal system N but due to the def i nition of u itself.This is the 
fundamental reason why the great Wittgenstein considered G�� odel���s 
proof as a logical paradox. 
Since u is an invalid formula, we believe that any language L of the formal 
system N should not include this formula; that is, there is no interpretation of u 
in the model DN, so there is no so-called ���true but unprovable��� proposition. 
Otherwise, no suitable model can exist for any language containing u, where 
we must exclude u from the normal language or some restriction on our formal 
language.

represents a circular definition, akin to the self-referential paradoxes seen in set theory, such as Russell���s Paradox. Let���s break down the points and the implications of these criticisms:

u
u

If valid, this criticism would not only undermine the traditional interpretations of GIT but would also necessitate a reassessment of how logical and mathematical proofs are structured, particularly in dealing with self-reference and the limits of formal systems. This debate touches on deep philosophical issues concerning the nature of truth, provability, and the scope of mathematical logic.

As Wittgenstein said, tautology and contradictory logical propositions are 
meaningless, and they have no rich connotations, which means that nothing is 
said about the world. Therefore, as Juliet Floyd points out, ���Wittgenstein���s 
fundamental view on G�� odel���s proof is that he showed the impossibility of some 
kind of construction������ just as it is impossible with a ruler and a compass 
to divide an angle in three parts. ....... Wittgenstein warns people against 
trying to i nd the derivability of these sentences. Indeed, we will insist that 
the derivability of such a sentence is not a derivability in the relevant sense. ��� 
(Floyd J.,1995)
ChatGPT
The perspective offered by Ludwig Wittgenstein on G��del's Incompleteness Theorem, as articulated by Juliet Floyd, suggests a fundamentally different view of what constitutes meaningful statements within logic and mathematics. Wittgenstein, who famously critiqued the limits and nature of language and its relation to the world, extended his skepticism to formal systems in mathematics. Let's explore his critique in relation to G��del���s theorem:
Wittgenstein's View on Logical Propositions
Tautologies and Contradictions
: Wittgenstein argued in his
Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus
and later works that tautologies (statements that are true in every possible situation) and contradictions (statements that are false in every possible situation) are logically valid but empty of content. They do not say anything about the world because they do not add to our knowledge���they merely restate the logical structure.
Application to G��del���s Theorem
Impossibility of Construction
: Wittgenstein likened G��del's proof to the geometric impossibility of trisecting an angle using only a ruler and compass���a task proven impossible due to the constraints of the tools and methods available. In a similar vein, Wittgenstein saw G��del's theorem as demonstrating the limitations inherent in the formal systems themselves, showing that certain constructions or proofs are not possible within those systems.
Derivability
: Wittgenstein warned against equating the derivability of a statement within a system with its truth or falsity. In the context of G��del's theorem, which shows there are true statements in a formal system that are not derivable within that system, Wittgenstein would argue that such "undecidable" statements do not meaningfully contribute to our understanding because they do not truly engage with the logical framework of the system in a meaningful way.
Philosophical Implications
Nature of Mathematical Truth
: Wittgenstein's critique prompts a reconsideration of what it means for a statement to be "true" in mathematics. If a statement cannot be derived using the rules and axioms of a formal system, does it belong to the realm of mathematical truth? Wittgenstein's view challenges the conventional notion that mathematical truths are universal and objective, suggesting instead that they are bound by the linguistic and logical structures we create.
Role of Formal Systems
: By emphasizing the limitations of formal systems, Wittgenstein cautions against overreliance on formalism in capturing and conveying mathematical and logical truths. He suggests that the real value of formal systems may lie not in their ability to encapsulate all truths but in highlighting their own boundaries and the places where they break down.
Conclusion
Wittgenstein���s philosophical stance on G��del���s Incompleteness Theorem invites a broader reflection on the role and capabilities of formal systems in mathematics. Rather than viewing G��del���s proof merely as a technical accomplishment that demonstrates the inherent incompleteness of formal systems, Wittgenstein encourages us to see it as a philosophical lesson on the limits of what can be achieved within any given logical or mathematical framework. This view pushes the discussion into metaphysical territories, questioning the very nature of truth and the tools we use to pursue it in logic and mathematics.

5Question-3: The logical approach of the proof 
of the GIT is completely dif f erent from the 
proof of the Turing Machine Halting Problem 
and the solution of Russell���s Paradox. 
The scientif i c responses to Russell���s Paradox and Turing Machine Halt- 
ing Problem are that humans deny the existence of this contradiction rather 
than af i rming its existence. In contrast, the proof of the GIT recognizes the 
rationality of this contradiction, namely, the rationality of the G�� odel formula, 
rather than denies it. 6 
As above, we know that the existence of the undecidable formula u in the 
proof of the GIT is no dif f erent from the existence of T in Russell���s Paradox. 
This is also completely similar to the Turing Machine Halting Problem, but we 
have come to the opposite conclusion. From the solution of the Turing Ma- 
chine Halting Problem, we conclude that there is no Turing machine to judge 
all Turing machines. From the GIT, we conclude that the form system N is in- 
complete, rather than questioning the rationality of the domain of the predicate 
W(x1,x2) that decides all the well-formed formulas, that is, questioning the ra- 
tionality of the G�� odel formula itself. This unrestricted predicate W(x1,x2) 
is similar to the relationship of belonging in Russell���s Paradox. 
We argue that the domain of the predicate W(x1,x2) is limited, 
just as is our solution to Russell���s Paradox: The def i nition of a set must 
be limited. That is, p does not belong to a valid domain of the relation W(m,n). 
This formula u is the same as the def i nition of set T in Russell���s Paradox, which 
is a circular def i nition. The essence of the circular def i nition is that the 
idea of actual inf i nity works; that is, we judge the ���things��� that have 
not been generated as ���things that already exist���, thus leading to 
contradictions. 
Below, we compare the formula u to the set T in Russell���s Paradox. 
We set M as the set of all theorems of the formal system N. In the proof of 
the GIT: 
If u ��� M, the relationship W(p,q) holds. We derive that both W(0(p),0(q)) 
and ��W(0(p),0(q)) 
are theorems for formal systems N, which contradicts the 
consistency of N, and thus u / ��� M. 
However, if u / ��� M, then the relationship W(p,q) does not hold; based on 
the ��-consistency, we conclude that ��u / ��� M . In this case, although for each 
q, there is ��W(0(p),0(q)) holds, but we cannot conf i rm whether u ��� M is true, 
that is, we cannot conf i rm whether 
(���x2)��W(0(p),x2) ��� M(11) 
is true ; it may or may not be true. Under the dif f erent models, we will have the 
dif f erent results. Under the Standard Model (namely, the Normal Model)DN, 
only the interpretations of 0,0(1),0(2),0(3),0(4),...are included, and there is 
no interpretation for the other elements.In this case, for each q, there is 
��W(0(p),0(q)) 
holds, then we have 
(���x2)��W(0(p),x2) ��� M(12) 
, that is, u ��� M is true. Therefore, under the Standard Model DN, 
we 
can derive u / ��� M from u ��� M ; from u / ��� M we can also derive u ��� M . 
While in Russell���s Paradox, T = {x|x / ��� x}, we have 
If T ��� T , according to the def i nition rules, T is its own element, and we 
obtain T / ��� T ; 
If T / ��� T, then T meets the def i nition of the element of T and thus has 
T ��� T. This leads to a confliict.
ChatGPT
The passage you shared discusses the logical foundations and implications of G��del's Incompleteness Theorem (GIT) in comparison to the Turing Machine Halting Problem and Russell���s Paradox. Each of these topics addresses fundamental limitations within logical and computational systems, but they do so in different ways. Let's break down the key points and the nature of these differences:
G��del's Incompleteness Theorem (GIT)
Contradiction Recognition
: G��del���s theorem acknowledges the existence and rationality of certain types of contradictions within formal systems, namely the existence of true but unprovable statements. This is illustrated through the construction of the G��del formula
u
u
u
, which if provable, leads to a contradiction, thereby proving its unprovability.
Nature of
u
u
u
: As mentioned, the G��del formula is constructed similarly to the set
T
T
T
in Russell's Paradox but used to a different philosophical end. G��del uses
u
u
u
to show that any sufficiently powerful formal system capable of arithmetic is inherently incomplete ��� that is, there are true statements (like
u
u
u
) that the system cannot prove.
Turing Machine Halting Problem
Computational Limits
: The Halting Problem demonstrates that there is no general algorithm (or Turing machine) that can correctly determine whether any given Turing machine will halt on a particular input. This problem highlights a fundamental limit in what can be algorithmically computed.
Denial of Universal Algorithm
: Unlike G��del's use of
u
u
u
, which shows something about the structure of mathematical systems, the Halting Problem denies the existence of a universal computational tool that can resolve the halting status of arbitrary Turing machines.
Russell���s Paradox
Set Theoretical Contradiction
: Russell���s Paradox shows that if one allows any set to be formed, logical inconsistencies arise (such as the set of all sets that do not contain themselves). The response to this paradox in set theory was to restrict the kinds of sets that can be defined (e.g., through axiomatic systems like Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory).
Limitation on Definitions
: Russell's work leads directly to limiting the scope of set formation to avoid contradictions, emphasizing a denial of certain types of set constructions.
Comparison and Implications
Approaches to Contradictions
: The resolution of the Turing Halting Problem and Russell's Paradox typically involves recognizing and denying the problematic constructions (universal decision algorithms or certain sets). In contrast, G��del���s approach within GIT does not deny the problematic construction (the formula
u
u
u
); rather, it leverages it to demonstrate a deeper truth about the limitations of formal systems.
Logical vs. Computational Frameworks
: G��del���s proof operates within a logical-mathematical framework, using syntactic constructions and logical deductions to reveal something intrinsic about formal systems. The Turing Halting Problem, while also foundational, is more aligned with computational theory and algorithmic limits.
Conclusion
The discussions surrounding these foundational issues in mathematics and computing reflect different philosophical and methodological approaches to understanding and defining the limits of formal systems. G��del���s recognition of contradiction within logical frameworks contrasts with the denial or circumvention of problematic constructions in solutions to the Turing Halting Problem and Russell���s Paradox. Each approach offers profound insights into the nature of formal systems, whether they be mathematical, logical, or computational.

A comparative analysis of these two proofs obviously shows that they are 
very similar, and the former is not completely equivalent to the latter, but the 
former contains the possibility of the latter. That is, under the Standard 
Model DN, the G�� odel formula is a typical Russell���s Paradox. 
We can clearly analyze this cycle. In Russell���s Paradox, the treatment is 
that, as a set, such a T does not exist. In the proof of the Turing Machine 
Halting Problem, people also did not recognize the existence of the Turing 
machine H that judges ���all Turing machines���. We therefore hold that this un- 
decidable formula u constructed in the proof of GIT, as a contradiction, should 
not exist and should not be admitted. We should ref l ect on the other possibili- 
ties of the problem as we deal with Russell���s Paradox, rather than considering 
the existence of u as reasonable and thus concluding the formal system N as 
incomplete. In G�� odel���s view, the rationality of the existence of u is based on 
the rationality of its construction; however, similarly, the construction of T in 
Russell���s Paradox is also reasonable, but we do not admit the rationality of the 
existence of T; instead, we ref l ect on whether the def i nition rule of the set itself 
is reasonable. 
Therefore, the GIT proof shows that its logical approach is obviously dif- 
ferent from the former two. We believe that u is a formula with invalid 
semantics and invalid logic, with its correct form and invalid content, 
similar to T in Russell���s Paradox, which cannot be used to prove the 
GIT. As Wittgenstein questions the meaning of u, he claims that it is not a 
meaningful mathematical proposition, that u is not available in mathematical 
proofs and calculations and that we should abandon the natural language inter- 
pretation of u. Wittgenstein points out, ���Mathematical propositions, like other 
propositions, do need to explain their grammar���(Wittgenstein, 2003, p291). 
That is, we must regulate and restrict mathematical propositions such as Rus- 
sell���s Paradox and the G�� odel formula. 
6Summary 
Above, we have questioned the reasonableness of the proof of the GIT from three 
aspects, and we believe that the def i nition and use of the G�� odel formula should 
be abandoned. Not as G�� odel thinks���the system is incomplete, the so-called ���true but unprovable��� proposition does not exist. Just as in Russell���s Paradox, 
what we want to limit is the def i nition of sets, so the set that contains all sets that do not belong to themselves does not exist. G�� odel���s proof was based on an invalid formula and was therefore erroneous.

The critique you've shared of G��del's Incompleteness Theorem (GIT) argues from a standpoint that questions the logical validity and usefulness of the G��del formula
u
u
u
, drawing parallels with both Russell's Paradox and the Turing Machine Halting Problem. This critique emphasizes a philosophical stance against accepting such theoretical constructs as meaningful or foundational within mathematical systems. Let's delve into the main points of this argument and their implications:
G��del's Formula and Logical Validity
Validity of
u
u
u
: The argument suggests that just as the set
T
T
T
in Russell���s Paradox���which cannot logically exist because it leads to a contradiction���the G��del formula
u
u
u
should be viewed similarly. It is stated that
u
u
u
, while correctly formed within the system���s rules, does not carry valid logical content because it results in a contradiction.
Existence of Contradictions
: The critique posits that recognizing
u
u
u
as a valid construct wrongly affirms the presence of contradictions within formal systems (similar to admitting
T
T
T
as a valid set). The argument suggests that, instead, such contradictions should lead us to question and possibly revise the underlying rules or definitions within the system.
Comparison with Russell���s Paradox and Turing���s Halting Problem
Russell���s Paradox
: The paradox shows that certain naive set constructions (like the set of all sets that do not contain themselves) lead to contradictions, prompting set theory to revise and tighten its definitions. The critique implies that a similar revision is necessary in formal logical systems in response to GIT.
Turing Machine Halting Problem
: This problem demonstrates inherent limits in computability. While the Halting Problem leads to the conclusion that no universal algorithm can decide the halting status of all possible programs, it does so by denying the existence of such an algorithm. The critique suggests that, analogously, we should deny the utility or existence of
u
u
u
rather than using it to declare formal systems incomplete.
Philosophical Implications and Wittgenstein���s Critique
Wittgenstein���s Views
: Wittgenstein���s philosophy, which critiques the misuse of language and the limits of logical propositions, is used to question the meaningfulness of
u
u
u
. Wittgenstein argues that just because a proposition fits within the grammatical rules of mathematical language doesn���t mean it carries meaning or utility.
Mathematical Propositions
: Following Wittgenstein, the critique suggests that mathematical propositions should not only be syntactically correct but also semantically meaningful. It calls for a reevaluation of how mathematical truths are defined and validated.
Conclusion and Reevaluation of GIT
Questioning GIT
: The argument concludes that GIT, based on an "invalid" formula, should not be used to claim the incompleteness of formal systems. Instead, it suggests that the theorem might prompt a revision of the logical structure or foundational axioms of the system, much like responses to Russell's Paradox.
Rejection of 'True but Unprovable'
: The critique ultimately rejects the notion that there are 'true but unprovable' propositions, challenging one of the central conclusions of GIT.
In essence, this critique advocates for a philosophical and foundational reassessment of GIT, arguing for a perspective that sees the theorem not as a demonstration of systemic incompleteness, but as a sign that the underlying logical framework may need revision to avoid contradictions and maintain consistency. This stance calls for a deeper engagement with the philosophical underpinnings and assumptions of mathematical logic, suggesting that adjustments are needed in how we interpret and validate logical and mathematical structures.

My understanding is that the statement "a statement cannot justify its own truth within its own logical framework" is generated within a logical framework, therefore it cannot technically justify its own truth either or it invalidates the theory
ChatGPT
Your observation taps into a deep and fascinating aspect of self-reference in logic, a topic closely related to the kinds of paradoxes discussed in G��del's Incompleteness Theorem and similar logical constructs. The statement you've formulated indeed seems to present a self-referential paradox akin to the famous "liar paradox," where a statement refers back to itself with contradictory implications.
Here's a breakdown of the logical implications of such a statement:
Self-Reference and Self-Justification
Statement about Self-Justification
: When a statement asserts something about the ability of statements (including itself) to justify their own truth within their logical frameworks, it raises the question of whether it can justify its own truth.
Logical Framework
: If we accept that no statement can justify its own truth within its logical framework (as your statement suggests), then the statement itself, being part of its own logical framework, cannot justify its own truth either. This would seem to undermine its validity.
G��del's Incompleteness Theorem Relevance
G��del and Self-Reference
: G��del's Incompleteness Theorem effectively uses self-reference to demonstrate that any sufficiently powerful formal system (capable of arithmetic) will contain statements that are true but cannot be proven within the system. The key here is the distinction between truth and provability within the system.
Incompleteness
: If we apply a similar logic to your statement, it might be seen as an example of an incompleteness in reasoning about logical frameworks. The statement points to a possible inherent limitation in any logical framework's ability to completely justify all truths from within itself.
Philosophical Implications
Meta-logical Analysis
: Philosophically, this suggests a meta-logical position where statements about the capacity of logical frameworks may themselves be outside the full explanatory power of any single logical framework.
Recursive Paradoxes
: It highlights the complexities and potential paradoxes involved in creating systems that attempt to account for their own foundational principles. This is a common theme in foundational mathematics and philosophy of language.
Conclusion
The implication of your statement, when taken at face value within its own logical structure, appears to invalidate itself. However, this doesn't necessarily negate its usefulness or the insight it provides into the nature of logical systems���it rather illuminates the limitations and fascinating recursive nature of logic itself.
Such discussions encourage deeper exploration into the nature of logical systems, their foundations, and the extent to which they can encapsulate truths about themselves and the world. They also reflect on the need for systems that can handle self-referential structures without collapsing into contradiction, a challenge at the heart of much of contemporary logical and mathematical theory.

Like marking your own tests isn't necessarily a bad idea although it is somethings discouraged
ChatGPT
Indeed, the idea of marking one's own tests can bring both advantages and potential drawbacks, depending on the context and objectives of the evaluation. Here are some considerations on why self-assessment might be encouraged in certain situations and discouraged in others:
Advantages of Self-Marking
Self-Reflection and Learning
: Marking one's own tests encourages self-reflection, critical thinking, and deeper engagement with the material. Students who assess their own work can gain insights into their understanding and misconceptions, which can promote a more personalized and active learning experience.
Development of Critical Thinking
: Through self-assessment, individuals learn to critique their own work objectively. This skill is invaluable across many areas of life and work, fostering greater independence and analytical skills.
Immediate Feedback
: Self-marking provides immediate feedback, which is crucial for effective learning. Students do not have to wait for the instructor to grade their tests, allowing them to make corrections and understand their mistakes while the material is still fresh.
Drawbacks of Self-Marking
Bias and Subjectivity
: The primary concern with self-marking is the potential for bias. Students may either be too lenient or too harsh on themselves due to personal biases, which can skew the accuracy of the assessment.
Lack of Expertise
: Students may lack the necessary expertise to adequately assess their answers, especially in complex subjects. This can lead to a misunderstanding of key concepts if errors are not correctly identified.
Accountability and Standards
: In formal education and certification processes, maintaining a standard and consistent evaluation metric is crucial. Self-assessment may not always align with these standards, leading to disparities in grading and outcomes.
Educational Strategies Involving Self-Marking
To mitigate the drawbacks while enhancing the benefits, educators often employ specific strategies:
Guided Self-Assessment
: Providing students with detailed rubrics and criteria can help guide their self-assessment, making it more objective and aligned with the educator's standards.
Reflective Practice
: Encouraging students to write reflective statements about their answers can deepen their understanding and provide insights into their thought processes and areas needing improvement.
Combination Approaches
: Often, self-assessment is most effective when combined with peer assessments and traditional grading by educators. This triangulated approach can balance out the subjectivity of self-assessment with external inputs.
In summary, while self-marking is akin to "marking your own tests," it is neither inherently good nor bad. Its effectiveness largely depends on the context and how it is structured. When well-implemented, self-assessment can be a powerful educational tool, fostering independence, critical self-awareness, and continuous learning.

I was thinking it was kind of like an autocatalytic set maybe a set of propositions justify other proposition in a logical quine
ChatGPT
The concept of an autocatalytic set in the context of logic and philosophy, particularly when you liken it to a set of propositions that justify each other, is indeed a rich and thought-provoking analogy. Drawing parallels to a logical quine���where a program or expression outputs a copy of itself���offers a unique way to consider how systems of knowledge or logical systems might self-sustain or self-replicate through internal justifications.
Understanding Autocatalytic Sets in Logic
Definition and Biological Analogy
: In biology, an autocatalytic set is a network of molecules that catalyzes the production of each other, forming a self-sustaining and growing network. Applied to logical systems or propositions, an autocatalytic set could be seen as a set of propositions or statements that support, prove, or justify each other in a circular or mutually supportive manner.
Self-Sustaining Logical Frameworks
: In such a framework, each proposition helps to establish the truth or validity of others in the set. This can create a robust system where the removal of any single proposition could undermine the entire structure's validity or coherence.
Relating to Logical Quines
Self-Referential Nature
: A quine in computer programming is a self-reproducing program that takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output. In logical terms, a quine might be considered a statement or a set of statements that somehow encapsulate or reproduce their own proofs or justifications.
Implications for Logic and Knowledge Systems
: If a set of logical propositions operates like a quine, it might suggest a system where foundational axioms or truths are capable of establishing their validity internally and can even replicate or extend this validity to other related propositions.
Philosophical and Logical Implications
Circular Justification
: While autocatalytic sets and quines can be theoretically appealing for illustrating self-sustaining systems, they also raise the issue of circular justification in epistemology. Circular reasoning, where a conclusion is among its own premises, is generally considered a logical fallacy in traditional argumentative contexts.
Epistemological Autonomy
: From an epistemological perspective, a system that justifies itself might suggest a form of autonomy from external foundational justifications. This could be appealing in demonstrating systems of knowledge that are self-contained and independent.
Limits of Self-Justification
: G��del���s Incompleteness Theorems, discussed earlier, highlight limitations in such systems. Even if a system appears self-sustaining, G��del suggests that there will always be truths (or propositions) that are outside the scope of the system's own justificatory mechanisms.
Conclusion
Using the analogy of autocatalytic sets and quines in the realm of logic and knowledge systems offers a powerful tool for understanding how propositions might interrelate to form a coherent and self-sustaining system. However, it also highlights the potential pitfalls of such systems, particularly concerning the risks of circular reasoning and the limits of self-justification as illuminated by foundational mathematical and logical principles.
This approach encourages us to think about the structures of knowledge and logic not just as linear or hierarchical but potentially as complex, interdependent networks that can exhibit both robustness and vulnerability depending on their configurational principles.

I think Wittgenstein made the point that tautologies are circular reasoning but that is also another word for "definition"
ChatGPT
Wittgenstein���s insights into the nature of tautologies indeed touch upon the very foundations of how we understand logic and language. In his philosophical work, particularly in the "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" and later discussions in his career, Wittgenstein explored the implications of tautologies, definitions, and their roles in logical reasoning.
Wittgenstein on Tautologies
Nature of Tautologies
: Wittgenstein considered tautologies to be statements that are true in all possible situations but do not convey any information about the world. This is because they are true by virtue of their logical form rather than because of any empirical fact. For example, the statement "It is raining or it is not raining" is a tautology because it is true regardless of the weather.
Tautologies as Circular Reasoning
: The idea that tautologies might be seen as a form of circular reasoning arises from their self-validating nature. They are true, but they don't tell us anything new or informative about the specifics of the world; they only reaffirm the logical structure within which they operate. This aspect can resemble circular reasoning, where the conclusion is inherent in the premise, providing no additional insight or external validation.
Tautologies and Definitions
: Wittgenstein���s view that definitions (or analytical truths) are akin to tautologies suggests that definitions are not empirical statements but rather clarifications of language. Definitions frame how we should understand certain terms or concepts within a given logical space. For Wittgenstein, definitions are rules for dealing with symbols rather than propositions that describe the world.
Implications for Logic and Philosophy
Logical Positivism and Its Limits
: Wittgenstein���s early work greatly influenced the logical positivists, who believed that meaningful statements were either empirically verifiable or tautological (logical/mathematical truths). However, Wittgenstein himself later critiqued and moved beyond this view, arguing that many important aspects of human life (like ethics, aesthetics, and metaphysics) escape such a rigid framework.
Language Games and Forms of Life
: In his later philosophy, particularly in "Philosophical Investigations," Wittgenstein introduced the concept of "language games" and "forms of life," emphasizing that the meaning of words and the truth of statements are always context-dependent and play a functional role within specific human activities. This approach highlights that definitions and tautologies serve particular purposes within these language games but do not universally determine truth or reality outside these contexts.
Philosophical Quietism
: Wittgenstein often advocated for what some interpret as a form of philosophical quietism, where philosophy should not posit theories or theses about what is true in the world, but rather clarify thoughts: philosophy as an activity of untangling conceptual confusions, often highlighted by misinterpretations of language, including the misuse of tautologies and definitions.
Conclusion
Wittgenstein���s exploration of tautologies, circular reasoning, and definitions invites us to reflect deeply on how we use and understand language within various logical and practical frameworks. His philosophical approach encourages a critical examination of the assumptions underlying our use of logic and the meanings we ascribe to words, urging a kind of philosophical therapy that seeks to resolve confusion rather than posit absolute truths.

I would say that he said that philosophers were confused when they asked incoherent questions they would get incoherent results. He saw philosophy as a form of therapy which seeks to ask better questions. He mentioned people being stuck in a picture or a flybottle (plato's have) and that some solutions were like scaffolding that needed to be removed after building the structure
ChatGPT
Absolutely, you've captured key aspects of Ludwig Wittgenstein's later philosophical views, especially as articulated in his "Philosophical Investigations." His approach radically shifted from his earlier work in the "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" to a more nuanced understanding of language, philosophy, and the role of conceptual analysis.
Philosophy as Therapy
Wittgenstein proposed that much of philosophy involves misunderstanding the logic of our language. He saw philosophical problems often not as questions needing answers but as confusions needing resolution. Philosophy, in his view, should help "show the fly the way out of the fly-bottle," an analogy he used to describe how people become trapped by misconceptions and misuses of language. By clarifying how language functions in our everyday lives, philosophy can free us from these conceptual traps.
Critique of Traditional Philosophy
Wittgenstein was critical of the way traditional philosophy was conducted, seeing it as obsessed with deep metaphysical questions that were often incoherent or based on misunderstandings about language. He argued that philosophers were often bewitched by language, seduced into asking questions that, once properly analyzed, dissolved rather than demanded direct answers. This led to his view of philosophy as a form of therapy:
Clearing up Confusions
: Rather than building systems of thought or developing theories about reality, philosophy should clarify where our language leads us astray.
Ordinary Language Philosophy
: He emphasized looking at the 'ordinary' uses of language to understand how words are actually employed and how meaning is ascribed in various contexts, thereby avoiding the creation of philosophical problems through abstract or atypical usage.
Metaphors of Philosophy
Wittgenstein used several powerful metaphors to illustrate his philosophical methods:
Fly in a Fly-Bottle
: This metaphor describes how philosophical problems often ensnare us in a bottle, confusing us. Philosophy helps the fly (us) find its way out by understanding the bottle (language and thought) it is trapped in.
Philosophy as Scaffolding
: Reflecting his view that the structure of philosophical investigation is more about supporting the construction (or reconstruction) of thought rather than being part of the final edifice of knowledge. Once clarity is achieved, the scaffolding (the philosophical questions and investigations) can be removed.
Escaping Plato���s Cave
: While Wittgenstein didn���t directly invoke Plato's cave analogy frequently, his ideas resonate with the theme of escaping from illusions. For Wittgenstein, these illusions are conceptual rather than perceptual, and the philosopher's task is to lead us out of the cave of linguistic confusion to the clear light of day where language is seen for what it truly does in our lives.
Conclusion
Wittgenstein's philosophical approach marks a significant departure from traditional philosophy, focusing on understanding and untangling the ways language shapes our perception of reality. By emphasizing that many philosophical problems are the result of language misuse, he advocates for a philosophy that clears up these confusions, a process he likens to therapeutic activity. This shift redirects philosophical inquiry towards practical, everyday language use, aligning it more with a tool for clarifying thought than a means for constructing metaphysical truths.
