My name is Gummo. I'm a hacker. I've been a hacker for the past 36 years and I'm here
to tell my story. My story started pretty young. I was born and raised in Jacksonville,
grew up absolutely dirt poor and I had an older brother. I had two older brothers,
one half brother and a natural sibling and all of us grew up in Jacksonville. Growing up in Jacksonville,
you know, we only had a mom or mother. She raised us by herself, all three of us, the best that
she could. She was an alcoholic and she did the best raising three boys. My mom passed away
when I was 12 years old in 1985 and I actually woke up on December the 7th, 1985 and pulled the
covers back and there was my mom. Ever since then, I've been on my own. My brother and I,
we went to go live with my aunt but she failed at that miserably and my father was in prison so
there was no choice really but to live with friends of the family which which we did for a
little while and my brother, he was about a year and a half older than me so he was much more
a free spirit and so he he just went on went on his way, went on to do his thing at 16 years old.
By that time I'm 14 and a half and you know really on my own and that's when I discovered
computers right. Actually, I discovered computers about three years earlier before my mother passed
away. Never really gave any consideration to her other than you know any other normal kid at
the age of eight, nine, ten. So it sat until my mother passed away and before she passed away,
the night that the night actually that she passed away, she had come home from graduation on my
half brother had graduated basic training at Fort Benning and the thing she told me before she
went to bed was she asked me how my computer studies were coming along and I lied to her
right and I said they were going great. In actuality, I really wasn't doing anything.
Then she passed right and then I you know you deal with what you can deal with when you're
12, 13 years old and my outlet was computers. First, you know I withdrew like any other kid does,
I guess I don't know and second of all I began to master my computer. I had a TRS-80 model
too and I taught myself how to code basic and for a couple years that's where I was right.
When people would ask me if I was fine, yeah I'm fine, yeah but you know my grades were really
disastrous. I had a couple friends that I really engaged with but no one too in particular but
I did withdraw even more into my computer right that I got an acoustical modem connected that
to a local bulletin board and begin to meet other people, begin to meet other people like me and
then you know people ask about you right you know they want to know who you are and you know back
then the internet was the internet really wasn't what people think it is now it was more or less
dial-up boards, ARPANET, closed loop systems, such things that of that such and but I set up a
bulletin board on a local BBS system and at the ripe old age of 14 started to meet other
hackers online and I started to learn a lot of cool things like like telephone freaking like how
to make free phone calls. I discovered a subculture of people who existed on the phone lines on the
telephone lines where they where you could talk to someone you know in London or in Paris or in
Georgia or LA and you can meet these people on the telephone on the these telephone party line so
to speak and so that was so you know 14 years old I'm learning how to freak telephone systems
freaking telephone systems was a way to actually access the old telephone systems the old bell
systems with special instructions and codes and methods which are which have long since expired
since you know the telephone system has gone digital but so 14 years old I'm learning you know
I'm learning how to you know code myself I've set up a bulletin board I'm meeting hackers and I'm
getting advice I'm learning how to do things I'm learning how to get the things that I need right
because I'm living with friends of the family and they really you know they they too themselves were
barely able to support me much barely themselves as well so everything that I had to do was for
myself right everything from food to money for money for clothes for school everything my entire
existence depended on my willingness to make sure that I was taking care of myself and so that's
what I learned how to do I learned how to at the age of 15 years old I took a bell and howl
language master and I learned how to reprogram credit cards to use them in stores and in ATMs
back before ATMs really had a dedicated ATM line to verify the transaction and of course I would
understand the batching process and all that but those that was that was 32 years ago and I just
learned how to manipulate things to get the things that I wanted whether it was printing a UPC
code for food from the store which I needed or doing the the the magnetic gas handle flip back
in those days when you need a gas for your car there was a dial on the on the gas pump and you
would flip the dial on and off well if you were to take if you took a an old-fashioned speaker
magnet and set it next to the handle that would flip it up and engage the pump the pump would
begin to run to distribute gas in those but it with the numbers went in turn and so that was so
I kept learning these tricks right I kept learning little tricks to survive survivability tricks
learning how to social engineer people to get what I wanted whether it was access to a specific
computer that I wanted to dial in to steal some files from or whether or not it was to convince
this the supermarket manager that I'd actually dad left some food behind when in turn I actually
hadn't just so I could eat that night so you know just growing up letting meeting hackers on the
online people people giving me what I felt like was worthwhile advice to survive to to be able to
you know not not wind up in a bad situation and that's that's exactly how I kept by myself from
falling apart from going under living with and all of the while right I'm still living with
friends of the family 1989 comes around I'm I'm 16 17 years old the friends of the family really
had enough of me living there so the official parting of ways right so there I am I just turned
17 years old and I'm on my own I have a I had a Chevrolet Chevette a 1984 Chevrolet
Chevette no a 1982 Chevrolet Chevette powder blue and all of my stuff was in there and
including including my TRS 80 model too and I went I lived in my car for for for the better
part of the entire year of 1989 and it was tough right it was you know I dropped out of school
I began to lose focus I began began stealing cars began using my skills in very very unique
fashions to obtain money quickly because when you're living in your car what what choice do you have
so yeah I did that for about a year and then I met then I met a girl and she became a girlfriend
and ultimately she became a wife and she helped me she helped me realize what what I was capable
of of doing and her family took me in and I went I went and got her we got a job you know just
bagging groceries and shit and just kept doing that right you know someone someone will leave
it in me you know and still sticking to computers had a daughter my daughter who turns 30 this
December my daughter my wife and I had a daughter and I realized that you know I needed to needed
to do better needed to do more provide more for for my wife and my daughter and so there I am
bagging groceries working at working in retail stores and actually working hard and continuing my
computer studies teaching myself how see cobalt Fortran all of the old languages teaching myself
computer languages and taking care of a wife and a kid $5 an hour and kept doing that and about
about two years into that I got the opportunity I saved up enough money to go to the chaos Congress
in Germany which is an annual conference of hackers from all around the world and I met some some
some some hackers like me who had who had not only been through a struggle but were continuing to
get to a struggle and I met a I met a good I met a I met a friend of mine his name was Boris
Floric he went by the hacker named Tron and we became really good friends and Boris and I we we
worked on a lot of smart card systems together he taught me about smart cards that the little chip
card in your wallet that everyone carries around you know that thing what's in your wallet and at
the time no one really knew what smart cards were they were only used extensively in Europe at the
time and so Boris taught me about smart cards these things that have a computer a microprocessor in
them and he taught me that these things control many things from from television access to telephone
access to making and receiving long-distance calls and so we worked on a crypto card scheme
together to where we were able to actually reverse engineer about five different providers who
issued chip cards smart cards for their services we successfully decrypted those services and with
that knowledge you know after we became friends after a couple years we we began to converse back
and forth you know at that at that point this is 94 and now I'm attending the Chaos Congress each
year and meeting with Boris and we're chatting back and forth on this you know all kinds of
technology most specifically smart cards about that time here in the United States huge huge space
systems was ready to launch a system called Direct TV back then actually was called DSS the
digital satellite system and and Hughes built the system from the ground up and I was interested in
that the reason I was interested in that because at this point it's 1995 my father had just been
released from prison and so I go to visit him and he's watching television I said oh dad what is that
he's like oh it's a satellite system called Direct TV here and I was amazed by the the picture quality
and how how great it looked and and it all came on a little small 18 inch dish so that that was
pretty fascinating and and I looked at the system and and I'd realized that was it was it was controlled
all of the authorizations were controlled by you know you guessed it a smart card so I it really
took very little to no effort between Boris and I to collaborate on the Direct TV F card which
basically was a smart card that allowed authorization for customers to receive HBO all of the channels
right pay per views etc and we successfully created a quite little humble system to reprogram
those cards and you know laughed it off really didn't think anything of the weirs after that
and then several months passed right busy busy couple years I'm going I'm going to school
and and actually working at a at a carpet cleaning company and just really just surviving paying the
bills and continuing to enhance my skills and I'm like oh well you know the hell with it you know
let's I really need some more money you know my daughter's you know getting ready to go into
school and so I wanted to put her into school and so I decided to sell my weirs for programming
Direct TV satellite access cards and so that's what I did I I realized that it was very easy to make
money doing doing providing a service for people who did not wish to pay their bill
so I really I really tried to I really wanted to one up my game right so Boris and I we went
together on some extensible ideas and we created some software that we sold to the Canadians
and we we made some money right we made we made you know 10 million dollars each
and I was able to get everything that I wanted and so did Boris and it was great but there was
there are a lot more factors than just Boris and I releasing code there were other in mitigating
factors you had an entire battalion of hackers from Rupert Murdoch's and trying to actually
circumvent other services and competitors out there to destroy them which they ultimately did
but that's a whole other story so HAC Direct TV for a few years and made some money went to got caught
and then after I got caught I was I was offered offered an opportunity right rather than to
go and sit in prison for a long time I was asked to consult and helping a company at that time
called NDS to help them solve their conditional access problem which at that point you know their
entire the entire direct TV system was completely compromised and NDS was looking for a way to
close the stamp out piracy so consulted with some good minds in Haifa Israel for a couple years
and went on my way came back to Jacksonville after hanging out consulting securing the direct TV
period four card helping helping a lot with that technology moving on coming back home
my name sort of floated out in the wrong direction this this guy who was doing the direct TV cards he
his wife was a dispatcher and she had actually she obtained my information
and then my wife's information and then my family's information and and and pretty much doxxed me at
that point and back then doxxing someone was really a terrifying thing as such it is now right when
someone doxxes you and post your information on the internet it's a shitty thing to go through and
in my in my circumstance I had a lot of a lot more a lot more things that I was involved with with
the government so with with a lot of help from the government and my own self my self motivation
now it was I moved I moved to Indiana I packed up the kids packed everything and moved to Indiana
it's just gonna really kind of lay low for a while you know I just got back from Israel
moved from Florida to Indiana and really just kind of you know chilled out I got a little job I got
a job at a newspaper and you know handle their websites and all of that real low-key
real low-tech job nothing fancy living in the middle of a cornfield so to speak and and enjoyed
it enjoyed the life for a couple years and then I was asked to and then a gentleman I met in Indiana
invited me up to Chicago to take a look at his business to see what sort of technical advice
I could give him for his business and so travel to Chicago sort of you know got to know him
within several days he got to know who I really was about my my background and I went to work for him
and at this point right you know now I have a job and I'm doing I'm setting up you know
IT infrastructure for his company and and making sure that all of his offices connect
and not only that but securely right cyber security really wasn't a thing then
it it was barely even mentioned but you know but cyber security to me right to what exists now or
what people realize as cyber security now to me is just an afterthought or was an afterthought
still sort of is mentally speaking because you know things that people are writing papers about
talking about creating solutions about these are all things that are built on technologies
that were built when the internet was created right you're everybody's you know talking about
1970s technology and no one's really trying to fix the problem but yeah yeah so I provided cyber
security for him his company set up the whole deal and then just started meeting new friends
along the way in Chicago that's how it is in Chicago and one thing led to another I met a
gentleman named Willard Harper Willard Buddy Harper and he he worked at the CME in Chicago
he was one of the largest hog traders in in the world really and he gave me an opportunity to
create some special networks for the CME to connect to the NYSE and so with that after doing
several of those you know meaning you know they were really simple for me but I created some
ultra high-speed private networks that only the CME and the NYSE still use and so he was impressed
with that and he's like what else can you do and I'm like just so people know that Chicago
mercantile exchange and the New York Stock Exchange that is correct yes yeah so I set up two bi-directional
unique fiber lines specifically for those two exchanges and secured them so yeah he asked me
what was next so I'm like hey there's this thing called Bitcoin uh I'm kind of it kind of piques
my interest and he asked me what I needed uh I said you know about a million bucks would work and
he literally opened up a file cabinet to add a million dollars and he's like all right go to it
and that's what I did at that point I built I built a supercomputer that was able to mine Bitcoin
uh mind about 5000 Bitcoin and at that point I believe they were Bitcoin was trading at 200 to
300 dollars a coin and so he was impressed and so was I actually and so we built three more
over the next eight months I built three more uh and had them right there at 107 West Van Buren
Street uh across from the CME uh and just sucking up electricity um but uh at the at the end of that
year and a half run uh we were able to mine uh close to 80 000 Bitcoin so yeah uh kind of uh
kind of you know after a couple years of doing that I really felt uh a little a little sense of
accomplishment but I really didn't feel like it was done so I ran into a gentleman um so I'm just
kind of I'm squandering around Chicago right I've made you know some Bitcoin you know I'm hanging out
you know walking around the loop you know hanging out in Millennial Park and just hanging out with
my friends uh and it kind of kicking back and I met a gentleman and he said hey you know our company
needs a webmaster right and a webmaster is just basically someone who did just does web work for
a company I'm like okay yeah sure yeah I'll come and be your webmaster right because having a job
having a legitimate job completes who I am right I could sit around and and do whatever I want to
make money but in the end I think it's about working an honest nine to five and so yeah yeah
hey Jackson I'll go and work you'd be a webmaster at your software company and so I went to work there
as their webmaster and and it was it was hilarious right their their their vice presidents they're
like well this is a very important job and you should blah blah blah and I'm yes sir and you know
and yes ma'am and and I really kept the ruse up as long as I could but I was outed by a friend of mine
that worked there and he outed me to the marketing manager and the marketing manager she outed me to
the entire staff and eventually I became responsible for their cybersecurity practice and so I'm like
well shit I guess I'm doing cybersecurity so here I am doing cybersecurity for a software company in
Chicago unintended right but honing my skills right figuring out figuring out the best method for
to to stand up specific protocols and systems and and things of that nature from a cybersecurity
perspective and so that's what I did and did it pretty well but then they fired me then they just
they fired me and so yeah it was kind of a thing between the owner and myself he didn't like me and
I surely didn't like him so now that that's public I really didn't like him so after that right
I just took a couple gigs as cybersecurity you know just kind of you know just did my thing
packed up my stuff the entire time in Chicago and came back to Jacksonville and again you know
doing consulting with a company for cybersecurity and I enjoyed it but
um that's what led me to where I am now right from from some of those angles
I've been responsible for putting some heavy hitters away I've worked with law enforcement
in in the past some real heavy hitters they you know I'm really good at hunting hackers
and finding people and finding and not finding not finding just people just
but finding the real the real the real hacker right the real hacker that's really causing me
am I'm that guy that looks for that hacker and I do that I do that very seriously and continue to
do that because I provide my service not only for companies right but for celebrities and and
stars right they they consult with me I I work with them personally and to solve any cybersecurity
questions or issues that they have you know some of the some of the things that people don't
understand is that everyone carries around a smartphone you know watching watching Edward
Snowden you know do all of this ridiculousness hiding under covers and everything everyone
should know that your smartphone is a PC is a portable computer and the things that that
smartphones are capable of doing are are are very terrifying um there there just recently was
an exploit that I had used for years for iOS that allowed me to actually listen in on your phone
conversations to read your SMS messages to read your email to actually see everything that you do
on your eye iOS device and those those those sort of those sort of exploits exists everywhere
in everything almost everything has a GPS chip in it almost every device has a chip in it and if
it has a chip in it it can be exploited and when when things are exploited sometimes
devices things systems and people are exploited for one reason or another
you know there's there's a lot of things that are very scary out there there there are right now
there's there are people selling your information they are selling your they're selling your Wi-Fi
network they're selling your Wi-Fi credentials they're selling your ancestry.com genealogy
you know data they're selling all of that there's the the thing that people don't really understand
is that there really is no more privacy in this world unless you go and live on an island somewhere
in the South Pacific with no electricity and no other people there there are things to be taken
advantage of and systems and devices and and so on you know it takes it takes a professional car
thief about 30 seconds to steal a car now because you really don't need to hotwire anything or use
a screwdriver or even a laptop you can use an an RF intercept or intercepting device which
could do a man in the middle attack with just a key fob and you can steal someone's you know
$150,000 car with that there there the technology stacks out there are endless to that are being
taken advantage of most most notably are the cellular systems the the mobile systems what
people care around most are contain the most value and the most data putting your information on
putting your information on tick tock you know creating a tick tock account and and filming
from so many locations you don't realize what you're really doing is you're really you're really
giving everything that you you hold possessive and private out to the world and that's where we
see people being attacked people being their their bank accounts being compromised etc
speaking of bank accounts a lot of people realize that you know that when you log into your bank
and a lot of banks will really deny this but banks actually have back doors into their
and into your accounts into your system just think about it for a moment when you log into
your bank account you know through such and such dot com and you have to answer all of these ridiculous
questions and get a two-factor SMS message sent to you so you can enter in the code but people
really don't realize is that their banks also have backdoor access to where applications like your
TurboTax and your your your your money management software all of that how do you think that connects
to your banks and so with these backdoor connections into banks things continue to be
inherently insecure you we see data breaches every day where millions of people have their
information stolen and not only stolen but you know sold and used against them
one of the one of the things that we also have to realize is that we have quantum computers
coming quantum computers will make all current and former encryption algorithms absolutely
obsolete so if you have something that you've encrypted in the past or you have some encrypted
files and they've been anywhere on the internet in a book wherever someone else can access your
encrypted files well very soon those files won't remain encrypted long and so hopefully
you know those uh those secrets were quite well encrypted
websites websites have so many flaws in them if you go everybody needs a website nowadays
everybody has a website to go to their favorite website
right now about 90% of the the web and the technologies that support them in your applications
and websites they're they're insecure they're inherently insecure whether or not it's a web
server running an open port or a misconfigured file on your server there's something that
there there's there's there's a little bit of something out there for everyone to take advantage
of and there's and now everyone is paying the price everyone now is becoming victims to these
crimes to where they thought they weren't a victim they where they never thought that they
would actually be potentially be a victim the more mobile applications the more people that
are using the phones that we just you know the more people that use mobile devices require more
mobile applications require more more data centers require more servers for those applications to
connect to and those are all at risk you know it really all you have to do is you know do a dns
query on anyone's web domain and you can begin to uncover the pieces of of how insecure most
organizations and individuals are people don't realize that they are you know when they're at
home they they put a password on their their router and they think that's it that's you know
I'm safe I'm secure but no one no one really understands the context of you know using an
additional layer of protection like a VPN or or some sort of ad blocking technology and
and people don't realize that their IP address is is basically like a flag out there on the
internet for them and for them to be discovered for them to be stalked harassed intimidated
swatted it doesn't matter and so it all come it all comes with understanding you know these these
technologies and understanding how to protect ourselves and how to protect yourself against
bad people wearing hoodies and cloaks as I said not all hackers are bad people
most hackers everyone is a hacker if it weren't for hackers we would not have Wi-Fi we wouldn't
have cameras we wouldn't have many things that we take for granted today criminals are the ones
that give hackers a bad name criminals are the ones who are breaking into systems and stealing
information and creating data breaches criminals are the ones who are stalking people and bad
context and stealing from others who don't who don't belong not hackers and so you know it's
been said before and here I am saying it too right hackers are not bad people criminals are bad
people but hackers know my thing now right is to to tell my story to tell people that you know
hackers really aren't bad people hackers really have a story to tell too you know I have a story
to tell and I'm telling it and I'm almost done telling it but you know we're just like anyone
else we we we live we breathe we we have feelings we we actually we actually overindulge in our
feelings because we wonder what people are always doing and what the next best thing is
you know I painted my my pinky pink back in 2006 because a friend of mine I was visiting a friend
of mine in Fort Myers and her daughter came and tugged on me she said hey why are you such a bad
hacker why don't you be a good hacker and do good things and ever since then man you know I've
advocated for doing good things with your skills helping people helping others you know not not
doing something for yourself doing something for others making sure that making sure that you know
your mom and dad wakes up in the morning without their shit being you know sold on a on a dark
market and to help and to help people right to help people achieve their goals to help people
understand who they are not just by where they've been or what they've seen in the shit that they've
been through but to under to help people understand how to get to where they're going by telling them
what what I've been through the shit that I've been through you know I've been through some real
shit in my life but that that's never deterred me from becoming who I am and who I expect to be
and it really hasn't stopped me from helping others and and showing other people the way
you know with this pink with this pink pinky nail now you know that young lady just got married this
year and that's that's my goal right to help as many ladies as many women as as many females
get into cyber security dude it's not just a guys thing it's just not where a sausage
fest of guys walking around saying they hack something it's about people who are critical
thinkers who contribute who care and have empathy and share their knowledge that's what it's about
and that's what I'm here to help people understand and to help people and encourage people to do
with their skills yeah man um I've seen a lot I've been through a lot I have my jump bag right here
with with my bitcoin collection on them and I'll show mark after but the only thing that the only
thing that I can encourage people to do is never give up always hold your head high and never ever
ever ever consider giving up no matter how tough things may get because one way or another you'll
find a way you'll find a path and so hopefully what I've said hopefully my story helps I don't know
but um if it reaches one person and it gives someone that motivation to say hey you know
I can do that too you know I can get from living in cars to consulting with you know
celebrities and and governments you know well then you can do it too so
there's nothing that you can't do there's nothing that we can't do it's only it's only about
what you choose to do and the decisions that we all make and so I choose to do the right thing
I choose to make the right decisions and I choose to make uh the right call and so
so that's my story all right thank you guys thanks
