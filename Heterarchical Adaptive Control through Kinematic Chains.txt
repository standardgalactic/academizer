Abstract:Living systems face both environmental complexity and limited access to free-energy resources. Survival under these conditions requires a control system that can activate, or deploy, available perception and action resources in a context specific way. In this Part I, we introduce the free-energy principle (FEP) and the idea of active inference as Bayesian prediction-error minimization, and show how the control problem arises in active inference systems. We then review classical and quantum formulations of the FEP, with the former being the classical limit of the latter. In the accompanying Part II, we show that when systems are described as executing active inference driven by the FEP, their control flow systems can always be represented as tensor networks (TNs). We show how TNs as control systems can be implemented within the general framework of quantum topological neural networks, and discuss the implications of these results for modeling biological systems at multiple scales.

this question, by providing a completely general, scale-free 
formal framework for describing interactions between physical 
systems in cognitive terms. It is based on the Free Energy 
Principle (FEP), i rst introduced in neuroscience [1]���[5] before 
being extended to living systems in general [6]���[9] and then to 
all self-organizing systems [10]���[13]. The FEP states that any 
system that interacts with its environment weakly enough to 
maintain its identif i ability over time 1) has a Markov blanket 
(MB) that separates its internal states from the states of its 
environment [14]���[18] and 2) behaves over time in a way 
that asymptotically minimizes a variational free energy (VFE) 
measured at its MB. Equivalently, the FEP states that any 
system with a non-equilibrium steady-state (NESS) solution 
to its density dynamics (and hence an MB) will act so as 
to maintain its state in the vicinity of its NESS. Any system 
compliant with the FEP can be described as engaging, at all 
times, in active inference: a cyclic process in which the system 
observes its environment, updates its probabilistic ���Bayesian 
beliefs��� (i.e., posterior or conditional probability densities) 
over future behaviors, and acts on its environment so as to test 
its predictions and gain additional information. The internal 
dynamics of such a system can be described as inverting 
a generative model (GM) of its environment that furnishes 
predictions of the consequences of its actions on its MB. 
As a fully-general principle, the FEP applies to all phys- 
ical systems, not just to behaviorally interesting, plausibly 
cognitive systems, such as organisms or autonomous robots 
[10]. Intuitively, behavior is interesting ��� to external observers 
and, we can assume, to the behaving system itself ��� when 
it is complex, situation-appropriate, and robust in the face 
of changing environmental conditions. Friston et al. [13] 
characterize interesting systems as ���strange particles���, whose 
internal (i.e., cognitive) states are inf l uenced by their actions 
only via perceived environmental responses; such systems 
have to ���ask questions��� of their environments in order to get 
answers [19]. Such systems, even bacteria and other basal 
organisms [20]���[23], have multiple ways of observing and 
acting upon their environments and deploy these resources in 
context-sensitive ways. In operations-research language, they 
exhibit situational awareness, i.e., awareness of the context of 
actions [24], and deploy attention systems to manage the infor- 
mational, thermodynamic, and metabolic costs of maintaining 
such awareness [12], [22]. Situational awareness is dependent

on both short- and long-term memory, or more technically, 
on the period of time over which precise (Bayesian) beliefs 
exist, sometimes referred to as the temporal depth or horizon 
of the GM [20], [21]. Upper limits can, therefore, be placed on 
behavioral complexity by examining the capacity and control 
of memory systems from the cellular scale [25] upwards. Liv- 
ing systems from microbial mats to human societies employ 
stigmergic memories [22] and hence have ���extended minds��� 
[26] in the sense of the literature on embodied, embedded, 
enactive, extended, and affective (4EA) cognition [27], [28].

The introduction of the article posits that living systems exhibit complex multi-level control systems while also being made up of simpler physical components. The challenge is to unify these perspectives. The article employs the Free Energy Principle (FEP) as a general framework to describe interactions between these systems and their environment. According to FEP, any system interacting with its environment minimizes its "variational free energy," essentially aiming for an optimal state. This behavior is termed active inference: the system observes its environment, updates its Bayesian beliefs, and takes actions accordingly.
The principle is general enough to apply not only to cognitive systems like humans or robots but also to simpler organisms like bacteria. Such systems maintain "situational awareness," where they adapt to environmental conditions while managing informational and metabolic costs. The article also discusses the role of memory in constraining behavioral complexity, mentioning that living systems employ "stigmergic memories," contributing to what is termed as "extended minds."
The central goal is to understand how these systems maintain complexity and adaptability within the constraints of their physical makeup and environmental conditions.

Any system with multiple perception���action (or stimulus��� 
response) capabilities requires a control system that enables 
context-guided perception and action and precluding the con- 
tinuous, simultaneous deployment of all available perception��� 
action capabilities. Such self organization entails the selection 
of a particular course of action ��� i.e., policy ��� from all 
plausible policies entertained by the system���s GM. In the 
active inference framework, the system���s internal states ��� 
hence its GM ��� can be read as encoding posterior probability 
densities (i.e., Bayesian beliefs) over the causes of its sensory 
states, including, crucially, its own actions. This leads to the 
notion of planning and control as inference [29]���[31], with 
the ensuing selection of an action given by the most likely 
policy. In bacteria such as E. coli, for example, mutual inhi- 
bition between gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for different 
metabolic operons permit the expression of specif i c carbon- 
source (e.g., sugar) metabolism pathways only when the target 
carbon source is detected in the environment [32]. The control 
of foraging behavior via chemotaxis employs a similar, in 
this case bistable, mechanism [33]. Such mechanisms are 
active in multicellular morphogenesis, for example, in the 
head-versus-tail morphology decision in planaria [34]. In the 
human brain, mutual inhibition between competing visual 
processing streams is evident in binocular rivalry (switching 
between distinct scenes presented to left and right eyes) or 
in the changing interpretations of ambiguous i gures such as 
the Necker cube [35], [36]; similar competitive effects are 
observed in other sensory pathways [37]. It also characterizes 
the competitive interaction between the dorsal and ventral 
attention systems, which implement top-down and bottom- 
up targeting of sensory resources, respectively [38]. It is 
invoked at a still larger scale in global workspace models of 
conscious processing, in which incoming information streams 
must compete, with each inhibiting the others, for ���access to 
consciousness��� [39], [40]. Mutual inhibition creates an ener- 
getic barrier that the control system that implements switching 
must expend free-energy resources to overcome; the controller 
must not only turn ���on��� the preferred system, but also turn 
���off��� the inhibition. The required free energy expenditure 
in turn induces hysteresis and hence the non-linear, winner- 
takes-all ���switch��� behavior in the time regime. Such barriers 
and their temporal consequences persist in more complex 
control systems whenever two perception���action capabilities 
are either functionally incompatible or too expensive to deploy 
simultaneously. 
Switching between perception���action capabilities can be 
regarded, from a theoretical, FEP perspective, as selecting 
a plausible policy, or plan, supported by the GM. Techni- 
cally, the probability distribution over policies or plans can 
be computed from a free energy functional expected under 
the posterior predictive density over possible outcomes, as 
described in ��II-A below. The control system that implements 
the switching process can be considered to employ the GM to 
predict, or assign a probability distribution to, each perception- 
action capability (i.e., policy) as a function of context [41], 
[42]. We can consider the GM to generate probabilistic 
���beliefs��� about the consequences of actions, where here a 
���belief��� is just a mathematically-described structure, e.g., a 
classical conditional probability density or a quantum state 
with an assigned amplitude. ���Planning��� or ���control��� can, 
therefore, always be cast as inference ��� again in the basal 
sense of computation ��� implemented by variational message 
passing or ���belief propagation��� on a (normal style) factor 
graph: a graph with nodes corresponding to the factors of 
a probability distribution and undirected edges corresponding 
to message-passing channels. Factor graphs can be combined 
with message passing schemes, with the messages generally 
corresponding to suff i cient statistics of the factors in question, 
to provide an eff i cient computation of functions such as 
marginal densities [43], [44]. Hence one can formalize control 
��� under the FEP ��� in terms of control as inference, which 
implies that there is a description of control in terms of 
message passing on a factor graph. When the GM is over 
discrete states, this implies a description of control in terms 
of tensor operators. 
Nearly all simulations of planning ��� under discrete state 
space GMs ��� use the factor-graph formalism. Crucially, the 
structure of the factor graph embodies the structure of the 
GM and, effectively, the way that any system represents the 
(apparent causes of) data on its MB; i.e., the way it ���carves 
nature at its joints,��� into states, objects and categorical features. 
Under the (classical) FEP, the factors that constitute the nodes 
of the factor graph correspond to the state-space factoriza- 
tion in a mean i eld approximation, as used by physicists, 
or by statisticians to implement variational Bayesian (a.k.a., 
approximate Bayesian) inference [45]. See [46] for technical 
details, [47] for an application to the brain, and Supplementary 
Information, Table 1 for a list of selected applications.

This section delves into the complexities of control systems in active inference frameworks, focusing on how such systems select specific courses of action, or policies, based on their Generative Models (GMs). The GMs encode posterior probabilities, essentially the system's Bayesian beliefs, about what it perceives and how it should act. The concept is extended to planning and control as forms of inference.
The text discusses various examples across biological scales, from gene regulation in E. coli bacteria to decision-making processes in the human brain. Mutual inhibition is a recurring theme, wherein different pathways or systems inhibit each other, requiring energy to overcome this inhibition for a switch in action to occur. Such mutual inhibition plays a role in tasks as diverse as bacterial foraging and human visual processing.
From a technical standpoint, the control systems are formalized under the Free Energy Principle (FEP) through factor graphs. These graphs are mathematical structures that allow for efficient computation in terms of message-passing and enable the conversion of control into an inference problem. Factor graphs are particularly useful in simulations involving discrete state spaces.
The factor graph's structure is crucial as it embodies the GM and how the system interprets data. Under classical FEP, these factors correspond to state-space factorizations used in mean-field approximations, familiar in both physics and statistics for variational Bayesian inference.
In summary, this part outlines a unified framework for understanding control systems in living organisms, spanning multiple scales and complexities, through the lens of active inference and the Free Energy Principle.

We show in Parts I and II of this paper that control l ow in 
such systems can always be formally described as a tensor 
network, a factorization of some overall tensor (i.e., high- 
dimensional matrix) operator into multiple component tensor 
operators that are pairwise contracted on shared degrees of 
freedom [48]. In particular, we show that the factorization 
conditions that allow the construction of a TN are exactly the 
same as those that allow the identif i cation of distinct, mutually 
conditionally independent (in quantum terms, decoherent), 
sets of data on the MB, and hence allow the identif i cation 
of distinct ���objects��� or ���features��� in the environment. This 
equivalence allows the topological structures of TNs ��� many 
of which have been well-characterized in applications of the 
TN formalism to other domains [48] ��� to be employed as a 
classif i cation of control structures in active inference systems; 
including cells, organisms, and multi-organism communities. 
It allows, in particular, a principled approach to the question 
of whether, and to what extent, a cognitive system can 
impose a decompositional or mereological (i.e., part-whole) 
structure on its environment. Such structures naturally invoke 
a notion of locality, and hence of geometry. The geometry 
of spacetime itself has been described as a particular TN 
��� a multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) 
[49]���[51] ��� suggesting a deep link between control l ow 
in systems capable of observing spacetime (i.e., capable of 
implementing internal representations of spacetime) and the 
deep structure of spacetime as a physical construct. 
We begin in this Part I, ��II by analyzing the control-f l ow 
problem in three different representations of active inference. 
First, we employ the classical, statistical formulation of the 
FEP [10], [11] in ��II-A to describe control l ow as imple- 
menting discrete, probabilistic transitions between dynamical 
attractors on a manifold of computational states. We then 
reformulate the physical interaction in quantum information- 
theoretic terms in ��II-B; in this formulation [12], components 
of the GM can be considered to be distinct quantum reference 
frames (QRFs) [52], [53] and represented by hierarchical 
networks of Barwise-Seligman classif i ers [54] as developed in 
[55]���[58]. Control l ow then implements discrete transitions 
between QRFs. The third step, in ��II-C, employs the mapping 
between hierarchies of classif i ers and topological quantum 
i eld theories (TQFTs) developed in [59]. Here, control l ow is 
implemented by a TQFT, with transition amplitudes given by 
a path integral. The second and third of these representations 
provide formal characterizations of intrinsic (or ���quantum���) 
context effects that are consistent with both the sheaf-theoretic 
treatment of contextuality in [60], [61] and the Contextuality 
by Default (CbD) approach of [62], [63]; see also the dis- 
cussion in [57] and [59, ��7.2]. The underlying theme is that 
contextuality arises due to the non-existence of any globally 
def i nable (maximally connected) conditional probability dis- 
tribution across all possible observations (see e.g., [64] for a 
review from a more general physics perspective). Extending 
our earlier analysis [57], we discuss reasons to expect that 
active inference systems will generically exhibit such context 
effects. 
In Part II, we develop a fully-general tensor representation 
of control l ow, and prove that this tensor can be factored into 
a TN if, and only if, the separability (or conditional statistical 
independence) conditions needed to identify distinct features 
of, or objects in, the environment are met. We show how TN 
architecture allows classif i cation of control l ows, and give 
two illustrative examples. We then discuss several established 
relationships between TNs and artif i cial neural network (ANN) 
architectures, and how these generalize to topological quantum 
neural networks [59], [65], of which standard deep-learning 
(DL) architectures are a classical limit [66]. Having developed 
these formal results, we turn to implications of these results 
for biology, and discuss how TN architectures correlate with 
the observational capabilities of the system being modeled, 
particularly as regards abilities to detect spatial locality and 
mereology. We consider how to classify known control path- 
ways in terms of TN architecture and how to employ the 
TN representation of control l ow in experimental design. We 
conclude by looking forward to how these FEP-based tools 
can further integrate the physical and life sciences.

This section indicates that the paper aims to explore control flow in active inference systems from both classical and quantum perspectives. It presents a unifying mathematical framework through the use of tensor networks (TNs), which formalize the relationships between different components of a control system.
In the first part, the paper explores control flow using three different frameworks: classical Free Energy Principle (FEP), quantum reference frames (QRFs), and topological quantum field theories (TQFTs). These approaches help elucidate the idea of contextuality, or the fact that global, maximally connected probability distributions do not exist across all observations. The paper argues that active inference systems will generally exhibit such contextual effects.
In the second part, the paper focuses on a generalized tensor representation of control flow. The architecture of the tensor network is conditional upon identifying distinct features or objects in the environment. This part also explores the connections between tensor networks and artificial neural network (ANN) architectures, extending this idea to topological quantum neural networks. The authors discuss the implications of these mathematical models for biology, specifically regarding the system's capabilities to perceive spatial locality and mereology (part-whole relationships).
In sum, the paper promises to offer a holistic understanding of control systems across different scales and types of inference, incorporating both classical and quantum theory. It seeks to bring the physical and life sciences closer through a unifying framework based on the Free Energy Principle.

II. FORMAL DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTROL PROBLEM 
A. The attractor picture 
Let U be a random dynamical system that can be de- 
composed into subsystems with states ��(t), b(t), and ��(t) 
such that the dependence of the ��(t) on the ��(t), and vice- 
versa, is only via the b(t). In this case, the b(t) form an MB 
separating the ��(t) from the ��(t). We will refer to the ��(t) as 
���internal��� states, to the ��(t) as ���environment��� states, and to 
the combined ��(t) = (b(t),��(t)) as ���particular��� (or ���particle���) 
states [10]. The FEP is a variational or least-action principle 
stating that any system ��� that interacts suff i ciently weakly with 
its environment ��� can be considered to be enclosed by an MB, 
i.e. any ���particle��� with states ��(t) = (b(t),��(t)), will evolve 
in a way that tends to minimize a variational free energy (VFE) 
F(��) that is an upper bound on (Bayesian) surprisal. This free 
energy is effectively the divergence between the variational 
density encoded by internal states and the density over external 
states conditioned on the MB states. It can be written [10, Eq. 
2.3], 
F(��) = Eq(��)[lnq��(��) ��� lnp(��,b)]

The VFE functional F(��) is an upper bound on surprisal 
(a.k.a. self-information) I(��) = ���lnp(��) > ���lnp(b) be- 
cause the Kullback-Leibler divergence term (DKL) is always 
non-negative. This KL divergence is between the density over 
external states ��, given the MB state b, and a variational 
density q��(��) over external states parameterized by the internal 
state ��. If we view the internal state �� as encoding a posterior 
over the external state ��, minimizing VFE is, effectively, 
minimizing a prediction error, under a GM encoded by the 
NESS density. In this treatment, the NESS density becomes a 
probabilistic specif i cation of the relationship between external 
or environmental states and particular (i.e., ���self���) states. We 
can interpret the internal and active MB states in terms of 
active inference, i.e., a Bayesian mechanics [11], in which 
their expected l ow can be read as perception and action, 
respectively. Here ���active��� states are a subset of the MB 
states that are not inf l uenced by environmental states and ��� 
for the kinds of particles considered here ��� do not inf l uence 
internal states. In other words, active inference is a process of 
Bayesian belief updating that incorporates active exploration 
of the environment. It is one way of interpreting a generalized 
synchrony between two random dynamical systems that are 
coupled via an MB.

In essence, minimizing the VFE corresponds to minimizing the prediction error under a generative model (GM) encoded by a nonequilibrium steady-state (NESS) density. This concept fits within the framework of active inference, a Bayesian approach to perception and action. The term "active" refers to those states within the Markov blanket that are not influenced by the environment or internal states, essentially encapsulating the system's exploratory actions in the environment.
In summary, the section provides a mathematical framework for understanding how control flow operates within an active inference system, grounding these concepts in the Free Energy Principle.

If the ���particle��� �� is a biological cell, it is natural to 
consider the MB b to be implemented by the cell membrane 
and the ���internal��� states �� to be the internal macromolecular or 
biochemical states of the cell; indeed, it is this association that 
motivated the application of the FEP to cellular life [5]. In this 
case, the NESS corresponds to the state, or neighborhood of 
states, that maintain homeostasis (or more broadly, allostasis 
[67]���[69]) and hence maintain the structural and functional 
integrity of �� as a living cell. This activity of self-maintenance 
has been termed ���self-evidencing��� [70]; systems compliant 
with the FEP can be considered to be continually generating 
evidence of ��� or for ��� their continued existence [10]. 
In the terminology of [13] cells are ���strange particles��� ��� 
their signal transduction pathways monitor (components of) 
the states of their environments, but do not directly monitor 
their actions on their environments (i.e., their own active 
states). The consequences of any action can only, therefore, 
be deduced from the response of the environment. In this 
situation, causation is always uncertain: whether an action 
by the environment on the cell ��� what the cell detects as an 
environmental state change ��� is a causal consequence of an 
action the cell has taken in the past cannot be determined by 
the data available to the cell. Every action, therefore, increases 
VFE, while every observation (potentially) decreases it. The 
(apparent) task of the cell���s GM is to minimize the increases, 
on average, while maximizing the decreases. 
The Bayesian mechanics afforded by the FEP implies a 
(classical) thermodynamics; indeed, the FEP can be read as 
a constrained maximum entropy or caliber principle [71], 
[72]. This follows from the fact that inference, i.e., self 
evidencing, entails belief updating and belief updating incurs a 
thermodynamic cost via the Jarzynski equality [73]���[75]. This 
cost provides a lower bound on the thermodynamic free energy 
required for metabolic maintenance. For example, a cell���s 
actions on its environment ��� e.g., chemotactic locomotion 
��� are largely driven by the need to acquire thermodynamic 
free energy. The cell���s GM cannot, therefore, minimize VFE 
by minimizing action [76]; instead, it must successfully pre- 
dict which actions will replenish its free-energy supply. As 
actions are energetically expensive, this requires trading off 
short-term costs against long-term goals. As shown in [41], 
selective pressures operating on different timescales favor the 
development of metaprocessors that control lower-level actions 
in a context-dependent way; these are often implemented via 
a hierarchical GM [77]. Such meta-level control provides 
probabilistic models of risk-sensitive actions in context. 
While such systems may be described as regulating free- 
energy seeking actions, they also regulate information-seeking 
actions, i.e., curiosity-driven exploration [78]���[80]. This fol- 
lows because VFE provides an upper bound on complexity 
minus accuracy [81]. The expected free energy (EFE), con- 
ditioned upon any action, can therefore be scored in terms 
of expected complexity and expected inaccuracy. Expected 
complexity is ���risk��� and corresponds to the degree of belief 
updating that incurs a thermodynamic cost; leading to risk- 
sensitive control (e.g., phototropism). Expected inaccuracy 
corresponds to ���ambiguity��� leading to epistemic behaviors 
(e.g., searching for lost keys under a streetlamp) [42]. 
When context-dependent control is considered, the neigh- 
borhood of the NESS resolves into a network of local minima 
corresponding to i xed perception-action loops separated by 
energetic barriers that the control system must overcome to 
switch between loops. For example, in a cell, this energetic 
barrier comprises the energy required to activate one pathway 
while de-activating another, which may include the energetic 
costs of phosphorylation, other chemical modif i cations, ad- 
ditional gene expression, etc. Different pairs of pathways 
can be expected to be separated by energetic barriers of 
different heights, generating a topographically-complex free 
energy landscape that coarse-grains, in a long-time average, 
to the neighborhood of the NESS, i.e., to the maintenance of 
allostasis [68], [69], [82]. 
As noted earlier, we can think of controllable perception- 
action loops as nodes on a factor graph, with the edges 
corresponding to pathways for control l ow, and the transition 
probabilities labeling the edges as inversely proportional to the 
energetic barrier between loops. This allows representing the 
GM for meta-level (i.e., hierarchical) control as a message- 
passing system as described in [47]. The presence of very 
high energetic barriers can render such a GM effectively one- 
way, as seen in the context-dependent switches between signal 
transduction pathways and GRNs that characterize cellular 
differentiation during morphogenesis. Biological examples of 
these include modif i cations of bioelectric pattern memories in 
planaria, which can create alternative-species head shapes that 
eventually remodel back to normal [83], or produce 2-headed 
worms which are permanent, and regenerate as 2-headed in 
perpetuity [84].

The section takes the formal mathematical principles from earlier and applies them to the biological context of a cell. In this model, the cell membrane serves as the Markov blanket (MB), the internal states (
��
\mu
��
) correspond to the biochemical states of the cell, and the external states (
��
\eta
��
) relate to the cell's environment.
Homeostasis & Allostasis
: The nonequilibrium steady-state (NESS) corresponds to the state(s) where the cell maintains its functional integrity. This self-maintenance is referred to as "self-evidencing," as systems that comply with the Free Energy Principle (FEP) continually generate evidence of their existence.
Uncertain Causation
: Cells are described as "strange particles," as they can monitor their environment but not directly their actions on it. This brings in the element of uncertain causation; the cell cannot definitively know if a change in its environment is a result of its own action.
Thermodynamics & Cost
: The FEP also connects to classical thermodynamics. Self-evidencing or belief-updating incurs a thermodynamic cost, and the cell's actions are aimed at acquiring the thermodynamic free energy needed for its metabolic functions.
Complex Decision-Making
: The cell���s generative model (GM) aims to minimize increases in Variational Free Energy (VFE) while maximizing its decrease, often involving a trade-off between short-term costs and long-term gains. This necessitates higher-order, meta-level controls that are often hierarchical.
Risk & Ambiguity
: The paper talks about ���risk��� as expected complexity, which involves belief updating at a thermodynamic cost. ���Ambiguity��� relates to expected inaccuracy and leads to exploratory behaviors, like a cell's phototropism.
Context-Dependent Control & Energetic Barriers
: The NESS is not a single state but a complex landscape with local minima separated by energetic barriers. These barriers could be, for instance, the energy required to switch cellular pathways.
Hierarchical Control
: These complexities are often managed through hierarchical, meta-level controls. They use probabilistic models to regulate not just energy-seeking but also information-seeking actions (like curiosity-driven exploration).
Biological Examples
: Finally, the section ends with specific biological examples, mentioning modifications in planaria that show how high energetic barriers can lead to permanent changes.
In summary, the section deepens our understanding of cellular control by linking it to the FEP and exploring the nuanced, hierarchical, and often uncertain nature of cellular decision-making and action.

B. The QRF picture 
Cellular information processing has traditionally been 
treated as completely classical, i.e., as implemented by causal 
networks of macromolecules, each of which undergoes clas- 
sical state transitions via local dynamical processes that are 
conditionally independent of the states of other parts of 
the network. While the ���quantum��� nature of proteins and 
other macromolecules is broadly acknowledged, the scale at 
which quantum effects are important remains controversial, 
with straightforward single-molecule decoherence models pre- 
dicting decoherence times of attoseconds (10���18s) or less 
[85], [86]: several orders of magnitude below the timescales 
of processes involved in molecular information processing 
[87]. While functional roles for quantum coherence in in- 
tramolecular information processing have been demonstrated, 
intermolecular coherence remains experimentally elusive [88]��� 
[91]. 
The free-energy budgets of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic 
cells are, however, orders of magnitude smaller than would 
be required to support fully-classical information processing 
at the molecular scale, suggesting that cells employ quantum 
coherence as a computational resource [92]. Indirect evidence 
of longer-range, tissue-scale coherence in brains has also been 
reported [93]. Reformulating the FEP in quantum information-theoretic terms enables it to describe situations in which long- range coherence, and hence quantum computation, cannot be neglected.

The "QRF picture" section explores the possible role of quantum effects in cellular information processing. Traditionally, this processing is considered to be classical, relying on causal networks of macromolecules. However, this perspective poses challenges:
Energy Budgets
: The energy budgets for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are much smaller than what would be required for fully classical information processing at the molecular scale. This discrepancy suggests that quantum coherence might be employed as a computational resource in cells.
Quantum Nature of Macromolecules
: While the quantum characteristics of proteins and other macromolecules are acknowledged, the relevance of these quantum effects at a biological scale remains a subject of debate.
Decoherence Times
: Classical models predict decoherence times on the order of attoseconds, which is several orders of magnitude less than the timescales relevant for cellular processes. This mismatch raises questions about whether a purely classical model is sufficient.
Evidence of Quantum Coherence
: Functional roles for quantum coherence within individual molecules (intramolecular) have been found, but intermolecular coherence remains elusive. However, indirect evidence of long-range, tissue-scale coherence, especially in brains, has been reported.
Reformulation of FEP
: By reframing the Free Energy Principle in terms of quantum information theory, the authors suggest that scenarios involving long-range quantum coherence could be adequately described, thus enriching our understanding of cellular processes.
In essence, the section brings up compelling reasons for considering quantum effects in the cellular context, particularly in light of energy constraints and evidence of long-range coherence. It proposes that a quantum reformulation of the Free Energy Principle may offer a more comprehensive description of cellular information processing.

Following the development in [12], we consider a bipartite 
decomposition U = AB of a i nite, isolated system U for 
which the interaction Hamiltonian HAB= HU���(HA+HB) 
is suff i ciently weak over the time period of interest that the 
joint state |Ui is separable (i.e., factors) as |Ui = |Ai|Bi. In 
this case, we can choose orthogonal basis vectors |iki so that: 
HAB= ��kKBTk 
N X 
i 
��k iM 
k 
i, (2) 
where KBdenotes Boltzmann���s constant, T is the absolute 
temperature of the environment, k =A or B, the Mk 
i are 
N mutually-orthogonal Hermitian operators with eigenvalues 
in {���1,1}, the ��k 
i ��� [0,1] are such that PN 
i ��k 
i = 1, 
and ��k��� ln2 is an inverse measure of k���s thermodynamic 
eff i ciency that depends on the internal dynamics Hk; see 
[56], [58], [94], [95] for further motivation and details of 
this construction and [96] for a pedagogical review. This 
description is purely topological, attributing no geometry to 
either U or B; hence it allows the ���embedding space��� of 
perceived ���objects��� to be an observer-dependent construct. It 
has several relevant consequences: 
���We can regard A and B as separated, and determined 
by independent measures. They are separated by ��� and 
interact via ��� a holographic screen B that can be rep- 
resented, without loss of generality, by an array of N 
non-interacting qubits, where N is the dimension of HAB 
[94], [95]. 
���A and B can be regarded as exchanging i nite N-bit 
strings, each of which encodes one eigenvalue of HAB 
[94]. 
���A and B have free choice of basis for HAB, correspond- 
ing to free choice of local frames at B, e.g., free choice, 
for each qubit qion B, of the local z axis and hence the 
z-spin operator szthat acts on qi[96]. 
���Choice of basis corresponds to choosing the zero-point 
of total energy by each of A and B. The systems A and 
B are, therefore, in general at informational, but not at 
thermal equilibrium [12]. 
���As A and B must obtain from B or A, respectively, 
whatever thermodynamic free energy is required, by Lan- 
dauer���s principle [73], [99], [100], to fund the encoding 
of classical bits on B (as well as any other irreversible 
classical computation), A and B must each devote some 
sector F of B to free-energy acquisition. The bits in F 
are ���burned as fuel��� and so do not contribute input data 
to computations. Waste-heat dissipation by one system 
is free energy acquisition by the other. The free-energy 
sectors FAand FBof A and B need not align as subsets 
of qubits on B; that is, qubits that A regards as free- 
energy sources may be regarded by B as informative 
outputs and vice-versa [56], [58]. 
���The actions of the internal dynamics HAand HBon B 
can be represented by A- and B-specif i c sets of QRFs, 
each of which both ���measures��� and ���prepares��� qubits on 
B. Each QRF acts on the qubits in some specif i c sector of 
B, breaking the permutation symmetry of Eq. (2) [56], 
[58], [59]. Only QRFs acting on sectors other than F 
implement informative computations; we will therefore 
restrict attention to these QRFs. 
���Each ���computational��� QRF can, without loss of general- 
ity, be represented by a cone-cocone diagram (CCCD) 
comprising Barwise-Seligman classif i ers and infomor- 
phisms between them [54], [55]. The apex of each 
such CCCD is, by def i nition, both the category-theoretic 
limit and colimit of the ���input/output��� classif i ers that 
correspond, formally, to the operators Mk 
i in Eq. (2) [56], 
[58], [59]. 
Typically, a CCCD is structured as a distributed information 
l ow in the form: 
A1 g12 
g21 A2 g23 
g32 ... Ak 
C0 
h1 
h2 hk 
A1 
f1 
g12 
g21 A2 
f2 g23 
g32 ... Ak 
fk 
(3) 
incorporating sets of classif i ers {A��} and (logic) infomor- 
phisms {fi,gjk} [54, Ch 12] over suitable index ranges. 
As a memory-write system, Diagram (3) depicts a generic 
blueprint for a bow-tie or variational autoencoder (VAE) net- 
work amenable to describing a hierarchical Bayesian network 
with belief-updating as discussed in e.g. [12], [57], [59]. 
Crucially, it is the non-commutativity of CCCDs of this form 
that specif i es intrinsic or quantum contextuality, as occurs, for 
instance, when the colimit core C0is undef i nable [57, ��7, ��8] 
[59, ��7.2]. Consequences of such contextuality are discussed 
via examples in Part II. 
The holographic screen B functions as an MB separating 
A from B. It can be regarded as having an N-dimensional, 
N-qubit Hilbert space Hqi= Q 
iqi. While Hqi 
is strictly 
ancillary to HU= HA��� HB, 
the classical situation can be 
recovered in the limit in which the entanglement entropies 
S(|Ai),S(|Bi) ��� 0 by considering the products HA��� Hqi 
and HB��� Hqito 
be ���particle��� state spaces for A and B, 
respectively. In this classical limit, the states of Hqibecome 
the blanket states of an MB that functions as a classical 
information channel [94]���[96]. In quantum holographic cod- 
ing, for example, B is often represented by a polygonal 
tessellation of the hyperbolic disc, with qubits represented 
by polygonal centroids. A specif i c TN model of a pentagon 
code is developed in [97]; see in particular their Fig. 4. 
The geometric description of B as implementing holographic 
coding, and its classical limit as an MB structured as a direct 
acyclic graph (DAG), is further explored in the setting of 
TQNNs in [98].

In this quantum-theoretic picture, ���systems��� or ���objects��� 
observed and manipulated by A or B correspond to sectors 
on B that are the domains of particular QRFs deployed by 
A or B, respectively [12], [58], [59]. To simplify notation, 
we use the same symbol, e.g., ���Q��� to denote both a QRF 
Q and the sector dom(Q) on B. Any identif i able system X factors into a ���reference��� component R that maintains a time- 
invariant state |Ri or more generally, state density ��R, that 
allows re-identif i cation and hence sequential measurements 
over extended time, and a ���pointer��� component P with a time- 
varying state |Pi or density ��P. It is this pointer component, 
named for the pointer of an analog instrument, which is 
the ���state of interest��� for measurements. The QRFs R and 
P clearly must commute, and the sectors R and P clearly 
must be mutually decoherent [12], [58], [59]. All ���system��� 
sectors must be components of some overall sector E that 
corresponds to the ���observable environment.��� The recording of 
measurement outcomes to a classical memory and the reading 
of previously-recorded outcomes from memory can similarly 
be represented by a QRF Y . As dom(Y ) is a sector on B, 
recorded memories of A are exposed to and hence subject 
to modif i cation by B and vice-versa. Both the observable 
environment E and the memory sector Y must be disjoint 
from, and decoherent with, the free-energy sector F. 
As actions on B encode classical data, they have an asso- 
ciated free energy cost of at least ln2 KBT per bit [73], [99], 
[100] that must originate from the source at F. Time-energy 
complementary associates a minimum time of h/[ln2(KBT)], 
with h being Planck���s constant, to this energy expenditure. 
We can, therefore, associate actions on B, including memory 
writes, with ���ticks��� of an internal time QRF, which we denote 
tAand tBfor A and B, respectively. Assuming all observa- 
tional outcomes are written to memory, we can represent the 
situation as in Fig. 1. The time QRF is effectively an outgoing 
bit counter that can be represented by a groupoid operator 
Gij: ti��� tj[56]. 
As outgoing bits are oriented in opposite 
directions with respect to B for A and B, the time ���arrows��� 
tAand tBpoint in opposite directions. Hence A and B can 
both be regarded as ���interacting with their own futures��� as discussed in [96].

Measurements of a system X can be considered sequential 
if: 1) they are separated in time according to the internal 
time QRF, and 2) their outcomes are recorded to memory 
to enable comparability across time. We show in [59] that 
sequential measurements can always be represented by one of 
two schemata. Using the compact notation: 
S(4) 
to represent a QRF S, we can represent measurements of 
a physical situation in which one system divides into two, 
possibly entangled, systems with a diagram of the form: 
S 
S1 
S2 
S(5) 
Fig. 1. Cartoon illustration of QRFs required to observe and write a readable 
memory of an environmental state |Ei. The QRFs E and Y read the state 
from E and write it to the memory Y respectively. Any identif i ed system 
S must be part of E. The clock Gijis a time QRF that def i nes the time 
coordinate tA. The dashed arrow indicates the observer���s thermodynamic 
process that converts free energy obtained from the unobserved sector F of 
B to waste heat exhausted through F. Adapted from [58], CC-BY license. 
Parametric down-conversion of a photon exemplif i es this kind 
of process. The reverse process can be added to yield: 
S

SS(6) 
In the second type of sequential measurement process, the 
pointer-state QRF P is replaced with an alternative QRF Q 
with which it does not commute. Sequences in which position 
and momentum, or spins szand sx, are measured alternately 
are examples. These can be represented by the diagram: 
S

R 
SS 
Q

S (7) 
As both P and Q must commute with R, the commutativity 
requirements for S are satisf i ed. 
The sequences of operations depicted in Diagrams (6) and 
(7) clearly raise the questions of how control is implemented, and of how the context changes that drive control l ow are 
detected. Before turning to these questions in Part II, we 
review a path-integral representation of QRFs, show that the 
same representation also captures the behavior of any system 
X identif i ed by a QRF, and discuss the questions of multiple 
observers and quantum contextuality.

C. The TQFT picture 
As a least-action principle, the FEP is fundamentally a 
statement about the paths followed by the joint system U 
through its state space. The classical FEP is amenable to 
a path-integral formulation [13] that expresses the expected 
value of any observable (functional) ���[x(t)] of paths x(t) 
through the relevant state space as ( [101], Eq. 6): 
h���[x(t)]i = Z 
dx0 Z d[x(t)]���[x(t)]p(x(t)|x0)p0(x0)(8) 
where x0is the initial state and p(x(t)|x0) 
is the conditional 
probability of the path x(t). Quantum theory generalizes this 
expression by, effectively. replacing ���[x(t)] with an auto- 
morphism on the relevant Hilbert space and p(x(t)|x0) with 
an amplitude for x(t) given the initial state x0. For some 
i nite-dimensional Hilbert space H, the manifold of all such 
automorphisms is a cobordism on H, which is by def i nition a 
TQFT on H [102]. 
We show in [59] that any sequential measurement of any 
sector X of B induces a TQFT on X, considered as a 
projection of the N-dimensional boundary Hilbert space Hqi 
associated with B. In particular, measurement sequences of 
the form of Diagram (6) can be mapped to cobordisms, i.e., 
to manifolds of maps between two designated boundaries, of 
the form: B 
S 
B 
S 
S1 
S2 
S 
S1 
S2 
F(i)F(k) 
F 
(9) 
while sequences of the form of Diagram (7) can be mapped 
to cobordisms of the form: 
B 
P 
R 
B 
S 
Q 
R 
P 
R 
S 
Q 
R 
F(i)F(k) 
F 
(10) 
In either case, F : CCCD ��� Cob is the functor from 
the category CCCD of CCCDs (and hence of QRFs) to the 
category Cob of i nite cobordisms required to def i ne a TQFT. 
In general, we can state: 
Theorem 1 ( [59] Thm. 1). For any morphism F of CCCDs 
in CCCD, there is a cobordism S such that a diagram of 
the form of Diagram (9) or (10) commutes. 
referring to [59] for the proof. 
Theorem 1 applies to any sequential measurement; there- 
fore, it applies to measurements of a sector X followed 
by measurements of the associated memory sector Y , or 
vice versa. Assuming for convenience that the dimension 
dim(X) = dim(Y ), we can consider a composite operation 
Q = (��� ���Q, ��� ��� 
Q), where ��� 
Q = QXQYand ��� ��� 
Q = QYQX. This Q 
is a pair of QRF sequences that can be identif i ed with TQFTs that measure and record an outcome, mapping HX��� HY, and dually use an outcome read from memory to prepare a state, mapping HY��� HX, 
respectively, as in Diagram 11:

This TQFT perspective provides a geometric and topological lens to understand sequential measurements in quantum systems, aligning with the FEP's focus on path optimization. It forms a bridge between classical and quantum descriptions and offers a rigorous mathematical framework for understanding complex quantum operations.

This composite operator Q is, by Theorem 1, itself a TQFT 
[98]. Hence the operation of recording observational outcomes 
for a sector X made at t to memory, and then comparing 
them to later observations at t+���t, is formally equivalent to 
propagating the ���system��� X forward in time from t to t+���t. 
Identifying QRFs as ���internal��� TQFTs allows a general 
analysis of information exchange between multiple QRFs 
deployed by a single system, e.g., A. Because all QRFs act on 
B, information exchange between QRFs requires a channel 
that traverses B. Any such channel is itself a QRF, one 
deployed by B. Considering A to comprise two observers, 
one deploying Q1and the other deploying Q2, that interact 
via a local operations, classical communication (LOCC [103]) 
protocol provides an example: 
BAB 
Q1 
Q2 Classical channel 
Quantum channel (12) 
In a LOCC protocol, one channel is considered ���classical��� 
while the other is considered ���quantum���; however, this lan- 
guage masks the fact that both channels are physical. As 
pointed out in [104], all media supporting classical commu- 
nication are physical, and interactions with these media are 
always local measurements or preparations. Hence the two 
channels in a LOCC protocol are physically equivalent ��� both 
are TQFTs implemented by B ��� although their conventional 
semantics are different. 
Diagram(12)can,clearly,alsorepresentexternally- 
mediated communication between any two functional com- 
ponents of a system, e.g., macromolecular pathways within 
a cell or functional networks within a brain. We show in 
[98] that whenever Q1and Q2are deployed by distinct ��� 
technically, separable or mutually decoherent ��� ���observers��� 
or ���systems,��� they fail to commute, i.e., the commutator 
[Q1,Q2] = Q1Q2��� Q2Q1��� h/2, where again h is Planck���s 
constant. As shown in [57], Theorem 3.4 using the CCCD 
representation, non-commutativity of QRFs induces quantum 
contextuality, i.e., dependence of measurement results on 
���non-local hidden variables��� that characterize the measure- 
ment context [105]���[107]. In the current context, such hidden 
variables characterize the action of HBon B, affecting what 
A will observe next in every cycle of A-B interaction. 
As shown in [63], such context dependence can, in prin- 
ciple, be captured classically if suff i cient measurements of 
the context can be implemented. Such measurements would, 
however, have to access all of B. The existence of an MB 
prevents such access; in the current setting, A has access 
to B only via B. The i nite energetic cost of measurement, 
and consequent requirement for a thermodynamic sector F, 
prevents measurement even of all of B by any i nite physical 
system. Hence, we can expect physical systems, including all 
biological systems, to employ only local context-dependent 
control to switch between mutually non-commuting (sets of) 
QRFs. How context switches implemented by QRF switches 
induce evolution, development and learning was introduced 
in [22]. Some specif i c examples of context switching in 
biological systems will be discussed Part II. 
III. CONCLUSION 
We have shown in this Part I how the problem of def i ning 
control l ow arises in active inference systems, and provided 
three formal representations of the problem. Control l ow can, 
in particular, be represented as switching between classical 
dynamical attractors, between deployed QRFs, and between 
computational processes represented by TQFTs. Implementing 
control l ow has a free-energy cost; hence any control-f l ow 
system must trade off its own processing costs against the 
expected benef i ts of switching between input/ouput modes. 
The time and memory dependence of control l ow can, more- 
over, be expected to lead generically to context effects on both 
perception and action. 
In the accompanying Part II of this paper, we will i rst prove 
that control l ows in active inference systems can always be 
represented as TNs, and show how TN architectures provide 
a convenient classif i cation control l ows. We then show how these can be implemented by TQNNs, and discuss applications of this formalism to the problem of characterizing control flow in biological systems.

Abstract���Living systems face both environmental complexity 
and limited access to free-energy resources. Survival under these 
conditions requires a control system that can activate, or deploy, 
available perception and action resources in a context specif i c 
way. In Part I, we introduced the free-energy principle (FEP) 
and the idea of active inference as Bayesian prediction-error 
minimization, and show how the control problem arises in 
active inference systems. We then review classical and quantum 
formulations of the FEP, with the former being the classical limit 
of the latter. In this accompanying Part II, we show that when 
systems are described as executing active inference driven by 
the FEP, their control l ow systems can always be represented 
as tensor networks (TNs). We show how TNs as control systems 
can be implemented within the general framework of quantum 
topological neural networks, and discuss the implications of these 
results for modeling biological systems at multiple scales.

developed in neuroscience [1]���[7]. We then showed how the 
control l ow problem arises in active inference systems, and 
reviewed classical and quantum formulations of the problem. 
Control l ow can be represented as switching between classical 
dynamical attractors, between deployed quantum reference 
frames (QRFs) [8], [9], and between computational processes 
represented by TQFTs [10], [11]. Implementing control l ow 
has a free-energy cost; hence any control-f l ow system must 
trade off its own processing costs against the expected benef i ts 
of switching between input/ouput modes. The time and mem- 
ory dependence of control l ow generically leads to context 
effects on both perception and action. 
In this Part II, we develop a fully-general tensor repre- 
sentation of control l ow in ��II, and prove that this tensor 
can be factored into a TN if, and only if, the separability 
(or conditional statistical independence) conditions needed to 
identify distinct features of, or objects in, the environment 
are met. We show how TN architectures allows classif i cation 
of control l ows, and give two illustrative examples. We then 
discuss several established relationships between TNs and 
artif i cial neural network (ANN) architectures in ��III, and 
show how these generalize to topological quantum neural 
networks [11], [12], of which standard deep-learning (DL) 
architectures are a classical limit [13]. Having developed these 
formal results, we turn to implications of these results for 
biology in ��IV, and discuss how TN architecture correlates 
with the observational capabilities of the system being mod- 
eled, particularly as regards abilities to detect spatial locality 
and mereology. We consider how to classify known control 
pathways in terms of TN architecture and how to employ the 
TN representation of control l ow in experimental design. We 
conclude by looking forward to how these FEP-based tools 
can further integrate the physical and life sciences.

II. TENSOR NETWORK REPRESENTATION OF CONTROL 
FLOW 
A. Tensor networks and holographic duality 
Entanglement and quantum error correction, two concepts 
developed in quantum information theory, have been proved to 
have a fundamental role in unveiling quantum gravity [14]. At 
the origin of this consideration is the discovery by Bekenstein 
and Hawking [15]���[18] that the second law of thermodynamics can be preserved in the gravitational i eld of a black hole, 
if this latter has an entropy proportional to the area of its 
horizon, by the inverse of the Newton gravitational constant 
G. This entropy is maximal, as implied by the second law 
itself, providing an upper bound for possible conf i gurations of 
matter within a region of the same size [19], [20]. 
Nonetheless, the scaling of the local degrees of freedom 
counted by the entropy does not increase as the volume, 
hinging toward the formulation of the holographic conjecture 
[21], suggesting a division between the information that can 
only be retrieved on the boundary world, and a merely appar- 
ent bulk world. AdS/CFT realized the holographic conjecture, 
postulating a duality between gravity in asymptotically AdS 
space and quantum i eld theory on the spatial inf i nity of the 
AdS space [22]. Giving literal meaning to the duality, Ryu 
and Takayanagi (RT, [23]) proposed that entanglement of a 
boundary region fulf i ls the same law as for the black hole 
entropy, replacing the area of the black hole horizon with 
an extremal surface area that bounds the bulk region under 
scrutiny. 
While on the boundaries the theory can be individuated 
by assigning a specif i c conformal i eld theory (CFT), in the 
bulk the geometry can be associated to specif i c entanglement 
structures of the quantum systems. This is, for instance, what 
happens to the ground states of a CFT associated to an 
AdS space: the RT surface area increases less fast than the 
volume of the boundary. When the boundary is at equilibrium, 
in a thermal state of i nite temperature, the bulk geometry 
corresponds to that of a black hole, its horizon being parallel to 
the boundary and its size increasing with the temperature. The 
RT surface is then conf i ned between the boundary and the back 
hole horizon, approaching the boundary at higher temperature 
and increasing its entropy. These considerations suggest the 
existence of a subtle link interconnecting the structure of 
spacetime and quantum entanglement, and hence that a theory 
of quantum gravity must be fundamentally holographic, where 
its states satisfy the RT formula for some bulk geometry. 
The existence of an exact correspondence between bulk 
gravity and quantum theory at the boundary may hinge toward 
possible inconsistencies with locality. This has been discussed 
in the literature, in terms of local reconstruction theory [24]��� 
[26]: variables in the bulk (e.g. bulk spins) can be controlled 
instantaneously from the boundary, but this requires simul- 
taneous access to a large portion of the boundary: locality 
and an upper speed of light do not hold exactly in this 
theory. Nonetheless, local observers conf i ned in small regions 
at the boundary still fulf i ll locality and the existence of 
an upper limit of the speed of information exchange, in a 
way that is reminiscent of quantum error correction codes 
(QECCs) in quantum information theory: information is stored 
redundantly, in such a way that when part of it is corrupted, 
a reconstruction of information is still possible. Locality in 
the bulk is therefore a QECC property of the encoding map 
that realizes the duality between bulk and boundary. On the 
other hand, these properties are strictly connected to RT, which 
provides the necessary resource of entanglement for QEEC to 
emerge. 
The RT formula and QECC are properties fulf i lled by 
different classes of models, among which TNs [28]. These 
have been i rst introduced in condensed matter physics as 
variational wave-functions of strongly correlated systems [29], 
[30]. TNs are many-body wavefunctions that can be derived by 
composing few-body quantum states, which are indeed tensors. 
A prototype TN is, e.g., a collection of Einstein-Podolsky- 
Rosen (EPR) entangled pairs of qubits: in a nonentangled 
basis, the measured qubits are in some entangled pure state, 
and can be composed with additional qubits to create states 
with increasing complexity. Indeed, complicated quantum en- 
tanglement can be derived by entangling only a few qubits 
[31]. 
Particularly relevant for its implications on the reconstruc- 
tion of spacetime structure is the multi-scale entanglement 
renormalization ansatz (MERA) [32]. TNs can be naturally 
related to holography duality by considering that their entan- 
glement entropy can be controlled by their graph geometry. 
Some versions of TNs that are characterized by RT entangle- 
ment entropy and QEEC have been constructed resorting to 
stabilizer codes [33], [34] and random tensors with large bond 
dimensions [35]. TNs with random tensors at each node can 
be regarded as random states restricted by the topology of the 
network. Exactly as random states are almost maximally en- 
tangled, random TNs show, through the RT formula, an almost 
maximal entanglement, providing a large family of states with 
interesting properties to explore holographic duality. Further- 
more, for random TNs, the RT formula holds in generic spaces 
with not necessarily hyperbolic geometry, hinging toward an 
extension of holographic duality beyond AdS, to more general 
conf i gurations in quantum gravity. Nonetheless, at least in 
three dimensions, random tensor networks have been related 
to the gravitational action, by means of the Regge calculus 
[36]. 
On the other hand, since geometry emerges as a specif i ca- 
tion of the entanglement structure, one may consider that the 
Einstein equations should be connected as well to the dynam- 
ics of entanglement. For small perturbations around the ground 
state of a CFT on a boundary, linearized Einstein equations 
have been derived from the RT formula [37], [38]. Indeed, 
the conformal symmetry enables a relationship between the 
energy-momentum and the entanglement entropy, and conse- 
quently the area of the extremal surface can be connected to 
the energy-momentum distribution at the boundary ��� the result 
is equivalent to the linearized Einstein equations. 
The dynamics on the boundary, on the other hand, shows 
a chaotic behaviour, with scrambling of the single-particle 
operators, which evolve into multi-particle operators [39]. 
Maximal chaotic behavior recovered in the growth of the 
commutator between ladder operators, as encoded in the out- 
of-time-ordered correlation (OTOC) functions, is characterized 
by exponential growth in time and temperature. A model 
endowed with this property is, e.g., the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev 
model, developed to describe certain systems in condensed 
matter physics, such as Gapless spin-f l uids [40]���[42]. On the 
other hand, operator scrambling is also related to QEEC: the 
chaotic dynamics at the boundary instantiates QECC preserv- 
ing quantum information, which is eff i ciently hidden (and 
protected) behind the horizon.

This paper is a dense read and tackles some of the most challenging and cutting-edge concepts in computational neuroscience, quantum mechanics, and theoretical physics. It attempts to extend the Free Energy Principle (FEP) and active inference framework into a general formalism for describing cognitive systems at different scales, incorporating tensor networks (TNs) as a representation of control flow in the system.
Let's break down some key concepts:
Free Energy Principle (FEP)
: This is a theoretical framework suggesting that any adaptive or self-organizing system (like the brain) acts to minimize its free energy, essentially predicting sensory inputs to minimize prediction errors.
Active Inference
: A Bayseian framework to describe decision making in biological agents. It postulates that organisms act to reduce the mismatch between their model of the world and sensory observations.
Tensor Networks
: In the paper, tensor networks are used as a mathematical tool to represent complex many-body systems and their entanglement structures.
Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECC)
: These are protocols for correcting errors in quantum computing; the paper suggests that they might be relevant for maintaining "locality" in the holographic dual representation.
Holographic Duality
: This is a concept from theoretical physics, notably in the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence, that describes a duality between a gravity theory in some space and a quantum field theory in the boundary of that space.
RT Formula
: Ryu-Takayanagi formula, which connects the entanglement entropy of a boundary system to the area of a surface in the associated bulk space.
Locality
: This term usually means that interactions only occur at very small distances. However, the paper notes that in the AdS/CFT correspondence, this might be violated, though it can still be maintained for local observers.
Out-of-Time-Ordered Correlation (OTOC)
: A measure of chaos in quantum systems. The paper suggests that chaotic behavior in the boundary system has implications for the bulk geometry and its information structure.
The paper seems to be suggesting that these diverse ideas can be synthesized into a unified framework for understanding complex systems, such as biological organisms, at multiple scales, from quantum to macroscopic. This framework involves using tensor networks to represent the control flows that arise in active inference systems complying with the Free Energy Principle. It also explores the deep connections between spacetime geometry, quantum mechanics, and cognitive behaviors in a truly interdisciplinary fashion.

Nevertheless, this has lead to many questions concerning the information behind the horizon 
being eventually accessible from the boundary though non- 
local measurements, the fate of the local degrees of freedom 
hitting the singularity, and the relation between the causal 
structure of the bulk and the smooth geometry across the 
horizon. 
B. General results 
We can now move to prove a general result: 
Theorem 1. A system A exhibits non-trivial control l ow if, 
and only if, its control l ow can be represented by a TN. 
and examine some of its corollaries. We begin by def i ning: 
Def i nition 1. Control l ow is trivial if a system deploys only 
one QRF. 
As any collection of mutually-commuting QRFs can be rep- 
resented as a single QRF [11], [79], any system that deploys 
only mutually-commuting QRFs exhibits trivial control l ow. 
Systems that deploy only a single QRF ���do the same thing��� 
regardless of context, and so do not qualify as ���interesting��� in 
the sense used here. As noted above, no i nite physical system 
can measure the entire state of its boundary with a single QRF, 
so no such system can simultaneously measure and act on its 
entire context. Any system A that deploys multiple QRFs Qi 
in sequence cannot, as noted in Part I, avoid contextuality 
due to unobservable effects, mediated by the action of HB, 
of the action of Qion the state later measured by Qj. Every 
action taken by an ���interesting��� system, in other words, at 
least transiently increases the VFE at its boundary. 
Consider, then, a system A that deploys multiple, distinct 
QRFs Q1,Q2,...Qn, acting on its environment B, where 
n ? N = dim(HAB). 
Classical control l ow in A can then 
be represented by a matrix CF = [Pij], where Pijis the 
probability of the control transition Qi��� Qj. 
As noted in 
Part I, any such transition has an energetic cost, which must 
be paid with free energy sourced from the thermodynamic 
sector F of the A-B boundary B. 
The matrix CF is a 2-tensor. Theorem 1 states that this 
tensor can be decomposed into a TN. We prove it as follows: 
Proof (Thm. 1). Suppose i rst that control l ow in a system 
A can be represented by a TN. A TN is, by def i nition, a 
factorization of a tensor operator into a network of tensor 
operators. This network can be either hierarchical or l at; if 
it is hierarchical, each layer can be considered a l at TN. 
Hence no generality is lost in considering just the case of a l at 
TN, which is an operator contraction T = ...TijTjkTkl..., 
where summation on shared indices is left implicit. In general, 
Tjk6= TT 
jk = Tkj, hence these expressions do not commute. 
They therefore represent non-trivial control l ow. Conversely, 
any non-trivial control l ow can be written, at any i xed scale 
or level of abstraction, as a linear sequence of (in general 
probabilistic) operators. The i xed order of operators in the 
sequence can be encoded formally by adding ���spatial��� indices 
as needed to allow contraction over shared indices. Hence any 
non-trivial control l ow at a i xed scale can be written as a l at 
TN. This construction can be repeated at each larger scale to 
produce a hierarchical TN over a collection of ���lowest-scale��� 
TNs.

The text you've posted delves into the complex intersection of quantum mechanics, information theory, and theoretical physics, particularly quantum gravity and AdS/CFT (Anti-de Sitter space/Conformal Field Theory) correspondence.
In the first part (Section A), the paper discusses the role of entanglement and quantum error correction in quantum gravity. It mentions the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula, which offers a way to link the entanglement entropy of a boundary region in a quantum field theory to the area of a minimal surface in the corresponding AdS space. This establishes a link between quantum entanglement and the geometry of spacetime, and it implies that theories of quantum gravity must be fundamentally holographic.
The paper also talks about the challenges to locality that arise in the AdS/CFT framework, and how they might be reconciled by quantum error correction codes (QECCs). Essentially, information is stored in such a way that even if part of it is corrupted, reconstruction is still possible.
In Section B, the focus shifts to control flow in quantum systems and its representation using Tensor Networks (TNs). A theorem is proposed: "A system A exhibits non-trivial control flow if, and only if, its control flow can be represented by a TN." Control flow here seems to relate to Quantum Reference Frames (QRFs), which could be thought of as a sort of "coordinate system" for interpreting quantum information.
The proof essentially argues that if a system's control flow can be represented by a Tensor Network, it means that the system's operations have complex dependencies (non-trivial control flow). Conversely, any system with non-trivial control flow can be represented as a flat TN at any fixed scale, and this can be generalized to hierarchical TNs at larger scales.
The paper suggests that TNs provide a framework not just for understanding quantum systems, but possibly also for understanding the deeper connections between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry.
This is a very high-level overview, but the content is extremely specialized. Would you like to delve deeper into a specific part?

We can now examine two corollaries of this result: 
Corollary 1. Decoherent reference sectors exist on a bound- 
ary B if and only if control l ow can be implemented by a 
TN. 
Proof. Decoherence between sectors requires independently- 
deployable, non-commuting QRFs. This requires a control 
structure that factors, hence by Theorem 1, it requires a 
TN. Conversely, a TN factors the control structure, making 
QRFs independently deployable, which renders their sectors 
decoherent. 
Equivalently, the generative model (GM) implemented by 
a system [4] factors if, and only if, control l ow can be 
implemented by a TN. 
Corollary 2. The TN of any system compliant with the FEP 
is a decomposition of the Identity. 
Proof. The FEP applies to systems with a NESS, and drives 
such systems to return to (the vicinity of) the NESS after 
any perturbation. Hence at a suff i ciently large scale, the TN 
of any such system is a cycle, i.e., a decomposition of the 
Identity. 
Many standard TN models, e.g., MERAs, assume bound- 
ary conditions asymptotically far, in numbers of lowest-scale 
operators, from the region of the network that is of interest. 
Identifying such asymptotic boundary conditions yields a 
cyclic system. 
Theorem 1, together with its corollaries, provides a natural, 
formal means of classifying systems by their control architec- 
tures. At a high level, two characteristics distinguish systems 
with different architectures: 
���Hierarchical depth, which indicates the number of ���virtual 
machine��� layers [43] the architecture supports. The in- 
terfaces between these layers implement coarse-graining, 
removing from the higher-level representation all dimen- 
sions, and hence all information, which is contracted out 
of the lower-level operators. 
���Number and location of contractions that yield unitary op- 
erators, and hence build in entanglement between lower- 
level operators. The natural limit is a MERA, in which 
every pair of lower-level operators is entangled at every 
hierarchical level [44]. 
The control-f l ow architecture, in turn, specif i es the structure 
of the ���layout��� of distinguishable sectors on B and hence 
of detectable features/objects in the environment. Locality 
on B requires a hierarchical TN; detectable entanglement 
requires a MERA-like TN. Locality is required for detectable 
features/objects to appear to have components with nested 
decompositions. Any QRF for geometric space, and hence for 
spacetime, must be hierarchical, and must be a MERA if en- 
tanglement in space is to be detected. A MERA is required, in 
particular, if the use of coherence between spatially-separated 
systems as a computational or communication resource is 
detectable.

The text delves further into the implications of the previously stated theorem concerning the role of Tensor Networks (TNs) in representing the control flow in quantum systems. Two corollaries are presented:
Corollary 1
The first corollary states that decoherent reference sectors (presumably sets of states that behave independently from each other) exist on a boundary
B
B
B
if and only if the control flow can be implemented by a TN. Essentially, having a TN representation of the control flow is necessary and sufficient for ensuring that Quantum Reference Frames (QRFs) can be deployed independently, thus rendering their respective sectors decoherent.
Corollary 2
The second corollary is connected to the Free Energy Principle (FEP), which is a general principle often applied to self-organizing systems. This corollary says that if a system complies with the FEP, then its corresponding TN is effectively a decomposition of the identity operator. This means that such systems tend to return to a "Non-Equilibrium Steady State" (NESS) after any perturbations, thereby aligning with the cyclic nature of identity decompositions.
Implications
The paper then discusses two characteristics that differentiate systems with varying control architectures:
Hierarchical Depth
: Indicates how many layers of abstraction or "virtual machine layers" a system supports. Each layer effectively simplifies the representation of the system by coarse-graining or contracting out lower-level information.
Number and Location of Contractions
: Refers to where entanglement is built into the system via unitary operators. A system with maximal entanglement at all hierarchical levels would resemble a Multiscale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA).
The text suggests that the architecture of control flow determines what types of "sectors" can exist on
B
B
B
and thus what kinds of features or objects are detectable in the environment. It also delves into the requirements for Quantum Reference Frames (QRFs) that would detect geometric space and spacetime. Essentially, a hierarchical and possibly MERA-like TN is necessary for detecting entanglement and coherence between spatially-separated systems in space.
This is quite a specialized topic, and I've done my best to provide an overview. Would you like to dive deeper into any part of this text?

To illustrate the classif i cation of systems by hierarchical 
level, consider the ten-step cyclic TN shown in Diagram (1): 
... 
ABJ (1) 
and its extension to a hierarchy as shown in Diagram (2): 
ABCDEFGHIJ (2) 
where red, blue, and green colors indicate distinct hierarchical 
���layers��� of tensor contractions. We have trained artif i cial 
neural networks (ANNs) to execute these TNs as the sequences 
of state transitions shown in Table 1. The i rst sequence 
(Dataset 1) is a ten-step cycle as shown Diagram (1); the 
second sequence (Dataset 2) layers the coarse-grained state 
transitions of Diagram (2) onto this ten-step cycle. In Dataset 
2, a two-bit tag is used to differentiate the ���low-level��� from 
the coarse-grained ���high-level��� cycles. An example state state 
transition from a randomly-generated initial state is shown in 
Fig. 1; the red-on-green bit pattern effectively moves ���up��� one 
step on each state-transition cycle. 
Table 1: Datasets used in ANN simulations. Dataset 1 specif i es 
a ten-step cycle A ��� B ��� ... ��� J ��� A. Dataset 2 specif i es 
this same cycle, with three coarse-grained cycles layered on 
top. The tags (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1) distinguish the data 
for the low- and high-level cycles. 
Fig. 2.Feed-forward network archtecture used to learn the control cycles 
specif i ed in Table 1. Each node is connected to every node of the next layer, 
as shown here for the i rst and last nodes only. The labels ���T��� and ���T+1��� 
indicate time steps in the executed control l ow. 
We trained two ANNs, one to execute each of the control 
cycles shown in Table 1. The networks are each composed 
of three layers, as illustrated in Fig. 2, with network sizes 
of [10, 50, 10] and [10, 200, 10], respectively, for the input, 
hidden, and output layers. The units in the hidden layer use 
the rectif i ed linear unit (ReLU) nonlinear activation function 
and the neurons in the output layer use the hyperbolic tangent 
activation function. The network is connected in a feedforward 
way where a neuron in one layer connects to every neuron 
in the next layer. Since the ANN serves as a switch state 
controller, we use a training scheme, similar to one-class 
classif i cation [45], where the training data are the only data 
that the network learns to produce. In so doing, the network 
learns to overf i t the training data, and any input outside of 
the designated state-encoding is discarded. The network is, 
therefore, not expected to deviate from the learned pattern. 
The network learns both control regimes with 100% accuracy 
after training with 3,000 randomly-generated 10-bit inputs. 
In the more realistic case of noisy input data, where binary 
states can be l ipped, the Bidirectional Associative Memory 
(BAM), a minimal two-layer nonlinear feedback network [46], 
is a viable alternative to a shallow feed-forward ANN. The 
architecure is shown in Fig. 3. This BAM network learns to 
associate between the two initial and i nal states in Table 1, with similar performance to that of the feed-forward network.

III. IMPLEMENTING CONTROL FLOW WITHTQNNS 
Tensor Networks can be naturally associated to the ma- 
trix elements of physical scalar products among topological 
quantum neural networks (TQNNs). Physical scalar products 
encode indeed the dynamics of TQFTs, since they fulf i ll their 
constraints of imposing l atness of the curvature and gauge invariance. Thus, the matrix elements associated to scalar 
products can be seen as evolution matrix elements for the spin- 
network states that span the Hilbert spaces of TQNNs. 
A. Tensor networks as classif i ers for TQNNs 
A notable example is provided by BF theories [47], a 
class of TQFTs particularly well studied in the literature of 
mathematical physics that enables expressing effective theories 
of particle physics, gravity and condensed matter, and provides 
as well a general framework for implementations of models 
of quantum information and quantum computation, machine 
learning (ML), and neuroscience. These are def i ned on the 
principal bundle M of a connection A for some internal gauge 
group G, with algebra g, according to the action on a d- 
dimensional manifold Md: 
S = Z Md Tr[B ��� F],(3) 
where B is an ad(g)-valued d-2-form, F denotes the i eld- 
strength of A, which is a 2-form, and the trace Tr is over the 
internal indices of g, ensuring gauge invariance of the density 
Lagrangian L = Tr[B ��� F] of the BF theory. 
Variation with respect to the conjugated variables, the 
connection A and the B frame-f i eld, closing a canonical 
symplectic structure, provide the equations of motion of the 
theory [47]: F = 0,dAB = 0,(4) 
which are, respectively, the curvature constraint, imposing the 
l atness of the connection, and the Gau�� constraint, imposing 
invariance under gauge transformations, having denoted with 
dAthe covariant derivative with respect to the connection A. 
At the quantum level, the states of the kinematical Hilbert 
space of the theory, fulf i lling by construction the Gau�� con- 
straint, can be represented in terms of cylindrical functionals 
Cyl, supported on graphs �� that are unions of segments ��i, the 
end points of which meet in nodes n, and with holonomies 
��� elements of the group G ��� H��i[A] of the connection A 
assigned to ��iand intertwiner operators ��� invariant tensor 
products of representations ��� vnassigned to the nodes n. 
For G = SU(2), spin-networks |��,j��,��ni, supported on �� 
and labelled by the spin j��of the irreducible representations 
of the group elements assigned to �� and by the quantum 
intertwiner numbers ��nassociated to vn, represent a basis of 
the kinematical Hilbert space of the theory. In terms of func- 
tionals of Cyl, one can provide the holonomy representation, 
which is related to the ���spin and intertwiner��� representation of 
|��,j��,��ni by means of the Peter-Weyl transform. This allows 
us to decompose the spin-network cylindric functional as [48]: 
��j��ij,��ni(h��ij) = O 
n 
��n ! �� ��� ���O 
��ij 
D(j��ij)(h��ij) ��� ���, 
(5) 
with D(j)are Wigner matrices providing representation ma- 
trices of the SU(2) group elements. 
The functorial evolution among spin-networks is ensured by 
the projector operator [11], which implements the curvature 
constraint in the physical scalar product among states, i.e. 
hin|P |outi,withP 
= Z D[N]exp(�� Z 
Tr[NF]). 
(6) 
We may then regard |ini as elements of the Hilbert space, and 
without loss of generality pick up those ones resulting from 
composing tensorially in Cyl k-representations of holonomies. 
We may further denote them as |j1...jki, with some ordering 
prescription to associate the topological structure of �� to 
the sequence of spin labels. Physically evolving states P|ini 
are distinguished from the former ones by labelling them as 
| 
^ 
j1������jki. Similarly, we introduce |outi as the tensor product 
of (n-k)-representations of holonomies, and denote these states 
as |i1...in���ki. Then the matrix elements of hin|P |outi 
naturally give rise [27] to an n-tensor, i.e. 
hi1...in���k| 
^ 
j1������jki = Ti1...in���kj1...jk.(7)

The text continues to explore the practical implementation of Tensor Networks (TNs) and their hierarchical properties using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Specifically, the paper discusses two different datasets trained on ANNs to simulate TNs with various hierarchical structures. The feed-forward network architecture is outlined, where units use ReLU and hyperbolic tangent activation functions. Importantly, the paper emphasizes that the ANNs are trained to overfit, ensuring they don't deviate from the learned control cycles. This makes them efficient state controllers.
The text then pivots to a theoretical discussion involving the integration of Tensor Networks with Topological Quantum Neural Networks (TQNNs) which are inherently related to Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). The paper elucidates the role of tensor networks as classifiers within TQNNs, particularly in the context of BF theories. These are a class of TQFTs which have widespread applications in multiple domains like particle physics, machine learning, and neuroscience.
Mathematical equations for BF theories are then presented, illustrating their action, Lagrangian, and the equations of motion. The text explains how the kinematical Hilbert space of the theory is constructed and further elaborates on the quantum states in this space, referring to their construction based on spin-networks and holonomies.
Finally, the paper discusses the concept of functorial evolution in these quantum states, introducing projective operators that implement curvature constraints. The outcome is represented as tensors, linking back to the foundational concept of Tensor Networks.
Overall, the text seems to blend practical implementations using ANNs with a deep theoretical framework involving TQNNs and TQFTs. It's a complex interplay between computation, quantum theory, and mathematical physics. Would you like to dive deeper into any particular section?

B. Geometric RG l ow for TQNNs and TNs 
The mathematical structures of TQNNs we summarized in 
Sec. III-A are picturing systems ���at equilibrium���, for which 
TQFTs characterize a topological stability that percolates into 
the related transition amplitudes. Nonetheless, it is worth 
considering as well how stochastic noise might interfere with 
the topological order ensured by TQFTs, and study the role of 
���out-of-equilibrium��� physics in the analysis of the evolution 
of the systems under scrutiny. 
Out-of-equilibrium dynamics is instantiated considering a 
heat-f l ow evolution of the fundamental i elds of the theory, 
with respect to a thermal time ��. Typical Langevin equations, 
complemented with stochastic noise, provide through their 
convergence toward the equations of motion of the theory the 
relaxation toward equilibrium of the i eld conf i gurations rep- 
resenting specif i c systems [49]. In general, given some i elds 
����, with a classical equation of motion derived, according
to the variational principle ��S/������, from an action S over 
a Euclidean manifold M, the associated Langevin equations 
read: ��� 
����� ����= ��� ��S 
������ 
+ ����,(8) 
with ����a stochastic noise term. The theory at equilibrium is 
characterized by the symmetries of the equations of motion 
��S/������= 
0 that are broken in the transient phase [50]; 
these symmetries are consistent with ��� and in the case of BF 
theories, actually generated by ��� the theories at equilibrium. 
A prototype of geometric heat-f l ow was introduced by 
Hamilton, and then used by Perelman to prove the Poincar�� e 
conjecture, which goes under the name of Ricci l ow. Here the 
gravitational i eld g����is the basic conf i gurational space i eld, 
while the drift terms are the Einstein equations of motion in 
the vacuum, which indeed are expressed by requiring that the 
components of the Ricci tensor vanish, i.e. R����= 0. The 
Ricci l ow then reads �� 
��� 
����� g����= ���2R����,(9) 
having considered now a Lorentzian manifold M. The Ricci 
l ow equations can be further complemented introducing the 
Ricci target RT 
���� = ��2(T�������1/2g����T), 
expressed in terms of 
the Newton constant G = ��2/(8��) and the energy-momentum 
tensor of matter T����, so as to obtain at equilibrium the Einstein 
equations: 
R�������1 2g����R 
= �� 2T���� ,or equivalentlyR����= RT 
����. 
(10) 
The stochastic version of the Ricci l ow, with heat equation 
turning into a Langevin equation, has been introduced and 
deepened in [50] for a generic gravitational system in the 
presence of matter i elds, describing an action S for gravity 
and matter. Moving then from: 
�� 
��� 
����� g����= ��� 
1 
��2 ��S 
��g���� 
+ �� g����,(11) 
in which a multiplicative noise ������= �� g����appears, the 
Hamiltonian analysis of the stochastic Ricci l ow (SRF) in the 
Adomian decomposition method (ADM) variables has been 
derived [50]. 
An essential by-product of the discussion, from the Ricci 
l ow perspective, is that the equilibration trajectories corre- 
spond to those of a renormalization group (RG) l ow. The 
thermal time �� plays the role of scale parameter that individ- 
uates a dimension in the bulk, which is out-of-equilibrium. 
The boundaries are recovered asymptotically in ��, in the 
infrared regime, and are by def i nition at equilibrium and thus 
symmetric. 
For a particular class of TQFTs, the BF theories we have 
introduced in Sec. III-A for implementing TQNNs and TNs, 
the geometric RG l ow acquire a specif i c expression as the 
TQFT equivalent of the gravitational Ricci l ow [51]. 
C. TNs as a generalization of the main model architectures in 
ML The use of TNs is an emerging topic in the ML community. 
The integration between the two appears quite immediate. A 
Fig. 4. Representation of the decision function (see [53]). 
Fig. 5. Matrix product decomposition (again see [53]). 
TN structure can be viewed as a ML model in which the 
parameters are properly adjusted to learn the classif i cation of a 
data set. Yet, as Ref. [52] mentions, machine learning can aid, 
in turn, in determining a factorization of a TN approximating 
a data set. Moreover, TNs are also used to compress the layers 
of ANN architectures, besides a variety of other uses. Tensor 
networks are becoming more and more popular to the extent 
that they are a powerful tool for representing and manipulating 
high-dimensional data, as in the case of image and video 
classif i cation tasks in which the data are represented as a high- 
dimensional tensor. High eff i ciency, l exibility, and ease of use 
are making them a dominant choice for many AI applications. 
Furthermore, besides being used to represent data, TNs can 
be used to process data by exploiting a number of operators. 
This feature makes them an effective technique for processing 
data in ML applications. 
As is well known, TNs are particularly well suited for rep- 
resenting quantum many-body states in which the dimension 
of the Hilbert space is exponentially large in the number of 
particles. The corresponding ML approach consists in: 
���Lifting data to exponentially higher spaces; 
���Applying any linear classif i er f(x) = W?��(X) to a non- 
linear space; 
���Compressing the weights by using TNs. 
The output of the model is a separation of classes that would 
not be linearly separable in a linear space. In particular, the 
decision function is the overlap of the weight tensor W with 
the feature map tensor �� as in Fig. 4. The weight tensor W 
can be approximated by the decomposition in Fig. 5. 
Regularization and optimization are built as a constructive 
product of low-order tensors while weight compression is 
performed by using the Matrix Product States (MPS) decom- 
position. If we look at Deep Neural Networks as a piecewise 
composition of linear discriminators (logistic regression func- 
tions), then the TN framework appears as a generalization of 
the main model architectures found in the ML literature, e.g. 
Support Vector Machines, Kernel models, and Deep Neural 
Networks.

The text you've shared appears to be a technical discussion about integrating ideas from theoretical physics���specifically Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs) and Ricci flow���into machine learning models like Tensor Networks (TNs) and Topological Quantum Neural Networks (TQNNs).
Let me break down some of the key points:
TQFTs and Equilibrium
: TQFTs describe systems in equilibrium and are concerned with topological properties that remain invariant under smooth deformations. The paper suggests that these ideas provide stability to the associated transition amplitudes in neural network models.
Stochastic Noise and Out-of-Equilibrium Dynamics
: The paper then moves to discuss what happens when these systems are not in equilibrium, such as when subjected to thermal fluctuations or stochastic noise. Here, Langevin equations come into play, guiding the system back to equilibrium.
Ricci Flow
: Ricci flow is a process in differential geometry that smooths out the irregularities of a manifold. The paper discusses how this mathematical concept can be incorporated into the evolution equations for field theory. A stochastic version of Ricci flow is also introduced.
Renormalization Group (RG) Flow
: In physics, RG flow describes how physical systems look at different length scales. The paper correlates this with thermal time and considers it as an 'out-of-equilibrium' dimension.
Tensor Networks in Machine Learning (ML)
: The paper notes that TNs can represent high-dimensional data efficiently and are becoming increasingly popular in ML for tasks like classification and compression.
TNs and Quantum Many-Body States
: The paper also emphasizes the utility of TNs in representing quantum states, which inherently exist in high-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
Generalization in ML
: Finally, it discusses how TNs could be a generalization of existing ML architectures, including Support Vector Machines and Deep Neural Networks, offering a new paradigm for ML models.
In essence, this text aims to bridge concepts from theoretical physics with machine learning, suggesting that these cross-disciplinary approaches can offer robust and efficient new ways to handle complex data.
1 / 1
The literature concerning the use of tensor theory in tra- 
ditional ML is becoming large. A short review starts with a seminal paper by Stoudenmire and Schwab [54], which 
demonstrated how algorithms for optimizing TNs can be 
adapted to supervised learning tasks by using MPS (ten- 
sor trains) to parametrize non-linear kernel learning models. 
Novikov, Trof i mov, and Oseledets [55] have shown how an 
exponentially large tensor of parameters can be represented 
in a factorized format called Tensor Train (TT), with the 
consequence of obtaining a regularization of the model. van 
Glasser, Pancotti, and Cirac [56] explored the connection be- 
tween TNs and probabilistic graphical models by introducing 
the concept of a ���generalized tensor network architecture��� 
for ML. Ref. [57] then designed a generative model, i.e. a 
traditional machine learning model that learns joint probability 
distributions from data and generates samples according to 
it, by using MPS. Ref. [58] made use of autoregressive 
MPSs for building an unsupervised learning model that goes 
beyond proof-of-concept by showing performance comparable 
to standard traditional models. Finally, Ref. [59] analyzes 
the contribution of polynomials of different degrees to the 
supervised learning performance of different architectures. 
IV. IMPLICATIONS FOR BIOLOGICAL CONTROL SYSTEMS 
Scale-free biology requires a smooth transition from 
quantum-like to classical-like behavior. Typical representations 
of metabolic, signal-transduction, and gene-regulatory path- 
ways are entirely classical, even though many of their steps in- 
volve electron-transfer or other mechanisms that are acknowl- 
edged to require a quantum-theoretic description [60], [61]. As 
noted earlier, free-energy budget considerations suggest that 
both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells employ quantum coher- 
ence as a computational resource [62]. Emerging empirical 
evidence for longer-range entanglement in mammalian brains 
suggests that large-scale networks may also be using quantum 
coherence as a resource [63]. Control l ow models must, 
therefore, support the possibility of quantum computation 
in biological systems. Hierarchical TNs that include unitary 
components, e.g., MERA-type models, provide this capability. 
In prokaryotes, the primary tasks of control l ow are 
adapting metabolism to available resources via metabolite- 
driven gene regulation [64] and initiating DNA replication 
and cell division when conditions are favorable. We can, 
therefore, expect shallow hierarchies of effectively classical 
control transitions in these organisms. Eukaryotes, however, 
are characterized by both intracellular compartmentalization 
and morphological degrees of freedom at the whole-cell scale. 
We have shown previously that the FEP will induce ���neu- 
romorphic��� morphologies ��� i.e. morphologies that segregate 
inputs from outputs and enable a fan-in/fan-out computational 
architecture ��� in any systems with morphological degrees of 
freedom [65]. Such systems can be expected to have deep con- 
trol hierarchies at the cellular level, with hierarchical structure 
correlating with morphological structure in morphologically- 
complex cells such as neurons [66], and in multicellular 
assemblages at all scales. These distinctions correlate with the 
orders-of-magnitude increase in classical computational power 
(estimated from total metabolic energy budget) as a function 
of cell-surface area in eukaryotes as compared to prokaryotes 
[62], as illustrated in Fig. 6. 
Fig. 6. Power-law relation between maximum classical computation rate (ver- 
tical axis) and cell-surface area (horizontal axis) derived in [62]. Information 
processing in eukaryotes is implemented by complex , overlapping signaling 
pathways that require hierarchical control, which information processing in 
prokaryotes is implemented by comparatively simple, two or three component 
pathways that require only shallow control systems. Adapted with permission 
from [62] Fig. 3. 
As well as managing metabolism and replication, most 
eukaryotes implement active exploration of the environment, 
communication with other systems, and ��� crucially for cog- 
nition ��� the writing and reading of stigmergic memories. 
Thus we can expect such systems to implement QRFs for 
spacetime and for specif i c kinds of objects, e.g., conspecif i cs 
and suitable substrates for recording stigmergic memories. 
Such QRFs rely on symmetries, and hence on redundancy 
of encoded (or encodable) information; they depend, in other 
words, on the availability of error-correcting codes [67], [68]. 
The implementation of spacetime as a QECC by TNs has 
been extensively studied by physicists as noted above; see [69] 
for review and [27] for a detailed analysis using the present 
formalism. The use of spacetime as an error-correcting code 
by organisms ��� e.g., the implementation of translational and 
rotational invariance of objects by dorsal visual processing in 
mammals [70], [71] ��� is well-understood phenomenologically, 
but the details of neural implementation remain to be eluci- 
dated. 
Both the context-sensitivity of, and the occurence of context 
effects due to non-commutativity of QRFs in, control net- 
works can be expected to increase with their complexity and 
hierarchical depth. ���Bowtie��� networks with high fan-in/fan- 
out to/from multi-use proteins or second messengers such 
as Ca2+are increasingly recognized as ubiquitous in higher 
eukaryotic cells [72]. Such networks have the general form 
of the CCCD depicted in Part I, Diagram 3. Frequently, such 
networks evolve via compression of information (e.g. toward 
share second messengers, as in [Ca2+]-based interactions [73], 
[74]) as an eff i ciency-increasing mechanism. Bowties intro- 
duce semantic ambiguities that must be resolved by context.

The text you've provided seems to be an academic discussion covering a range of topics related to Tensor Quantum Neural Networks (TQNNs), Tensor Networks (TNs), and their applications in Machine Learning (ML) and biological control systems. It appears to integrate concepts from theoretical physics, computer science, and biology, presenting a complex interdisciplinary framework.
Here's a brief summary of the main points:
TQNNs and TQFTs
: The paper starts by discussing how Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs) offer a mathematical framework for understanding TQNNs, particularly in terms of topological stability. It explores the effects of stochastic noise on these systems.
Geometric RG Flow
: It introduces the concept of Ricci flow and how it relates to TQNNs, particularly when considering out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Ricci flow is a geometric concept used to study the shape of manifolds, and it's being adapted here to consider how systems evolve towards equilibrium.
TNs in ML
: Tensor networks, originally developed for quantum many-body systems, are gaining prominence in machine learning for tasks like classification, data compression, and even understanding neural network architectures. The paper cites several works showing how TNs can be used to parametrize non-linear kernel learning models, among other applications.
Biological Control Systems
: The paper then shifts to discuss how these theoretical constructs could be applicable to biological systems. It argues that prokaryotic cells might use simpler, classical-like control systems while eukaryotic cells, particularly in the brain, might actually utilize quantum coherence for more complex tasks.
Implications for Eukaryotes
: The paper suggests that eukaryotic cells, due to their complexity, may require more intricate control networks that could even be quantum in nature. It also discusses the role of "Bowtie" networks that are high fan-in/fan-out networks prevalent in higher eukaryotic cells, noting how they may introduce semantic ambiguities that must be resolved by context.
The paper seems to be at the intersection of quantum computation, machine learning, and biological systems, proposing that concepts from each can inform the others in novel and interesting ways.

Each incoming signal has its own governing semantics, but 
the relevant context can depend on boundary conditions which 
can be exceedingly diff i cult (if not impossible) to predetermine 
(see e.g., [75], [76] for general discussions of the history and 
semantic depth of this problem). As pointed out in [77], a 
context change x 7��� y is semantically problematic if for 
a i xed set {oi} of observations, the conditional probability 
distributions P(oi|x) and P(oi|y) are well def i ned, but the joint 
distribution P(oi|x���y) is not [78]. This occurs whenever the 
QRFs for x and y do not commute [79, Th 7.1]. As suggested 
by Part I, Diagram 3, this context-switching problem affects 
deep learning using VAEs [80]; see e.g., the application to 
antimicrobial peptides in [81]. In general, the structure of 
Part I, Diagram 3 can serve as a convenient benchmark for 
distinguishing signal transduction networks that incorporate 
co-deployable versus non-co-deployable QRFs [79]. 
���Quantum��� context effects due to non-commutativity have, 
interestingly, been reported even at the scale of human lan- 
guage use. The ���Snow Queen��� experiment [82] challenged 
subjects with distinct, mutually-inconsistent meanings of terms 
such as ���kind���, ���evil���, or ���beautiful��� in different contexts, and 
detected statistically-signif i cant context effects using the CbD 
formalism [83], [84]. Such effects cannot be explained by 
linguistic ambiguity, misreading, etc. Such language-driven 
contextuality is taken up in the setting of psycholinguistics 
and distributional semantics in [85], which combines CbD and 
the sheaf theoretic [86], [87] methods to systematically study 
semantic ambiguity as creating meaning/sense discrepancies 
in statements like ���It was about time���, ���She had time on her 
hands to win the heat���, ���West led with a queen���, etc. 
While the notion of ���languages��� has thus far been ap- 
plied to cells, tissues, and even non-vertebrates in a mostly 
metaphorical way, we can speculate that linguistic approaches 
to understanding the interplay between context dependence 
and semantic ambiguity may be useful to biology in general. 
Immune cells (e.g., T cells) are, for example, ���programmed��� or 
���trained��� by their progenitor cells to respond to local cellular 
signals and ambient conditions in particular ways. Unexpected 
context changes may induce dysfunctional (at the organism 
scale) responses, including chronic disorders [88]; these can be 
considered consequenes of discrepancies between the ���actual��� 
semantics of incoming signals and the semantics expected by 
the immune system���s ���language.��� This suggestion of possi- 
ble ���linguistic��� contextuality seems in consonance with the 
hypothesis of [89] that the immune system is a cognitive 
(living) system implementing its exclusive system of language- 
grammar, which may be prone to analogous disorders of com- 
munication as those discussed in [85]. Similar context effects 
have been observed in microbiological systems [90]; here 
discrepancies in experimentally derived classical probabilities 
arising from lactose-glucose interference signaling in E. Coli 
can only be explained in terms of non-classical probabilities. 
We note that the expression ���quantum-like��� [91] is often used 
for such effects; however, their formal structure is exactly that 
given by quantum theory. 
We expect that further research into quantum biology will 
unfold signif i cant perspectives on human/mammalian physiol- 
ogy and cognitive capabilities along the lines suggested in the 
present article. For example, allostatic maintenance, as brief l y 
alluded to in Part I, can be seen as a process regulating a 
body���s physiological conditions relative to costs and benef i ts 
while dynamically allocating resources for the purpose of 
overall adaptability of an organism within its internal envi- 
ronment. Implementing the allostatic and anticipatory mech- 
anisms are the visceromotor cortical regions generating auto- 
nomic, hormonal, and immunological predictions leading to 
interoceptive inference [92]���[94], [96]���[99], [102]. This pro- 
cess of inference in humans and mammals putatively utilizes 
predictive coding for the processes of homeostasis-allostasis 
through a hierarchy of cellular to organ-level systems, in turn 
connecting interoception to the processes of extercoception 
and proprioception [92], [99]���[102]. The basic principles 
follow from how allostasis provides protection against po- 
tential surprise by utilizing a framework somewhat beyond 
the error signaling necessary for homeostatic maintenance (it 
is essentially through minimizing the free energy of internal 
state trajectories towards combatting surprise, as discussed in 
Part I). The net effect of the process is consonant with the 
Good Regulator theorem of [95], showing how regulation of 
a given system requires an internal model of that system. A 
further perspective is to emphasize the predictive nature of 
an integrated, complex, allostatic-interoceptive cortical system 
capable of supporting a spectrum of psychological phenomena 
including memory and emotions [99] (cf. [102]). Accordingly, 
cognitive conditions such as depression and autism have been 
described as abnormalities of allostatic-interoceptive inference, 
so impairing predictive coding mechanisms due to aberrant 
assimilation and mistuning of prediction errors (putatively a 
connectivity issue), conceivably leading to a root cause of 
many known cognitive conditions [92], [100], [102]. 
We anticipate that this fully general, context sensitive 
model of control l ow will be important for understanding 
morphogenesis, which is not simply a feed-forward emergent 
system, but rather a highly context-sensitive error-minimizing 
process [103]. Specif i cally, the collective intelligence of cells 
during embryonic development, organ regeneration, and meta- 
morphosis can create and repair specif i c complex structures 
despite a wide range of perturbations [104]. Changes in the 
genome, the number of cells, or the starting conf i guration can 
often be overcome: bisected embryos result in normal twins, 
amputated salamander limbs re-grow back to normal, and 
planarian fragments result in perfect little worms [105]. The 
competency of cellular collectives to reach the correct target 
morphology despite even drastic interventions requires an 
understanding of how they navigate, via context-sensitive con- 
trol l ow, problem spaces including anatomical morphospace 
[106], physiological, and transcriptional spaces [68], [107]. 
Understanding the navigation policies used by unconventional 
collective intelligences can help not only understand creative problem-solving on rapid timescales (such as the ability to regulate genes to accommodate an entirely novel stressor [108] 
without evolutionary adaptation), but may also have implications for predicting and managing the goals and behavioral repertoires of synthetic beings [109].

V. CONCLUSION 
We have shown here how the problem of def i ning control 
l ow arises in active inference systems, and provided three 
formal representations of the problem. We have proved that 
control l ow in such systems can always be represented by 
a tensor network, provided illustrative examples, and shown 
how the general formalism of topological quantum neural 
networks can be used to implement a general model of control 
l ow. These results provide a general formalism with which to 
characterize context dependence in active inference systems 
at any scale, from that of macromolecular pathways to that of 
multi-organism communities. They suggest that the concept 
of communication by language is not just metaphorical when 
applied to biological systems in general, but rather an appro- 
priate and productive description of interactional dynamics. 
We view these results as a further step toward fully 
integrating the formal models, concepts, and languages of 
physics, biology, and cognitive science. This integration is not 
reductive. It rather allows us to classify systems using natural 
measures of organizational and computational complexity, and 
to understand how interactions between simpler systems can 
implement the more complex behavior of the larger systems 
that they compose.

The conclusion of the text summarizes key points and emphasizes the significance of their findings for understanding active inference systems across various scales, from molecular pathways to entire communities of organisms. The core argument is that control flow in these systems can be mathematically represented using tensor networks, thus creating a formal framework for studying context-dependent behaviors.
It also posits that the language used to describe biological interactions isn't just metaphorical but a fitting and useful way to discuss these complex dynamics. This notion opens up the possibility for cross-disciplinary integration, melding the languages and formal models of physics, biology, and cognitive science to generate a richer understanding of complex systems.
Notably, this integrated approach isn't meant to be reductive; rather, it aims to provide natural measures for organizational and computational complexity. This could enable researchers to better understand how interactions between simpler components can give rise to the more intricate behaviors observed in larger, more complex systems. Overall, the text suggests that these findings could serve as a stepping stone towards a unified theory encompassing physical, biological, and cognitive phenomena.

Abstract
This paper introduces a variational formulation of natural selection, paying special attention to the nature of ���things��� and the way that different ���kinds��� of ���things��� are individuated from���and influence���each other. We use the Bayesian mechanics of particular partitions to understand how slow phylogenetic processes constrain���and are constrained by���fast, phenotypic processes. The main result is a formulation of adaptive fitness as a path integral of phenotypic fitness. Paths of least action, at the phenotypic and phylogenetic scales, can then be read as inference and learning processes, respectively. In this view, a phenotype actively infers the state of its econiche under a generative model, whose parameters are learned via natural (Bayesian model) selection. The ensuing variational synthesis features some unexpected aspects. Perhaps the most notable is that it is not possible to describe or model a population of conspecifics per se. Rather, it is necessary to consider populations of distinct natural kinds that influence each other. This paper is limited to a description of the mathematical apparatus and accompanying ideas. Subsequent work will use these methods for simulations and numerical analyses���and identify points of contact with related mathematical formulations of evolution.

1. Introduction
This paper is an attempt to show that some fundaments of theoretical evolution���and (neuro)biology���emerge when applying the free energy principle to dynamical systems with separation of temporal scales. It offers a technical and generic treatment with minimal assumptions or commitments to specific biological processes. As such, it does not borrow from established constructs in evolutionary theory; rather, it tries to show how some of these constructs are emergent properties, when seen through the lens of the free energy principle. In subsequent work, we will use the ensuing variational synthesis to consider established���and current���evolutionary theories. Our aim in this paper is to introduce a formalism that may be useful for addressing specific questions���about evolutionary or developmental dynamics���using analytic or numerical recipes that have proven useful when applying the free energy principle in other fields.
A key phylogenetic process���underlying the development and diversification of species in evolutionary time���is known as natural selection, regarded by some as the central organizing principle of biology. While Darwin conceived of natural selection in terms of heredity, variation, and selection [1,2], he only detailed selection, as the mechanisms of heredity and variation would not be understood for some time [3,4]. The integration of Mendelian genetics with natural selection in the early twentieth century was followed by an integration with molecular genetics [5] in the mid-century to form Neo-Darwinism, or the modern synthesis. The modern synthesis, along with the selfish gene hypothesis���put forth in the 1970s [6]���provide a largely gene-centric view of Darwinian evolution that dominates the current perspective.
This gene-centric view of evolutionary biology has remained largely disconnected from phenotypic processes that impact organisms in developmental time [7,8]. Lewontin characterised this disconnect���between genetic and phenotypic understanding���as the major challenge facing the field [9]. While some progress has been made in the following fifty years, biologists continue to highlight the gaps remaining for modelling biology as a single integrated process over multiple scales [10,11,12,13]. By ���gene-centric���, we refer not just to theories of sequence evolution [14], but also to the central role genes (or summary statistics of genes) play either explicitly or implicitly in accounts of phenotypic evolution. For instance, the Price Equation [15] and the closely related replicator equation [16] of evolutionary game theory express the relationship between the changes in (the average of) some phenotypic trait over time. This gene-centric view relies upon a mapping between that trait and the genetic material passed from generation to generation but focuses upon the phenotypic effects of genes as opposed to the alleles themselves. Similarly, adaptive dynamic approaches [17] typically focus upon ecological interactions at a phenotypic level. The modern focus upon phenotypic traits reflects the importance of the interaction between a phenotype and its environment in determining fitness. However, it is important to note that such perspectives do not conflict with the central role of genetic inheritance, and implicitly score the fitness of genotypes in terms of the phenotypes they imply.

The paper "A Variational Synthesis of Evolutionary and Developmental Dynamics" appears to address significant gaps in the understanding of evolutionary biology, particularly the disconnect between genetic and phenotypic processes. It aims to introduce a new formalism based on the free energy principle to unify theories in evolutionary and developmental dynamics.
The key innovation is a variational formulation of natural selection. This approach uses Bayesian mechanics to understand how slower, phylogenetic processes (e.g., natural selection over generations) are constrained by, and in turn constrain, faster phenotypic processes (e.g., adaptations within a lifetime). The paper suggests that adaptive fitness can be modeled as a "path integral of phenotypic fitness," which would imply that both short-term and long-term evolutionary processes can be understood as types of inference and learning.
Furthermore, the paper challenges the gene-centric view that currently dominates evolutionary biology. Instead of focusing solely on genetic material or summary statistics of genes, it proposes that both genetic and phenotypic perspectives are crucial for a more complete understanding of natural selection and evolutionary dynamics.
It's noteworthy that the paper suggests the need to consider populations of distinct natural kinds that influence each other, rather than just populations of conspecifics (members of the same species). This aligns with the paper's broader goal to provide a more integrated, multi-scale understanding of biological processes, ranging from genetic to phenotypic to ecological levels.
Overall, this work aims to bridge some longstanding gaps in the biological sciences by introducing mathematical formalisms that can encapsulate both evolutionary and developmental phenomena. It promises future research that will employ these methods for simulations and numerical analyses to deepen our understanding of evolution.

An organism inherits a set of instructions for growth and development (i.e., an ex- 
tended genotype) that is, in essence, a prediction about the niche environment (including 
temperature, humidity, chemical composition, available resources, statistical patterns, etc.). 
Interrogating the phrase ���survival of the i ttest��� leads to the understanding of ���f i ttest��� as 
organisms that are the best ���f i t��� to their niche environment [18]. For example, a bacterium 
from thermal hot springs will fail to thrive in a cool pond because its genotype does not 
accurately predict the niche environment. Therefore, ���f i tness��� is relative to the niche, where 
slow phylogenetic processes have selected for an extended genotype that enhances the 
growth and proliferation of organisms in the environment where the corresponding species 
expects to i nd itself. 
An organism can also ���f i t��� itself to the niche through adaptation (i.e., action, learning, 
and development) during its lifetime. For example, a bacterium that normally subsists on 
sulphur reduction���but can also survive through reducing oxygen���will outlast its sulphur- 
dependent competitors in an environment that is devoid of sulphur. Such an organism can 
adapt to its environment through learning and optimising for oxygen reduction, thereby 
increasing its i t to the niche and, implicitly, its capacity to reproduce in a high-oxygen 
environment. In this way, the phenotypic processes can enhance the i t of organisms to 
their environment in developmental time, and through reproduction, phenotypic processes 
can lead to the enhancement of i t in evolutionary time (i.e., across generations). As the 
(extended) genotype of organisms produces phenotypes, phylogenetic processes over 
evolutionary time also impact phenotypic (ontogenetic) processes in developmental time. 
Here, we offer a synthesis of evolution and development through a mathematical 
framework that unif i es slow, multi-generational (phylogenetic) processes with single- 
lifetime, phenotypic (developmental and behavioural) processes using the same principles, 
as they apply to each temporal scale. The ensuing variational account of evolution focuses 
on the coupling between phylogenetic processes at evolutionary timescales and ontogenetic 
Entropy 2023, 25, 9643 of 23 
processes over phenotypic lifetimes. In principle, this abstract treatment is agnostic to 
specif i c mechanisms, and could be applied to biological as well as non-biological systems 
provided their ���f i tness��� depends upon events during a lifetime, and where this i tness 
inf l uences dynamics over a generational scale. This multiscale account foregrounds the 
circular causality that arises from the implicit separation of timescales [19]. 
In brief, we consider slow phylogenetic processes (natural selection) as furnishing top- 
down constraints (i.e., top-down causation) on fast phenotypic processes (action selection). 
In turn, the active exchange of the phenotype with its environment provides evidence that 
is assimilated by natural selection (i.e., bottom-up causation). This ontological account is 
licensed by describing both phylogenetic and phenotypic processes as selecting (extended) 
genotypes and (extended) phenotypes [7,20] with the greatest i tness, where i tness is 
quantif i ed with (free energy) functionals of probability density functions (a functional is a 
function of a function). 
This formulation means that natural selection and action selection can be described as 
updating probabilistic beliefs at phylogenetic and phenotypic scales, respectively: namely, 
learning and inference [21���23]. This separation of scales affords an interpretation of natural 
selection as Bayesian model selection [24���26], while action selection becomes planning as infer- 
ence [27���30]���both (appearing to) optimise the same i tness functional: namely, Bayesian 
model evidence or marginal likelihood. A narrative version of this account can be told 
from the point of view of the genotype (from the bottom up) or the phenotype (from the top down):

The passage discusses how the concepts of evolution and development are intrinsically linked through a mathematical framework that applies across different temporal scales. It argues that an organism's "fitness" is not just a static measure, but a dynamic one that evolves both across generations (through natural selection) and within individual lifetimes (through adaptation, action, and learning).
In this framework, an organism inherits an "extended genotype" that acts as a prediction of its niche environment. Fitness is thus relative to how well the genotype predicts the conditions of the niche in which the organism finds itself. Over multiple generations, natural selection fine-tunes these predictions, enhancing an organism's fit to its environment.
Within a single lifetime, an organism can also improve its fit to its environment through learning and adaptation. For example, a bacterium capable of surviving in multiple ways can adapt to changes in its environment, thereby improving its chances of survival and reproduction. These adaptations within a lifetime (phenotypic processes) can then contribute to evolutionary processes (phylogenetic processes) over multiple generations.
The paper presents a multi-scale view that includes both slow phylogenetic processes and faster phenotypic processes. Natural selection acts as a "top-down" constraint on fast phenotypic processes, whereas the active interaction of the phenotype with its environment informs natural selection in a "bottom-up" manner.
The paper argues that both of these processes can be understood through the language of Bayesian probability. It likens natural selection to Bayesian model selection at the evolutionary scale, and individual actions and learning processes to planning as inference at the phenotypic scale.
In summary, this framework aims to unify our understanding of evolutionary and developmental processes by showing how both types of processes can be described by the same underlying principles. It's a multi-scale, multi-mechanism approach that provides a holistic view of biological (and potentially non-biological) systems.

From the perspective of the genotype, we can consider evolution as belief-updating 
over generations, where the belief in question corresponds to a probability density over 
extended genotypes (henceforth, genotype). This belief-based model of allelic change 
is analogous to treatments of evolution in terms of changes in allele frequencies from 
generation to generation [15]. This belief updating can be described by the probability 
of a genotype appearing in subsequent generations, in a way that depends lawfully on 
the marginal likelihood of extended phenotypes (henceforth, phenotype) in the current 
generation. The basic idea is that the genotype parameterises or encodes a generative model, which 
the phenotype uses to infer and act on its environment. On this view, evolution can be regarded 
as testing hypotheses���in the form of generative models���that this kind of phenotype can 
persist in this environment. These hypotheses are tested by exposing the phenotype to 
the environment and are rejected if the phenotype ���strays from the path��� of a persistent 
phenotype. In this way, the evolutionary process selects models or hypotheses about 
persistent phenotypes for which it has the greatest evidence. In short, natural selection is 
just Bayesian model selection [25,26,31,32]. 
From the perspective of a phenotype, each conspecif i c is equipped with a generative 
model and initial conditions that underwrite its epigenetic, developmental and ethological 
trajectories. The states of the phenotype trace out a path through state-space over its lifetime. 
These phenotypic states encode or parameterise beliefs about environmental states���and 
the way the phenotype acts. This parameterization leads to active inference and learning, 
in which the phenotype tries to make sense of its world and���through a process of belief 
updating���to realise the kind of creature it thinks it is. (We use the term ���thinks��� in a 
liberal sense here and do not mean to imply that all living entities have explicit existential 
thoughts.) More precisely, what we mean is that these entities behave as if they hold a set of 
beliefs about the sort of entity they are (e.g., the meta-Bayesian stance as considered in [33]). 
In virtue of its genetic endowment, it thinks it is a persistent phenotype. If endowed with a 
good generative model of its environment [34], it will persist and supply evidence of its ���f i t��� 
to the environment (i.e., ���f i tness���); namely, evidence (i.e., marginal likelihood) that has been 
accumulated by the slow evolutionary process. 
What follows is a formal version of this narrative that calls upon some standard results 
from statistical physics. The resulting synthesis is both dense and delicate, because it 
tries to account for coupling between a phenotype and its econiche���and the coupling 
between phenotypic and phylogenetic processes���using the same principles. Specif i cally, 
Entropy 2023, 25, 9644 of 23 
we describe a variational synthesis that calls on the path integral formulation of stochastic 
dynamics, the apparatus of the renormalisation group, and the Poincar�� recurrence theo- 
rem. The ensuing synthesis considers natural selection and action selection as emergent 
properties of two random dynamical processes unfolding at slow (phylogenetic) and fast 
(phenotypic) timescales. The key aspect of this synthesis is that both processes have an 
attracting set (a.k.a., pullback attractor) or steady-state solution [35]. These solutions corre- 
spond to an evolutionary stable state [36] and a nonequilibrium steady-state density [37] over 
phylogenetic and phenotypic states, respectively. By describing these steady states in terms 
of a phylogenetically encoded generative model���namely, a joint density over the paths of 
the phenotype and its environment���one can recover an ontological description of how the 
two processes inform, and are informed by, each other. 
Some of the analysis presented in this paper follows that in [21���23], which also 
appeals to the notion of a renormalisation group. These treatments are based upon the 
emergence of separable timescales and the interpretation of the dynamics at each scale in 
analogy with inference and learning processes. The key differences are as follows. The 
renormalisation in [21] depends upon a reduction in the number of degrees of freedom 
with learning, whereas our formulation depends upon a partitioning operation as part 
of the renormalisation. The difference in timescales between variables in [21] emerges 
from the structure of the neural network used, whereas it is a direct consequence of the 
reduction operator implicit in our choice of renormalisation. Finally, we extend our analysis 
to sentient phenotypes, whose dynamics can be interpreted explicitly in terms of Bayesian 
belief-updating. We conclude with a numerical study, illustrating the basic ideas with 
synaptic selection in the brain.

The passage is quite dense but it elaborates on the concept of evolution as a form of Bayesian model selection, both from the perspectives of genotype and phenotype.
From the genotype's viewpoint, evolution is like updating beliefs over generations. A genotype can be viewed as a set of hypotheses or generative models that predict how a phenotype will interact with its environment. If the phenotype doesn't fit well with the environment, the hypotheses (genotypes) are rejected, leading to natural selection essentially being a Bayesian model selection process.
From the phenotype's angle, each organism is thought to operate as if it has a set of beliefs about what kind of creature it is, its "generative model." As it goes through its life, it constantly updates these beliefs in response to environmental interactions, a process likened to active inference and learning.
The paper then delves into a formal mathematical treatment, involving concepts from statistical physics like the path integral formulation of stochastic dynamics, the renormalization group, and the Poincar�� recurrence theorem. This synthesis aims to describe how natural selection and individual actions can be seen as emergent properties from dynamic processes operating at different timescales (slow phylogenetic and fast phenotypic).
By integrating these two levels of processes into one framework, the paper aims to provide a cohesive view of how genotypes and phenotypes inform and are informed by each other across different scales of time. The paper also differentiates its approach from previous work, particularly in terms of the use of renormalization and how time scales are handled.
In summary, the paper aims to provide a unified mathematical framework that ties together evolutionary and developmental processes, presenting them as different aspects of a single underlying process of Bayesian model updating. It even extends its analysis to sentient phenotypes, making it applicable to neural processes as well.

2. A Variational Formulation 
We assume that evolution can be described with two random dynamical systems, de- 
scribing phylogenetic (evolutionary) and phenotypic (particular) processes, respectively. The 
idea is to couple these systems using the apparatus of the renormalisation group [38���40] to 
map from fast phenotypic dynamics to slow phylogenetic dynamics in evolutionary time. 
This mapping rests upon a dimension reduction and coarse graining or grouping 
operator (RGfor Renormalisation Group) that maps the path of a phenotype e �� 
to relevant 
variables at the evolutionary scale��=R��� e �� 
. On this view, bottom-up causation is simply 
the application of a reduction operator,R��� e �� 
, to select variables that change very slowly. 
Top-down causation entails a specif i cation of fast phenotypic trajectories in terms of slow 
genotypicvariations, whicharegroupedintopopulations,G�����, 
accordingtotheinf l uences 
they exert on each other. The implicit separation into fast and slow variables can be read 
as an adiabatic approximation [41] or���in the sense of synergetics���into fast (dynamically 
stable) and slow (dynamically unstable) modes, respectively [42]. This separation can also 
be seen in terms of vectorial geometric formulations [43]. Please see [21], who deal carefully 
with the separation of time scales by analogy with temporal dilation in physics. Intuitively, 
this analogy rests upon the idea that time can be rescaled, depending upon whether we 
take the perspective of things that move quickly or slowly. 
The i nal move is to express the dynamics���at fast and slow levels���in terms of 
functionals that have the same form. These functionals are functions of probability densities 
that can be read as Bayesian beliefs. Expressing the dynamics in this way allows one 
to interpret phenotypic dynamics as active inference and learning, under a generative 
model that depends on the extended genotype. In other words, one can interpret the 
phylogenetic state as inferring states of the environment over evolutionary time. Crucially, 
the extended genotype accumulates evidence for its phenotype, thereby evincing a form of 
Bayesianmodelselectionorstructurelearning[25,44���48]. Forananalogousthermodynamic 
treatment, please see [22], who ref i ne and extend the free energy formulation of [49]. In the 
context of learning dynamics, a thermodynamic free energy was derived in [50]���using the 
maximum entropy principle [51,52]���and later applied to study phenomenological models

of evolution [22]. Please see [50,53,54] for further discussion in terms of neural networks 
and information theory.

The section titled "A Variational Formulation" delves into the mathematical details that underpin the coupling between evolutionary (phylogenetic) and individual (phenotypic) processes. The authors use the concept of the renormalization group to bridge the gap between these two scales.
Random Dynamical Systems
: The authors posit that both evolutionary and phenotypic processes can be described as two separate but related random dynamical systems.
Renormalization Group (RG)
: This technique is used for mapping fast phenotypic changes to slow evolutionary changes over time. Essentially, it's a form of dimension reduction and coarse-graining that identifies relevant variables at the evolutionary scale.
Bottom-Up and Top-Down Causation
: The renormalization group operator
R
R
R
is used to select slowly changing variables in the bottom-up process, while in the top-down causation, fast phenotypic trajectories are framed in terms of slow genotypic variations.
Adiabatic Approximation
: The separation into fast and slow variables is likened to the adiabatic approximation in physics, which allows the authors to look at things that change at different rates through a rescaling of time.
Functionals
: The authors express the dynamics at both fast and slow scales using the same form of functionals, which are functions of probability densities interpreted as Bayesian beliefs.
Active Inference and Learning
: With this mathematical setup, the authors argue that phenotypic dynamics can be understood as a form of active inference and learning under a generative model that's rooted in the extended genotype.
Bayesian Model Selection
: The extended genotype accumulates evidence in favor of its phenotype, effectively acting as a Bayesian model selection process.
Thermodynamic and Information Theory
: References are made to previous works that have approached this from the angle of thermodynamics and information theory, particularly the use of free energy and maximum entropy principles.
Overall, this section aims to provide a formal framework that unifies phylogenetic and phenotypic processes, casting them both as kinds of inference under uncertainty, where evidence is accumulated over time to update beliefs about the state of the world.

2.1. Particular Partitions 
There are many moving parts in this formulation because it tries to account for the 
behaviourof���things���[55]andhowthisbehaviourunderwritestheemergenceof���kinds���(e.g., 
individuals and populations) at nested (i.e., developmental and evolutionary) timescales. 
We will use[x(t)] ��� e x 
to denote the history or path of a time-varying state. These 
paths are determined by state-dependent l owfx(x), with parametersx��� e x 
that include 
initial states x(0) =x0���x. These parameters denote a (natural) kind. 
Everything that follows rests upon a particular partition of states. A particular partition 
is considered necessary to talk about ���things���, such as a ���phenotype��� or ���population���. In 
brief, a particular partition enables the (internal) states of some ���thing��� to be separated 
from the (external) states of every ���thing��� else by (sensory and active) blanket states [56���60]. 
In the absence of this partition, there would be no way of distinguishing a phenotype 
from its external milieu���or a population from the environment. In this setup, external 
states can only inf l uence themselves and sensory states, while internal states can only 
inf l uence themselves and active states. See Figure 1 for an inf l uence diagram representing 
the coupling among internal, external, and blanket states: 
States:x= (��,s,a,��). States comprise the external, sensory, active and internal states 
of a phenotype. Sensory and active states constitute blanket statesb= (s,a), while 
phenotypic states comprise internal and blanket states,��= (b,��) = (s,��). The 
autonomous states of a phenotype ��= (a,��)are not inf l uenced by external states: 
i.External statesrespond to sensory and active states. These are the states of a 
phenotype���s external milieu: e.g., econiche, body, or extracellular space, depending 
upon the scale of analysis. 
ii.Sensory statesrespond to l uctuations in external and active states: e.g., chemo- 
reception, proprioception, interception. 
iii.Active statesrespond to sensory and internal states and mediate action on the envi- 
ronment, either directly or vicariously through sensory states: e.g., actin i laments, 
motor action, autonomic ref l exes. 
iv.Internal statesrespond to sensory and active states: e.g., transcription, intracellular 
concentrations, synaptic activity.

The section "2.1. Particular Partitions" delves further into the mathematical underpinnings of the variational formulation for evolutionary and phenotypic dynamics. Here are the key elements:
Nested Timescales and Kinds
: The framework attempts to account for different 'kinds' of entities (like individuals and populations) and their behaviors at nested timescales, such as developmental and evolutionary.
State-Dependent Flow
: The equations involve state-dependent flows with initial conditions that define a particular 'kind' (natural kind).
Particular Partition
: To talk about specific entities like phenotypes or populations, the authors introduce the idea of a 'particular partition' of states. These partitions allow for a separation of internal and external states through sensory and active 'blanket' states. Without this partition, one cannot distinguish an entity from its environment.
Influence Diagram
: States are defined as comprising external, sensory, active, and internal states. Sensory and active states serve as blanket states that separate internal from external states. This configuration is schematically represented for better understanding.
Stochastic Dynamics
: The evolution of these states is described by Langevin or stochastic differential equations, capturing both deterministic (state-dependent flows) and random (Wiener fluctuations) influences.
Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition
: The equations can be further simplified or expressed using this mathematical tool, which involves both gradient (dissipative) and solenoidal (conservative) flows.
Steady-State Density
: The authors note that the framework assumes a steady-state density or potential function that changes slowly, if at all, relative to the timescales of interest.
Gradient and Solenoidal Flows
: These flows are dependent on the amplitude of random fluctuations and circulate on the isocontours of a potential function called self-information.
NESS Density
: The term refers to the nonequilibrium steady-state density, which is essential for understanding the dynamics at play.
In summary, this section elaborates on how the complex dynamics of 'kinds'���ranging from individual phenotypes to entire populations���can be mathematically described. It offers a robust framework for capturing these dynamics at multiple scales and under varying conditions.

The particular partition above rests on sparse coupling between dynamic variables, 
c.f., [68,69], and evinces the notion of an ���action-perception cycle��� between external and 
internal states [70]. The terms ���external��� and ���internal��� offer useful intuitions, but it is worth 
being cautious about overinterpreting these labels in spatial terms. For instance, it might 
seem that some ���external��� variables such as ambient temperature might directly inf l uence 
���internal��� variables such as the temperature within a cell. However, this intuition would 
not be an appropriate way of thinking about this system���s partition. Either we would 
have to assume that there is an intervening variable (e.g., the temperature within the cell 
membrane) or we would have to treat the internal temperature as a sensory variable, which 
itself inf l uences internal variables such as the rates of enzymatic reactions. There is now an 
emerging literature asking about the appropriate ways to think of particular partitions in 
biology, including what is internal to a neuronal network [71], or a spinal ref l ex arc [72]. 
Figure 1.Schematic (i.e., inf l uence diagram) illustrating the sparse coupling among states that 
constitute a particular partition at two scales. 
2.2. Ensemble Dynamics and Paths of Least Action 
To describe dynamics at the phenotypic or phylogenetic scale, we i rst need to rehearse 
some standard results from statistical physics that furnish a probabilistic description of 
trajectories or paths at any scale. This description calls on the self-information of statesx(t), 
generalised states ��� 
x= (x,x0,...), and paths, e x 
= [x(t)], whereD���x= (x0,x00,...)denotes 
generalised notion, and 2�� is the covariance of generalised random l uctuations: 
=(x) = ���ln p(x) 
L(���x) = ���ln p(���x ? ? ?x 
0) = 1 2[ln ? ? ?�� ? ? ?+(D 
��� x���f(���x)) �� 
1 
2��(D ��� x���f(���x)) + ��� ��f] 
A( e x 
) = ���ln 
p( e x ? ? ?x 
0) = R dtL(���x) 
(3) 
Entropy 2023, 25, 9647 of 23 
The i rst measure,=(x), 
is the self-information or surprisal of a state, namely, the 
implausibility of a state being occupied. When the state is an allele frequency and evolves 
according to Wright���Fisher dynamics, this is sometimes referred to as an ���adaptive land- 
scape��� [73]. The second,L(���x), 
is the Lagrangian, which is the surprisal of a generalised state, 
namely, the instantaneous path associated with the motion from an initial state. In gener- 
alised coordinates of motion, the state, velocity, acceleration, etc., are treated as separate 
(generalised) states that are coupled through the l ow [74,75]. Finally, the surprisal of a 
pathA( e x 
)is called action, namely, the path integral of the Lagrangian. 
Generalised states afford a convenient way of expressing the path of least action in 
terms of the Lagrangian

��� x���D���x= ��������� xL( 
��� x) ��� 
. 
��� 
x(��) =D���x��� ������ xL( 
��� 
x)(4) 
The i rst equality resembles a Lagrange equation of the i rst kind that ensures the 
generalised motion of states is the state of generalised motion. Alternatively, it can be 
read as a gradient descent on the Lagrangian, in a moving frame of reference (second 
equality). When the Lagrangian is convex, solutions to this generalised gradient descent on 
the Lagrangian (third equality) necessarily converge to the path of least action. Denoting 
paths of least action with boldface: 
. ��� 
x=D���x=f(���x) 
��� ������ xL( 
��� 
x) =0��� 
��� 
x=argmin��� xL( 
��� 
x) 
�����e xA( 
~ 
x) =0��� 
~ x=argmine xA( e x 
) 
(5) 
Convergence is guaranteed by the quadratic form (i.e., convexity) of the Lagrangian, 
which inherits from Gaussian assumptions about random l uctuations. This gradient 
descent is sometimes described as convergence to the path of least action, in a frame of 
reference that moves with the state of generalised motion [76]. 
We can also express the conditional independencies implied by a particular partition 
using the Lagrangian of generalised states. Because there are no l ows that depend on both 
internal and external states, external and internal paths are independent, when conditioned 
on blanket paths: 
���2f

a) = L(�����|���s , ��� 
a) + L(�����|���s , ��� 
a) ��� (�������������)|���s , ��� 
a,x0(6) 
In other words, blanket paths furnish a Markov blanket over internal paths. We will 
use this result later to disambiguate the role of active and sensory dynamics in sentient 
behaviour���i.e., active inference���of a phenotype. First, we have to establish a formalism 
for ensembles or populations of phenotypes. Here, we draw on the apparatus of the 
renormalisation group. 
2.3. Different Kinds of Things 
To deal with multiple ���things��� (e.g., particles, phenotypes and populations), we i rst 
introduce a grouping operatorGthat partitions the states at the i-th scale of analysis into 
N particles on the basis of the sparse coupling implied by a particular partition. In other 
words, we group states into an ensemble of particles, where each particle has its own 
internal and blanket states. With a slight abuse of the set builder notation:

The text you've provided appears to be a technical excerpt discussing concepts from physics and systems theory, applied to topics possibly related to biological systems. It delves into the notions of internal and external variables, and their interconnections, while cautioning against overinterpreting these terms. The text also introduces mathematical formulations related to dynamics, such as the Lagrangian and action, and how these are related to paths of least action and ensemble dynamics.
Specifically, the piece covers:
The caution needed when interpreting 'internal' and 'external' variables, particularly in biological systems like cellular dynamics.
The use of concepts from statistical physics to describe system dynamics, including the notion of surprisal or self-information.
The mathematical formulation of paths of least action and how they can be derived from the Lagrangian.
The idea of conditional independence, or Markov blankets, between internal and external paths.
Overall, the text appears to be aiming to provide a theoretical foundation for understanding complex systems, potentially in biology, through the lens of statistical physics and dynamics. It seems quite dense and would likely require a solid understanding of the referenced fields to fully grasp. Would you like to know more about any specific section or term?

It looks like you've posted a highly technical and specialized section of text related to mathematical physics, likely from a research paper. The equations and notation involve Lagrangians, Markov blankets, and the formalism of populations or ensembles of particles, perhaps in the context of complex systems or statistical physics. It also seems to touch upon scale analysis, particularly using the renormalization group and the concept of 'particles of particles.'
Due to the formatting and the specialized nature of the text, it's not entirely clear what specific question or point you'd like to address. Could you please clarify what you're asking or what you'd like to know more about?

A summary of the main points

ChatGPT
Certainly, based on the text provided:
Lagrangian Formalism
: The text begins by discussing a Lagrangian framework involving internal, external, and blanket states. These states appear to be described by certain mathematical equations, potentially from the field of statistical physics or complex systems theory.
Markov Blanket
: It asserts that blanket paths furnish a "Markov blanket" over internal paths. In simpler terms, the surrounding or 'blanket' states statistically segregate internal states from external ones, serving as a kind of barrier or filter.
Active and Sensory Dynamics
: The text hints that this formalism can be used to explore sentient behavior, particularly active inference, although this is something to be addressed later in the work.
Ensembles and Renormalization
: To deal with multiple "things" like particles or phenotypes, the authors introduce a "grouping operator (G)" that partitions states based on their sparse coupling. The renormalization group is cited as a relevant mathematical tool here.
Hierarchical Structure
: It seems that there is a recursive or multi-scale structure to the system, where states of particles at one scale form the particular states at a higher scale. This is indicated through the use of grouping (G) and reduction (R) operators, and could involve creating 'particles of particles', i.e., populations.
Scale Analysis
: The composition of operators maps states from one scale to another, suggesting a focus on hierarchical or multi-scale systems.
The text appears to be laying the groundwork for a multi-scale, statistical, or complex systems analysis, likely relevant to fields like theoretical physics, complex systems, or perhaps even biology given the mention of "phenotypes".
Would you like to explore any of these points in more detail?

The primary offering of this variational formulation of natural selection���from an 
empirical perspective���is that one can hypothesise alternative forms for the Lagrangian. 
Each choice of Lagrangian will have consequences not only for the dynamics over physio- 
logical and developmental timescales but will also allow for predictions as to evolution over 
phylogenetic timescales. It is also worth noting that the account of natural selection set out 
here, in which genotypic evolution depends upon the action of phenotypic paths, applies 
to systems that satisfy the variational i tness lemma (Lemma 1): namely, the likelihood 
of an agent���s genotype corresponds to the likelihood of its phenotypic trajectory. While 
a plausible assumption���that is intuitively consistent with Darwinian evolution���we did 
not examine the conditions under which this assumption holds. This means there is an 
opportunity to further the ideas set out in this paper by examining the sorts of stochastic 
systems in which the variational i tness lemma (Lemma 1) holds. It could be argued that 
Lemma 1 must hold at least in those systems where the genotype transforms into the 
phenotype retaining an equivalence within stochastic limits. For example, gene expression 
is the most fundamental level at which the genotype gives rise to the phenotype, and this 
mapping from genotype to phenotype is the subject of the many process theories studied 
by developmental biology. On a teleological view, one might further argue that active 
inference is necessary to maintain a high degree of equivalence during the course of this 
transformation and to preserve a correspondence between genotype and phenotype. 
Available edge cases are, however, informative. Single mutations can induce saltatory 
changes in phenotype; a canonical example is the four-winged Drosophila melanogaster l y 
produced by combining three mutations, abx, bx3, and pbx of the bithorax complex in a 
single animal [113]. In complementary fashion, the planarian Dugesia japonica reproduces 
by i ssion followed by regeneration and has a heterogeneous, mixoploid genome with no 
known heritable mutants [114]; the phenotype of this animal has, however, remained stable 
for many thousands of generations in laboratories, and in all likelihood for millions of 
years in the wild. The phenotype can, moreover, be perturbed in saltatory fashion from 
one-headed to two-headed by an externally imposed bioelectric change; this altered pheno- 
type is bioelectrically reversible but otherwise apparently permanent [115]. Engineering 
methods can create even more radically diverse phenotypes without genetic modif i cations, 
as demonstrated by the ���xenobots��� prepared from Xenopus laevis skin cells, which adopt 
Entropy 2023, 25, 96419 of 23 
morphologies and behaviours completely unlike those that skin cells manifest when in the 
frog [116,117]. 
The availability of experimentally tractable edge cases of Lemma 1 provides an oppor- 
tunity to further the ideas set out in this paper by examining the sorts of stochastic systems 
in which the variational i tness lemma (Lemma 1) holds. The kinds of edge cases mentioned 
above suggest, however, that Lemma 1 could be weakened to holding ���up to��� saltatory 
events, including abiotic events such as bolide impacts, affecting genotype, phenotype, or 
both without substantially affecting the theory. Any systems that survive such events���any 
systems whose Markov blankets remain intact���simply carry on, undergoing learning, 
variation, and selection as if the saltatory event had never occurred. 
One could suggest that Lemma 1, and the broader scope of the formalisms described 
here, may be applicable to systems where a population of entities engages in intergenerational 
replication (modelled here using the renormalisation operations), and where those entities at a 
faster timescale engage in rapid adaptation (e.g., development, learning, behaviour, modelled 
with active inference) during their lifetime. These two levels could, for example, model how 
genome-based intergenerational evolution sets initial conditions for organismal molecular and 
behavioural developments. For the faster intra-generational scale, the external states model the 
material basis of what the phenotype is a generative model of. For the slower inter-generational 
scale, the external states are updated through time as a process of renormalisation (reduction 
and grouping) of the extended genotype-phenotype. 
7. Conclusions 
This work attempts to unify the slow, multi-generational phylogenetic process of 
natural selection with the single-lifetime, phenotypic process of development (equations 
and notation summarized in Supplementary Materials). In this perspective, a bidirectional 
l ow of information occurs as evolution imposes top-down constraints on phenotypic 
processes, and action selection provides evidence that is selected for by the environment 
(i.e., bottom-up causation). In this account, learning and inference occur through updating 
probabilistic beliefs via Bayesian model selection in evolutionary time and active inference 
in developmental time. The i tness of (extended) genotypes and (extended) phenotypes is 
selected for through the minimisation of the same free energy functional: Bayesian model 
evidence or marginal likelihood. 
Further studies using both simulations and laboratory experiments are clearly needed 
to test this framework in the context of particular process theories that propose explicit 
functional connections between genotype and phenotype. While Lemma 1 is prima facie 
plausible in the case of idealised ���central dogma��� organisms in which phenotype is largely 
determined by genotype within a tightly constrained, essentially static niche, the relation 
between genotype and phenotype in holobionts inhabiting realistic niches can be expected 
to be substantially more complex. ���Egalitarian��� organisms, e.g., obligate symbionts or 
holobionts, comprising cells with different genotypes [118] and engineered systems���that 
offer cells radically different environments than they have experienced in phylogenetic 
evolution to date [119]���may be of particular interest for such studies.

This text discusses a variational formulation of natural selection, which can be empirically tested by manipulating the Lagrangian. Here are the main points:
Lagrangian Choice
: The choice of Lagrangian can predict dynamics over both physiological and developmental timescales, as well as phylogenetic (evolutionary) ones.
Variational Fitness Lemma (Lemma 1)
: The paper introduces a lemma that links the likelihood of an agent���s genotype with its phenotypic trajectory. This seems consistent with Darwinian evolution.
Conditions Unexplored

Abstract
We present a normative computational theory of how the brain may support visually-guided goal-directed actions in dynamically changing environments. It extends the Active Inference theory of cortical processing according to which the brain maintains beliefs over the environmental state, and motor control signals try to fulfill the corresponding sensory predictions. We propose that the neural circuitry in the Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC) compute flexible intentions���or motor plans from a belief over targets���to dynamically generate goal-directed actions, and we develop a computational formalization of this process. A proof-of-concept agent embodying visual and proprioceptive sensors and an actuated upper limb was tested on target-reaching tasks. The agent behaved correctly under various conditions, including static and dynamic targets, different sensory feedbacks, sensory precisions, intention gains, and movement policies; limit conditions were individuated, too. Active Inference driven by dynamic and flexible intentions can thus support goal-directed behavior in constantly changing environments, and the PPC might putatively host its core intention mechanism. More broadly, the study provides a normative computational basis for research on goal-directed behavior in end-to-end settings and further advances mechanistic theories of active biological systems.

1. Introduction
Traditionally, sensorimotor control in goal-directed actions like object-reaching is viewed as a sensory-response mapping involving several steps, starting with perception, movement planning in the body posture domain, translation of this plan in muscle commands, and finally movement execution (Erlhagen and Sch��ner, 2002). However, each of these steps is hindered by noise and delays, which make the approach unfeasible to operate in changing environments (Franklin and Wolpert, 2011). Instead, Predictive Coding or ���Bayesian Brain��� theories propose that prior knowledge and expectations over the environmental and bodily contexts provide crucial anticipatory information (Rao and Ballard, 1999). Under this perspective, motor control begins with target anticipation and motor planning even before obtaining sensory evidence. Here, we take on this view and extend an increasingly popular Predictive Coding based theory of action, Active Inference (Friston et al., 2010), with the formalization of flexible target-dependent motor plans. Moreover, based on extensive neural evidence for the role of the PPC in goal coding and motor planning (Snyder et al., 2000; Galletti et al., 2022), we propose that this cortical structure is the most likely neural correlate of the core intention manipulation process.

In primates, the dorsomedial visual stream provides critical support for continuously monitoring the body posture and the spatial location of objects to specify and guide actions, and for performing visuomotor transformations in the course of the evolving movement (Cisek and Kalaska, 2010; Fattori et al., 2017; Galletti and Fattori, 2018). The PPC, located at the apex of the dorsal stream, is also bidirectionally connected to frontal areas, motor and somatosensory cortex, placing it in a privileged position to set goal-directed actions and continuously adjust motor plans by tracking moving targets and posture (Andersen, 1995; Gamberini et al., 2021) in a common reference frame (Cohen and Andersen, 2002). Undoubtedly, the PPC plays a crucial role in visually-guided motor control (Desmurget et al., 1999; Filippini et al., 2018; Gamberini et al., 2021)���with the specific subregion V6A involved in the control of reach-to-grasp actions (Galletti et al., 2022)���but its peculiar role is still disputed. The most consistent view is that the PPC estimates the states of both body and environment and optimizes their interactions (Medendorp and Heed, 2019). Others see the PPC as a task estimator (Haar and Donchin, 2020) or as being involved in endogenous attention and task setting (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002). Its underlying computational mechanism is not fully understood, especially as regards the definition of goals in motor planning and their integration within the control process (Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008). For example, the prevailing Optimal Feedback Control theory defines motor goals through task-specific cost functions (Todorov, 2004). Neural-level details of motor goal coding are becoming increasingly important in light of the growing demand for neural interfaces that provide information about motor intents (Gallego et al., 2022) in support of intelligent assistive devices (Velliste et al., 2008; Srinivasan et al., 2021).

Intentions encode motor goals���or plans���set before the beginning of motor acts themselves and could be therefore viewed as memory holders of voluntary actions (Andersen, 1995; Snyder et al., 1997; Lau et al., 2004; Fogassi et al., 2005). Several cortical areas handle different aspects of this process: the Premotor cortex (PM) encodes structuring while the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) controls phasing (Gallego et al., 2022). In turn, the PPC plays a role in building motor plans and their dynamic tuning, as different PPC neurons are sensitive to different intentions (Snyder et al., 2000). Notably, intention neurons respond not only when performing a given action but also during its observation, allowing observers to predict the goal of the observed action and, thus, to ���read��� the intention of the acting individual (Fogassi et al., 2005). Motor goals have also been observed down the motor hierarchy, which is an expression of Hierarchical Predictive Coding in the motor domain (Friston et al., 2011).

To investigate how neural circuitry in the PPC supports sensory-guided actions through motor intentions from a computational point of view, we adopted the Active Inference theory of cognitive and motor control, which provides fundamental insights of increasing appeal about the computational role and principles of the nervous system, especially about the perception-action loop (Friston and Kiebel, 2009; Friston et al., 2010; Bogacz, 2017; Parr et al., 2022). Indeed, Active Inference provides a formalization of these two cortical tasks, both of which are viewed as aiming to resolve the critical goal of all organisms: to survive in uncertain environments by operating within preferred states (e.g., maintaining a constant temperature). Accordingly, both tasks are implemented by dynamic minimization of a quantity called free energy, whose process generally corresponds to the minimization of high- and low-level prediction errors, that is, the satisfaction of prior and sensory expectations. There are two branches of Active Inference appropriate to tackle two different levels of control. The discrete framework can explain high-level cognitive control processes such as planning and decision-making, i.e., it evaluates expected outcomes to select actions in discrete entities (Pezzulo et al., 2018). In turn, dynamic adjustment of action plans in the PPC matches by functionality the Active Inference framework in continuous state space (Friston et al., 2011, 2012). In short, this theory departs from classical views of perception, motor planning (Erlhagen and Sch��ner, 2002), and motor control (Todorov, 2004), unifying and considering them as a dynamic probabilistic inference problem (Toussaint and Storkey, 2006; Kaplan and Friston, 2018; Levine, 2018; Millidge et al., 2020). The biologically implausible cost functions typical of Optimal Control theories are replaced by high-level priors defined in the extrinsic state space, allowing complex movements such as walking or handwriting (Friston, 2011; Adams et al., 2013).

In the following, we first outline the background computational framework and then elaborate on movement planning and intentionality in continuous Active Inference. Our most critical contributions regard the formalization of goal-directed behavior and the processes linking dynamic goals (e.g., moving visual targets) with motor plans through the definition of flexible intentions. We also investigate a more parsimonious approach to motor control based solely on proprioceptive predictions. We then provide implementation details and a practical demonstration of the theoretical contribution in terms of a simulated Active Inference agent, which we show is capable of detecting and reaching static visual goals and tracking moving targets. We also provide detailed performance statistics and investigate the effects of system parameters whose balance is critical to movement stability. Additionally, gradient analysis provides crucial insights into the causes of the movements performed. Finally, we discuss how intentions could be selected to perform a series of goal-directed steps, e.g., a multi-phase action, and illustrate conditions for neurological disorders.

The article, "Flexible Intentions: An Active Inference Theory," by Matteo Priorelli and Ivilin Peev Stoianov, presents a computational theory for understanding how the brain supports visually-guided, goal-directed actions in dynamic environments. The study builds on Active Inference theory, proposing that the neural circuitry in the Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC) is responsible for computing "flexible intentions," which help generate adaptive, goal-directed actions.
The authors argue that traditional sensorimotor models, hindered by noise and delays, are not efficient for dynamically changing environments. They advocate for a Predictive Coding or "Bayesian Brain" approach, which anticipates targets and plans movements even before obtaining sensory data. They propose that the PPC plays a vital role in forming and dynamically adjusting these plans. They also suggest that different neurons in the PPC are sensitive to different intentions and that this mechanism is critical for both executing and observing actions.
To validate their theory, the authors created a computational agent with visual and proprioceptive sensors and an actuated upper limb. This agent was tested in various target-reaching tasks and performed successfully under different conditions like dynamic targets, varying sensory feedback, and different movement policies.
The study concludes that Active Inference theory, when combined with the concept of flexible intentions located in the PPC, can effectively support goal-directed behavior in dynamic environments. This work aims to serve as a normative computational basis for future research in goal-directed behavior and could have implications for neural interfaces and intelligent assistive devices.

We first outline the computational principles of the underlying probabilistic and Predictive Coding approach and provide background on variational inference, free energy minimization, Active Inference, and variational autoencoders necessary to comprehend the following main contribution.

2.1. The Bayesian brain hypothesis
An interesting visual phenomenon, called binocular rivalry, happens when two different images are presented simultaneously to each eye: the perception does not conform to the visual input but alternates between the two images. How and why does this happen? It is well-known that priors play a fundamental role in driving the dynamics of perceptual experience, but dominant views of the brain as a feature detector that passively receives sensory signals and computes motor commands have so far failed to explain how such illusions could arise.

In recent years, there has been increasing attention to a radically new theory of the mind called the Bayesian brain, according to which our brain is a sophisticated machine that constantly makes use of Bayesian reasoning to capture causal relationships in the world and deliver optimal behavior in an uncertain environment (Doya, 2007; Hohwy, 2013; Pezzulo et al., 2017). At the core of the theory is the Bayes theorem, whose application here implies that posterior beliefs about the world are updated according to the product of prior beliefs and the likelihood of observing sensory input. In this view, perception is more than a simple bottom-up feedforward mechanism that detects features and objects from the current sensorium; rather, it comprises a predictive top-down generative model which continuously anticipates the sensory input to test hypotheses and explain away ambiguities.

According to the Bayesian brain hypothesis, this complex task is accomplished by Predictive Coding, implemented through message passing of top-down predictions and bottom-up prediction errors between adjacent cortical layers (Rao and Ballard, 1999). The former are generated from latent states maintained at the highest levels, representing beliefs about the causes of the environment, while the latter are computed by comparing sensory-level predictions with the actual observations. Each prediction will then act as a cause for the layer below, while the prediction error will convey information to the layer above. It is thanks to this hierarchical organization and through error minimization at every layer that the cortex is supposed to be able to mimic and capture the inherently hierarchical relationships that model the world. In this view, sensations are only needed in that they provide, through the computation of prediction errors, a measure of how good the model is and a cue to correct future predictions. Thus, ascending projections do not encode the features of a stimulus, but rather how much the brain is surprised about it, considering the strict correlation between surprise and model uncertainty.

The section begins by acknowledging the limitations of traditional views of the brain as a passive feature detector, using the example of the binocular rivalry visual phenomenon, where perception alternates between two different images presented to each eye. Traditional models have struggled to explain how such perceptual dynamics could happen.
In contrast, the Bayesian brain hypothesis suggests that the brain operates as a sophisticated machine that continually employs Bayesian reasoning to interpret the world and guide behavior. Central to this theory is the concept of Predictive Coding, where the brain is not merely processing sensory inputs passively but is proactively generating predictions about what it should perceive. This approach relies on Bayesian principles to update beliefs about the world based on prior knowledge and incoming sensory information.
Predictive Coding is implemented hierarchically in the brain's cortical layers. Top-down predictions generated from higher cortical levels (representing prior beliefs) and bottom-up prediction errors from lower levels (based on sensory input) pass messages between each other. This dynamic allows the brain to refine its understanding continually and to reduce the "surprise" or prediction error at each layer.
In summary, according to the Bayesian brain hypothesis and the Predictive Coding approach, perception is not just a bottom-up process based on incoming sensory data. Instead, it's a complex, interactive process where the brain constantly updates its beliefs and expectations about the world, testing those against incoming sensory information to refine its predictions and better understand the environment. This provides a much richer, dynamic view of cognition and perception than traditional models.

2.2. Variational bayes
Organisms are supposed to implement model fit or error minimization by some form of variational inference, a broad family of techniques based on the calculus of variations and used to approximate intractable posteriors that would otherwise be infeasible to compute analytically or even with classical sampling methods like Monte Carlo (Bishop, 2006). Under the Bayesian brain hypothesis, we can assume that the nervous system maintains latent variables z about both the unknown state of the external world and the internal state of the organism. By exploiting a prior knowledge p(z) and the partial evidence p(s) of the environment provided by its sensors, it can apply Bayesian inference to improve its knowledge (Ma et al., 2006). To do so, given the observation s, the nervous system needs to evaluate the posterior p(z|s):

p(z|s)=p(z,s)p(s)
(1)
However, directly computing such quantity is infeasible due to the intractability of the marginal p(s) = ���p(z, s)dz, which involves integration over the joint density p(z, s). What does the variational approach is approximating the posterior with a simpler to compute recognition distribution q(z)���p(z|s) through minimization of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between them:

DKL[q(z)||p(z|s)]=���zq(z)ln q(z)p(z|s)dz
(2)
The KL divergence can be rewritten as the difference between log evidence ln p(s) and a quantity L(q) known as evidence lower bound, or ELBO (Bishop, 2006):

DKL[q(z)||p(z|s)]=ln p(s)������zq(z)ln p(z,s)q(z)dz=ln p(s)���L(q)
(3)
Since the KL divergence is always nonnegative, the ELBO provides a lower bound on log evidence, i.e., L(q)���ln p(s). Therefore, minimizing the KL divergence with respect to q(z) is equivalent to maximizing L(q), which at its maximum corresponds to an approximate density that is closest the most to the real posterior, depending on the particular choice of the form of q(z). In general, few assumptions are made about the form of this distribution���a multivariate Gaussian is a typical choice���with a trade-off between having a tractable optimization process and still leading to a good approximate posterior

The section delves into how the Bayesian brain hypothesis might practically be implemented within neural systems through Variational Bayes, a method that draws on variational inference techniques.

2.3. Free energy and prediction errors
How can Bayesian inference be implemented through a simple message passing of prediction errors? Friston (2002, 2005) proposed an elegant solution based on the so-called free energy, a concept borrowed from thermodynamics and defined as the negative ELBO. Accordingly, Equation (3) can be rewritten as:

F(z,s)=���L(q)=DKL[q(z)||p(z|s)]���ln p(s)=���zq(z)ln q(z)p(z,s)dz
(4)
Minimizing the free energy with respect to the latent states z���a process called perceptual inference���is then equivalent to ELBO maximization and provides an upper bound on surprise:

z=arg min zF(z,s)
(5)
In this way, the organism indirectly minimizes model uncertainty and is able to learn the causal relations between unknown states and sensory input, and to generate predictions based on its current representation of the environment. Free energy minimization is simpler than dealing with the KL divergence between the approximate and true posteriors as the former depends on quantities that the organism has access to, namely the approximate posterior and the generative model.

To this concern, it is necessary to distinguish between the latter and the real distribution producing sensory data, called generative process, which can be modeled with the following non-linear stochastic equations:

s=g(z)+wsz���=f(z)+wz
(6)
Where the function g maps latent states or causes z to observed states or sensations s, the function f encodes the dynamics of the system, i.e., the evolution of z over time, while ws and wz are noise terms that describe system uncertainty.

Nervous systems are supposed to approximate the generative process by making a few assumptions: that (i) under the mean-field approximation the recognition density can be partitioned into independent distributions: q(z) = ���iq(zi), and that (ii) under the Laplace approximation each of these partitions is Gaussian: q(zi)=N(��i,�����1i), where ��i represents the most plausible hypothesis���also called belief about the hidden state zi - and ��i is its precision matrix (Friston et al., 2007). In this way, the free energy does not depend on z and simplifies as follows:

F(��,s)=���ln p(��,s)+C=���ln p(s|��)���ln p(��)+C
(7)
Where C is a constant term. A more precise description of the unknown environmental dynamics can be achieved by considering not only the 1st order of Equation 6 but also higher temporal orders of the corresponding approximations: ����={��,�����,��������,...}���called generalized coordinates (Friston, 2008; Friston et al., 2008). This allows us to better represent the environment with the following generalized model:

s��=g��(����)+wsD����=f��(����)+w��
(8)
Where D is the differential (shift) operator matrix such that D����={�����,��������,...}, s�� denotes the generalized sensors, while g�� and f�� denote the generalized model

The section 2.3 discusses the implementation of Bayesian inference through the minimization of free energy, a concept that Karl Friston borrowed from thermodynamics. Here, free energy is defined as the negative of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). Essentially, minimizing free energy is equivalent to maximizing ELBO, and by extension, this minimizes the KL divergence, which gives us a good approximation of the real-world posterior.

6. Discussion
We presented a normative computational theory based on Active Inference of how the neural circuitry in the PPC and DVS may support visually-guided actions in a dynamically changing environment. Our focus was on the computational basis of encoding dynamic action goals in the PPC through flexible motor intentions and its putative neural basis in the PPC. The theory is based on Predictive Coding (Doya, 2007; Hohwy, 2013), Active Inference (Friston, 2010), and evidence suggesting that the PPC performs visuomotor transformations (Cisek and Kalaska, 2010; Fattori et al., 2017; Galletti and Fattori, 2018) and encodes motor plans (Andersen, 1995; Snyder et al., 1997). Accordingly, the PPC is proposed to maintain dynamic expectations of both current and desired latent states over the environment and use them to generate proprioceptive predictions that ultimately generate movements through reflex arcs (Adams et al., 2013; Versteeg et al., 2021). In turn, the DVS encodes a generative model that translates latent state expectations into visual predictions. Discrepancies between sensory-level predictions and actual sensations produce prediction errors sent back through the cortical hierarchy to improve the internal representation. The theory unifies research on intention coding (Snyder et al., 1997) and current views that the PPC estimates the body and environmental states (Medendorp and Heed, 2019), providing specific computational hypotheses regarding the involvement in goal-directed behavior. It also extends some perception-bound Predictive Coding interpretations of the PPC dynamics (FitzGerald et al., 2015) and provides a more comprehensive account of movement planning (Erlhagen and Sch��ner, 2002), tightly integrated into the overall sensorimotor control process.

The core novelty with respect to state-of-the-art implementations in continuous time Active Inference is that we first considered an internal belief over not only bodily states but also every object in the scene, where the latter are encoded in the joint angles space as well, simulating a visuomotor reference frame that the PPC is supposed to encode. Then, we decomposed the belief dynamics into a set of independent intentions each depending on the current belief and predicting the next plausible state. Such formalization has several advantages. First, since attractors are dynamically generated at each time step, the agent can also follow moving targets and interact with a constantly changing environment, in contrast to static reaching tasks where a desired fixed state is specified in the belief dynamics (Baioumy et al., 2020). Second, expressing the target position in terms of a possible joint configuration���either imposed by higher levels for realizing specific affordances or freely inferred by the exteroceptive models���results in simple intentions, without the need to directly use sensory information or duplicating lower-level generative models, which leads to implausible scenarios (Lanillos et al., 2020; Sancaktar et al., 2020). It should be however noted that, although an intrinsic-only attractor is faster and more parsimonious, continuous activation of visual low-level attractors may provide more precise motor control. Indeed, it seems that motor areas are able, at a certain "neural energy" cost, to interact with and generate predictions in multiple sensory domains. The key difference is that in the former a single prediction���which is already biased toward a future state���is compared with the sensory input; in the latter, a prediction of the current state is compared with the desired exteroceptive goal, biasing the belief through the backpropagated gradient. Further studies are thus needed to implement low-level attractors in a biologically plausible way���e.g., intentions could generate through parallel pathways their own future sensory predictions that are compared with the observations in the usual way, with a particular intention that can be viewed as trying to continuously predict the current sensory input���and analyze the differences between the two modalities. Last, maintaining different belief components also allows easy encoding of previously memorized states which can be especially useful when implementing a sequence of actions, since only the intention precisions have to be adjusted. Indeed, it seems that the PPC explicitly encodes and maintains such goals during the whole unfolding of sequential actions (Baldauf et al., 2008). A specific goal is selected among other competitive intentions possibly under the control of the PFC and PMd (Stoianov et al., 2016) and fulfilled by setting it as a predominant belief trajectory as an attractor with a strong gain (see Equations 44, 26 and Figure 4). For example, in a typical reaching task, the goal of reaching a specific visual target corresponds to the future expectation that the agent's arm will be over that target; thus, if the agent maintains a belief over the latter, the corresponding intention links the expected belief over the future body posture with the inferred target, expressed in joint angles, encoding a specific interaction to realize.

We tested the computational feasibility of the theory on a delayed reaching task���a classical experiment in electrophysiology���in which a monkey is required to reach with its hand a visual-spatial target, starting the movement from an HB (Breveglieri et al., 2014). To do this, we simulated an agent consisting of a coarse 3-DoF limb model and noisy visual and proprioceptive sensors (Figure 3A). Simplified proprioceptive sensors provided a noisy reading of the state of the limb in joint angles, while visual input was provided by a fixed camera and consisted of an image of the target and limb. Predictive visual sensory processing simulating the DVS was implemented with a VAE trained to infer body state and target location, both in the joint angles domain (Figure 3C). The limbs were animated at the velocity level with motor control signals computed by the visually-guided Active Inference controller. The computational analysis showed, first and most importantly, that the controller could correctly infer the position of the visual targets (Figure 5, t = 70), use it to compute and set motor goals in terms of prior beliefs on the future body state through intention functions (Figure 5, t = 105), and perform adequate and smooth reach movements (Figure 5 t = 105���150), with and without visual feedback (Figure 6). The greater accuracy obtained with visual feedback parallels classical results in a similar classical behavioral comparison of reaching (Keele and Posner, 1968).

We then systematically investigated the effects of noise on various functional components (Figure 7), starting with the balance of the precision between proprioceptive and visual sensory models: a noiseless Active Inference agent (BL condition) resulted in the best performance, with a stable final approach and accuracy only limited by the quality of the visual target estimation. Among the noisy conditions, pure proprioceptive control resulted in the lowest performance, as expected. Motor control driven by both proprioceptive and visual feedback with balanced precision between the two domains resulted in improved reach accuracy and greatly improved arm belief stability (Figure 8). The effect on accuracy was mainly due to the inclusion of visual information in the inference process, but also to slower updates of the motor control signals due to decreased confidence about proprioceptive input. The increased stability of the arm belief did not improve movement stability as increasing confidence about visual input also increased the discrepancy between belief and action updates, the latter only relying on noisy proprioceptive observations. In fact, we showed that if we remove the plausibility constraint that motor control is driven only by proprioceptive predictions and thus let actions minimize prediction errors from all sensory domains, the reach performance greatly increases (Figure 9). Nonetheless, any combination of visual and proprioceptive feedback improved performance relative to a control driven by feedback from a single sensory domain. The instability due to the difference in update directions between belief and action could be balanced by other mechanisms that we have not considered here. For example, we assumed that the same pathway is used for both control and belief inference, but it seems that the motor cortex generates different predictions depending on the brain areas which it interacts with: purely proprioceptive predictions for motor control, whose prediction error is suppressed at the lowest level of the hierarchy, and rich somatosensory predictions for latent state inference, which integrates somatic sensations at different hierarchical levels (Adams et al., 2013). Intention precisions or attractor gains affected performance as well. First, they affected reach time: as expected, the greater the gain, the faster the movement. However, fast movements come at a cost: increased gains generally resulted in less precise movements and decreased stability during the final reach period. Finally, higher visual target precisions decreased perception time and improved perception accuracy but decreased perception stability.

We also investigated the effects of movement onset policies: response delay allows investigating perceptual and motor preparatory processes separately from the motor control and action execution. We found that delayed response decreased movement time with respect to a policy that requires an immediate response (Figure 10), which fits the behavioral pattern (Shenoy et al., 2013). Apparently, this is due to the need to estimate, in the latter condition, the target position ���on the fly,��� and constantly adapt the intention according to the updated target estimate. The advantage of allowing some preparatory time becomes clear in an anecdotal fly-catching task, which results in faster movement and increased chances of success. This comes with the critical contribution of PPC neurons that systematically modulate their activity during the preparatory period (Shenoy et al., 2013), which here provided specific predictions for the computations performed in the PPC. Notably, the immediate-response policy allowed the Active Inference controller to perform actions under dynamic environmental conditions, such as tracking moving objects. Free energy minimization resulted in rapid target detection also in this case, and maintained subthreshold perception error on moving targets (Figure 11) which allowed precise tracking after an initial reaching period.

Intention-driven Active Inference in continuous time largely compares to classical neural-level hypotheses of motor planning such as the Dynamic Field Theory (Erlhagen and Sch��ner, 2002), with the advantage of stepping on an established Predictive Coding framework, dynamic approximate probabilistic inference, and end-to-end sensorimotor control. The Dynamic Field Theory estimates the parameters of the desired movement���such as movement direction and target velocity���from sensory and task features encoding environmental descriptors, which closely compares to motor goal coding through flexible intentions in our model. The two theories have in common a dynamic activation of the internal representations in continuous time, governed by a dynamic system, but they differ in the nature of the signals and their coding. Movement descriptors in Dynamic Field Theory are represented by a dynamically activated multidimensional space, each encoded on a population of competing neurons, while Active Inference approximates movement properties with their central moments (belief) and dispersion (precisions). While population coding allows a complete description of a probabilistic distribution, it could be overshot when used to code single magnitudes (although it is essential when encoding discrete categories). Yet, such representation allows coding multiple competing targets on the same population of neurons, while in our scheme each target should be encoded by a dedicated unit. Notably, the brain encodes scalar variables using a variety of number coding schemes, including monotonic and distributed (Stoianov and Zorzi, 2012). The latter, known as a ���mental number line��� (Stoianov et al., 2008), could be an interesting hypothesis to explore also in the context of feature coding in continuous Active Inference. Currently, distributed coding is used only in discrete Active Inference and other probabilistic models to investigate computationally high-level cognitive functions such as planning, navigation, and control (Stoianov et al., 2016, 2022; Pezzulo et al., 2018). The two theories also differ in the nature of the input to their dynamic systems. In Active Inference, system input encodes generalized prediction errors, which are integrated into higher-level moments. Instead, input in Dynamic Field Theory directly encodes state values. Coding based on prediction errors has the advantage of minimizing the quantity of transmitted information���hence, energy. Finally, the theories also differ in scope: Active Inference provides a full account of the entire sensorimotor control process, while Dynamic Field Theory describes only movement planning.

6.1. Precision balance and conditions for disorders
Based on our computational analysis, it becomes clear that some motor and behavioral disorders could be due to the lack of proper sensory and intention precisions (Adams et al., 2021). Here, we illustrate the normal condition and two types of potentially improper precision balance that could become a causal condition for neurological disorders. Figure 15A illustrates the condition for normal functioning, which is such that the contribution of a single intention to the belief update (which, as a reminder to the reader, is proportional to the gain of intentions ��) is sufficiently small with respect to the sensory contribution. In this case, during free energy minimization, the system dynamics smoothly moves the belief toward the strongest goal, along with precise tracking of the true latent state and sensory signal of the limbs, allowing thus to compute correct motor control errors and perform smooth action execution. A critical abnormal condition arises when the intention gain �� is too strong, as illustrated in Figure 15B. In this case, the belief moves too rapidly toward the goal without being able to match the proprioceptive observations, which results in computing incorrect motor control signals. Another abnormal condition is caused by too close precisions ��k of competitive intentions, which is likely to result in opposing belief updates and thus prevent the fulfillment of any of the competing goals (as in Figure 15C). This situation might manifest in terms of motor onset failure or oscillatory behavior.

6.2. Neural-level predictions
One peculiarity of Active Inference based theories of motor control is that proprioceptive predictions are sent through efferents down to the spinal cord and that specific muscle control signals are computed at that level by reflex arcs, so that action attempts to suppress proprioceptive prediction errors (Adams et al., 2013). This prediction critically differs from competing modern theories such as the Optimal Control (Todorov and Jordan, 2002), according to which the efferents convey muscle control signals computed at the cortical level. A general aspect of Active Inference regards the dynamic inferential process, which predicts with increasing precision the internal representation of the sensorium���including estimation of targets and body posture���starting from noisy priors that gradually converge to ideal states. This kind of precision trend should be observed in an experiment with multiple repetitions of the same action and target, with variability of cell activity encoding the target and body that gradually decreases in time within trials. While this prediction is generally shared with Predictive Coding based theories, classical stimulus-response theories would predict invariant variability of cell activity across time. Another general aspect regards coding of prediction errors. In fact, body-environment transitions involving a change of states and tasks result in transient bursts of activity in error-conveying cells until the error is minimized. Prediction errors conveying upstream information are supposed to be encoded by pyramidal cortical cells in superficial layers while downstream predictions are encoded by deep pyramidal neurons (Parr et al., 2022).

In light of the considerations so far, we predict several different types of correlates that should be found in the PPC related to coding environment, task, and bodily states. The former two include correlates of potential spatial targets and selected motor goals, which indeed have been consistently found in the PPC (Andersen, 1995; Snyder et al., 1997; Filippini et al., 2018). The latter includes correlates of intention-biased bodily state estimates, which thus are not precise representations of the true states. To this concern, a key expected neural correlate of the proposed mechanism in the PPC includes signals encoding intention prediction errors between the current belief and future states corresponding to targets to interact with, both encoded in a visuomotor reference frame. To investigate this, one can manipulate high-level priors, e.g., by inducing an abrupt change of the intention, which should then be observed as a fast decaying change of the corresponding prediction error. A related hypothesis is that in tasks comprising several targets���like the classical monkey experiment analyzed here���each goal generates its own intention and prediction error. In normal conditions only one intention is selected at a time, and this behavior should be observed in the relative dynamics between all the intention prediction errors encoded simultaneously. Finally, the use of generalized beliefs in Active Inference predicts that the PPC encodes not only static states but also a detailed estimate of body dynamics, up to a few temporal orders. Indeed, a body of literature report motion-sensitive, or Vision-for-Action activity in the DVS and PPC (Galletti and Fattori, 2018). The validation of all these correlates will be the subject of further studies with real monkey experiments similar to the one described in Figure 3B.

6.3. Limitations and future directions
Our focus here was on intention coding in the PPC, which directly deals with motor plans and motor control. Further elaborations will extend the theory with higher-level aspects of cognitive control, including intention structuring (dealt by PM), phasing (SMA) (Gallego et al., 2022), planning, and goal selection (HC, PFC) (Stoianov et al., 2016, 2018; Pezzulo et al., 2019). Motor control operated here in an inner belief space belonging to the joint angles domain, which is generally suboptimal in the external Cartesian space. Although a kinematic transformation was implicitly performed by the VAE, we assumed that neural activity in the PPC encodes generalized beliefs over targets and body only in a motor-related domain; however, neural data suggest that neurons in the motor cortex encode motor trajectories also in extrinsic coordinates (Cohen and Andersen, 2002; Adams et al., 2013), and a more realistic model should include representations encoding states in both intrinsic and extrinsic reference frames. A functional correlate of the motor cortex should represent future states���which were defined here implicitly in the intention prediction errors and dynamics functions���and transform desired trajectories from Cartesian coordinates to proprioceptive predictions in the intrinsic state-space. This transformation is different from Optimal Control planning since the optimization of a classical inverse model reduces to a more manageable inference problem.

Since our focus was on the theoretical introduction of intentionality in Active Inference, every analysis was only partially characterized by a simple reaching task. However, fundamental properties of the physical model, including geometry, mass, and friction, strongly influence the resulting motion dynamics���hence the entire inferential process. This implementation does not adopt other important neural and biomechanical specificities such as signal delay and joint friction (Wolpert and Flanagan, 2016), and just partially covers the three main domains of sensorimotor learning through a predictive forward control; for example, it does not fully include reactive, stimuli-driven control such as obstacle avoidance, although we showed that it can successfully perform static and dynamic tasks. However, it could be easily extended to accommodate additional sensory modalities���e.g., tactile sensations���with rich generative models such as the VAE implemented here. Further planned computational analyses will use a richer belief space, a more realistic physical arm model, and additional actuators, and expand the complexity of the intention functions to investigate the capacity of the theory to explain in-depth neural levels, cognitive, and kinematic phenomena related to motor learning, motion perception, motor planning, and so on. Planned future studies with a more articulated agent will also challenge the theory at the behavioral and neural level against other empirical findings regarding movement preparation and motor control, in either delayed or direct response settings. For example, we will test the model for stimulus-stimulus congruency and stimulus-response compatibility effects (Kornblum et al., 1990). As for the former, it is intuitive that a greater sensory dimension overlap predicts faster target-belief convergence���thus faster intention setting. Less intuitive is that stimulus-response compatibility effects should emerge due to differences in the dynamic transition from one belief state to another in the proprioceptive domain. For example, a belief over the effector state should change more, requiring more time to converge when reaching a contralateral position than an ipsilateral one.

Although we considered an Active Inference model with just a single layer of intentions, the structure represented in Figure 2 could be scaled hierarchically and intermediate goals could be considered between high-level intentions and low-level sensory generative models, e.g., by combining discrete and continuous Active Inference for planning and movement execution (Friston et al., 2017a,b; Parr et al., 2020; Sajid et al., 2021). According to the free energy principle, the agent will then choose goals and subgoals and rely on specific sensory modalities such that free energy is minimized at every hierarchical level based on prediction errors coming from the level below. This formalization will provide an explicit basis for motor planning, including tasks like object manipulation. Indeed, although the current implementation performs well on spatial tasks like reaching in a dynamically changing environment, it cannot implement composite goals which the brain needs to handle. On the other hand, an agent that can encode higher-level goals in a discrete domain and infer policies based on the expected free energy will be able to dynamically modify its behavior and react to environmental changes. An extended implementation of this kind���showing the interplay between discrete goals and continuous intentions���will be the subject of future work.

What is the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic reference frames?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Intrinsic and extrinsic reference frames refer to different ways of describing the position or movement of an object in space, and they are often used in the context of neuroscience, robotics, and physics.
Intrinsic Reference Frame
: This is a coordinate system that is based on the object itself. For instance, in motor control, an intrinsic reference frame would describe the angles of joints, muscle contractions, or other properties inherent to the body. When you say "bend your elbow to a 90-degree angle," you're using an intrinsic frame of reference. The description is based on the object's own axes or internal properties, and it doesn't require any information about the object's position relative to external landmarks.
Extrinsic Reference Frame
: This describes an object's position or movement in relation to an external coordinate system or some external point of reference. For example, GPS coordinates use an extrinsic reference frame; they tell you where you are in relation to the Earth as a whole. In the context of motor control, this could involve describing a hand's position in terms of Cartesian coordinates (X, Y, Z) within a room.
In the context of the article, the authors discuss how neural activity in the PPC (Posterior Parietal Cortex) has been traditionally thought to encode motor intentions primarily in an intrinsic frame of reference (joint angles, muscle contractions, etc.). However, they also mention that more recent data suggest that an extrinsic frame of reference (like Cartesian coordinates) is also encoded by neurons, suggesting that a more comprehensive model of motor control should include both.
In summary, intrinsic frames are object-centered, focusing on properties internal to the object itself, while extrinsic frames are world-centered, focusing on the object's position or movement within some larger context.

Connections with William Powers and Prigogine
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The discussions in the articles you've mentioned relate to theories of motor control, cognition, and active inference. While not directly cited, these theories share some similarities and contrasts with the work of William Powers and Ilya Prigogine.
William Powers
: Powers is best known for his "Perceptual Control Theory," which posits that behavior is the control of perception. In simple terms, the organism acts to bring its perceptions in line with internally set reference values. This is quite akin to active inference and predictive coding theories, where the brain aims to minimize the discrepancy between sensory input and predicted states. Both theories involve internal models, goal-directed behavior, and a focus on minimizing some form of error or difference between the expected and actual states. However, Perceptual Control Theory has its unique details and formulations that set it apart from active inference.
Ilya Prigogine
: Known for his work on dissipative structures and far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics, Prigogine explored how systems can maintain order by increasing entropy in their surroundings. While his work is more commonly associated with physical and chemical systems, the ideas have been extrapolated to social and biological systems, including brain function. The notion that systems work to minimize a certain kind of "free energy" or, more generally, that they self-organize to reduce uncertainty, is a concept that bears similarities to the Free Energy Principle in neuroscience and active inference models. The Free Energy Principle talks about the brain striving to minimize free energy, akin to predictive errors, to maintain homeostasis and adapt to its environment.
Both Powers and Prigogine offer paradigms that seek to explain complex, self-organizing behavior, be it in social systems, physical systems, or biological entities like the human brain. While their theories are not cited directly in the discussions on active inference and predictive coding, their work lays philosophical and theoretical groundwork that is very much in line with the principles discussed.

Dynamic field theory.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Dynamic Field Theory (DFT) is a framework used primarily in cognitive science, computational neuroscience, and robotics to model the continuous time evolution of neural fields. This theory is often used to describe a wide range of cognitive processes, including decision making, working memory, attention, and motor planning. In DFT, a "field" refers to a distribution of activation across a dimension of interest, such as spatial position, color, or any other feature dimension. These fields evolve over time based on input, previous states, and interactions with other fields.
Here's how DFT might relate to some of the other theories and models you've mentioned:
Active Inference and Predictive Coding
: While Dynamic Field Theory and active inference both address cognitive processes and can model similar behaviors, their focus is somewhat different. Active inference is more rooted in a Bayesian approach to cognition, emphasizing how the brain minimizes free energy or prediction errors. DFT, on the other hand, typically focuses more on the dynamics of neural activation patterns without necessarily invoking Bayesian inference. However, both could be part of a larger integrated framework since DFT could be seen as providing the neural basis for the error minimization processes proposed in active inference.
William Powers' Perceptual Control Theory
: DFT and Perceptual Control Theory can both model goal-directed behaviors and could be considered complementary. While Perceptual Control Theory focuses on the hierarchical nature of control systems and how they aim to keep perceptions in line with internal set-points, DFT provides a neural basis for how fields representing such perceptions and intentions could dynamically evolve over time.
Ilya Prigogine's Thermodynamics
: At a more abstract level, the idea of systems seeking to reach a stable state resonates with Prigogine's concepts of far-from-equilibrium systems. The stable patterns of activation that emerge in DFT can be likened to the self-organized structures in Prigogine���s dissipative systems, although the mathematical frameworks are different.
In summary, Dynamic Field Theory provides a set of mathematical tools for modeling the temporal evolution of cognitive processes in a neural substrate. While it may not explicitly aim to minimize free energy or prediction error, it offers complementary insights into how cognitive and neural systems might achieve stability and carry out complex tasks.

Abstract
Active inference is a method for state estimation and control actions that is based on the Free Energy principle, which explains how biological agents infer the state of their environment and act upon it by maintaining a model of that environment and evaluating predictions. This method merges both action and sensory processing and is therefore a promising approach for robotic control. In active inference, the internal representations (or states) in the agent can be described by applying hierarchical dynamical models (HDMs). This offers a way to describe the dynamical development of states, and to structure them hierarchically. Despite the possibilities of this hierarchical approach, there are very few examples of hierarchical active inference being applied to robotics or control problems. This thesis aims to make a step in exploring the possibilities of active inference under a HDM. We describe the implementation of a control algorithm based on the hierarchical formulation of active inference on several continuous control problems, most importantly a 2-D robot arm. The algorithm is first demonstrated with a basic single level cart simulation, analysing the effect of the various parameters and inclusion of higher dynamic orders on the stability. A following simulation of multiple carts demonstrates a simple example of a hierarchical division of goals, and how high level objectives are realized by reaching lower level goals. It also shows how insolvable prediction errors at lower levels are propagated up the hierarchy. Finally, the simulation of a 2-D robot arm shows how these hierarchies can introduce goal-directed behaviour in practical control problems. We made several attempts to design a hierarchical generative model capable of realizing position-reaching behaviour in the robot arm, dictating joint angles from desired positions, with varying levels of success. Several pitfalls were encountered in choosing a suitable model for the control task. Most importantly, it was found that the convergence was faulty when higher levels contained more independent states. This emphasizes the information-reducing role of hierarchies. Lastly, we demonstrate that the hierarchical generative model is capable of adding complexity to the robots behaviour, by expanding the goal-reaching objective with a path-tracing task. In short, hierarchical active inference can be applied effectively to the demonstrated goal-reaching control problems, however this requires a careful consideration of the generative model for the task at hand.

The abstract you've provided outlines a thesis that explores the application of hierarchical active inference to continuous robot control problems. The author aims to leverage the Free Energy principle, which underlies active inference, to create a method for state estimation and control actions in robotic systems. The central concept involves using hierarchical dynamical models (HDMs) to describe the internal representations or states of the agent, allowing for the structuring of these states in a hierarchical manner.
The thesis describes the implementation of a control algorithm based on this hierarchical formulation of active inference, primarily focusing on a 2-D robot arm as the main example. The algorithm's efficacy is demonstrated through various simulations, starting with a basic single-level cart simulation to analyze the impact of different parameters and higher dynamic orders on stability. A more complex simulation involving multiple carts showcases a hierarchical division of goals, highlighting how high-level objectives are achieved by reaching lower-level goals. It also illustrates how prediction errors at lower levels can affect higher-level goals.
The thesis further explores the implementation of a hierarchical generative model for the robot arm, aiming to realize position-reaching behavior. However, challenges are encountered in choosing a suitable model for the control task. Notably, the convergence of the algorithm is found to be problematic when higher levels of the hierarchy contain more independent states, highlighting the role of hierarchies in information reduction.
Despite these challenges, the thesis demonstrates that hierarchical active inference can effectively be applied to goal-reaching control problems in robotics. However, the success of the approach is contingent on carefully considering the generative model chosen for the specific task at hand.
Overall, the thesis contributes to the exploration of applying hierarchical active inference to continuous robot control, highlighting both its potential benefits and challenges in achieving goal-directed behavior through structured hierarchies of states.

Kinematic chain
1 / 1
ChatGPT
A kinematic chain is a term used in robotics and biomechanics to describe a sequence of rigid bodies (links) connected by joints that allow relative motion between the bodies. This chain represents the mechanical structure of a system, where each body can move with respect to its neighboring bodies through the joints. Kinematic chains are commonly used to model and analyze the movement of robotic arms, human limbs, and other mechanical systems.
In the context of robotics, a kinematic chain represents the mechanical structure of a robot arm, which consists of rigid links connected by joints. The way these joints are connected determines the degrees of freedom and the range of motion of the robot arm. By analyzing the kinematic chain, researchers and engineers can determine how different joint angles correspond to the position and orientation of the end-effector (such as the robot's hand) in the workspace.
Kinematic chains are fundamental in robotics because they help describe how a robot's joints move and interact to achieve desired tasks. The study of kinematic chains involves understanding joint types (e.g., revolute, prismatic), joint parameters, joint limits, and the mathematical equations that describe the relationship between joint angles and end-effector position.
In summary, a kinematic chain is a sequential arrangement of rigid bodies connected by joints, commonly used to model the movement and mechanics of robotic arms and other mechanical systems.

The role of central pattern generators
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) are neural networks or circuits that are responsible for generating rhythmic patterns of motor activity, such as walking, swimming, and other repetitive movements. These networks are found in various parts of the nervous system, including the spinal cord, brainstem, and even some higher brain areas. The primary function of CPGs is to produce coordinated motor patterns without requiring continuous input from higher-level brain areas. They play a crucial role in generating and controlling basic rhythmic movements that are essential for survival and locomotion.
Key characteristics and roles of Central Pattern Generators include:
Rhythm Generation:
CPGs are capable of producing rhythmic patterns of motor activity, like the alternating motion of limbs during walking or the undulating motion of a snake's body during slithering.
Autonomous Control:
CPGs can operate relatively independently of higher-level brain control. While sensory input and higher brain areas can influence CPG activity, these networks have inherent properties that allow them to generate rhythmic patterns without constant input.
Modularity:
CPGs can be modular, meaning that they can generate different rhythmic patterns for different motor behaviors. For example, there might be separate CPGs responsible for walking, running, and swimming.
Adaptability:
CPGs can be modulated or adjusted based on sensory feedback and higher-level commands. They can change their activity patterns based on changes in the environment or task requirements.
Conservation of Energy:
By generating rhythmic patterns without requiring continuous input from the brain, CPGs help conserve neural energy. This is particularly useful for repetitive behaviors like locomotion, where constant brain involvement would be inefficient.
Clinical Relevance:
CPGs are of clinical interest because they are related to motor control and recovery in cases of spinal cord injury and neurological disorders. Researchers explore ways to activate or enhance CPGs to facilitate movement in individuals with impaired motor function.
Evolutionary Significance:
CPGs are thought to have evolutionary significance, as they provide a foundation for generating basic rhythmic movements that were important for early animals' survival and locomotion.
In summary, Central Pattern Generators are neural circuits responsible for generating rhythmic motor patterns, and they play a vital role in generating basic rhythmic movements like walking and swimming. While they can operate independently of higher-level brain control, they can also be modulated by sensory input and higher-level commands, allowing for adaptability and coordination of movements.

So it seems that rhythmic oscillatory movements can be mainly controlled by a cpg reflex arc
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct! Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) are neural circuits that play a significant role in generating rhythmic oscillatory movements, often referred to as "rhythmic motor patterns." These patterns can include activities like walking, swimming, flying, and even certain aspects of breathing and chewing. CPGs are responsible for producing these rhythmic patterns of motor activity, and they often operate as part of a reflex arc.
Here's how the process works:
Generation of Rhythmic Patterns:
CPGs are neural networks that are capable of producing rhythmic patterns of motor activity without requiring continuous input from higher brain areas. They are capable of generating repetitive sequences of muscle contractions and relaxations, which are essential for rhythmic movements.
Influence of Sensory Input:
While CPGs can generate rhythmic patterns autonomously, they are also influenced by sensory input. Sensory feedback from the environment or from the body itself can modify the timing and intensity of the generated motor patterns. This sensory input helps adjust the movement to the current conditions and requirements.
Reflex Arc Involvement:
In many cases, CPGs operate as part of a reflex arc. A reflex arc is a neural pathway that mediates a reflex action. When a sensory stimulus is detected, such as the stretching of a muscle or the touch of an object, sensory receptors send signals to the spinal cord. The spinal cord processes these signals and can directly activate motor neurons that are connected to the muscles involved in the reflex response.
Simplicity and Efficiency:
The involvement of CPGs and reflex arcs allows the nervous system to generate rhythmic movements in a simple and efficient manner. For example, walking involves a complex coordination of multiple muscles in the legs, and CPGs help generate the basic alternating pattern of muscle contractions that underlies walking.
Examples of Rhythmic Movements:
Rhythmic oscillatory movements controlled by CPGs can be found in various animals. For instance, the rhythmic wing flapping of birds, the undulating motion of fish swimming, and the leg movements during walking are all examples of movements that involve CPGs.
Overall, CPGs and the reflex arcs they operate within are integral to generating rhythmic oscillatory movements. They allow animals to perform essential repetitive activities with relatively minimal involvement from higher brain centers, conserving neural energy and enabling efficient movement.

Certainly! Let's connect the concepts you've mentioned���Active Inference, Central Pattern Generators (CPGs), Kinematic Chains, and Hierarchical Active Inference for Robot Control���to see how they relate:
Active Inference and Hierarchical Active Inference for Robot Control:
Active Inference is a computational framework for understanding how organisms, including robots, infer the states of their environment and take actions to minimize prediction errors. The Hierarchical Active Inference for Robot Control you mentioned extends this concept to robotics, where robots use hierarchical models to structure their internal representations and control actions based on predictions. This approach allows robots to set and achieve goals through inference and action, similar to how organisms use perception and action to interact with their environment.
Central Pattern Generators (CPGs):
CPGs play a role in generating rhythmic movements, often in the form of oscillatory patterns, such as walking or swimming. In the context of robot control, CPGs can be thought of as lower-level control circuits that generate rhythmic motor patterns. While Active Inference and CPGs operate at different levels of abstraction, they can be integrated within a hierarchical control framework. The higher-level Active Inference can set goals and intentions, while the lower-level CPGs generate the rhythmic patterns needed to achieve those goals.
Kinematic Chains:
Kinematic chains are structural arrangements of rigid bodies connected by joints. In robotics, they represent the mechanical structure of robotic limbs. The kinematic chain's joint angles and positions are essential parameters for controlling robotic movements. Active Inference can provide a framework for encoding and inferring the states of these kinematic chains, allowing robots to plan and execute movements effectively. Hierarchical Active Inference can further structure these movements based on goals and intentions.
Bringing these concepts together, a hierarchical Active Inference-based control system for a robot could involve multiple levels of abstraction:
High-Level Intention Setting:
Active Inference is used to set high-level goals and intentions for the robot, such as reaching a specific position or following a trajectory.
Hierarchical Structure:
The robot's control system is organized hierarchically, with higher levels specifying intentions and lower levels generating motor patterns through mechanisms like CPGs.
Kinematic Chain Control:
The kinematic chain of the robot's limb is controlled to achieve the intended goal. The robot infers its current position and adjusts joint angles through Active Inference to reach the desired state.
Rhythmic Movements:
In scenarios where rhythmic movements are needed, CPGs can be employed to generate the oscillatory patterns required for tasks like walking or swimming. These CPG-generated patterns are guided by higher-level intentions set through Active Inference.
In summary, these concepts can be integrated to create a comprehensive control system for robots that combines intention setting, hierarchical structure, kinematic chain control, and even the generation of rhythmic movements through mechanisms like CPGs. This allows robots to perform complex tasks by inferring and executing actions based on their internal models and sensory input.

Information flows between levels, guiding the robot's actions and adjusting motor patterns.
Feedback loops between different levels ensure coherence between intention, motor execution, and sensory input.
Motor Execution and Sensory Feedback:
Motor patterns generated based on intentions, kinematic chain states, and CPGs drive the robot's movements.
Sensory feedback from the environment and the robot's sensors provides information for inference and refinement.
Adaptive Learning and Control:
The control system can adapt and learn from experience, updating models and strategies based on prediction errors and sensory input.
Adaptive learning ensures that the robot improves its control over time.
Task Performance:
The robot performs complex tasks by integrating intention setting, hierarchical organization, kinematic chain control, and rhythmic movements through CPGs.
By integrating these concepts into a unified framework, the robot's control system becomes more versatile, capable of handling various tasks, from reaching specific positions to executing rhythmic movements. The hierarchical structure allows the robot to set goals at different levels of abstraction, generate appropriate motor patterns, and adjust its behavior based on sensory feedback and predictions. This framework lays the foundation for creating more advanced and adaptable robotic control systems that mimic the principles observed in biological organisms.

Abstract
Working together on complex collaborative tasks requires agents to coordinate their actions. Doing this explicitly or completely prior to the actual interaction is not always possible nor sufficient. Agents also need to continuously understand the current actions of others and quickly adapt their own behavior appropriately. Here we investigate how efficient, automatic coordination processes at the level of mental states (intentions, goals), which we call belief resonance, can lead to collaborative situated problem-solving. We present a model of hierarchical active inference for collaborative agents (HAICA). It combines efficient Bayesian Theory of Mind processes with a perception���action system based on predictive processing and active inference. Belief resonance is realized by letting the inferred mental states of one agent influence another agent���s predictive beliefs about its own goals and intentions. This way, the inferred mental states influence the agent���s own task behavior without explicit collaborative reasoning. We implement and evaluate this model in the Overcooked domain, in which two agents with varying degrees of belief resonance team up to fulfill meal orders. Our results demonstrate that agents based on HAICA achieve a team performance comparable to recent state-of-the-art approaches, while incurring much lower computational costs. We also show that belief resonance is especially beneficial in settings where the agents have asymmetric knowledge about the environment. The results indicate that belief resonance and active inference allow for quick and efficient agent coordination and thus can serve as a building block for collaborative cognitive agents.

Hierarchical models are used to structure internal representations and predictions in a layered manner.
Hierarchical Active Inference for Robot Control:
Hierarchical Active Inference was applied to robot control, enabling agents to perform complex tasks by structuring goals and intentions hierarchically.
The framework combines Bayesian Theory of Mind processes with predictive processing and active inference for efficient control.
Kinematic Chains and Central Pattern Generators (CPGs):
Kinematic chains represent the connections between body parts and how they move in coordinated ways.
Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) are neural circuits responsible for generating rhythmic movements, like walking.
Resonating Minds - Collaborative Problem Solving:
Resonating Minds introduces belief resonance, where agents' inferred mental states influence each other's predictive beliefs about goals and intentions.
The model is used to achieve collaborative problem-solving in scenarios where agents have asymmetric knowledge.
Sleep-Wake Cycle and Sleep Paralysis Hypothesis:
A hypothesis suggests that sleep paralysis arises from desynchronization of opponent muscle groups' oscillations.
Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) play a role in signaling smooth movement, leading to false perceptions during sleep paralysis.
Heterarchical Adaptive Control through Kinematic Chains (HACK):
The "HACK" framework integrates hierarchical and non-hierarchical reasoning for control, using kinematic chains to represent movement coordination.
The model can be applied to study complex phenomena like the sleep-wake cycle and sleep paralysis.
Interdisciplinary Approach and Future Directions:
Collaborate with experts in relevant fields to refine and validate hypotheses and models.
Investigate emergent behaviors, test scenarios, and gather empirical data to support the framework's applicability.
In summary, the topics discussed encompass a wide range of concepts, from cognitive robotics and hierarchical active inference to kinematic chains, central pattern generators, collaborative problem-solving, and their potential applications in understanding the sleep-wake cycle and sleep paralysis. The integration of these topics within frameworks like "HACK" offers a promising approach to exploring complex phenomena and advancing our understanding of cognitive processes and motor control.
