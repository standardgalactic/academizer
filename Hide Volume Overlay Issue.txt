I am trying to hide the volume overlay in windows 10. i used an application called HidevolumeOSD which worked, but chrome still brings up the play interface in netflix whenever the volume buttons are pressed.

To address the issue where Chrome still displays the play interface in Netflix when you adjust the volume, even though you've used HideVolumeOSD to hide the volume overlay in Windows 10, you might need to follow a different approach. HideVolumeOSD is effective for the Windows volume overlay, but the behavior you're experiencing in Chrome is likely controlled by the browser or the Netflix web app itself.
Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:
Update Chrome and Netflix App
: Ensure that both Google Chrome and the Netflix app (if you're using it) are updated to their latest versions. Sometimes, these issues are resolved in newer updates.
Check Chrome Extensions
: If you have any Chrome extensions installed, they might be causing this behavior. Try disabling extensions one by one to see if the issue persists. This can help identify if an extension is the culprit.
Use a Different Browser
: Try using a different web browser to access Netflix and see if the issue persists. This can help determine if the problem is specific to Chrome.
Look for Specific Chrome Settings
: Dive into Chrome's advanced settings to see if there's an option that controls media playback or OSD (On-Screen Display) behavior. While Chrome doesn't have direct settings for this, some hidden flags might influence how media controls are displayed.
Keyboard Settings
: Check your keyboard settings in Windows. Some keyboards have software that allows customization of media keys and their behavior.
Check for Third-Party Software Conflicts
: If you have other third-party software that manages media or keyboard settings, they might conflict with how Chrome handles volume changes. Try temporarily disabling other software to test this.
Feedback to Developers
: If none of the above solutions work, consider providing feedback to both the Chrome and Netflix development teams. It might be a known issue they are working on or something new that they need to be aware of.
Remember, some behaviors are hard-coded into applications and web services, and might not be customizable. In such cases, finding a workaround, like using a different browser for Netflix, might be the only solution.

the play controls pop up when you move the mouse onto the window or press the volume, this is annoying
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The behavior you're describing, where play controls pop up in Netflix on Chrome when you move the mouse or press the volume buttons, is indeed a part of the standard user interface design for many streaming platforms, including Netflix. This is intended to provide quick access to playback controls, but it can be intrusive if you're simply adjusting the volume or moving the mouse.
Unfortunately, there's no straightforward, built-in way to disable this feature in Netflix or Chrome, as it's an integrated part of how the web app operates. However, I can suggest a few workarounds that might help reduce the annoyance:
Use Keyboard Shortcuts
: Instead of using the mouse to adjust the volume, you could use keyboard shortcuts if your keyboard has dedicated media keys. This might prevent the controls from appearing as it does when using the mouse.
Adjust Volume Elsewhere
: You could adjust the system volume from your taskbar or another application, instead of using the volume keys while Netflix is in focus. This way, the Netflix window wouldn't register the volume change as an interaction.
Use Full-Screen Mode Wisely
: If you're watching in full-screen mode, the controls typically hide themselves automatically after a few seconds of inactivity. Moving the mouse to a corner of the screen where it's less intrusive before going hands-off might help.
Extensions or Scripts
: There might be browser extensions or user scripts for browsers like Chrome that can alter how media playback controls are displayed. However, use caution with these, as they can affect browser performance and security.
Feedback to Netflix
: Consider providing feedback to Netflix. If enough users find a feature annoying, companies sometimes provide a way to customize or disable such features in future updates.
Remember, any changes or customizations done through third-party extensions or scripts are at your own risk and might break functionality or violate terms of service. As of now, the behavior you're experiencing is a standard part of the Netflix viewing experience in a browser.
You
Ok I just think it is ridiculous that the people at netflix have no idea how a remote control is supposed to work.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It's understandable that you find the behavior of Netflix's playback controls in the web browser to be frustrating, especially when it doesn't align with your expectations or preferences for how a remote control experience should work. Streaming services often design their interfaces to cater to a broad range of users and use cases, and sometimes this leads to design choices that might not suit everyone's needs or expectations.
Here are a few additional thoughts and possible actions:
Diverse User Preferences
: Netflix and other streaming platforms often design their interfaces based on a wide range of user feedback and usability studies. What might be intuitive or convenient for some users could be a point of annoyance for others.
Providing Feedback
: One of the most direct ways to influence change is by providing feedback to Netflix. They likely track user feedback for future updates, and if enough users share your sentiment, it could lead to changes in future versions of the app or website.
Community Discussion
: Sometimes, discussing these issues in community forums or social media platforms where Netflix might have a presence can help. Companies often pay attention to public sentiment expressed in these spaces.
Exploring Alternatives
: While not ideal, exploring other streaming services might lead you to one with a user interface more suited to your preferences. Each service tends to have slightly different UI/UX designs.
Custom Solutions
: While more technical and not supported by Netflix, tech-savvy users sometimes create their own solutions, like browser extensions or scripts, to modify the behavior of web applications. This is a more involved route and comes with its own set of risks and challenges.
It's important to remember that user interface design is a complex field with many competing considerations, and what might seem like a clear oversight from one perspective could be a deliberate design choice from another. However, user feedback is a crucial part of how these services evolve, so sharing your views with Netflix could contribute to future improvements.
You
I think they are trying to penalize the user for adjusting the volume
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It's highly unlikely that Netflix or any other major streaming service would intentionally design their user interface to penalize users for adjusting the volume. Such a design choice would not be beneficial for the user experience or the service's reputation. However, the issue you're facing might be an unintended consequence of a design choice aimed at enhancing user interaction in a different way.
Here are a few potential reasons behind the design choice:
Ease of Access
: The design might be intended to ensure that playback controls are easily accessible whenever there is user interaction with the video player. This is especially useful for users who frequently pause, rewind, or fast forward.
Responsiveness to Interaction
: Showing controls on interaction (like volume adjustment or mouse movement) might be part of making the player responsive. The idea is to provide immediate control access as soon as the user shows an intent to interact.
Consistency Across Devices
: Many streaming services aim for a consistent user experience across various devices and platforms (smart TVs, mobile devices, web browsers). This sometimes leads to design choices that work well on some platforms but are less ideal on others.
Technical Limitations or Overlooked Use Cases
: Sometimes, certain behaviors in an application are not the result of a deliberate design choice, but rather a limitation of the technology used or an overlooked user scenario.
While it can be frustrating, it's important to recognize that interface design often involves balancing a wide range of user needs and preferences. If you feel strongly about this issue, providing constructive feedback directly to Netflix is a good way to make your voice heard. Companies do take user feedback into account when planning updates and changes to their platforms.

How can I toggle this command with !h (alt +h)? ;; disable mouse ;;


BlockInput MouseMove
TrayTip, Mouse disabled, Press [ESC] to enable mouse movement

~Esc::
BlockInput MouseMoveOff
Exitapp
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
To create a script that toggles the mouse movement on and off using the
Alt + H
keyboard combination (
!h
in AutoHotkey syntax) and shows a tray tip when disabled, you can use AutoHotkey, a scripting language for automating the Windows GUI. Here's how you can modify your script:
autohotkey
Copy code
; This script toggles mouse movement on and off using Alt + H
; Shows a tray tip when mouse movement is disabled
; Press ESC to enable mouse movement and exit the script

#Persistent  ; Keeps the script running

; Toggle variable
toggle := 0

; Alt+H hotkey
!h:: 
    toggle := !toggle  ; Switches the value of toggle between 0 and 1
    if (toggle = 1) {
        BlockInput MouseMove  ; Disable mouse movement
        TrayTip, Mouse disabled, Press [ESC] to enable mouse movement
    } else {
        BlockInput MouseMoveOff  ; Enable mouse movement
    }
return

; ESC hotkey
~Esc:: 
    BlockInput MouseMoveOff  ; Enable mouse movement
    ExitApp  ; Exit the script
return
This script works as follows:
When you press
Alt + H
(
!h
), it toggles the state of the mouse movement. If the mouse movement is currently enabled, it will disable it, and vice versa.
When the mouse movement is disabled, a tray tip will appear, informing you that the mouse is disabled and can be re-enabled by pressing
ESC
.
Pressing
ESC
will re-enable the mouse movement and exit the application.
Remember to run this script with AutoHotkey installed on your Windows machine. Also, be cautious when disabling input devices like your mouse, as it may affect your ability to interact with your system normally.
You
I think you can just toggle off with escape as well
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly, you can modify the script to toggle the mouse movement on and off using
Alt + H
and use the
Escape
key to both enable the mouse movement and exit the script. Here's the revised AutoHotkey script:
autohotkey
Copy code
; This script toggles mouse movement on and off using Alt + H
; Shows a tray tip when mouse movement is disabled
; Press ESC to toggle mouse movement on and off

#Persistent  ; Keeps the script running

; Toggle variable
toggle := 0

; Alt+H hotkey
!h:: 
    toggle := !toggle  ; Switches the value of toggle between 0 and 1
    if (toggle = 1) {
        BlockInput MouseMove  ; Disable mouse movement
        TrayTip, Mouse disabled, Press [ESC] to toggle mouse movement
    } else {
        BlockInput MouseMoveOff  ; Enable mouse movement
    }
return

; ESC hotkey
~Esc:: 
    if (toggle = 1) {
        BlockInput MouseMoveOff  ; Enable mouse movement
        toggle := 0
    } else {
        BlockInput MouseMove  ; Disable mouse movement
        TrayTip, Mouse disabled, Press [ESC] to toggle mouse movement
        toggle := 1
    }
return
In this version:
Pressing
Alt + H
toggles the mouse movement on or off.
When the mouse movement is disabled, a tray tip will appear, informing you that the mouse is disabled and can be toggled by pressing
ESC
.
Pressing
ESC
will toggle the mouse movement on or off, depending on its current state.
This script gives you the flexibility to control the mouse movement using both the
Alt + H
and
Escape
keys, which can be more convenient depending on your workflow. As before, ensure AutoHotkey is installed on your system to use this script, and use it responsibly to avoid losing control of your mouse unintentionally.
You
the escape isn't working, it should just toggle off, not on, and just while mouse blocking is enabled
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
I understand now. You want the
Escape
key to only disable the mouse movement if it's currently blocked, and not to toggle it on. Here's the corrected AutoHotkey script:
autohotkey
Copy code
; This script toggles mouse movement on and off using Alt + H
; Shows a tray tip when mouse movement is disabled
; Press ESC to disable mouse movement if it's currently enabled

#Persistent  ; Keeps the script running

; Toggle variable
toggle := 0

; Alt+H hotkey
!h:: 
    toggle := !toggle  ; Switches the value of toggle between 0 and 1
    if (toggle = 1) {
        BlockInput MouseMove  ; Disable mouse movement
        TrayTip, Mouse disabled, Press [ESC] to enable mouse movement
    } else {
        BlockInput MouseMoveOff  ; Enable mouse movement
    }
return

; ESC hotkey
~Esc:: 
    if (toggle = 1) {
        BlockInput MouseMoveOff  ; Enable mouse movement
        toggle := 0
        TrayTip, Mouse enabled
    }
return
In this revised script:
Pressing
Alt + H
toggles the mouse movement on or off.
When mouse movement is disabled, a tray tip appears informing you that the mouse is disabled and can be enabled by pressing
ESC
.
Pressing
ESC
will only enable the mouse movement if it's currently disabled (i.e., if
toggle = 1
). The
Escape
key won't disable the mouse movement.
This should work as you described, with the
Escape
key only functioning to enable the mouse movement when it is disabled. Be sure to test this in a controlled environment to avoid any unintended loss of control over your mouse.
You
Ok it seems to work now. Still no ideas from how to keep the play controls from popping up when volume is pressed, it must be removing focus and returning it.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
I'm glad to hear the AutoHotkey script is working for you now.
Regarding the issue with the Netflix play controls popping up when the volume is pressed, it's a tricky situation because this behavior is typically controlled by the web application (Netflix in this case) and the browser, and there isn't a direct and simple way to modify it from the user's end. Here are a few additional thoughts and potential workarounds:
Background Volume Control
: If possible, try adjusting the volume without having the Netflix tab as the active window. For instance, you can use media keys on your keyboard (if available), or adjust the volume from your system tray or another application. This might prevent Netflix from registering the interaction and popping up the controls.
Use of Extensions
: Some browser extensions can modify how web pages behave. You might find an extension that can alter the way media controls are displayed or interacted with in browsers. However, be cautious with extensions as they can affect your browser's performance and security.
Different Playback Method
: If this issue is too disruptive, consider using the Netflix app for Windows instead of accessing it through a web browser. The app might have different interaction behaviors compared to the web version.
Custom Browser Scripts
: For advanced users, custom scripts (like Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey scripts) can be written to modify how web pages behave. This would require programming knowledge and a good understanding of how web pages work.
Feedback to Service Providers
: It's always a good idea to provide feedback to the service providers (in this case, Netflix and the browser developer) about your experience. If enough users report a similar inconvenience, they might consider changing how the interface behaves in future updates.
Each of these options has its own set of limitations and potential issues, and some may not be feasible depending on your situation. Unfortunately, there's no guaranteed solution to prevent the Netflix controls from appearing when the volume is adjusted, as it's part of the intended functionality of the Netflix web player.
You
Ok that works. I can select another window on the other screen. I can adjust the volume without interupting the movie now.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
That's great to hear! Selecting another window on a different screen to adjust the volume without interrupting the movie is a smart workaround. It's always satisfying to find a solution that fits your specific needs, especially when dealing with features of applications or services that aren't directly customizable.
If you have any more questions, need further assistance with other tech-related issues, or have any other inquiries, feel free to ask. Enjoy your uninterrupted movie watching!
