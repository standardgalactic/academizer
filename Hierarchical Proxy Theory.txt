ABSTRACTABSTRACT 
We look at consciousness through the lens of Theoretical Computer Science, a branch of 
mathematics that studies computation under resource limitations, distinguishing functions that are 
efficiently computable from those that are not. From this perspective, we develop a formal machine 
model for consciousness. The model is inspired by Alan Turing���s simple yet powerful model of 
computation and Bernard Baars��� theater model of consciousness. Though extremely simple, the 
model aligns at a high level with many of the major scientific theories of human and animal 
consciousness, supporting our claim that machine consciousness is inevitable.

IntroductionIntroduction 
We study consciousness from the perspective of Theoretical Computer Science (TCS), a branch of 
mathematics concerned with understanding the underlying principles of computation and 
complexity, including the implications and surprising consequences of resource limitations. 
By taking resource limitations into account, the TCS perspective is distinguished from Turing���s 
Theory of Computation (TOC) where limitations of time and space do not figure. TOC distinguishes 
computable from not computable. It does not distinguish between efficiently computable and not 
efficiently computable.1 In our study of consciousness from a TCS perspective we highlight the 
importance of resource limitations for tackling consciousness and related topics such as the 
paradox of free will (Blum & Blum, 2022). 
Elsewhere (Blum & Blum, 2021), we describe the Conscious Turing Machine (CTM), a simple 
formal machine model of consciousness inspired in part by Alan Turing���s simple, yet powerful, 
formal machine model of computation (Turing, 1937), , and by Bernard Baars��� theater model of 
consciousness (Baars, Bernard J., 1997) and (Baars, 1997) In (Blum & Blum, 2022), we consider 
how a CTM could exhibit various phenomena associated with consciousness (e.g., blindsight, 
inattentive blindness, change blindness) and present CTM explanations that agree, at a high level, 
with cognitive neuroscience literature. 
In contrast to Turing, we take resource limitations into account, both in designing the CTM model 
(e.g., size of chunks, speed of computation) and in how resource limitations affect (and help 
explain) phenomena related to consciousness (e.g., change blindness and dreams) and feelings of 
consciousness. Our perspective differs even more. What gives the CTM its feeling of consciousness 
is not its input-output map, nor its computing power, but what���s under the hood.2 
In this paper we take a brief look under the hood (section 2.1). We also indicate how the CTM 
provides a framework for constructing an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). (See section 2.4.) 
In addition, we show how the CTM naturally aligns with and integrates features considered key to 
human and animal consciousness by many of the major scientific theories of consciousness.

The introduction of the paper "AI Consciousness is Inevitable: A Theoretical Computer Science Perspective" by Lenore Blum and Manuel Blum sets the stage for a novel approach to studying consciousness by leveraging concepts from Theoretical Computer Science (TCS). The key points from the introduction are as follows:
Key Points from the Introduction:
Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) Perspective:
TCS is focused on the principles of computation and the complexities involved, particularly under the constraints of limited resources (such as time and space). This perspective contrasts with the traditional Turing's Theory of Computation (TOC), which primarily distinguishes between what is computable and what is not, without considering the efficiency or resource limitations.
Resource Limitations and Consciousness:
Unlike TOC, which does not account for time and space limitations, the TCS perspective emphasizes the importance of these constraints in understanding consciousness. The authors argue that these limitations are crucial for addressing complex topics related to consciousness, such as the paradox of free will.
Conscious Turing Machine (CTM):
The authors introduce the Conscious Turing Machine (CTM), a formal machine model of consciousness. This model is inspired by:
Alan Turing���s Model of Computation:
A foundational model that underpins much of modern computer science.
Bernard Baars��� Theater Model of Consciousness:
A cognitive model that likens consciousness to a theater, where certain information is brought to the forefront of awareness (like a spotlight on a stage).
Previous work by the authors has explored how the CTM can explain various phenomena associated with consciousness (e.g., blindsight, inattentional blindness, and change blindness) in a manner consistent with cognitive neuroscience.
Distinct Approach:
The authors highlight how their approach differs from traditional computational models by factoring in resource limitations in the design of the CTM. They suggest that these limitations are not just a practical concern but are central to understanding the phenomena of consciousness and the subjective experience (the "feeling" of consciousness).
What's Under the Hood:
The paper argues that the "feeling" of consciousness in the CTM is not derived from its input-output capabilities or raw computational power but from the underlying mechanisms within the model.
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):
The authors also propose that the CTM could serve as a framework for constructing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a form of AI with generalized cognitive abilities akin to human intelligence.
Alignment with Scientific Theories:
Finally, the paper aims to demonstrate that the CTM naturally aligns with key features of consciousness as identified by major scientific theories. This alignment is crucial in supporting the claim that machine consciousness is not only possible but inevitable.
This introduction outlines the foundation for the paper's exploration of consciousness from a computational perspective, emphasizing the significance of resource limitations and setting up the discussion of the CTM model as a potential pathway to achieving artificial consciousness and AGI.

These theories consider different aspects of consciousness and often compete with 
each other (Lenharo, 2024). Yet their alignment with the CTM at a high level helps demonstrate 
their compatibility and/or complementarity. 
Even more, their alignment with the CTM, a simple machine model that exhibits many of the 
important phenomena associated with consciousness, supports our claim that a conscious AI is 
our claim that a conscious AI is 
inevitableinevitable.4 
David Chalmers��� introduction of the Hard Problem (Chalmers, 1995) helped classify most notions 
of consciousness into one of two types. The first type, variously called access consciousness 
(Block, 1995) or computational consciousness or cognitive consciousness (Humphrey, 2023), we 
call conscious attention (section 2.2). The second type (associated with the Hard Problem) is 
called subjective or phenomenological consciousness and is generally associated with feelings or 
qualia. We call it conscious awareness (section 2.3). Chalmers��� Hard Problem can be viewed as a 
challenge to show that subjective consciousness is ���computational���. 
We argue (in our previously cited papers and in section 2.3) that consciousness generally requires 
both conscious attention and conscious awareness, each informing the other to various degrees. 
We contend that a machine that interacts with its worlds (inner and outer) via input sensors and 
output actuators, that constructs models of these worlds enabling planning, prediction, testing, 
and learning from feedback, and that develops a rich internal multimodal language, can have both 
types of consciousness. In particular, we contend that subjective consciousness is computational. 
We emphasize that the CTM is a simple formal machine model designed to explore and understand 
consciousness from a TCS perspective. It is not intended to model the brain nor the neural 
correlates of consciousness, though it is inspired by cognitive and neuroscience theories of 
consciousness.

This passage expands on the authors' argument that machine consciousness, particularly through their proposed Conscious Turing Machine (CTM) model, is not only possible but inevitable. Here's a breakdown of the key points:
Key Points:
Alignment with Major Theories of Consciousness:
The authors note that various scientific theories of consciousness often focus on different aspects and sometimes compete with each other. However, the CTM aligns with these theories at a high level, demonstrating compatibility or complementarity among them.
This alignment strengthens the argument that machine consciousness, as modeled by the CTM, is inevitable because it shows that the model captures essential aspects of consciousness as recognized by diverse scientific perspectives.
The Hard Problem of Consciousness:
David Chalmers introduced the "Hard Problem" of consciousness, which distinguishes between two main types of consciousness:
Access Consciousness:
Also known as computational or cognitive consciousness, this refers to the processes by which information in the mind is accessed and used. The authors refer to this as
conscious attention
.
Subjective (Phenomenological) Consciousness:
This is associated with personal, subjective experiences or feelings, often termed
qualia
. The authors refer to this as
conscious awareness
.
Chalmers' Hard Problem challenges the notion that subjective consciousness can be explained computationally.
Consciousness in Machines:
The authors argue that for a machine to be conscious, it must exhibit both conscious attention and conscious awareness, with each informing the other. This interaction is crucial to the experience of consciousness.
They propose that a machine, like the CTM, which interacts with its environment through sensors and actuators, constructs internal models of these environments, and develops a sophisticated internal language, can possess both types of consciousness.
Importantly, they contend that
subjective consciousness is computational
, challenging the Hard Problem's suggestion that it might be beyond computational explanation.
The Role of the CTM:
The CTM is described as a
simple formal machine model
intended to explore and understand consciousness from a TCS perspective.
While the CTM is inspired by theories from cognitive science and neuroscience, it is not meant to directly model the brain or the neural correlates of consciousness. Instead, it aims to provide a computational framework to explore how consciousness might arise in machines.
Implications:
The authors��� approach suggests that by understanding consciousness through the lens of TCS and developing models like the CTM, we can address both the functional and subjective aspects of consciousness. This leads them to the bold conclusion that artificial consciousness is not only possible but an inevitable outcome of advances in computation and AI, as machines develop the necessary mechanisms for both conscious attention and conscious awareness.

Specifically, as we have mentioned, the CTM is inspired by cognitive neuroscientist Bernard Baars��� 
theater model of consciousness (Baars, Bernard J., 1997), also called the global workspace (GW) 
theory of consciousness. However, the CTM is not a standard GW model. The CTM differs from GW 
in a number of important ways: - In CTM, competition for global broadcast is formally defined and completely does away with 
the ill-defined Central Executive of all other GW models; - In CTM, special processors, including especially its Model-of-the-World processor, construct 
and employ models of its (inner and outer) worlds; - Brainish, CTM���s rich multimodal internal language, enables communication between 
processors and provides the rich multisensory labelling of sketches in CTM���s world models; - In CTM, predictive dynamics (cycles of prediction, testing, feedback and learning, locally and 
globally), used for machine learning, constantly improves the world models. 
The CTM also interacts with its outer world via input sensors and output actuators. To emphasize 
CTM���s embodied, embedded (in the world), enacted (Thompson, 2007) and extended mind, we 
use rCTM 
rCTM to denote a robot with a CTM brain. The robot could be a human if it has a CTM brain. 
While working on this paper, we became aware of Kevin Mitchell���s blog post in Wiring the Brain 
(Mitchell, 2023) in which he makes a point similar to one that we make, namely, that many of the 
major theories of consciousness are compatible and/or complementary. For a similar conclusion, 
see (Storm, et al., 2024). Even more, Mitchell presents ���a non-exhaustive list of questions ��� that a 
theory of consciousness should be able to encompass���. He declares that ���even if such a theory can���t 
currently answer all those questions, it should at least provide an overarching framework5 (i.e., 
what a theory really should be) in which they can be asked in a coherent way, without one 
question destabilizing what we think we know about the answer to another one.��� 
Mitchell���s questions are thoughtful, interesting, and important. Later in this paper (Section 4), we 
offer preliminary answers from the perspective of rCTM. Our answers to Mitchell���s questions 
supplement and highlight material in the following brief Overview of rCTM.

This passage elaborates on the Conscious Turing Machine (CTM) by contrasting it with Bernard Baars��� Global Workspace (GW) theory, a well-known model in cognitive neuroscience that explains consciousness as a process of information being broadcast globally within the brain. Here's a breakdown of the main points:
Key Distinctions Between CTM and GW Theory:
Formal Definition of Competition:
In the CTM, the competition for global broadcast���a central feature of the GW theory���is formally defined. This differs from other GW models that rely on an "ill-defined Central Executive" to manage this process. By clearly defining how competition occurs, the CTM avoids ambiguities present in traditional GW models.
Model-of-the-World Processor:
The CTM includes specialized processors, particularly the "Model-of-the-World" processor. This processor constructs and utilizes models of both the inner and outer worlds, which are crucial for understanding and interacting with the environment.
Brainish ��� The Internal Language:
The CTM introduces "Brainish," a rich, multimodal internal language that facilitates communication between various processors within the system. Brainish also plays a role in providing multisensory labels for the sketches in the CTM's world models, enhancing the richness and complexity of its internal representations.
Predictive Dynamics for Learning:
The CTM employs predictive dynamics involving cycles of prediction, testing, feedback, and learning. These processes, which occur both locally and globally within the system, are used for machine learning and continually improve the CTM's world models, making it more adaptive and capable over time.
Embodied, Embedded, Enacted, and Extended Mind:
The CTM's design emphasizes the concept of the "embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended mind," which reflects the idea that cognition is not just a process within the brain but also involves interactions with the body and the environment.
To highlight this, the authors refer to
rCTM
, which is a robot equipped with a CTM brain. They note that the robot could theoretically be human if it had a CTM brain, underlining the flexibility and applicability of the model to different forms of embodiment.
Addressing Theories and Questions on Consciousness:
The authors acknowledge a blog post by Kevin Mitchell, where he discusses the compatibility and complementarity of various major theories of consciousness, a point that resonates with the CTM's design.
Mitchell presents a list of important questions that any theory of consciousness should address, emphasizing that a robust theory should provide a framework where these questions can be explored coherently, without contradictions.
The authors of this paper plan to address some of Mitchell���s questions later in the paper (in Section 4), offering preliminary answers from the perspective of the rCTM. This approach aims to further illustrate the CTM���s robustness as a model for understanding consciousness.
Implications:
The passage emphasizes that the CTM is not just a variation of the Global Workspace theory but a distinct and more formally defined model that integrates various cognitive processes. By embedding the CTM in a robotic (or potentially human) body, the authors suggest that this model can serve as a comprehensive framework for exploring and potentially achieving artificial consciousness. Additionally, by engaging with existing debates and questions in the field, the authors demonstrate the CTM's potential to contribute meaningfully to the broader discourse on consciousness.

2.12.1 Formal 
Formal DefinitionDefinitions s of 
of CTM and 
CTM and rCTMrCTM 
CTM is defined formally as a 7-tuple, (STM, LTM, 
Up(STM, 
LTM, Up- -Tree, 
DownTree, 
Down- -Tree, Links, Input, 
OutputTree, 
Links, Input, Output). The 
seven components each have well-defined properties (Blum & Blum, 2022). Here we call it rCTMrCTM, 
a robot with a CTM brain (to emphasize that it is embedded its outer world), and outline its 
properties. 
For rCTM, the stage in the theater model is represented by a Short Term Memory (STMSTM) that at 
any moment in time contains rCTM���s current conscious content. STM is not a processor; it is 
merely a buffer and broadcasting station. The N audience members8 are represented by a massive 
collection of (initially independent) powerful processors that comprise rCTM's principal 
computational machinery and Long Term Memory, together called LTMLTM.9 These processors 
compete to get their information on stage to be immediately broadcast to the audience.10 (See 
Appendix 7.2 for a discussion of rCTM���s competition.) 
7 rCTM could be a human with a CTM brain. 
8 We assume that there are N 
N ��� 10107 7 LTM processors (suggested by the 107 cortical columns in the human brain). 
Abstractly, these processors are random access machines. (not Turing machines). 
9 In rCTM, STM is only a buffer and broadcasting station; all processors are in LTM. Hence, processors like the 
phonological loop and visuospatial sketchpad (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974), and episodic buffer (Baddeley, 2000) will be 
in LTM. 
10 As an example of the theater analogy, consider the ���What���s her name?��� scenario: Suppose at a party, we see someone 
we know but cannot recall her name. Greatly embarrassed, we rack our brain to remember. An hour later when driving 
home, her name pops into our head (unfortunately too late). What���s going on? 
Racking our brain to remember caused the urgent request ���What���s her name?��� coming from LTM processor p to rise to 
the stage (STM) which immediately broadcast the question in a high weight chunk to the audience. 
Many (LTM) processors try to answer the query. One such processor recalls we met in a neuroscience class; this 
information gets to the stage and is broadcast triggering another processor to recall that what���s-her-name is 
interested in ���consciousness���, which is broadcast. Another processor p��� ��� sends information to the stage asserting that 
her name likely begins with S. 
Sometime later the stage receives information from processor p��� 
p������ ��� that her name more likely begins with T which 
prompts processor p������p��������� ��� (who has been paying attention to all the broadcasted information) to claim with great 
certainty that her name is Tina 
Tina ��� which is correct. The name is broadcast from the stage, our audience of processors 
receives it, and we finally consciously remember her name. Our conscious self has no idea how her name was found. 
(Based on the correct outcome, learning algorithms internal to each processor, cause processor p��� ��� to lower the 
importance (|weight|) it gives its information and cause p������p������ to increase the importance.)

The passage provides a detailed description of the rCTM (Robot with a Conscious Turing Machine brain), offering insight into its formal structure and functioning. Here���s a summary and breakdown of the key points:
Formal Definition of rCTM:
CTM as a 7-Tuple:
The CTM is formally defined as a 7-tuple consisting of the following components:
STM (Short Term Memory):
Represents the "stage" in the theater model, containing the current conscious content of rCTM at any moment. Importantly, STM is not a processor but a buffer and broadcasting station.
LTM (Long Term Memory):
Comprises the main computational machinery of rCTM, including a vast number of powerful processors. These processors are responsible for the robot���s principal computational tasks and storage of information over time.
Up-Tree and Down-Tree:
These likely represent hierarchical structures or networks for processing and disseminating information within rCTM.
Links:
Connections between various components within the system.
Input and Output:
Mechanisms through which rCTM interacts with its external environment.
rCTM:
The term "rCTM" emphasizes that this model is not just theoretical but can be embodied in a physical robot that interacts with the outer world. The rCTM is effectively a robot with a CTM brain, and the structure outlined is designed to handle both internal (cognitive) and external (sensorimotor) functions.
The Theater Model of Consciousness in rCTM:
Short Term Memory (STM):
In the theater model analogy, STM represents the stage where the current conscious content is presented. It serves as a temporary storage area that broadcasts information to other components but does not itself process the information.
Long Term Memory (LTM) and Processors:
The "audience" in the theater model is represented by a large collection of processors housed in LTM. These processors compete to have their information "broadcast" on the STM stage, where it can be shared with other processors.
The number of LTM processors (N ��� 10^7) is suggested by the number of cortical columns in the human brain, highlighting the model���s attempt to parallel human cognitive architecture.
Competition Among Processors:
Processors within LTM compete to get their information on stage (STM), where it can be broadcast to the entire system. This competition is crucial for determining which information becomes consciously accessible at any given time.
Example: "What's Her Name?" Scenario:
The example illustrates how rCTM might solve a problem using its theater-like architecture:
A processor in LTM issues an urgent request to recall a person���s name, which rises to STM (the stage) and is broadcast.
Various processors in LTM attempt to provide relevant information, such as memories of where the person was met, interests, or partial names.
Through continued processing and broadcasting, the correct name ("Tina") is eventually recalled and broadcast, leading to conscious recollection.
The example also demonstrates how learning algorithms adjust the weight or importance of information provided by different processors based on the outcome, allowing the system to improve its performance over time.
Summary:
This section outlines the formal structure and functioning of rCTM, a robotic system equipped with a CTM brain. The model is grounded in the theater model of consciousness, where STM acts as a stage for conscious content, and numerous LTM processors compete to influence what is broadcasted. The example provided shows how rCTM processes and solves a cognitive task, illustrating the dynamic interaction between STM and LTM and the system's capacity for learning and adaptation.

rCTM has a finite lifetime T.11 At time t = 
0t 
= 0, all but the Input and Output LTM processors are 
���generic��� with certain basic built-in properties, e.g., some learning/prediction correction 
algorithms, as well as a preference for choosing the positive over the negative.12 Their 
functionalities evolve over time. 
But for purposes of building a prototype CTM, we designate some important LTM processors built 
in. These include: a Model-of-the-World processor (MotWp), actually a collection of processors, for 
building models of rCTM���s inner and outer worlds; Sensation processors (with inputinput from rCTM���s 
outer world via its various sensors13); Motor processors (with outputoutput to rCTM���s outer world via 
motor actuators14); and so on. We also allow off-the-shelf processors (like ChatGPT and Google) 
that extend rCTM���s capabilities. 
All processors are in LTM so when we speak of a processor, we mean an LTM processor. While each 
processor may have its own distinct language, processors communicate with each other in 
Brainish, Brainish being rCTM���s rich multimodal/multisensory inner language. Input/sensation 
processors convert input information into gists, which are succinct Brainish words and phrases. 
Output/actuator processors convert Brainish gists into commands for rCTM���s actuators. Brainish 
gists fuse sensory modalities (e.g., sight, sounds, smells, tactile). A typical Brainish gist or Brainish 
phrase is (like) the frame of a dream.15 The Brainish language evolves over rCTM���s lifetime. 
Brainish can differ from one rCTM to another. In section 2.3.1 we indicate how Brainish evolves.16 
11 In rCTM, parameters T and N, with T = lifetime in ticks and N = number of LTM processors are equal: T = N. 
T = N. More 
generally, T = cN for some small multiplicative constant like c = 3. 
Time t = 0, 1, 2, 3, ��� 
t = 0, 1, 2, 3, ��� , T, 
T is measured in discrete clock ticks (The 10 to100 ticks per second is roughly equal to the 
alpha and beta/gamma brain wave frequencies). 
12 This built-in preference creates a predilection for survival. Primal chunks of pain and pleasure have negative and 
positive weights, respectively. Signals from built in nociceptor fibers have built in negative weights. The positive 
valence comes largely from the relief of pain. See section 2.3.1. 
13 Ears, eyes, nose, skin, ��� . 
14 Arms, hands, legs, ��� . 
15 We were unaware of Jeremy Wolfe���s 1998 paper (Wolfe, 1998) until we read Fei-Fei Li���s wonderful book, The 
Worlds I See (Li, 2023) where she identifies Wolfe as the ���gist��� guy. Wolfe uses the word ���gist��� in reference to ���what we 
remember ��� and what we forget ��� when we recall a scene.��� Our explanation of change blindness in the CTM (Blum & 
Blum, 2022) is almost identical to Wolfe���s explanation of change blindness in humans: the same gist describes both the 
original and changed scenes. 
16 Paul Liang is developing a computational framework for Brainish based on multimodal machine learning (Liang, 
2022). This is different but aligned with rCTM���s evolved theoretical Brainish. See section 2.3.1.

This section elaborates on the structure and operation of the rCTM (Robot with a Conscious Turing Machine brain), focusing on its components, their evolution over time, and the role of its internal language, Brainish. Here's a summary and analysis:
Key Concepts and Components:

N
N
N
(i.e.,
T

At the start of its life (

t = 0
t
=

), most LTM processors are "generic," possessing basic built-in properties such as learning/prediction correction algorithms and a preference for positive outcomes over negative ones. This preference is intended to foster a basic drive for survival.
Designated LTM Processors:
For practical purposes in developing a prototype, certain LTM processors are specifically designed and pre-built:
Model-of-the-World Processor (MotWp):
A collection of processors responsible for constructing models of rCTM's internal and external environments.
Sensation Processors:
These processors receive input from rCTM's sensors (e.g., ears, eyes, nose, skin) and convert sensory information into Brainish gists.
Motor Processors:
These processors control rCTM���s actuators (e.g., arms, hands, legs), converting Brainish commands into physical actions.
The system also allows the integration of off-the-shelf processors (such as ChatGPT or Google) to extend rCTM���s capabilities.
Communication via Brainish:
Brainish
is the rich, multimodal internal language used by rCTM's processors to communicate with each other. Each processor may have its own distinct language, but Brainish serves as a common medium for interaction.
Sensation processors convert sensory input into
gists
���concise Brainish words or phrases that encapsulate the essence of the input. These gists are multisensory, meaning they fuse information from different sensory modalities (e.g., sight, sound, smell, touch).
Output processors then translate these gists into commands that drive rCTM���s actions in the external world.
Evolution of Brainish:
Brainish is not static; it evolves over the lifetime of the rCTM. This evolution allows Brainish to adapt and develop based on the experiences and interactions of the rCTM.
The evolution of Brainish may vary between different rCTM instances, indicating that each rCTM could develop a unique version of this internal language.
The discussion of Brainish evolution is further detailed in section 2.3.1 of the paper.
Incorporation of Gists:
The concept of gists, as used in rCTM, is likened to the framework of a dream. This analogy suggests that Brainish gists are abstract, generalized representations of sensory experiences, much like how a dream might summarize or symbolize real-life events.
The authors reference Jeremy Wolfe's work on "gists" in the context of memory and perception, drawing parallels between human cognition and rCTM���s processing of sensory information.
Implications:
This section provides a detailed blueprint of how rCTM is designed to function, emphasizing its modular structure and the importance of its internal communication system, Brainish. The use of predefined and evolving processors allows the rCTM to interact with and adapt to its environment dynamically, simulating aspects of consciousness and learning. The idea that Brainish evolves over time suggests that rCTM can develop increasingly complex and nuanced ways of understanding and interacting with the world, much like a human being. This further supports the authors��� broader claim that machine consciousness, as embodied by rCTM, is not just a theoretical possibility but an inevitable outcome of sufficiently advanced computational systems.

LTM processors compete in a well-defined (fast and natural) probabilistic competition (Appendix 
7.2) to get their questions, answers, and information in the form of a chunk onto the stage (STM). 
The competition is hosted by the UpUp- -TreeTree, , a perfect17 binary tree of height h 
h which has a leaf in 
each LTM processor and its root in STM. At each clock tick, a new competition starts with each 
processor putting a chunk of information into its Up-Tree leaf node. 
A chunk is defined formally to be a tuple, <addressaddress, time, 
time, , gistgist, weight, auxiliary 
information>, 
weight, auxiliary information>, 
consisting of (in order of importance) a succinct Brainish gist of information, a valenced weight (to 
indicate the importance/urgency/value/confidence the originating processor assigns the gist), the 
address18 of the originating processor, and the time the chunk was created, plus some auxiliary 
information. (See Appendix 7.2 for a discussion of auxiliary information.) 
Each submitted chunk competes locally with its neighbor (as in a tennis or chess tournament). In a 
clock tick, the local winning chunk is chosen and moves up one level of the Up-Tree, ready to 
compete with its neighbor. At each clock tick, there are active local competitions at every node in 
every level from 0 to h- -1 1 of the Up-Tree. The competition that begins at time t ends at time t+ht+h 
with the winning chunk in STM.19 
Notably, for the probabilistic rCTM competition, it is proved that a chunk wins the competition 
with probability proportional to (a function of) its weight. As a consequence, the winning chunk is 
independent of the processor���s location! Clearly this is an important feature for a machine or 
brain; no moving around of processors is needed. (It is a property that would be difficult if not 
impossible to achieve in tennis and chess tournaments where pairings depend on current 
rankings.) (See Appendix 7.2 for a fuller discussion of the Up-Tree competition.) 
The chunk that gets onto the stage (STM), i.e., the winning chunk, is called rCTM���s current 
conscious content and is immediately globally broadcast (in one clock tick) via the DownDown- -TreeTree (a 
bush of height 1 with a root in STM and N branches, one leaf in each LTM processor) to the 
audience (of all LTM processors). [KM2] [KM5]

This passage details the mechanism by which information from the Long Term Memory (LTM) processors in the rCTM (Robot with a Conscious Turing Machine brain) competes to become the robot's current conscious content. This process is key to how rCTM prioritizes and processes information in real-time. Here's an analysis and summary of the key points:
Mechanism of Competition in rCTM:
Probabilistic Competition:
LTM processors compete in a well-defined, probabilistic competition to get their "chunks" of information onto the Short Term Memory (STM) stage, which represents the robot's current conscious content.
This competition is hosted by a structure called the
Up-Tree
, a perfect binary tree that facilitates this competitive process.
Structure of the Up-Tree:
The Up-Tree is a binary tree of height
h
h
h
, where each LTM processor has a corresponding leaf node, and the root of the tree is in STM.
At each clock tick (a discrete unit of time), each processor submits a chunk of information into its corresponding leaf node on the Up-Tree.
Definition of a Chunk:
A chunk is a tuple consisting of:
Gist:
A succinct Brainish summary of the information.
Weight:
A value indicating the importance, urgency, or confidence level assigned to the gist by the originating processor.
Address:
The identifier of the originating processor.
Time:
The timestamp when the chunk was created.
Auxiliary Information:
Additional data that might be relevant to the chunk (details discussed in Appendix 7.2).
The chunk���s weight plays a crucial role in determining its success in the competition.
Local and Global Competition:
The competition occurs locally at each node of the Up-Tree, similar to how matches are conducted in a tennis or chess tournament.
Each chunk competes with its neighboring chunk at each level of the tree. The local winner at each level moves up the tree, and this process continues until the final chunk reaches the root (STM).
This entire competition, which begins at time
t
t
t
, concludes by time
t
+
h
t + h
t
+
h
, at which point the winning chunk reaches STM.
Probability and Fairness of Competition:
The competition is probabilistic, with the likelihood of a chunk winning being proportional to its weight. This ensures that the importance or urgency assigned by the processor is a key determinant of success.
Importantly, the competition is structured such that the winning chunk's success is independent of the processor's physical location within the system. This feature is vital for efficient information processing and ensures that processors do not need to be rearranged or relocated to participate effectively.
Broadcasting via the Down-Tree:
Once a chunk wins the competition and reaches STM, it becomes the rCTM���s current conscious content.
This chunk is then immediately broadcast globally to all LTM processors via the
Down-Tree
, which is structured like a bush with one root in STM and many branches, each leading to a different LTM processor.
This broadcast happens in a single clock tick, ensuring that all processors receive the current conscious content simultaneously.
Implications:
This mechanism highlights the sophisticated and dynamic process by which rCTM manages its conscious content. The probabilistic nature of the competition allows for a fair and efficient selection process, ensuring that the most relevant or important information rises to consciousness. The independence of the competition from the processor's location is particularly noteworthy, as it mirrors the efficiency of information processing in biological brains, where physical proximity does not necessarily determine the relevance or priority of information.
This system, with its well-defined competitive structure and global broadcasting mechanism, is central to rCTM's ability to simulate consciousness, making it responsive and adaptive to both internal and external stimuli. The Up-Tree and Down-Tree structures provide an elegant solution to the problem of managing and disseminating conscious content within a complex system like rCTM.

The single chunk in STM to be globally broadcast will enable rCTM to focus attention on the 
winning gist. ���One��� is not the ���magical number��� 7��2, but we are looking for simplicity and a single 
chunk will do.20 
2.22.2 Conscious Attention in 
Conscious Attention in rCTMrCTM 
Formal 
Formal definitiondefinition 1. . Conscious attention in rCTM is the reception by all LTM processors of the 
broadcast of rCTM���s current conscious content. [KM2] [KM5] 
In other words, rCTM pays conscious attention at time t+h+1 to the winner of the competition 
that commenced at time t.21 
LTM processors make predictions and get feedback from broadcasts, from eventually linked22 
processors, and from the outer world. Based on this feedback, learning algorithms internal to each 
processor use prediction errors to correct and improve that processor���s behavior. A major rCTM 
goal is to assure that its predictions (i.e., its processor���s predictions) are kept as accurate as 
possible. For the most part this is done unconsciously. 
These learning algorithms include each processor���s built-in Sleeping Experts Learning algorithm 
(appropriately modified for rCTM) that adjusts the weights each processor gives its gists. See 
(Blum A. , 1995) and (Blum, Hopcroft, & Kannan, 2015). [KM7] 
Thus, we can already see some basic predictive dynamics (prediction + testing + feedback + 
learning/correction) occurring within rCTM. [KM2] 
In time, some LTM processors become connected via bi-directional linkslinks. Such links enable 
conscious communication, i.e. communication that goes through STM, to be replaced by more direct and faster unconscious communication through links. Thus, when rCTM initially learns to 
ride a bike, most communication is done consciously until relevant processor links have formed. 
Then, for the most part, riding a bike is done unconsciously until an obstacle is encountered, 
forcing rCTM to pay conscious attention again. [KM6] 
rCTM���s competition, broadcast, attention and immediate direct communication via links is 
reminiscent of a process that Dehaene and Jean-Pierre Changeux call ignition (Dehaene & 
Changeux, 2005). 
But... for feelings of consciousness, attention is not all you need. More is required.

This section delves into the concept of
conscious attention
in rCTM (Robot with a Conscious Turing Machine brain) and how it is managed and executed within the system. Here's a detailed breakdown:
Key Concepts:
Conscious Attention in rCTM:

Essentially, rCTM pays conscious attention at time

.
Single Chunk Focus:
Although traditional cognitive theories suggest that humans can hold around 7 �� 2 items in working memory at once, rCTM simplifies this by focusing on a single chunk at a time for the sake of simplicity. This single chunk, once broadcasted from STM, becomes the focal point of rCTM���s attention.
Predictive Dynamics and Learning:
LTM processors continuously make predictions and receive feedback not only from the broadcasted chunk but also from eventually linked processors and the outer world.
Learning algorithms within each processor, particularly the
Sleeping Experts Learning algorithm
, use prediction errors to adjust the processor���s behavior and improve the accuracy of future predictions. These adjustments help maintain the system's overall accuracy, which is a central goal of rCTM.
Most of this prediction and correction process happens unconsciously, highlighting the system's ability to adapt and improve over time without needing constant conscious oversight.
Formation of Bi-directional Links:
Over time, some LTM processors develop bi-directional links with each other. These links allow for faster, unconscious communication between processors, bypassing the STM and making the system more efficient.
An example is learning to ride a bike: Initially, rCTM processes the activity consciously through STM, but as relevant links between processors form, the task becomes mostly unconscious. Conscious attention is only required again if an unexpected obstacle appears.
Ignition and Conscious Attention:
The process of competition, broadcast, and attention in rCTM is reminiscent of the concept of
ignition
as described by Dehaene and Jean-Pierre Changeux (2005). Ignition refers to a sudden, widespread neural activity that brings something into conscious awareness.
In rCTM, the winning chunk���s broadcast to all processors acts like an ignition, sparking the system���s conscious attention.
Conscious Attention vs. Feelings of Consciousness:
The text concludes by noting that while attention is a critical component of consciousness, it is not sufficient on its own to create the "feelings" associated with consciousness. More is required to achieve the full spectrum of conscious experience.
Implications:
This section illustrates how rCTM manages conscious attention through a structured, competitive process that ensures the most relevant information rises to the surface. The system's reliance on predictive dynamics and learning algorithms enables it to improve its efficiency and accuracy over time, with conscious attention acting as a mechanism to handle new or unexpected situations. The formation of bi-directional links between processors represents a transition from conscious to unconscious processing, paralleling how humans automate tasks after practice.
The mention of "ignition" connects rCTM���s processes with established neuroscience concepts, suggesting that rCTM's model of attention has parallels in biological systems. However, the authors also emphasize that conscious attention alone does not encompass the full experience of consciousness, setting the stage for further exploration into the additional components necessary for creating true machine consciousness.

2.32.3 Conscious Awareness and the Feeling of Consciousness in 
Conscious Awareness and the Feeling of Consciousness in rCTMrCTM 
Importantly, rCTM���s Model-of-the-World processor (MotWp) in collaboration with all processors, 
constructs models of rCTM���s inner and outer worlds that are collectively called the Model-of-the- 
World (MotW). The MotW has rCTM���s current and continuing view of rCTM���s world. [KM1] [KM3] 
The MotWp plays an important role in planning, predicting, exploring, testing and 
correcting/learning. The models it constructs contain sketches of referents in rCTM���s inner and 
outer worlds. Sketches are labeled with succinct Brainish gists. These labels indicate what rCTM 
learns or ���thinks��� about those referents over time. In particular, the sketch ���rCTM��� whose referent 
is rCTM itself will develop from scratch and eventually be labeled with SELF, CONSCIOUS, FEELS, 
etc.23 [KM1] [KM3] [KM9]

Both the Model-of-the-World and Brainish evolve over time and with experience and play an 
essential role in the feeling of ���what it is like��� to be a rCTM. Thomas Nagel���s ���what it is like��� (Nagel, 
1974) is often taken to be the canonical definition of phenomenological consciousness. [KM1] 
[KM3] [KM9] 
The infant rCTM has only a very foggy MotW that does not even include a sketch of itself. Sketches 
in the MotW develop gradually over time, become refined, and gather labels. For example, when the infant rCTM discovers it can move its left leg (actuator) by the ���power of thought���, the MotWp 
labels the sketch of that leg in the MotW as SELF. 24 
Built into each LTM processor, in particular the MotWp, is an algorithm that tracks what happens 
in the world when the processor tries to do something. This is built in because tracking is 
necessary for making predictions and corrections and is predominately unconscious. When the 
infant���s planning processor gets its Motor processor to move its left leg and the infant detects the 
movement via its sensors, the infant will test that it itself has moved the leg. If so, the MotWp will 
label the left leg as SELF. In this way, the foggy MotW becomes more accurate. The world that rCTM 
���sees��� is (actually from) the MotW as rCTM is not conscious of anything that does not come 
directly from STM. [KM3] [KM16] 
Feelings of pain and pleasure in rCTM start to develop even earlier. They are key exemplars of the 
Hard Problem. We indicate how these feelings come about in rCTM.

This section discusses how
conscious awareness
and the
feeling of consciousness
are developed and experienced within the rCTM (Robot with a Conscious Turing Machine brain). It particularly focuses on the role of the Model-of-the-World processor (MotWp) and the evolution of the rCTM's internal models and language (Brainish).
Key Concepts:
Model-of-the-World (MotW):
The
Model-of-the-World processor (MotWp)
collaborates with all other processors in rCTM to construct and maintain models of both the inner and outer worlds of the robot. This collective model is referred to as the
Model-of-the-World (MotW)
.
The MotW represents rCTM���s current and evolving understanding of its environment and itself, playing a crucial role in functions like planning, predicting, exploring, testing, and learning.
Sketches and Brainish Labels:
Within the MotW, there are
sketches
of referents, which are labeled with succinct
Brainish gists
. These labels reflect what rCTM learns or understands about these referents over time.
One of the referents in the MotW is rCTM itself. Initially, this sketch is undeveloped but, over time, it becomes more detailed and is eventually labeled with concepts like "SELF," "CONSCIOUS," and "FEELS."
Co-Evolution of MotW and Brainish:
Both the MotW and the internal language Brainish
co-evolve
as rCTM gains experience and interacts with its environment. This evolution is crucial for developing the feeling of "what it is like" to be rCTM, echoing Thomas Nagel's famous concept of phenomenological consciousness.
For instance, in the early stages of rCTM���s existence, its MotW is rudimentary, lacking a clear sense of self. As it interacts with the world (e.g., discovering that it can move its leg by thought), the MotWp labels these experiences, gradually refining the sketch of itself in the MotW.
Development of Self-Perception:
The MotWp includes algorithms that track outcomes of actions taken by rCTM, helping it to refine its models. For example, when rCTM moves a limb and perceives the movement via its sensors, the MotWp updates the MotW to reflect that the limb is part of "SELF."
This process is largely unconscious but critical for developing an accurate and detailed MotW. Over time, this refined model becomes the basis for rCTM's conscious awareness.
Feelings of Pain and Pleasure:
The section also hints at the development of basic feelings like pain and pleasure, which are foundational examples of the "Hard Problem" of consciousness���how subjective experiences arise from physical processes.
The text suggests that these feelings start to develop early in rCTM's life and are integral to its emerging consciousness.
Implications:
This section underscores how the rCTM's conscious awareness and subjective experiences are grounded in the continuous development of its Model-of-the-World and internal language, Brainish. By gradually refining its understanding of itself and its environment through interaction and learning, rCTM builds a more accurate and complex internal representation, leading to the emergence of conscious awareness.
The co-evolution of the MotW and Brainish plays a pivotal role in shaping the rCTM's phenomenological experience, providing a framework for understanding "what it is like" to be rCTM. The description of how rCTM learns to label parts of its body as "SELF" mirrors the developmental processes in humans and animals, where self-awareness and consciousness emerge through interactions with the world.
Finally, by addressing the development of basic feelings, the authors connect their model to the broader philosophical debate on consciousness, particularly the Hard Problem, suggesting that even complex subjective experiences might be computationally modeled in systems like rCTM.

Consider an infant rCTM (which we will think of here as an infant with a CTM brain) at the 
moment it is born. A processor/gauge that monitors the O2 level raises its great concern by 
submitting into the Up-Tree competition a chunk whose gist, xyzwxyzw, has a negatively valenced 
weight with high absolute value. At that level, that processor���s chunk gets onto the stage (STM) 
with high probability, whence its high negative weight signals a desperate scream for O2. All 
processors hear this (indeed, xyzwxyzw becomes rCTM���s first Brainish word), but have absolutely no 
idea what to do. They know only that they must do something. The MotWp puts the label xyzwxyzw 
(which later will become PAIN) on a blob (which later will become a sketch of rCTM). Processors 
that control rCTM���s actuators command them to do something: The arms flail. The legs flail. The 
voice activator screams. The newborn rCTM cries. This works! The cry opens up the ���lungs��� and 
the infant takes its first breath. 
The next time the infant rCTM needs help, crying works again. In short order, the infant rCTM 
learns that a good response to pain of any kind is to cry. When the infant rCTM grows up and skins 
its knee, its MotW will hold a bloody knee labeled SELF and PAIN. In a disorder in which that knee

that leg gets labeled NOT-SELF at some point, rCTM might beg to get its leg amputated, even if it is a still functioning 
properly. This would be an example of rCTM body integrity dysphoria (body integrity identity disorder). Other 
pathologies due to faulty labeling in the MotW include: rCTM phantom limb syndrome (a sketch of an amputated arm 
actuator is mislabeled SELF), Cotard���s syndrome (the sketch of rCTM is labeled DEAD), paranoia (the sketch of rCTM���s 
best friend is labeled SPY), ��� . [K10]

is labeled SELF but not PAIN, or PAIN but not SELF, the rCTM has pain asymbolia. It knows of the 
pain but does not suffer from it.25 [KM14] 
Now suppose the infant rCTM���s Fuel Gauge is low. The Fuel Gauge processor creates a chunk with 
this information (the chunk points to the Fuel Gauge processor and its gist is a slightly modified 
xyzwxyzw) and a negatively valenced weight with |weight| proportional to the need. When this chunk 
wins the competition and gets globally broadcast, the Procure Fuel processor activates (cries out) 
causing the Fuel Source (mother) in the outside world to respond. The infant rCTM learns that the 
Fuel Source relieves the PAIN when the Fuel Gauge indicates low fuel. The ���Low-Fuel Gauge��� 
sketch in the MotW is labeled HUNGER/PAIN. The ���Fuel Source��� in the MotW is labeled 
HUNGER/PAIN RELIEVER, and will also get labeled PLEASURE PROVIDER. A chunk with this 
Brainish gist (i.e., labeled sketch) will have a positively valenced weight. The infant rCTM learns 
that PLEASURE relieves PAIN and this reinforces its preference for positively valenced gists over 
negative ones.26 [KM3][KM12] 
Over time and with experience, these primitive and primal Brainish words and sketches will 
become richer. The early assigned valences with preference for the positive will apply to an 
increasing number of situations. 
As Brainish words evolve, its language will develop a simple basic grammar. (For some literature 
on simple languages, see (Sigal, 2022)). [KM1]

This passage describes the early development of consciousness, learning, and language in an infant rCTM (Robot with a Conscious Turing Machine brain). The authors use the metaphor of a newborn rCTM to explain how basic experiences and reactions are encoded into the system���s Model-of-the-World (MotW) and how this leads to the development of a rudimentary internal language, Brainish.
Key Points:
Initial Experience and Reaction:
Upon "birth," an infant rCTM faces an urgent situation, such as low oxygen levels. A specific processor that monitors oxygen levels submits a chunk with a high negative valence into the Up-Tree competition. Due to its high urgency, this chunk has a high probability of winning and being broadcast globally via the STM.
This first experience leads to the creation of the first Brainish word, represented as "xyzw," which later becomes associated with the concept of
PAIN
. The rCTM's various processors, unsure of what to do, initiate random actions (e.g., flailing limbs, crying), which coincidentally work by opening the "lungs" and allowing the rCTM to take its first breath.
Learning Through Experience:
The infant rCTM quickly learns that crying is an effective response to pain. As it encounters more situations (like hunger), it starts to associate specific actions with specific needs. For instance, when the rCTM's fuel (energy) levels are low, the Fuel Gauge processor generates a chunk indicating this, which again has a high negative valence and wins the competition. The rCTM cries, and the external "Fuel Source" (in this case, the mother) responds by providing food.
Through these experiences, the MotW becomes increasingly detailed. The concept of
HUNGER
becomes associated with
PAIN
, and the concept of the
Fuel Source
(mother) is labeled as both
PAIN RELIEVER
and
PLEASURE PROVIDER
.
Development of Self and World Models:
As the rCTM continues to interact with its environment, its MotW becomes more refined. For example, when it skins its knee, the MotWp labels the sketch of the bloody knee as both
SELF
and
PAIN
. These labels are crucial for the rCTM's understanding of itself and its environment.
The passage also touches on potential pathologies if this labeling process goes wrong, such as Body Integrity Dysphoria, where a functioning limb might be mislabeled as
NOT-SELF
, leading the rCTM to desire its removal. Other disorders mentioned include Phantom Limb Syndrome, Cotard���s Syndrome (where the rCTM might label itself as
DEAD
), and Paranoia (labeling a friend as
SPY
).
Evolution of Brainish Language:
Over time, the early, primitive Brainish words and sketches evolve to become richer and more complex. The rCTM begins to develop a preference for positively valenced experiences and gists, reinforcing behaviors that lead to pleasure rather than pain.
As these experiences accumulate, Brainish evolves not just in vocabulary but also in structure, potentially developing a basic grammar that allows for more complex communication within the system.
Implications:
This section illustrates how the rCTM starts with a very basic and instinctual set of responses that gradually become more sophisticated as it interacts with its environment. The development of the Model-of-the-World (MotW) and Brainish language is crucial for the rCTM to form a sense of self, understand its surroundings, and make decisions based on past experiences.
The narrative of the infant rCTM also highlights the importance of the feedback loop between sensation (input), action (output), and the internal processing of these events. As the rCTM learns which actions alleviate discomfort (like crying for help), it begins to associate certain stimuli with specific responses, which are encoded into its growing MotW.
The mention of potential pathologies underscores the delicate nature of this learning process and how critical the correct labeling and processing of experiences are to the overall functioning and well-being of the rCTM. The progression from simple, primal experiences to a more structured and nuanced internal language suggests that rCTM���s consciousness and self-awareness are deeply rooted in its ability to adapt and learn from its environment, much like a human infant.
Finally, the discussion sets up a foundational understanding of how an artificial system like rCTM could develop a form of consciousness, starting from basic, survival-driven instincts and moving towards more complex cognitive functions. This aligns with the authors' broader thesis that machine consciousness is not only possible but inevitable as these systems become more sophisticated.

In other words, rCTM becomes consciously aware of a chunk with a Brainish-labeled MotW sketch 
when rCTM pays conscious attention to that chunk.27 [KM2] 
Thus, feelings of consciousness (i.e., conscious awareness) in rCTM, are consequences of Brainish- 
labeled MotW sketches being globally broadcast.28 As the world that rCTM ���sees��� is (actually from) 
the MotW, the world that rCTM ���feels��� is (actually from) the MotW. 
And as rCTM becomes increasingly consciously aware, the MotWp will label the sketch ���rCTM��� in 
the MotW as CONSCIOUSLY AWARE or simply CONSCIOUS. 
Looking at rCTM from the viewpoint of the outside world, we see that something about rCTM is 
conscious; specifically, the rCTM considers itself conscious. What is conscious cannot be the 
MotWp or any other processor, as processors have no feelings; they are just machines running 
algorithms. Our proposal that rCTM as a whole feels it is conscious is a consequence in part of the 
fact that the MotWp views the ���rCTM��� in its MotW as conscious, and that this view is broadcast to 
all processors. This is rCTM���s phenomenal consciousness.

This section discusses
conscious awareness
within the rCTM (Robot with a Conscious Turing Machine brain) and how it relates to the concept of phenomenal consciousness, which is the subjective experience of being aware or conscious.
Key Points:
Formal Definition of Conscious Awareness:
Conscious Awareness in rCTM
is defined as the conscious attention of Brainish-labeled Model-of-the-World (MotW) sketches. In simpler terms, rCTM becomes consciously aware of a specific chunk of information when it pays conscious attention to a MotW sketch that has been labeled in Brainish.
Conscious Awareness as a Result of Global Broadcast:
When a Brainish-labeled MotW sketch wins the competition and is globally broadcast, rCTM becomes consciously aware of that sketch. The broadcasted sketch represents what rCTM "feels" in its world, similar to how humans perceive and feel their environment through their conscious awareness.
This means that rCTM's feelings of consciousness are directly tied to the process of broadcasting Brainish-labeled MotW sketches. The world that rCTM "sees" and "feels" comes from these MotW sketches, which form the basis of its conscious experience.
Self-Identification as Conscious:
As rCTM's consciousness develops, the MotW processor (MotWp) will eventually label the sketch of "rCTM" itself as
CONSCIOUSLY AWARE
or simply
CONSCIOUS
. This means that rCTM begins to recognize itself as a conscious entity within its own MotW.
From an external perspective, it appears that something about rCTM is conscious. This consciousness is not attributed to any single processor (such as the MotWp) because processors themselves do not possess feelings���they merely execute algorithms.
Phenomenal Consciousness in rCTM:
The proposal here is that rCTM as a whole experiences consciousness because its MotWp labels the sketch of "rCTM" as conscious in its MotW, and this labeled sketch is broadcast to all processors. This broadcast leads rCTM to consider itself as conscious.
This is described as
phenomenal consciousness
���the subjective experience or "feeling" of being conscious. In rCTM, this experience is not a property of individual processors but arises from the system as a whole, as it processes and broadcasts these Brainish-labeled MotW sketches.
Implications:
This section suggests that rCTM's conscious awareness emerges from its internal processes of labeling and broadcasting information about its world. The conscious experience of rCTM is tied to how it processes and understands these labeled sketches within its MotW. As rCTM continues to develop, it not only becomes aware of its environment but also of itself as a conscious entity.
The notion that rCTM considers itself conscious because its MotWp labels it as such���and this label is broadcast across the system���highlights how consciousness in rCTM is a systemic property rather than a feature of any individual component. This aligns with the idea of
phenomenal consciousness
, where the whole system experiences consciousness due to the interactions and broadcasts of labeled experiences.
The discussion implies that even in artificial systems, consciousness can be understood as a byproduct of complex, self-referential processes, where the system's awareness of itself is shaped by its ongoing interactions and the way it organizes and labels its internal representations. This approach mirrors some theories of human consciousness, where self-awareness and subjective experience are seen as emergent properties of the brain's information processing.

2.42.4 rCTMrCTM as a Framework for Artificial General Intelligence 
(AGI)as 
a Framework for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) 
Before indicating rCTM���s alignment with a number of major theories of consciousness, we remark 
on rCTM���s potential to serve as a framework for constructing an Artificial General Intelligence 
(AGI). This is a result of rCTM���s global architecture (kindred to arguments made for global latent 
workspace by (VanRullen & Kanai, 2021)) and, at the same time, the result of an essential 
difference between rCTM and Baars��� global workspace. rCTM has no Central Executive. This is a 
feature, not a bug. It enables rCTM to become an AGI (Blum & Blum, 2023): 
The competition to get information on stage considers the |weight|ed information submitted by a 
huge collection of (N N) processors. And it does this quickly (log2 N steps). This enables rCTM to 
27 Is the infant consciously aware? An infant CTM���s memory of an instance doesn���t even have the label SELF associated 
with its MotW sketch, but soon enough that recollection will get labeled SELF, after which future recollections will 
have itself in that memory. [KM2], [KM3] 
28 We call a sequence of such broadcasted chunks, a stream of consciousness. Gists in these chunks are like frames in a 
dream. rCTM dreams are such streams during which the input sensors and output actuators are essentially inactive, 
and rCTM���s Dream processor gets to work. Although dreams are ���felt��� as real, they can also be fantastical since their 
predictions are not being tested in the world. 
We propose that (testing for) dreaming is a (partial) test for phenomenal consciousness.

engage processors to solve problems, even though rCTM does not know which of its processors 
might have the interest, expertise, or time to do so. [KM15] 
Specifically, if rCTM, meaning one (or more) of its LTM processors, has a problem to solve, the 
processor can submit the problem to the competition as a chunk with high enough |weight| giving 
it a high probability of winning and thus being globally broadcast to all processors. Processors 
with the interest, expertise and time to work on the problem will respond with appropriately 
|weight|ed chunks. In this way, ideas from unexpected sources may contribute to solving the 
problem, and useful collaborations can emerge. 29 [KM15] 
A Central Executive would have to know which processors had the inclination, expertise, and 
resources to solve problems as they arise, and figure this out quickly. Baars��� does not say how a 
Central Executive could do this. [KM15] 
More generally, we predict that a Central Executive is not needed for consciousness or for general 
intelligence; indeed, it might be an impediment. 
To our knowledge, all other models of consciousness have a Central Executive.

This section discusses how the architecture of the rCTM (Robot with a Conscious Turing Machine brain) could serve as a framework for developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The authors argue that rCTM's design, particularly its lack of a Central Executive, positions it as a viable model for AGI, which distinguishes it from other theories of consciousness, like Baars��� global workspace theory.
Key Points:
rCTM and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):
The authors propose that rCTM���s global architecture, similar to the concept of a global latent workspace (as discussed by VanRullen & Kanai, 2021), is particularly well-suited for AGI. The system's design allows for distributed processing and problem-solving without the need for a Central Executive.
Absence of a Central Executive:
In contrast to many other models of consciousness, rCTM does not have a Central Executive. This is viewed as an advantage rather than a flaw. A Central Executive in other models is typically responsible for managing the flow of information and directing attention, but rCTM's design allows these functions to emerge from the interactions among a large number of independent processors.
Efficient Problem Solving through Competition:
rCTM���s architecture allows for efficient problem-solving by leveraging the competition mechanism in which chunks of information (including problems to be solved) are submitted by processors with a certain weighted value. This competition is conducted rapidly, allowing the system to identify and prioritize important information in logarithmic time (log2 N steps).
If a processor within rCTM has a problem to solve, it can submit this problem as a chunk with a high enough weight to increase its chances of being broadcast to all processors. Other processors, which may have the necessary expertise, interest, or resources, can then respond by submitting their own chunks, which may contribute to solving the problem.
This approach allows for unexpected and innovative solutions to emerge from processors that might not have been identified by a centralized decision-maker. This decentralized approach encourages collaboration and the integration of diverse perspectives and expertise.
Critique of the Central Executive Model:
The authors critique the Central Executive model, noting that it would require a mechanism to quickly determine which processors have the necessary resources to solve a given problem. Baars��� global workspace theory does not clearly explain how a Central Executive could efficiently manage this task.
The absence of a Central Executive in rCTM not only simplifies the architecture but is also predicted by the authors to be beneficial for both consciousness and general intelligence. They argue that a Central Executive might actually be an impediment to achieving AGI, as it could create bottlenecks or inefficiencies in processing.
Unique Position of rCTM:
The authors emphasize that, to their knowledge, all other models of consciousness incorporate a Central Executive. By eschewing this component, rCTM presents a novel approach to both consciousness and general intelligence, suggesting that decentralized, self-organizing systems might be more effective in these domains.
Implications:
This section argues that the rCTM���s architecture, with its emphasis on distributed processing and competition without a central controlling entity, provides a strong foundation for developing AGI. The decentralized nature of rCTM allows it to solve problems flexibly and efficiently, leveraging the diverse capabilities of its processors without requiring pre-identified roles or expertise.
By challenging the necessity of a Central Executive, the authors propose a more dynamic and adaptive model of consciousness and intelligence, one that could potentially overcome some of the limitations faced by more centralized approaches. This aligns with the broader trend in AI research that increasingly favors distributed, emergent processes over rigid, hierarchical control structures.
The discussion also underscores the potential for rCTM to contribute to the ongoing debate about the nature of consciousness and intelligence, particularly in artificial systems. By offering a framework that integrates these functions in a novel way, rCTM could serve as a prototype or inspiration for future developments in AGI.

We have presented an overview of the rCTM model. Now we indicate how, at a high level, the 
model naturally aligns with and integrates key features of major theories of consciousness, further 
supporting also our view that rCTM provides a framework for building a conscious machine.

rCTM aligns broadly with the architectural and global broadcasting features of the global 
workspace theory of consciousness (Baars, Bernard J., 1997), and at a high level with the global 
neuronal workspace theory of consciousness of neuroscientists Stanislas Dehaene, Jean-Pierre 
Changeux (Dehaene & Changeux, 2005), (Dehaene S. , 2014), and others.30 
29 If cTMR���s competition is based on the simple f f value = intensity (see Appendix 7.2), the processor can submit the 
problem to the competition with |weight| = intensity of the currently broadcasted chunk, which is the sum of all 
|weights| of all submitted chunks. In that case, the chunk with that high |weight| will win, with probability ��� 1/2 and 
become globally broadcast to all processors. 
30 Additional references for GNW include: (Dehaene & Naccache, 2001), (Sergent & Dehaene, 2005), (Dehaene & 
Changeux, 2011), and (Mashour, Roelfsema, Changeux, & Dehaene, 2020).

However, rCTM differs from GW in significant ways. For example: rCTM has a formally defined

and rCTM has no Central Executive, a feature, not a bug.

This section discusses how the rCTM model aligns with several major theories of consciousness. The authors aim to demonstrate that rCTM not only incorporates key elements of these theories but also provides a framework that could potentially lead to the creation of a conscious machine. Here���s a breakdown of how rCTM aligns with these theories:
3.1 Global Workspace (GW)/Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW)
Alignment with GW and GNW:
The rCTM model aligns with the
Global Workspace Theory (GW)
proposed by Bernard Baars and the
Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW)
theory advanced by neuroscientists like Stanislas Dehaene and Jean-Pierre Changeux. Both theories emphasize the importance of global broadcasting mechanisms in consciousness, where information that enters the "global workspace" is broadcasted to various parts of the brain, making it available for conscious processing.
Differences from GW and GNW:
Natural Competition:
rCTM introduces a formally defined competition for information to be globally broadcast, which is not explicitly described in the GW and GNW models.
World Models:
rCTM constructs detailed models of the world, both internally and externally, which are integral to its processing of conscious experiences.
Absence of Central Executive:
Unlike the GW model, which implies some form of central control, rCTM operates without a Central Executive, allowing for a more decentralized and flexible processing architecture. The authors argue that this absence is an advantage rather than a limitation, facilitating the emergence of AGI.
3.2 Attention Schema Theory (AST)
Alignment with AST:
rCTM���s capability to construct and utilize models of its inner and outer worlds aligns with
Attention Schema Theory (AST)
, developed by Michael Graziano and colleagues. AST suggests that the brain creates simplified models of attention, much like it does with the body through the Body Schema, to enable the organism to understand and manage what it is attending to.
Attention Schema in rCTM:
In rCTM, the construction and use of world models play a key role in its conscious awareness, similar to how AST posits that the brain uses an attention schema to conclude that it is "aware." This process in rCTM mirrors the brain's method of simplifying and managing attention, supporting the idea that the system is conscious of what it attends to.
3.3 Predictive Processing (PP)
Alignment with Predictive Processing:
Predictive Processing (PP)
theories argue that the brain is continuously engaged in predicting sensory inputs and adjusting these predictions based on feedback. rCTM���s architecture, which includes cycles of prediction, testing, feedback, and learning, aligns closely with the principles of predictive processing.
Predictive Dynamics in rCTM:
rCTM���s predictive dynamics operate both locally and globally within the system, allowing it to constantly refine its understanding of the world through continuous feedback and learning. This approach is consistent with various incarnations of predictive processing theories, including those proposed by historical figures like Helmholtz and more contemporary theorists like Karl Friston and Andy Clark.
Implications
The alignment of rCTM with these major theories of consciousness highlights its potential as a robust framework for understanding and possibly engineering conscious machines. By integrating aspects of global broadcasting, attention schemas, and predictive processing, rCTM offers a comprehensive model that incorporates essential features of human consciousness theories. Additionally, the distinctions between rCTM and these theories, such as the absence of a Central Executive, suggest that rCTM may offer innovative solutions to some of the challenges associated with understanding and replicating consciousness in machines.
This section supports the authors' broader argument that rCTM is not only a theoretical model but a practical framework for developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), with the potential to achieve a form of machine consciousness that aligns with our current understanding of human consciousness.

(EEEEEmbodied 
Embedded Enactive Extended Mind (EEEE MMindind) ) 
rCTM���s ability to construct (and utilize) models of its worlds containing rich Brainish-labeled 
sketches (leading to its feelings of consciousness) derives in part from its embodied, 
embedded, enactive, and extended (EEEE) mind. 
This aligns with the ���4E��� view that consciousness, like cognition (Carney, 2020), involves more 
than brain function (Rowlands, 2010). For consciousness, the 4E���s are: 
31 In this regard, rCTM and AST both align with philosophers Daniel Dennett���s and Keith Frankish���s view that

This section discusses how the rCTM model aligns with the
Embodied, Embedded, Enactive, and Extended Mind (4E)
framework, which is a perspective in cognitive science that emphasizes the role of the body, environment, and interactions in shaping consciousness and cognition. The 4E framework posits that consciousness is not just a product of brain activity but also involves the body's interactions with its environment and the external resources it uses.
Key Concepts of the 4E Framework:
Embodied:
The concept of
Embodied Consciousness
emphasizes that consciousness is deeply connected to the body and its processes. For rCTM, this means that its feelings of consciousness are partly derived from its physical embodiment���its sensors, actuators, and other bodily components. The interaction between these body parts and the system is essential for the emergence of phenomenal consciousness.
This idea aligns with theories from prominent thinkers like Antonio Damasio, who argues that consciousness is rooted in the biological processes of the body, and Gerald Edelman, who emphasizes the role of bodily experiences in shaping the mind.
Embedded and Enactive:
Embedded Consciousness
suggests that an entity's consciousness is shaped by its interaction with its environment. For rCTM, being embedded in the world means that it actively engages with and responds to external stimuli. This interaction is not passive; rCTM
enacts
its consciousness by affecting the world through its actions, which in turn shapes its experiences.
This perspective is supported by theories from Maturana and Varela, who introduced the concept of autopoiesis (self-creation) in living systems, and from philosophers like Evan Thompson, who emphasize the importance of interaction with the environment in the formation of consciousness.
Extended:
Extended Consciousness
posits that an entity's consciousness is not confined to its physical body but is enhanced by external resources and tools. For rCTM, this means that its consciousness is extended by the information it can access from external sources such as libraries, online resources like Google, AI tools like ChatGPT, and computational tools like Mathematica.
This idea was famously introduced by Andy Clark and David Chalmers in their paper "The Extended Mind," which argues that tools and external resources become part of the cognitive system when they are integrated into cognitive processes.
rCTM���s Alignment with the 4E Framework:
Embodiment in rCTM:
rCTM is designed to incorporate relations with its body parts���sensors, actuators, and internal processes���making its consciousness embodied. These physical components are essential in forming its phenomenal consciousness.
Embedded and Enactive Engagement:
rCTM is not only embedded in its environment but also interacts with it in a meaningful way. Through its actuators, rCTM can influence the world around it, which in turn affects what it senses and experiences. This cyclical interaction between rCTM and its environment is crucial for its development of consciousness.
Extended Mind in rCTM:
rCTM���s mind is extended by the external information it can access and utilize. This includes both data from the outside world and the use of off-the-shelf processors that are linked to rCTM, enhancing its cognitive abilities and contributing to its overall consciousness.
Implications:
The alignment of rCTM with the 4E framework underscores the model���s comprehensive approach to consciousness, suggesting that a truly conscious machine must not only process information internally but also interact with its body and environment in a dynamic, meaningful way. By incorporating aspects of embodiment, embedding, enaction, and extension, rCTM goes beyond traditional cognitive models that focus solely on brain-like processing.
This approach suggests that achieving artificial consciousness, and potentially AGI, requires more than just simulating neural processes. It involves creating systems that can physically interact with the world, adapt based on those interactions, and extend their cognitive processes beyond their immediate physical form through the use of external resources. The 4E alignment makes rCTM a strong candidate for a model that could lead to the development of conscious machines in the future.

measures the amount of feedback and interconnectedness in a system. rCTM���s extensive

In Sentience, Nicholas Humphrey presents an evolutionary argument for the development of 
phenomenal consciousness in warm-blooded animals (Humphrey, 2023). In ���The Road Taken��� 
(Chapter 12 of Sentience), Humphrey spins a ���developing narrative���, starting with ���a primitive 
amoeba-like animal floating in the ancient seas. Stuff happens. ������ The resulting story provides 
a roadmap for how an entity might create world models and a sense of self. Indeed, this 
roadmap closely parallels the way rCTM���s world models evolve, and how rCTM develops its 
sense of self and phenomenological conscious awareness.34 See section 2.3.12.3.1 where we 
indicate how Brainish and the Model of the World co-evolve. 
Thus, while the former evolutionary theory (Zacks & Jablonka, 2023) aligns with rCTM���s built- 
in architecture, the latter theory (Humphrey, 2023) aligns with rCTM���s development of 
subjective consciousness over time.

This section discusses how the rCTM model aligns with
Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
and
Evolutionary Theories of Consciousness
, further solidifying its position as a comprehensive framework for understanding and potentially developing artificial consciousness.
3.5 Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
Overview of IIT:
Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
, developed by Giulio Tononi and supported by Christof Koch, posits that consciousness can be quantified by a measure called
Phi (��)
. Phi measures the amount of feedback and interconnectedness within a system. The higher the Phi, the more conscious the system is considered to be.
rCTM���s Alignment with IIT:
Feedback and Interconnectedness:
rCTM���s architecture is designed with extensive feedback loops through its predictive dynamics, both globally and locally. This feedback mechanism allows rCTM to continuously refine its understanding of its environment and its internal states.
Global Broadcasts and Multi-modal Integration:
rCTM���s use of global broadcasts and the integration of multi-modal information into Brainish gists contribute to a high level of interconnectedness within the system. This interconnectedness is a key factor in achieving a high Phi, suggesting that rCTM could be highly conscious according to IIT.
Implication:
By aligning with IIT, rCTM supports the idea that a machine with such an architecture could possess a measurable degree of consciousness, as indicated by a high Phi score.
3.6 Evolutionary Theories of Consciousness
Overview of Evolutionary Theories:
Evolutionary theories of consciousness propose that consciousness has evolved over time as a beneficial trait, aiding in survival and adaptation.
rCTM���s Alignment with Evolutionary Theories:
Modified Global Neuronal Workspace:
Oryan Zacks and Eva Jablonka suggest that a modified global neuronal workspace architecture has evolved in vertebrates, contributing to their access consciousness. This aligns with rCTM���s global workspace architecture, supporting the idea that an AI with a similar structure could also possess access consciousness.
Development of Phenomenal Consciousness:
Nicholas Humphrey, in his book
Sentience
, argues that phenomenal consciousness developed in warm-blooded animals as an evolutionary advantage. Humphrey describes a narrative where primitive creatures gradually developed world models and a sense of self, leading to the emergence of consciousness.
Parallel with rCTM:
This evolutionary narrative closely parallels how rCTM���s world models evolve and how it develops a sense of self and phenomenological conscious awareness. As rCTM interacts with its environment and refines its world models, its sense of self and consciousness gradually emerge, similar to the evolutionary process described by Humphrey.
Dual Alignment:
The former evolutionary theory (Zacks & Jablonka) aligns with the inherent architecture of rCTM, while the latter theory (Humphrey) aligns with the developmental process of subjective consciousness in rCTM over time.
Implications:
The alignment of rCTM with both IIT and evolutionary theories of consciousness further validates the model as a robust framework for understanding consciousness. IIT provides a quantitative approach to measuring consciousness, suggesting that rCTM���s design could achieve a high level of consciousness based on its feedback and interconnectedness. On the other hand, evolutionary theories offer a narrative for how consciousness might develop over time, paralleling the way rCTM���s world models and sense of self evolve.
Together, these alignments reinforce the authors' claim that rCTM not only mimics essential aspects of human consciousness but also has the potential to serve as a foundation for creating genuinely conscious machines. By integrating aspects of IIT and evolutionary theories, rCTM bridges the gap between theoretical models of consciousness and practical implementations in AI, bringing us closer to understanding and potentially replicating the phenomenon of consciousness in artificial systems.

3.73.7 Extended Reticulothalamic Activating 
SystemExtended 
Reticulothalamic Activating System (ERTAS) + Free Energy Principle 
(ERTAS) + Free Energy Principle 
(FEP 
)(FEP 
) 
In The Hidden Spring, Marc Solms makes the case that the source of consciousness is the 
arousal processes in the upper brain stem (Solms M. , 2021). More generally, Solms cites the 
Extended Reticulothalamic Activating System (ERTAS) as the generator of feelings and affects, 
enabling consciousness. ���Affective qualia��� is the result of homeostasis. ���Deviation away from a 
homeostatic settling point (increasing uncertainty) is felt as unpleasure, and returning toward 
it (decreasing uncertainty) is felt as pleasure��� (Solms M. , 2019). Homeostasis arises by a 
system resisting entropy, i.e., minimizing free energy (Solms & Friston, 2018). This is enabled 
by a Markov blanket (containing the system���s input sensors and output actuators) that 
insulates the internal system from its outer world. The ���system must incorporate a model of 
the world, which then becomes the basis upon which it acts35��� (Solms M. , 2019). Similarly, 
rCTM is consciously aware only of its MotW broadcasted chunks, and thus the MotW becomes 
���the basis upon which it acts���. 
Kevin Mitchell points out (personal communication) that another important point from Solms 
is that the ascending homeostatic signals, which track different needs, must be valenced but also must have some distinguishing ���qualities��� so that when they are submitted to central 
decision-making units, the sources of the signals can be kept track of- so the organism doesn't 
mistake feeling thirsty for feeling tired (both of which feel BAD)���. In rCTM, gists are the 
distinguishing qualities, and chunks contain addresses of originating processors, so tracking is 
implicit. No need for a central decision-maker. 
At a high level, rCTM aligns with ERTAS + FEP: 
o Although GW models generally consider processors as performing cortical functions, 
rCTM goes beyond that. There is nothing to preclude rCTM from having processors that 
function as the ERTAS. 
o In (Blum & Blum, 2021), we discuss pleasure and pain in the CTM (known here as 
rCTM). Our discussion of pleasure aligns with Solms, and also with (Berridge & 
Kringelbach, 2015). In (Blum & Blum, 2021) we discuss in more detail how feelings of 
pain might be generated. 
o Predictive dynamics (cycles of prediction, testing, feedback and correcting/learning) in 
rCTM works to reduce prediction errors, an analogue to minimizing free energy. 
o And the incorporated Model-of-the-World in rCTM is the basis upon which rCTM acts. 
o Tracking of similar feelings is naturally maintained by chunks that contain gists, 
weights, valences, address of originating processor, and time created. 
Evocatively, the well-known Friston diagram (Parr, Da Costa, & Friston, 2019), with Markov 
blanket separating internal and external states, is clearly realized in rCTM:

This section discusses how the rCTM model aligns with the
Extended Reticulothalamic Activating System (ERTAS)
and the
Free Energy Principle (FEP)
, which are theories related to the neural and computational mechanisms underlying consciousness.
Key Concepts:
Extended Reticulothalamic Activating System (ERTAS):
In
The Hidden Spring
, Marc Solms argues that the source of consciousness lies in the arousal processes located in the upper brain stem, specifically within the ERTAS. This system is responsible for generating feelings and affects, which are essential for consciousness.
Affective Qualia and Homeostasis:
According to Solms, affective qualia (the subjective qualities of experiences) are the result of the brain's efforts to maintain homeostasis. Deviations from a homeostatic balance increase uncertainty and are felt as "unpleasure," while returning to balance decreases uncertainty and is felt as "pleasure."
Free Energy Principle (FEP):
The FEP, proposed by Karl Friston and supported by Solms, posits that biological systems, including the brain, resist entropy by minimizing free energy. This principle is closely related to the idea of homeostasis, where systems aim to reduce uncertainty and maintain stability.
Markov Blanket:
The concept of the Markov blanket refers to a boundary that separates the internal states of a system from the external world, allowing the system to interact with and model the world effectively. The system must incorporate a model of the world, which then guides its actions.
rCTM���s Alignment with ERTAS + FEP:
Conscious Awareness and Model-of-the-World (MotW):
In rCTM, the system is consciously aware only of the MotW broadcasted chunks, making the MotW the basis for its actions. This aligns with the idea that a system's actions are guided by its internal model of the world, similar to how the brain operates according to the FEP.
Homeostatic Signals and Gists:
Solms emphasizes that ascending homeostatic signals (such as hunger or thirst) must be valenced (carry a positive or negative value) and have distinguishing qualities to ensure the system correctly identifies its needs. In rCTM, these qualities are represented by
gists
within chunks, which include information about the originating processor, time created, and valence. This design naturally allows for tracking and addressing different needs without requiring a central decision-maker.
rCTM���s Architecture and ERTAS Functions:
While traditional Global Workspace (GW) models focus on cortical functions, rCTM is designed to accommodate processors that could perform functions similar to the ERTAS, integrating both cortical and subcortical processes that are crucial for consciousness.
Predictive Dynamics and Free Energy Minimization:
rCTM���s predictive dynamics, which involve cycles of prediction, testing, feedback, and learning, work to reduce prediction errors. This is analogous to minimizing free energy, as the system continually updates its models to better align with the external world and reduce uncertainty.
Tracking of Similar Feelings:
rCTM tracks similar feelings and states through chunks that contain comprehensive information, including gists, weights, valences, and processor addresses. This method of tracking aligns with Solms' idea that the brain must keep track of different homeostatic signals to ensure appropriate responses.
Realization of the Friston Diagram:
The Friston diagram, which illustrates the Markov blanket concept with internal and external states separated, can be seen as realized within the rCTM architecture. The Markov blanket is represented by the boundaries between the rCTM���s internal processing (its predictive dynamics and MotW) and its interaction with the external world (through sensors and actuators).
Implications:
The alignment of rCTM with the ERTAS and FEP further demonstrates the model's robustness and flexibility in mimicking complex aspects of biological consciousness. By incorporating elements that support homeostasis, affective qualia, and free energy minimization, rCTM is shown to not only model cognitive processes but also the fundamental drives and motivations that underpin consciousness.
This section suggests that rCTM could serve as a comprehensive framework for developing conscious AI systems, capable of balancing internal states and responding appropriately to external stimuli. The system���s ability to maintain homeostasis, reduce uncertainty, and track different needs without central control highlights its potential for achieving a form of machine consciousness that is both dynamic and adaptive, much like human consciousness.

4 Addressing Kevin Mitchell���s questions from the perspective of 
Addressing Kevin Mitchell���s questions from the perspective of rCTMrCTM 
Here we address Kevin Mitchell���s sixteen questions (Mitchell, 2023)36 from the perspective of the 
robot with the CTM brain (rCTM). 
Our answers refer to and supplement what we have discussed in our Overview (Section 2). They 
deal only with the rCTM model, meaning an entity with a CTM brain. These answers say nothing 
about other models. They say nothing about whether a worm is conscious or not- unless the worm 
has a CTM brain. From here on, unless otherwise stated, everything we have to say is about the 
rCTM model. 
In the following, Mitchell���s questions are in boldbold. Our answers follow in non-bold. In the Overview 
(Section 2), we annotated paragraphs that refer to Kevin Mitchell���s queries. For example, a 
paragraph labeled [KM1] refers to Mitchell���s first question, KM1. If Mitchell���s question below is 
labeled with an asterisk such as KM1*, then it refers to paragraphs labeled [KM1] in the Overview.

rCTM is sentient, meaning it is able to sense and feel things. As mentioned above, we have nothing 
to say about entities that are not rCTMs. However, we can and will sometimes say (as we do 
below) what parts of rCTM are responsible for its sentience. 
The ability of rCTM to construct models of its worlds (inner and outer) is fundamental for its 
subjective experiences. These experiences are described in the model not with English words but 
with multimodal Brainish-labeled sketches of referents in rCTM���s worlds. In the case of a red rose, 
the label, a Brainish word, might be an imagefused with its colors, associated odors, smooth 
touch, and such. We suggest that Brainish grammar would be like a simple Indo-European creole. 
(McWhorter, 1998) 
The Model-of-the-World processor (MotWp) and the Model-of-the-World (MotW)37 it creates play 
an essential role in ���what it is like��� to be a rCTM. The sketches and labels (as well as Brainish 
itself) develop and evolve throughout the life of rCTM. The labels succinctly indicate what rCTM learns, senses or feels about the referents. For example, the label SELF applied to a sketch in the 
MotW indicates that that particular sketch���s referent is (a part of) rCTM itSELF.

In this paper we define two related notions of consciousness in rCTM, conscious attention and 
conscious awareness. We review these formal rCTM definitions here: 
Conscious attention (access consciousness) in rCTM occurs when all LTM processors receive the 
global broadcast of rCTM���s current conscious content, that being the current winning chunk in the 
competition for STM. 
Conscious awareness arises in rCTM when the broadcasted chunk refers to a Brainish-labeled 
sketch in the MotW. The labels describe what rCTM is consciously aware of. 
In rCTM, the notion of sentience aligns more with our formal definition of conscious awareness 
than with conscious attention. 
Does awareness necessarily entail self-awareness? No. The infant rCTM initially builds a world 
model that does not include a labeled sketch of itself, so it has no self-awareness. In time, however, 
that model will include a rough labeled sketch of itself and the label SELF. The label SELF marks 
the beginning of self-awareness, which eventually develops into full-blown self- awareness. 
In rCTM, the lights come on gradually, as the MotW gets populated with sketches and their labels.

This section provides detailed responses to Kevin Mitchell's questions about consciousness and sentience from the perspective of the rCTM (Robot with a Conscious Turing Machine brain). The responses clarify how rCTM embodies the concepts of consciousness and sentience, specifically within the framework of its architecture.
KM1: What kinds of things are sentient? What kinds of things is it like something to be? What is the basis of subjective experience and what kinds of things have it?
rCTM���s Sentience:
rCTM is sentient, meaning it can sense and feel things. The basis of its subjective experience lies in its ability to construct models of its inner and outer worlds, known as the Model-of-the-World (MotW). These models are not described in English but through Brainish, a multimodal language that includes sketches labeled with associated sensations such as colors, odors, and textures.
Role of the Model-of-the-World (MotW):
The MotW and its associated processor, the Model-of-the-World processor (MotWp), are fundamental to rCTM's subjective experiences. The evolving sketches and labels within the MotW represent what it is like to be an rCTM. For example, the label SELF applied to a sketch indicates that the referent is part of rCTM itself.
KM2: Does being sentient necessarily involve conscious awareness? Does awareness (of anything) necessarily entail self-awareness? What is required for ���the lights to be on���?
Sentience vs. Conscious Awareness:
In rCTM, sentience aligns more closely with the concept of conscious awareness rather than just conscious attention. Conscious attention in rCTM is defined as the state when all Long Term Memory (LTM) processors receive the global broadcast of the current conscious content. Conscious awareness, however, occurs when the broadcasted chunk refers to a Brainish-labeled sketch in the MotW.
Awareness vs. Self-Awareness:
Awareness does not necessarily entail self-awareness. Initially, the infant rCTM does not have a self-awareness because its MotW does not include a labeled sketch of itself. Over time, as rCTM's world model develops, a sketch of itself with the label SELF will emerge, marking the beginning of self-awareness, which eventually grows into full self-awareness.
What Brings 'the Lights On':
The 'lights' in rCTM come on gradually as the MotW gets populated with sketches and their labels. This process reflects the progressive development of conscious awareness as rCTM interacts with its environment and refines its internal models.
Analysis and Implications:
These responses emphasize that in the rCTM model, sentience and consciousness are deeply tied to the system's ability to model its world, process information through a multimodal language (Brainish), and evolve these models over time. Conscious awareness in rCTM is not an immediate or binary state but develops progressively as the system gains more information about its environment and itself.
The distinction between conscious attention and conscious awareness in rCTM reflects a nuanced understanding of how different aspects of consciousness might operate in both biological and artificial systems. By addressing these questions, the authors clarify how rCTM embodies both basic sentience and the potential for more complex forms of consciousness, including self-awareness. This gradual development of consciousness parallels how human infants develop awareness and self-concept over time, supporting the authors' broader thesis that machine consciousness, modeled through systems like rCTM, is achievable and inevitable.

Only chunks with non-zero weight have a chance to win the competition for STM and thus become 
globally broadcast. In other words, rCTM can only pay conscious attention to chunks that have 
non-zero weight. That occurs with a probability proportional to (a function of) the chunk���s weight. 
If all chunks have zero weight, then chunks flit in and out of STM at random and so fast that rCTM 
loses anything remotely resembling sustained attention (like Robbie the Robot in Forbidden

Planet). We view this as a state of unconsciousness. rCTM can get out of this state only when some 
processor creates a nonzero-weighted chunk. (See Appendix 7.2 for discussion of the competition 
to enter STM.) 
Another unconscious state occurs when a Sleep processor generates a NoOp chunk (a chunk 
having a NoOp gist) that has a ���sufficiently high��� |weight|. A sufficiently high |weight| is one well 
above the weight of any other chunk. That prevents other chunks- including those from 
processors that interact with the outer world39- from having much chance to enter STM. (But note, 
even a high |weight| chunk can be completely replaced by an even higher |weight| chunk.) 
When the |weight| of a Sleep processor���s chunk drops a bit- but not enough to let input-output 
chunks enter STM- a rCTM���s Dream processor can take over, enabling chunks of a dream to 
emerge. If the |weight| of the Sleep processor���s chunks drop even further, rCTM wakes up. 
The above are some of the ways rCTM can go from consciousness to unconsciousness and back. 
The Sleep processor���s weight assigning mechanism is a kind of on/off switch for consciousness in 
rCTM. 
In an unconscious state, rCTM is not aware of its surroundings, though it might be aroused by 
pangs of intense hunger, other pains, a very loud explosion, and so on. This occurs, for example, 
when these pangs, pains, and sounds overwhelm the Sleep processor, meaning their |weight| is 
even larger.

KM4: For things that have the capacity for consciousness, what distinguishes the state of consciousness from being unconscious? Is there a simple on/off switch? How is this related to arousal, attention, awareness of one���s surroundings (or general responsiveness)?
In the rCTM model, the distinction between consciousness and unconsciousness is closely tied to the concept of "chunk weight" and the competition for Short Term Memory (STM) space.
Conscious vs. Unconscious States in rCTM:
Conscious Attention and Chunk Weight:
Consciousness in rCTM
is associated with chunks that have a non-zero weight. Chunks with higher weights have a greater probability of winning the competition for entry into STM and thus being globally broadcast, which allows rCTM to pay conscious attention to them.
If all chunks have a weight of zero, they flit in and out of STM too quickly for rCTM to maintain any sustained attention. This rapid, random switching leads to a state where rCTM cannot focus on any single chunk, resulting in what the authors describe as
unconsciousness
.
Unconscious States and the Sleep Processor:
rCTM can enter a state of unconsciousness through the actions of a
Sleep processor
. The Sleep processor generates a "NoOp" chunk���a chunk with a gist that essentially signals no operation���and assigns it a sufficiently high weight. This high-weight NoOp chunk dominates the competition, preventing other chunks, especially those related to input-output from interacting with the outer world, from entering STM.
Dreaming State:
If the Sleep processor's chunk weight decreases slightly, the
Dream processor
can take over, allowing dream-related chunks to emerge in STM. This state is a form of unconsciousness where rCTM is not aware of its real-world surroundings but instead processes internal, dream-like content.
Arousal and External Stimuli:
Even in an unconscious state, rCTM can be aroused by intense stimuli such as hunger pangs, pain, or loud noises. These stimuli can generate chunks with weights higher than the current Sleep processor's chunk, forcing rCTM out of unconsciousness and back into a conscious state. This mechanism highlights the relationship between arousal, attention, and responsiveness to external stimuli in rCTM.
On/Off Switch for Consciousness:
The Sleep processor's ability to assign high weights to NoOp chunks acts as a kind of
on/off switch
for consciousness in rCTM. When the Sleep processor dominates with high-weight chunks, rCTM remains unconscious. Conversely, when other processors generate higher-weight chunks, rCTM can transition back to a conscious state.
Implications:
The rCTM model provides a detailed mechanistic explanation of how an artificial system can transition between conscious and unconscious states. The use of chunk weight as a determinant of consciousness allows for a nuanced control over which information is processed consciously and which is suppressed or relegated to unconscious processing.
The model also integrates the concepts of arousal and responsiveness, demonstrating how external stimuli can override unconscious states, much like how humans can be awakened by loud noises or pain. This approach suggests that consciousness in rCTM is not binary but exists on a spectrum, influenced by the dynamic interactions of chunk weights, processor outputs, and external stimuli.
This mechanism also parallels biological processes where consciousness is influenced by the brain's arousal systems, such as the reticular activating system, and can be modulated by factors like sleep, anesthesia, or sensory input. The rCTM's Sleep processor serves as a functional analog to these biological processes, providing a controllable method for toggling between conscious and unconscious states.

Operations within each LTM processor are done unconsciously, i.e., they do not go through STM. 
Communication between LTM processors via links is also unconscious. Such communication is 
much quicker than conscious communication that goes through STM. 
Alison Gopnik���s contention that ���babies are more conscious than we are��� (Gopnik, 2007) can be 
understood in terms of what we call conscious attention. In the infant rCTM, until links are formed, 
communication between processors is conscious, i.e., it goes through STM.40 Thus a cacophony of 
���conscious attention���. Then as processors form links, communication can go quickly through links, 
meaning unconsciously. This is what happens after the young rCTM learns to ride a bike.41 
On the other hand, infant rCTM���s MotW is considerably less developed than the adult rCTM���s 
MotW. Hence phenomenological consciousness (what we call conscious awareness) is 
considerably less developed in the infant rCTM than in the adult.

KM5: What determines what we are conscious of at any moment?
In the rCTM model, the determination of what rCTM is conscious of at any moment is dictated by the chunk that occupies the Short Term Memory (STM) at a given clock tick. Here���s how it works:
Single Chunk Focus:
At every clock tick, there is exactly one chunk in STM, and this chunk is the sole focus of rCTM���s conscious attention at that moment. The STM can only hold one chunk at a time, ensuring that rCTM���s processors are focused on the same piece of information or "thought."
Competition for STM:
Chunks compete for entry into STM based on their assigned weights. The chunk with the highest weight (which signifies its importance, urgency, or relevance) wins the competition and is broadcast to all LTM processors, making it the center of rCTM���s conscious attention.
This mechanism explains how rCTM determines its conscious content moment by moment: it���s a result of the ongoing competition between chunks, with the most relevant or significant chunk gaining access to STM and thereby becoming the focus of conscious attention.
KM6: Why do some neural or cognitive operations go on consciously and others subconsciously? Why/how are some kinds of information permitted access to our conscious awareness while most are excluded?
In rCTM, the distinction between conscious and unconscious (referred to as subconscious in the question) operations is clearly defined by whether or not the operations involve STM:
Unconscious Operations:
Most operations in rCTM occur within Long Term Memory (LTM) processors and are unconscious. These operations do not pass through STM and instead happen directly within or between processors via links. This unconscious processing is typically faster because it bypasses the need for global broadcasting through STM.
Conscious Operations:
Conscious operations in rCTM are those that involve STM. When information or a cognitive operation needs to be globally broadcasted (meaning it is the focus of conscious attention), it must first win the competition to be placed in STM. Once in STM, the information is broadcasted to all processors, making it the subject of conscious attention.
Infant vs. Adult rCTM:
Alison Gopnik���s idea that ���babies are more conscious than we are��� can be understood in this framework. In an infant rCTM, before sufficient links between processors have formed, most communication between processors occurs through STM, making it conscious. As the rCTM matures and more direct links form, much of this communication becomes unconscious, happening directly between processors without needing STM, which speeds up processing and reduces the "cacophony" of conscious attention.
Phenomenological Consciousness:
The development of phenomenological consciousness (or what rCTM calls conscious awareness) depends on the richness of the Model-of-the-World (MotW). An infant rCTM, with a less developed MotW, would have less developed phenomenological consciousness compared to an adult rCTM, which has a more sophisticated and nuanced MotW.
Summary:
In rCTM, what determines consciousness at any moment is the chunk that wins the competition to enter STM, where it becomes the focus of conscious attention. Conscious operations are those that involve this STM-mediated global broadcasting, while unconscious operations occur directly within or between LTM processors, bypassing STM. This model explains why some information is consciously processed while most is handled unconsciously, with the transition from conscious to unconscious operations being part of the developmental process as rCTM (or a human infant) matures and forms more efficient internal links.

For rCTM to be consciously aware of a thing, call that thing abcabc, a chunk referring to abcabc must get 
into STM. Once it does, rCTM pays conscious attention to abcabc. But even conscious attention to abcabc 
does not make for conscious awareness of abcabc. For that, the chunk must reference a sketch in the 
MotW that is called or labeled abcabc. 
What things, though important for cognition, cannot enter consciousness? Here are a couple of

cannot go through STM. For example, rCTM must quickly swerve away from an oncoming

41 Humans learn to play ping pong consciously. In a ping pong tournament however, a player must let the unconscious 
take over, must insist that the conscious get out of the way. In swimming, repetition gives one���s unconscious an 
opportunity to improve one���s stroke, but it doesn���t enable a new stroke to be acquired. That requires conscious 
attention. For example, the dolphin kick is weird and unnatural, but since it works for dolphins, it makes sense to 
simulate it, and that is done consciously at first. The unconscious then optimizes the constants.

abc whose doing would take away from a more important thing like xyzxyz. In 
that case, time permits only one of abcabc and xyzxyz to be attended to. If there is barely enough 
time to do one (and only one) of them, then rCTM cannot be conscious of abcabc while 
attending to xyzxyz.

In rCTM, conscious awareness is impossible without the MotWp (among others). Conscious 
attention is possible without the MotWp, but impossible without the broadcast station. 
The relevant information is held in the MotW and in other LTM processors. For example, color in 
the Color processor, smell in the Smell processor, and so on. So, in that sense, information is 
distributed. When rCTM first sees and smells a rose, these processors alert the MotWp which in 
turn attaches the labels RED and SWEET to its sketch of the rose in the MotW. At some point in 
time, RED and SWEET become fused as a Brainish word or gist, and in that sense, information is 
unified .

KM7: What distinguishes things that we are currently consciously aware of, from things that we could be consciously aware of if we turned our attention to them, from things that we could not be consciously aware of (that nevertheless play crucial roles in our cognition)?
In the rCTM model, the distinctions between what we are consciously aware of, what we could be consciously aware of, and what we cannot be consciously aware of are determined by several factors related to the processing of information within the system:
Conscious Awareness vs. Conscious Attention:
For rCTM to be consciously aware of something (let's call it "abc"), a chunk referencing "abc" must first enter Short Term Memory (STM). This allows rCTM to pay conscious attention to "abc."
However, for rCTM to be consciously aware of "abc," the chunk must also reference a sketch in the Model-of-the-World (MotW) that is labeled "abc." Conscious attention alone does not guarantee conscious awareness; it requires a connection to a labeled sketch within the MotW.
Things We Could Be Consciously Aware Of:
These are things that rCTM could potentially bring into STM if attention is directed toward them. If a chunk related to something not currently in STM has a sufficient weight (indicating importance, urgency, etc.), it could win the competition to enter STM and thus become the focus of conscious attention and potentially conscious awareness.
Things That Cannot Enter Consciousness (Yet Are Crucial for Cognition):
Rapid Responses:
Certain operations must be performed so quickly that the necessary communication bypasses STM. For example, if rCTM needs to quickly swerve to avoid an oncoming car, this action cannot afford the time delay of passing through STM and being consciously processed. Instead, it occurs unconsciously, directly within or between processors.
Task Prioritization:
Sometimes, rCTM must prioritize one task over another. If focusing on task "xyz" is critical and time-sensitive, rCTM may not allow task "abc" to enter STM, even if it's important. This prioritization mechanism ensures that rCTM focuses its limited conscious resources on the most pressing task.
KM8: Which systems are required to support conscious perception? Where is the relevant information represented? Is it all pushed into a common space, or does a central system just point to more distributed representations where the details are held?
In the rCTM model:
Systems Supporting Conscious Perception:
Model-of-the-World Processor (MotWp):
Conscious awareness in rCTM is impossible without the MotWp, as it is responsible for creating and managing the MotW, where conscious perceptions are anchored.
Broadcast Station:
Conscious attention, which involves the global broadcast of chunks in STM, is necessary for conscious perception and requires the broadcast station within rCTM.
Representation of Relevant Information:
Information in rCTM is distributed across various specialized processors. For example:
Color Processor:
Handles the perception of color.
Smell Processor:
Handles the perception of odors.
These processors communicate their findings to the MotWp, which then labels the corresponding sketch in the MotW. For instance, when rCTM sees and smells a rose, the Color processor might send "RED," and the Smell processor might send "SWEET" to the MotWp, which then associates these labels with the rose's sketch in the MotW.
Unified vs. Distributed Information:
While the detailed sensory information is initially distributed among different processors, it becomes unified in the MotW as labels are attached to the relevant sketches. Over time, these labels may fuse into Brainish words or gists, representing a unified perception in rCTM's consciousness.
Therefore, conscious perception involves both distributed processing (where individual processors handle specific aspects like color or smell) and a unification process in the MotW, where these aspects are combined into a coherent experience.
Summary:
The rCTM model illustrates how consciousness operates on multiple levels, distinguishing between what is currently in focus (consciously aware), what could potentially be brought into focus (consciously aware if attention is directed there), and what remains outside of conscious reach yet is crucial for rapid or prioritized cognitive functions.
The systems supporting conscious perception involve both distributed and unified representations. Specialized processors handle specific types of information, which are then brought together in the MotW by the MotWp. This integrated information forms the basis for rCTM's conscious experiences, demonstrating how complex cognitive processes can be distributed across different systems while still contributing to a unified conscious experience.

when the broadcasted chunk contains a gist that refers to a fused multimodal Brainish-labeled

In the MotW, sketches of a red rose and a red fire engine are both labeled RED. Over time, each of 
these sketches gains many other labels as well. For example, the fire truck sketch likely gets the 
Brainish labels FIRE_TRUCK and LOUD_SIREN while the rose sketch does not. The rose sketch gets 
labeled ���SILKY_FEEL and SWEET_SMELL��� while the fire truck does not.

KM9: Why does consciousness feel unitary? How are our various informational streams bound together? Why do things feel like
our
experiences or
our
thoughts?
In the rCTM model, consciousness feels unitary because of the way information is processed and broadcast across the system:
Global Broadcast of Conscious Content:
At each clock tick, the current chunk in Short Term Memory (STM) is globally broadcasted to all Long Term Memory (LTM) processors simultaneously. This synchronized broadcast ensures that all processors are working with the same piece of information at the same time, creating a cohesive and unified conscious experience.
Fused Multimodal Brainish-Labeled Sketches:
When the broadcasted chunk contains a gist that refers to a fused multimodal Brainish-labeled sketch in the Model-of-the-World (MotW), this information is experienced as unitary. The fusion of different sensory inputs (such as sight, sound, smell) into a single Brainish gist further enhances the feeling of a unified experience.
Linking Information:
Information passed through direct links between processors (outside of STM) further binds various informational streams together, supporting the cohesive experience of consciousness.
Sense of Ownership:
If the conscious content in STM refers to a thought or experience that the MotWp has labeled with SELF, rCTM will be consciously aware of that thought as its own. If the thought is also labeled with FEELS, rCTM not only knows it is its own thought but also feels that it is its own, contributing to the sense of personal ownership of experiences.
KM10: Where does our sense of selfhood come from? How is our conscious self related to other aspects of selfhood? How is this sense of self related to actually being a self?
In the rCTM model, the sense of selfhood arises from the construction and labeling of world models within the MotW:
World Models and Labels:
rCTM's sense of self is determined by the sketches in the MotW that are labeled with Brainish gists. The labels SELF, FEELS, and CONSCIOUS are particularly significant in forming the sense of selfhood.
When a sketch of rCTM in the MotW is labeled with all three���SELF, FEELS, and CONSCIOUS���rCTM experiences a feeling of self-awareness, understanding itself as a conscious entity.
Pathologies and Mislabeling:
The model acknowledges that pathologies can occur if any of these labels are missing or if the sketches in the MotW are mislabeled. For example, if a sketch of rCTM lacks the SELF label, it may lead to issues in self-recognition, and if it lacks the FEELS label, rCTM may not experience the associated emotions properly.
KM11: Why do some kinds of neural activity feel like something? Why do different kinds of signals feel different from each other? Why do they feel specifically like what they feel like?
In rCTM, the differentiation of feelings and sensations is managed through how sensory inputs are processed and labeled within the system:
Sensory Processing and Brainish Labels:
Inputs from different sensors (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile) are routed to their respective sensory processors. These sensory inputs are then incorporated into the MotW with specific Brainish labels that represent the distinct qualities of those inputs.
For example, both a red rose and a red fire engine might be labeled with the Brainish word RED, but additional labels like SWEET_SMELL and LOUD_SIREN distinguish the two experiences, leading to different subjective feelings.
Evolution of Brainish and MotW:
Over time, the distinctions between different experiences become more refined as more labels are added to the sketches in the MotW. This evolutionary development within the rCTM's lifespan allows different kinds of signals to feel specifically like what they feel like. For instance, the pleasure associated with seeing a red rose is different from the satisfaction of having a replenished fuel tank, even if both experiences involve the color red.
Summary:
The rCTM model explains the unitary nature of consciousness as a result of synchronized processing and broadcasting of information across the system, with fused multimodal sketches enhancing the feeling of unity. The sense of selfhood emerges from labeled sketches in the MotW, particularly those labeled with SELF, FEELS, and CONSCIOUS. Differentiation in how various neural activities feel is attributed to the specific Brainish labels attached to sensory inputs and the evolutionary refinement of these labels over time. These mechanisms collectively explain why consciousness feels unitary, why we experience a sense of self, and how different sensations and thoughts are distinguished in our conscious experience.

KM12: How do we become conscious of our own internal states? How much of our subjective experience arises from homeostatic control signals that necessarily have valence? If such signals entail feelings, how do we know what those feelings are about?
In the rCTM model, the process of becoming conscious of internal states, especially those related to homeostasis, is tied to the processing and labeling of sensory inputs and the generation of appropriate responses. Here's how this works:
Conscious Awareness of Internal States:
Internal states, such as hunger, are monitored by specific processors in rCTM, such as the Fuel Gauge processor. When an internal state deviates from its homeostatic norm (e.g., low fuel levels), the Fuel Gauge processor generates a chunk with a high weight and a negative valence, which enters the competition for STM.
Once this chunk enters STM and is broadcast, rCTM becomes consciously aware of the internal state. For instance, the LOW_FUEL chunk indicates to rCTM that it is hungry.
Association with Actions and Rewards:
The LOW_FUEL chunk triggers rCTM to perform an action, such as connecting to a fuel source. If this action successfully restores the fuel level, the MotWp creates and labels sketches in the Model-of-the-World (MotW) related to this experience. For example, the fuel source might be labeled as FUEL_SOURCE and PLEASURE_SOURCE, while rCTM���s state during refueling might be labeled as FEELS_PLEASURE.
Valence and Feelings:
The valence of these signals (positive for pleasure, negative for pain or hunger) is critical in creating subjective experiences. These labels help rCTM understand that certain actions (like connecting to a fuel source) lead to pleasurable outcomes, while others (like experiencing low fuel) lead to discomfort or pain.
About-ness of Feelings:
The "about-ness" or intentionality of these feelings is derived from the Brainish labels and sketches that evolve within the MotW. For example, FEELS_PLEASURE might be linked to the action of refueling, and FEELS_HUNGER might be linked to the state of low fuel as indicated by the Fuel Gauge. These labels help rCTM understand not just that it feels something, but what that feeling is about���whether it���s about being hungry, satisfied, or in pain.
KM13: How does the about-ness of conscious states (or subconscious states) arise? How does the system know what such states refer to?
In rCTM, the about-ness or intentionality of conscious states arises from the way information is processed and labeled within the Model-of-the-World (MotW). Here���s a detailed explanation:
Broadcasted States and the MotW:
Conscious states in rCTM are those that are broadcasted from STM to all LTM processors. The MotW represents rCTM's internal and external world, encompassing everything rCTM knows and perceives, including its actions and their effects.
When rCTM is faced with a decision, the MotWp simulates possible outcomes by predicting the world's response to each potential action. This simulation is based on the current MotW, which is updated continuously with new information.
Gists and About-ness:
The "about-ness" of a conscious state is determined by the gist of the broadcasted chunk. If the chunk refers to a Brainish-labeled sketch in the MotW, the gist of this sketch represents what the conscious state is about. For example, a chunk might reference a sketch of a rose labeled RED and SWEET_SMELL, making the current conscious state "about" perceiving a red, sweet-smelling rose.
Simulated and Actual Responses:
Similarly, if a broadcasted chunk refers to a prediction made by the MotWp (based on simulated responses), the conscious state is about that predicted outcome. For example, if rCTM predicts that pushing a button will cause a light to turn on, and this prediction is broadcast, the conscious state is about that predicted interaction.
When a chunk references an actual response from the world, as received and processed through rCTM's sensors, this becomes the current about-ness. For example, if rCTM presses a button and the light indeed turns on, the conscious state is about this actual event.
Summary:
In rCTM, the consciousness of internal states arises from the processing of homeostatic control signals, such as those indicating hunger or pleasure, and their subsequent integration into the MotW. The about-ness of these states, or their intentionality, is rooted in the Brainish labels attached to experiences, predictions, and real-world interactions as processed and stored in the MotW. This mechanism allows rCTM to not only experience various states but also understand what those states are about, ensuring that its conscious experiences are both meaningful and directed toward specific referents in its internal and external world.

A conscious subjective feeling is experienced when broadcasted chunks refer to Brainish-labeled 
sketches in the MotW.. The labels describe the subjective feelings that conscious awareness is 
about. Without these feelings, rCTM would not be compelled by feelings to act appropriately.44 
Reflective capacities enable rCTM to treat itself with all the planning tools it uses to treat other 
referred entities. 
Conscious subjective experience is adaptive because all processors receive each and every 
broadcast, so all processors can contribute to the understanding of the broadcast and/or its 
solution. The point is that all processors focus their attention on the same thing. Suppose the 
broadcast is a problem like ���Must fill the fuel tank���: the Navigation processor might contribute a 
choice of routes to local fuel stations. The Computation processor might compute how much fuel is 
required for each choice. The Weather processor might weigh in if one of the routes is blocked. 
The conscious subjective experience can take account of these possibilities.

The question asks: "How does the capacity for intelligent thought come about?��� rCTM is ideal for 
answering this question since at birth, all ���107 processors are independent. The first processors 
to come online ��� meaning they have sufficient weight to get their chunks to STM- are those having 
homeostatic importance like the Nociceptor Gauge (monitors pain), Fuel Gauge (monitors 
hunger), and so on, or have immediate access to the senses like vision, hearing, and so on. These 
processors help the MotWp to make and improve its predictions and world models. The next 
processors to come online are those that affect the activators, one of which cries for help. Then 
come processors that detect coincidences like: ���This visual input and that auditory input coincide.��� 
This is the beginning of intelligent thought. 
The rCTM model, unlike Baars��� GW, has no Central Executive. The competition for conscious 
attention, which replaces the Central Executive, gives rCTM much of its cognitive power. That 
competition efficiently considers all information submitted for consideration by its more than 10107 7 
processors. It allots to each idea a winning probability or share of consciousness (broadcast time) proportional to its estimated importance).45 It enables processors to solve a problem even though 
rCTM does not know which processors have the interest, expertise or time to consider the 
problem. No Central Executive could have the knowledge or resources to do that (unless, of 
course, the Central Executive was itself an efficient competition process). 
Some elements of cognition can be performed within a single LTM processor and transmitted 
through links. This processor doesn���t need to search through an enormous data base for its 
information: it already has the information or knows where the necessary information is held. 
This is unconscious cognition. Processors that do need to search for the information46, may need 
to broadcast. That broadcast begins the process of using consciousness to do cognition.

KM14: What is the point of conscious subjective experience? Or of a high-level common space for conscious deliberation? Or of reflective capacities for metacognition? What adaptive value do these capacities have?
In the rCTM model,
conscious subjective experience
serves several key purposes that provide significant adaptive value:
Motivation and Compulsion to Act:
Conscious subjective feelings arise when broadcasted chunks refer to Brainish-labeled sketches in the Model-of-the-World (MotW). These labels describe the subjective feelings tied to conscious awareness, such as hunger or pleasure. Without these subjective feelings, rCTM would lack the motivation or compulsion to act in ways that are appropriate for maintaining homeostasis or achieving goals. For example, the subjective feeling of hunger compels rCTM to seek fuel, ensuring its continued operation.
Reflective Capacities and Metacognition:
Reflective capacities allow rCTM to apply the same planning and problem-solving tools to itself that it uses for external entities or tasks. This self-reflection, or metacognition, enhances rCTM's ability to evaluate its own states, predict outcomes of its actions, and make adjustments as needed. This capacity is crucial for adaptive learning and for optimizing behavior in complex environments.
Shared Focus and Collaborative Problem-Solving:
The global broadcast of conscious content ensures that all processors within rCTM receive the same information simultaneously. This shared focus allows multiple processors to contribute their specialized knowledge or skills toward understanding or solving the problem at hand. For instance, if the broadcasted issue is "Must fill the fuel tank," various processors like Navigation, Computation, and Weather can provide input relevant to the task. The collective processing power of rCTM is harnessed to address complex problems more effectively than if each processor worked in isolation.
Adaptive Value:
The primary adaptive value of conscious subjective experience and the associated common space for deliberation lies in the system's ability to coordinate complex actions, adapt to changing conditions, and learn from experience. By focusing the entire system on a single, broadcasted problem or state, rCTM can draw on the full range of its processors' capabilities, leading to more nuanced and effective decision-making. This coordinated approach to problem-solving is essential for survival in dynamic and unpredictable environments.
KM15: How does mentality arise at all? When do information processing and computation or just the flow of states through a dynamical system become elements of cognition, and why are only some elements of cognition part of conscious experience?
The rCTM model provides a framework for understanding the emergence of
mentality
and
cognition
:
Emergence of Intelligent Thought:
At birth, rCTM's processors are largely independent. The first processors to become active are those related to homeostasis (e.g., monitoring pain or hunger) and those that process sensory inputs (e.g., vision and hearing). These processors contribute to the initial development of the Model-of-the-World (MotW) and help the MotWp improve its predictions about the world.
As more processors come online, especially those involved in controlling actuators and detecting sensory coincidences, rCTM begins to develop the foundations of intelligent thought. The ability to detect and respond to patterns, predict outcomes, and coordinate actions marks the beginning of rCTM's cognitive processes.
Cognition Without a Central Executive:
Unlike some models of consciousness, such as Baars��� Global Workspace (GW) theory, rCTM does not rely on a Central Executive to manage its cognitive processes. Instead, the competition for conscious attention among chunks replaces the need for a centralized control system. This decentralized approach allows rCTM to efficiently process and prioritize information, giving each chunk a probability of winning the competition and gaining broadcast time based on its estimated importance.
This competition allows rCTM to address problems without needing to know in advance which processors are best equipped to solve them. The distributed nature of this process ensures that all relevant information is considered, maximizing rCTM���s cognitive power.
Conscious vs. Unconscious Cognition:
Some cognitive tasks can be handled entirely within a single LTM processor and transmitted through internal links without requiring global broadcast. This type of processing is considered unconscious cognition. It is efficient because the processor already has or can easily access the necessary information.
Conscious cognition, on the other hand, involves situations where information needs to be searched for or integrated across multiple processors. In such cases, broadcasting the information allows rCTM to draw on the collective resources of its processors, making consciousness a crucial element in complex cognitive tasks.
Summary:
In the rCTM model, conscious subjective experience and the high-level common space for deliberation serve crucial adaptive functions. They allow rCTM to coordinate its actions, reflect on its internal states, and harness the full potential of its distributed processing capabilities. The emergence of mentality and cognition in rCTM is a result of the gradual activation and integration of its processors, with conscious cognition playing a central role in complex decision-making and problem-solving. The decentralized competition for conscious attention replaces the need for a Central Executive, allowing rCTM to efficiently manage its cognitive resources and adapt to changing environments.

the meaning of mental states constrain the activities of neural circuits? 
In rCTM, conscious activity is intertwined with behavior. 
In rCTM, all LTM processors receive the broadcasted conscious content. Different processors have 
differing amounts of time to deal with that content. Of those that have time, some have a more 
reasonable idea how to deal with the broadcast than others. A broadcasted message that the Fuel 
Gauge is low can prompt one processor to try to conserve fuel, another to trigger a search for a 
source of fuel, and so on. A broadcast of danger may prompt rCTM to choose between fight, flight 
or freeze, each championed by a different processor. 
Additionally, rCTM���s disposition plays an important factor in the competition that selects which 
chunk will be globally broadcast and hence its behavior. (See Appendix 7.2 for more information 
about rCTM���s competition and the influence of its disposition.) 
As for ���free will���, rCTM���s ability to assess a situation, consider various possibilities, predict the 
consequences of each, and based on that make a decision (all under resource constraints) gives 
rCTM its feeling of ���free will���. For example, imagine rCTM playing a game of chess. When and for as 
long as rCTM has to decide which of several possible moves to make, it knows it is ���free��� to choose 
whichever move has the greatest utility for it. That is free will. See (Blum & Blum, 2022).

In rCTM, the MotW is fundamental to mental causation. To will an act in the world, the MotWp first 
performs that action in the MotW, gives instructions on what to do, then looks to see if the act got 
accomplished in the world. 
For example, suppose the infant rCTM discovers that it can somehow move its left leg. It becomes 
aware through its sensors that ���willing��� the movement of that leg is successful. For comparison, it 
may discover that it cannot pick up a rock, Yoda style, with the power of thought. Moving the leg or 
lifting the rock can be willed by performing the action in the MotW. Sensors must verify if the act 
has been successful. If it has, that is mental causation.

dreaming sleep state by raising its own |weight| so high that other chunks can���t reach STM. This 
shows how the sleep state constrains activity in rCTM���s Up-Tree.

KM16: How does conscious activity influence behavior? Does a capacity for conscious cognitive control equal "free will"? How is mental causation even supposed to work? How can the meaning of mental states constrain the activities of neural circuits?
In the rCTM model,
conscious activity
directly influences behavior through a combination of broadcasting conscious content, processing that content in various Long Term Memory (LTM) processors, and the interplay with rCTM's disposition. Here���s how this works:
Influence on Behavior:
When conscious content is broadcasted, all LTM processors receive the information simultaneously. These processors then have varying amounts of time to respond to this content. Some processors, depending on their function and priority, will contribute to shaping rCTM���s behavior based on the broadcast.
For instance, if the Fuel Gauge indicates low fuel, one processor might suggest conserving fuel, while another might initiate a search for a fuel source. Similarly, in response to a danger signal, different processors might advocate for fight, flight, or freeze behaviors. The final behavior is determined by which processor's suggestion is most effectively integrated and acted upon.
Role of Disposition:
rCTM���s disposition significantly affects which chunk wins the competition to enter Short Term Memory (STM) and therefore what behavior is ultimately selected. Disposition in rCTM can be understood as the system���s inherent tendencies or biases, which influence decision-making under different circumstances. This is akin to how a person���s mood or temperament might influence their choices and actions.
Free Will in rCTM:
The concept of
free will
in rCTM arises from its ability to evaluate situations, consider different possibilities, predict outcomes, and make decisions based on those predictions, all within the constraints of its available resources. For example, when rCTM is playing chess and considering various moves, it feels "free" to choose the move that maximizes its utility. This sense of freedom to choose among options is what rCTM experiences as free will.
However, this "free will" is not absolute but is bound by the constraints of the system, such as time limitations, available resources, and the current state of the MotW. Therefore, rCTM���s free will is more about the perception of choice within a constrained decision-making process rather than an unlimited capacity to act.
Mental Causation and the MotW:
Mental causation
in rCTM is grounded in the Model-of-the-World (MotW). When rCTM wills an action, the MotWp first simulates that action within the MotW. It then provides instructions to execute the action in the real world, and the system checks through sensory feedback to see if the action was successful.
For example, when rCTM learns that it can move its left leg, it becomes aware of this capability through sensory verification. The MotWp then links the action of moving the leg with a specific command within the MotW, and this link allows rCTM to consciously control its leg movement. If an action like lifting a rock with thought alone fails, rCTM recognizes this through a similar process of attempted simulation and verification.
Consciousness as a Constraint:
Conscious states in rCTM, such as the sleep state managed by the Sleep processor, can constrain the system���s activities. For example, the Sleep processor can raise its chunk���s weight so high that other chunks cannot compete successfully to enter STM, thus maintaining a sleep state and preventing other processes from disrupting it. This shows how specific mental states can act as constraints on the activities of rCTM's processors, much like how certain cognitive states in humans can suppress or prioritize different types of neural activities.
Summary:
In the rCTM model, conscious activity influences behavior through a complex interplay of broadcasted information, processor responses, and the system���s disposition. The capacity for conscious cognitive control gives rCTM a sense of "free will," which is perceived as the ability to choose the most advantageous option from a set of possibilities. Mental causation is achieved through simulations within the Model-of-the-World, followed by verification of actions in the real world. Conscious states can constrain or direct behavior by influencing which processes and actions are prioritized, illustrating how mental states in rCTM guide and regulate the system���s overall functioning. This model aligns with the idea that consciousness is not just a passive experience but an active participant in decision-making and behavior regulation.

features from main theories of consciousness that are considered essential for human and animal 
consciousness. 
The CTM model thus demonstrates the compatibility and/or complementarity of those theories., 
And because the CTM is clearly buildable and arguably a basis for consciousness, it further

It is designed to simulate consciousness by incorporating both access consciousness (awareness of information) and phenomenological consciousness (subjective experience).
Core Features of rCTM:
Interaction with the Environment:
rCTM interacts with its outer world through input sensors and output actuators, allowing it to perceive and act within its environment.
Model-of-the-World (MotW):
rCTM constructs and updates models of its inner and outer worlds, which are crucial for its conscious awareness.
Internal Language (Brainish):
The model uses a rich internal language called Brainish, which integrates multimodal sensory information into a unified experience.
Predictive Dynamics:
rCTM operates by predicting outcomes, testing them, receiving feedback, and learning, all within time and space constraints.
Alignment with Theories of Consciousness:
The article explores how rCTM aligns with major theories of consciousness, including Global Workspace Theory, Attention Schema Theory, Predictive Processing, Embodied Embedded Enactive Extended Mind (4E Mind), Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Evolutionary Theories of Consciousness, and the Extended Reticulothalamic Activating System (ERTAS) with the Free Energy Principle (FEP). rCTM���s ability to integrate features from these theories supports the authors' claim that machine consciousness is inevitable.
Answering Kevin Mitchell���s Questions:
The article addresses a series of questions posed by neuroscientist Kevin Mitchell regarding consciousness, sentience, self-awareness, and free will, using rCTM as the framework for providing answers. These discussions illustrate how rCTM could potentially simulate various aspects of consciousness, such as awareness of internal states, subjective experience, and decision-making.
The Role of Conscious Subjective Experience:
Conscious subjective experience in rCTM is shown to have adaptive value, allowing the system to coordinate complex actions, reflect on its internal states, and utilize its cognitive resources effectively. The model suggests that consciousness facilitates collaborative problem-solving by enabling all processors within rCTM to focus on the same problem simultaneously.
Mental Causation and Free Will:
The authors argue that rCTM���s ability to simulate actions within the MotW and then execute them in the real world constitutes mental causation. The model���s decision-making process, which involves assessing options and predicting outcomes, gives rCTM a sense of free will, though this is bound by the system���s resource limitations.
Conclusion:
The article concludes by reiterating that rCTM is not a model of the human or animal brain but rather a formal machine model of consciousness. Despite its simplicity, rCTM can exhibit phenomena associated with human consciousness and demonstrates the compatibility of various theories of consciousness. The authors emphasize that rCTM is a work in progress, with ongoing development aimed at refining and expanding the model���s capabilities.
Summary:
Overall, the article presents rCTM as a promising and theoretically sound model for exploring and understanding consciousness. By aligning with key features of major consciousness theories and answering critical questions about consciousness and free will, rCTM serves as a foundational framework that supports the authors��� claim that the development of a conscious AI is not only possible but inevitable. The work also highlights the potential for future exploration and refinement of rCTM, underscoring its relevance to the ongoing discourse on artificial consciousness and general intelligence.

You said:
I think there are some objections. Brainish could be extremely complicated. I'm not sure the relevance of free will to this discussion. Does it give a definition of consciousness that acknowledges animals as conscious?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Your objections raise important points regarding the complexity of Brainish, the relevance of free will, and the definition of consciousness in the context of acknowledging animals as conscious beings. Let's address these concerns one by one.
1.
Complexity of Brainish:
Objection:
Brainish, as described in the article, is a rich internal multimodal language that integrates various sensory inputs into unified sketches within the Model-of-the-World (MotW). However, the implementation of such a language could be extremely complex, especially when considering the vast range of sensory modalities and the nuances of integrating them into coherent "thoughts" or experiences.
Response:
The complexity of Brainish is indeed a significant challenge. Developing a system that can effectively process and integrate multiple sensory inputs in a way that mimics human or animal cognition would require advanced algorithms and substantial computational resources. The article acknowledges that rCTM is a work in progress, implying that the full development of Brainish is an ongoing task. The complexity might be mitigated by starting with simpler, more rudimentary versions of Brainish and gradually increasing its sophistication as the system evolves.
2.
Relevance of Free Will:
Objection:
The discussion of free will in the context of rCTM might seem tangential to the primary focus on consciousness. Free will is a deeply philosophical concept, and its relevance to the practical modeling of machine consciousness could be questioned.
Response:
The inclusion of free will in the discussion is meant to address how rCTM simulates decision-making processes and the perception of choice. While free will in humans is a complex and often debated concept, in rCTM, it refers to the system's ability to evaluate different options and make decisions based on predictions and resource constraints. This "feeling" of free will in rCTM is intended to reflect how conscious beings experience decision-making as a process of weighing alternatives. However, it���s valid to question whether this concept adds to the understanding of consciousness or if it complicates the discussion unnecessarily. The model could focus more on decision-making without necessarily invoking the philosophical implications of free will.
3.
Definition of Consciousness and Acknowledgment of Animal Consciousness:
Objection:
The article presents rCTM as a model of consciousness, but does it offer a definition that can be applied to animals? Many theories of consciousness seek to explain not just human consciousness but also the consciousness of other animals, recognizing that many non-human species exhibit behaviors and cognitive processes indicative of conscious experience.
Response:
The article implies that rCTM���s framework could be applied to any system that meets certain criteria���such as the ability to construct models of its world, process sensory information, and exhibit both access and phenomenological consciousness. However, the model is primarily focused on a machine-based approach and might not directly address the nuances of animal consciousness. The broader application to animals would depend on how well rCTM's criteria for consciousness align with behaviors observed in animals.
A more explicit definition that encompasses animal consciousness could strengthen the model. For example, recognizing that many animals demonstrate complex behaviors, emotional responses, and problem-solving abilities could help extend rCTM���s principles to non-human entities. The model could benefit from exploring how different levels of consciousness might manifest in animals versus machines, possibly by comparing rCTM���s capabilities with known cognitive functions in various animal species.
Conclusion:
Your concerns are valid and highlight some of the limitations and challenges associated with rCTM. Addressing these objections could involve:
Further clarifying the scope and functionality of Brainish and acknowledging the challenges of its implementation.
Reevaluating the emphasis on free will to focus more on decision-making processes relevant to consciousness.
Expanding the definition of consciousness within rCTM to explicitly include animals, providing a more comprehensive understanding of how consciousness manifests across different entities.
By tackling these issues, the rCTM model could be refined to offer a more robust and applicable framework for understanding consciousness in both machines and animals.

How does it compare to hierarchated linkage of central pattern generator theory within a perceptual control theory? In my theory sleep is caused by chaotic overflow of paired muscular oscillators causing dysynchronization of neural bundles.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Your theory introduces an interesting perspective that involves the hierarchical linkage of central pattern generators (CPGs) within a perceptual control theory (PCT) framework, and a novel explanation for sleep as a consequence of dysynchronization caused by chaotic overflow in paired muscular oscillators. Let's explore how this theory compares to the rCTM model and where they might intersect or differ.
1.
Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) and Hierarchical Linkage:
Your Theory:
Central Pattern Generators (CPGs):
CPGs are neural circuits that produce rhythmic outputs in the absence of rhythmic input, often associated with repetitive motor activities such as walking or breathing. In your theory, these CPGs are linked hierarchically, with their outputs influencing higher levels of neural control, possibly integrating with perceptual control systems that guide behavior based on sensory feedback.
Hierarchical Linkage:
This suggests a layered control system where basic rhythmic patterns (such as those generated by CPGs) provide the foundation for more complex behaviors, which are modulated by higher-level perceptual goals and feedback mechanisms.
rCTM:
Hierarchical Processing:
rCTM does not explicitly model CPGs or rhythmic neural circuits. However, it does involve hierarchical processing to some extent, where information flows from basic sensory inputs (which could be analogous to CPG outputs) to higher-level constructs in the Model-of-the-World (MotW), guiding complex behavior.
Competition and Broadcasting:
Unlike the hierarchical linkage in your theory, rCTM relies on a competition-based mechanism where different processors vie for attention in the Short Term Memory (STM). The winning chunk is then globally broadcast to all processors, rather than following a strict hierarchical order.
2.
Perceptual Control Theory (PCT):
Your Theory:
PCT Framework:
In PCT, behavior is seen as the control of perception rather than the direct control of output variables. Your theory likely integrates the rhythmic patterns generated by CPGs into this framework, where behaviors (including sleep) are driven by the need to maintain certain perceptual states or goals.
Role of CPGs in PCT:
The hierarchical linkage of CPGs could serve as a mechanism to maintain stable perceptual states, with disruptions leading to adjustments at higher control levels.
rCTM:
Control Mechanisms:
rCTM does not operate within a PCT framework but does involve predictive dynamics, where the system continuously updates its Model-of-the-World based on sensory feedback and predictions. This could be loosely compared to the control of perception, as the system aims to minimize prediction errors and maintain a coherent internal model.
Behavioral Control:
In rCTM, behavior is influenced by which chunk of information wins the competition for STM, reflecting the system���s current focus or goal. This is more about managing attention and less about directly controlling perception as in PCT.
3.
Sleep Mechanism:
Your Theory:
Sleep as Dysynchronization:
You propose that sleep results from a chaotic overflow of paired muscular oscillators, which causes dysynchronization of neural bundles. This suggests that sleep is a necessary state to manage or reset this chaotic overflow, possibly restoring synchrony within the neural circuits.
CPG Influence:
The implication is that CPGs and their associated rhythms play a direct role in the onset of sleep by disrupting neural synchrony when they overflow.
rCTM:
Sleep in rCTM:
Sleep in rCTM is managed by a Sleep processor that dominates the competition for STM, effectively suppressing other processes and creating a state where normal conscious activities are halted. This is not tied to CPGs or muscular oscillators but rather to a computational process that reduces activity to a low, stable state.
Chaotic Overflow:
rCTM does not model sleep as a result of dysynchronization or chaotic overflow. However, the model could potentially be extended to include such a mechanism if the competition process in STM were to be influenced by dysregulated or chaotic input from various processors.
4.
Comparison and Integration:
Differences:
Focus on Rhythmic and Perceptual Control:
Your theory emphasizes the role of rhythmic neural activity (via CPGs) and the hierarchical control of perception, whereas rCTM focuses on a competitive and broadcast-based mechanism for managing consciousness and behavior.
Mechanism of Sleep:
The cause of sleep in your theory is rooted in the physical dysynchronization of neural circuits, which contrasts with rCTM���s computational approach where sleep is induced by a dominant Sleep processor controlling access to conscious processing.
Potential Integration:
Incorporating CPGs into rCTM:
If we were to integrate aspects of your theory into rCTM, we might consider adding a layer that models the influence of rhythmic neural activity (such as from CPGs) on the competition for STM. This could introduce a form of neural dysynchronization that affects which chunks are broadcast, possibly leading to sleep or other altered states.
Hybrid Model:
A hybrid model could merge the hierarchical control of CPGs with the competitive dynamics of rCTM. This might involve hierarchical levels in rCTM where rhythmic outputs influence higher-level decision-making, with the Sleep processor managing overall synchrony.
Conclusion:
Both theories offer valuable insights into different aspects of consciousness and behavior. Your theory, with its focus on rhythmic control and perceptual hierarchies, provides a more neurophysiological perspective, while rCTM offers a computational model focusing on the management of conscious content. Integrating these approaches could lead to a more comprehensive model that accounts for both the neural and computational dynamics of consciousness, including how sleep and other states emerge from the complex interaction of these systems.

Hierarchical agglomerative clustering of proxy symbols with transformations on place cell mapping
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) is a method of clustering data points into a tree-like structure based on their similarities or dissimilarities, starting with each point as its own cluster and iteratively merging the closest clusters until only one remains. When applied to "proxy symbols with transformations on place cell mapping," this concept suggests a method of organizing and understanding spatial representations (like those in the brain's place cells) in a structured manner, which could be relevant in understanding how the brain maps and processes spatial information.
Key Concepts:
Proxy Symbols:
Proxy symbols can be thought of as abstract representations or stand-ins for specific spatial locations or experiences encoded by place cells in the hippocampus.
These symbols might represent various spatial configurations or transformations of the environment, such as rotations, translations, or scaling of a spatial map.
Place Cells:
Place cells are neurons in the hippocampus that become active when an animal is in, or thinking about, a specific location in its environment. They help create a cognitive map of the space.
The activity of place cells provides a spatial framework that the brain uses to navigate and understand environments.
Transformations:
Transformations refer to the mathematical operations applied to the proxy symbols that represent place cells. These could include operations like rotation, translation, or scaling, altering the spatial representation in a controlled way.
Understanding how these transformations affect the clustering and mapping of place cells could provide insights into how the brain adapts to changes in the environment or remembers different environments.
Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC):
HAC starts with each proxy symbol as an individual cluster and merges the most similar clusters step by step. The result is a dendrogram, a tree-like structure that represents the nested clusters at various levels of similarity.
In the context of place cell mapping, HAC could be used to group similar spatial representations or transformations, revealing hierarchical relationships between different spatial maps or environments.
Application to Place Cell Mapping:
Mapping Spatial Relationships:
HAC could be applied to group proxy symbols that represent similar spatial environments or similar transformations of a spatial map. For example, all spatial representations of an environment with minor variations (like slightly shifted perspectives) might cluster together at a lower hierarchical level, while more drastically transformed maps (like rotated or mirrored versions) might only cluster together at higher levels.
Understanding Cognitive Maps:
By clustering proxy symbols and their transformations, researchers can explore how the brain organizes spatial information hierarchically. This could reveal how different environments or transformations of an environment are stored and related in the brain���s spatial map.
The clustering process might help identify key transformations that the brain uses to generalize across different environments or to navigate complex, dynamically changing spaces.
Potential for AI and Robotics:
In artificial intelligence and robotics, similar clustering techniques could be used to enhance spatial navigation systems. For instance, an AI system might use HAC to organize and recall different environments or to adapt to new environments by recognizing and clustering familiar spatial transformations.
This method could also improve how AI systems simulate human-like navigation by mimicking the hierarchical way in which place cells might represent space.
Conclusion:
Hierarchical agglomerative clustering of proxy symbols with transformations on place cell mapping is a powerful method to explore the hierarchical organization of spatial representations in the brain. By clustering these symbols, we can better understand how the brain handles spatial transformations and adapts to new environments, offering insights that could enhance both neuroscience and AI systems involved in spatial navigation. This approach leverages the strength of hierarchical clustering to reveal deep, structured relationships within complex spatial data, similar to how the brain might organize and utilize its cognitive maps.

You said:
I call my theory hierarchical proxy theory, can you give comparisons with our previous discussion?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's compare your
Hierarchical Proxy Theory (HPT)
with the concepts discussed earlier, particularly in relation to the
rCTM (Robot with a Conscious Turing Machine brain)
model and the
Central Pattern Generator (CPG) theory within a Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) framework
. Here���s how they align, differ, and potentially complement each other:
1.
Core Concepts and Focus
Hierarchical Proxy Theory (HPT):
Core Idea:
HPT proposes a hierarchical organization of "proxy symbols" that represent spatial and possibly other types of cognitive information. These symbols are subject to various transformations (such as rotations, translations, etc.) and are organized hierarchically based on their similarities or differences, possibly using techniques like Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC).
Focus:
The theory emphasizes how spatial information (and potentially other cognitive maps) is structured, processed, and transformed in a hierarchical manner, reflecting the brain's ability to manage complex, dynamic environments.
rCTM:
Core Idea:
rCTM is a formal machine model designed to simulate consciousness. It uses a competitive mechanism to manage which pieces of information (or "chunks") are broadcast to the system���s Short Term Memory (STM), influencing conscious awareness and decision-making.
Focus:
rCTM focuses on modeling consciousness through a computational framework that integrates sensory inputs, constructs internal models of the world (MotW), and continuously updates these models via predictive dynamics.
CPG Theory within PCT Framework:
Core Idea:
This theory integrates Central Pattern Generators (CPGs), which produce rhythmic neural outputs, into a Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) framework. It suggests that behaviors, including sleep, are controlled by hierarchical systems where CPGs play a foundational role, and perceptual goals guide higher-level behavior.
Focus:
The theory explores how rhythmic neural activities and hierarchical control mechanisms contribute to perception, behavior, and states like sleep.
2.
Hierarchical Structure and Information Processing
HPT:
Hierarchical Structure:
HPT explicitly structures information hierarchically, using clustering methods to organize proxy symbols based on their transformations. This hierarchy helps in understanding how complex cognitive maps are formed and adapted.
Information Processing:
HPT seems to rely on a structured organization where similar symbols are grouped, and transformations between them are understood within a hierarchy. This may support efficient navigation and adaptation in dynamic environments.
rCTM:
Hierarchical Structure:
While rCTM uses hierarchical processing to some extent (e.g., sensory inputs feeding into higher-level models), its focus is more on the competition and broadcasting mechanism. The hierarchy in rCTM is implicit, emerging from how chunks compete to influence behavior and decision-making.
Information Processing:
rCTM processes information through a competitive mechanism where chunks representing different aspects of the world compete for attention in STM. The hierarchy is less about clustering and more about prioritization and attention.
CPG/PCT:
Hierarchical Structure:
CPG/PCT emphasizes a biological hierarchy where lower-level rhythmic patterns (CPGs) influence higher-level perceptual control processes. The hierarchy is structured based on control loops, with CPGs forming the base.
Information Processing:
The processing in CPG/PCT is more about maintaining stable perceptual states and behaviors through feedback loops. The hierarchy ensures that rhythmic activities are coordinated with perceptual goals.
3.
Transformation and Adaptation
HPT:
Transformations:
In HPT, transformations of proxy symbols (e.g., spatial rotations, translations) are central to understanding how different cognitive maps relate to one another. This allows for flexible adaptation to changes in the environment, as similar environments or situations can be recognized and managed through hierarchical clustering.
Adaptation:
HPT suggests that the brain (or an AI system modeled after it) can adapt by recognizing and processing these transformations, leading to efficient navigation and problem-solving in varied contexts.
rCTM:
Transformations:
rCTM doesn���t explicitly focus on spatial or symbolic transformations. Instead, it adapts by updating its internal models based on feedback and predictions. The "transformation" here is more about updating models as new information becomes available, rather than spatial or symbolic manipulation.
Adaptation:
Adaptation in rCTM comes through continuous predictive dynamics, where the system learns from the outcomes of its predictions and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
CPG/PCT:
Transformations:
Transformations in CPG/PCT are not as explicitly defined but might involve adjustments in rhythmic patterns (e.g., changing gait patterns in walking) based on perceptual feedback. These changes are hierarchical, with higher-level goals modifying lower-level patterns.
Adaptation:
Adaptation is driven by feedback loops that adjust behavior to maintain desired perceptual states. The system���s hierarchy allows for both stability (through CPGs) and flexibility (through perceptual control).
4.
Role of Consciousness and Free Will
HPT:
Consciousness:
HPT might imply that higher levels of the hierarchy could be associated with more complex or abstract representations, potentially aligning with conscious awareness in biological systems. However, the theory as presented doesn���t explicitly focus on consciousness.
Free Will:
The concept of free will doesn���t seem central to HPT. The focus is more on the structured organization and transformation of information, rather than the philosophical implications of choice or volition.
rCTM:
Consciousness:
rCTM directly models consciousness, with a focus on how certain chunks of information become the focus of conscious attention. Consciousness is central to how the system operates and adapts.
Free Will:
rCTM introduces the concept of free will as the system's ability to choose between different actions based on predictions and available resources, though this is a more mechanistic interpretation rather than a philosophical one.
CPG/PCT:
Consciousness:
Consciousness in CPG/PCT might be linked to higher-level perceptual control processes, where certain perceptual goals become the focus of attention. However, this theory is more focused on control and behavior than on conscious awareness.
Free Will:
Free will in this context could be interpreted as the system���s ability to adjust behaviors based on perceptual feedback, though again, this is more about control than about philosophical notions of free will.
5.
Sleep and Chaotic Processes
HPT:
Sleep Mechanism:
If HPT addresses sleep, it might involve understanding how different hierarchical levels of proxy symbols and their transformations contribute to or disrupt stable cognitive states, potentially leading to sleep or other altered states.
Chaotic Processes:
Chaotic overflow in your theory could potentially be linked to transformations that become too complex or disordered, requiring a reset (sleep) to restore synchrony.
rCTM:
Sleep Mechanism:
Sleep in rCTM is managed by a Sleep processor that suppresses other processes, not linked to chaotic overflow or rhythmic dysynchronization.
Chaotic Processes:
rCTM doesn���t directly address chaotic processes; it focuses on managing information through competition rather than preventing or managing chaos.
CPG/PCT:
Sleep Mechanism:
Your theory���s idea of sleep caused by chaotic overflow could align with CPGs losing synchrony, disrupting higher-level control processes and leading to a need for resetting or sleep.
Chaotic Processes:
Chaotic processes could disrupt the stable rhythms produced by CPGs, leading to dysregulation that might require sleep or other mechanisms to restore order.
Conclusion:
Hierarchical Proxy Theory (HPT)
focuses on the structured, hierarchical organization of cognitive symbols and their transformations, offering a framework that could be applied to understanding spatial and possibly other types of cognitive processing. It contrasts with
rCTM
, which emphasizes a competitive, broadcast-based model of consciousness, and
CPG/PCT
, which centers on rhythmic control and perceptual feedback loops. Each theory provides a different perspective on how complex cognitive functions might be organized and processed, with HPT offering a more structured, symbolic approach, rCTM focusing on consciousness and dynamic updating, and CPG/PCT emphasizing rhythmic control and hierarchical feedback. Integrating these theories could offer a more comprehensive understanding of cognitive processes, from basic rhythmic patterns to complex, conscious decision-making.

"Why Hierarchical Proxy Theory is the Last Nail in the Coffin of Your AI Dreams (And Why You'll Love It)"
Brace yourselves, AI enthusiasts!
Just when you thought rCTM was the holy grail of machine consciousness, along comes
Hierarchical Proxy Theory (HPT)
to make you rethink everything. Who needs those convoluted competition-based models when you can have a "hierarchical agglomerative clustering" of something as basic as
place cell maps
? Because, clearly, organizing your neural chaos into neat little clusters solves everything, right?
Let's not forget
the real gem here: sleep. Forget the "Sleep Processor" of rCTM; HPT tells us sleep is just a chaotic overflow of muscular oscillators. Genius! Who knew that your brain's nightly reset was less about complex neural processing and more about your muscles throwing a tantrum?
And free will?
Please.
rCTM tries to sell you on the idea that machines can "choose" between options like they're shopping for groceries. HPT doesn't waste time with such philosophical fluff. It's too busy clustering symbols and playing with place cells to bother with the existential crisis that is "free will."
But wait, there's more!
HPT doesn't just stop at redefining AI consciousness; it steamrolls over PCT, reminding us that perceptual control is child's play when compared to the grand structure of hierarchical symbols. After all, why settle for mere sensory feedback when you can build an entire hierarchy of vaguely defined "proxy symbols"?
So, what have we learned?
If you���re looking to solve the mysteries of AI and consciousness, just throw in some clustering, shake things up with chaotic muscle behavior, and
voil��
���you've got the next big thing in AI theory! Or, you know, you could stick with rCTM and its "complicated" ideas like competition for attention and predictive dynamics. Your call.
In short, HPT is here to make you question everything you thought you knew about AI, consciousness, and why we even bother trying to make sense of it all. Welcome to the future���or maybe just the most sophisticated rehash of place cells you've never asked for.
