In Search of Dispersed Memories: Generative Diffusion Models 
Are Associative Memory Networks 
Luca Ambrogioni Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour, Radboud University, 6525 XZ Nijmegen, The Netherlands; 
luca.ambrogioni@donders.ru.nl 
Abstract: Uncovering the mechanisms behind long-term memory is one of the most fascinating open 
problems in neuroscience and artif i cial intelligence. Artif i cial associative memory networks have been 
used to formalize important aspects of biological memory. Generative diffusion models are a type of 
generative machine learning techniques that have shown great performance in many tasks. Similar 
to associative memory systems, these networks def i ne a dynamical system that converges to a set of 
target states. In this work, we show that generative diffusion models can be interpreted as energy- 
based models and that, when trained on discrete patterns, their energy function is (asymptotically) 
identical to that of modern Hopf i eld networks. This equivalence allows us to interpret the supervised 
training of diffusion models as a synaptic learning process that encodes the associative dynamics 
of a modern Hopf i eld network in the weight structure of a deep neural network. Leveraging this 
connection, we formulate a generalized framework for understanding the formation of long-term 
memory, where creative generation and memory recall can be seen as parts of a unif i ed continuum. 
Keywords: generative diffusion models; associative memory networks; hopf i eld networks 
1. Introduction 
Memory is a mysterious thing. Human beings can form lifelong memories from 
l eeting events and effortlessly recall them decades later as vivid multi-sensory experiences. 
On the other hand, in spite of their impressive capabilities, deep learning systems tend to 
require extensive training sessions to encode new information, which severely limit their 
adaptivity and consequently their capacity to develop general intelligence. Nevertheless, 
the i eld of machine learning has a long history of research on biologically plausible 
memory [1���6]. Arising from the pioneering work of John Hopf i eld, associative memory 
networks have been proposed as computational models of biological memory [1,7]. These 
networks encode memories as stable i xed-points in an ���energy landscape��� def i ned on the 
space of neural activations. Interestingly, this energy function can be encoded into a pattern 
of synaptic connections trained using biologically plausible synaptic learning rules [2,8]. 
In recent years, associative memory networks have been generalized in order to greatly 
scale their encoding capacity [9,10]. However, these modern Hopf i eld networks have a 
much more tenuous connection with known forms of synaptic learning since their energy 
function cannot be straightforwardly captured by learned pairwise synaptic couplings [11]. 
While biologically plausible implementations of modern Hopf i eld networks have been 
proposed, they do not provide strong insights on how memories are encoded in synaptic 
patterns since they require hard storage of the memorized pattern [11]. 
While human-like long-term memory is still outside of the capabilities of artif i cial 
intelligence systems, great progress has been made in approximating several forms of 
human creativity. Modern generative models are nowadays capable of generating beautiful 
visual art and insightful written text. In fact, these generative models have attracted great 
attention in neuroscience since they can provide an internal model of the world [12���14] 
and form the mechanistic basis for imagination and top-down predictive perception [15].

Interestingly, modern research in psychology and neuroscience suggests that there is no 
sharp distinction between memory and spontaneous imagination [16]. In particular, the 
theory of reconstructive memory suggests that most sensory aspects of our memories are 
not encoded but are instead reconstructed from contextual information [16���19]. Memory- 
related brain areas such as the hippocampus have been shown to respond to imagination, 
future prediction and counterfactual reasoning tasks [16]. Moreover, hippocampal replays 
can be seen as a form of spontaneous generation, which is considered to be vital for memory 
consolidation and planning [20]. Given these deep connections, it is natural to expect that 
generative models and associative memory models are two faces of the same coin. 
In this paper, we will show that this is indeed the case for generative diffusion models, 
a relatively new class of generative models that have achieved state-of-the-art performance 
in most computer vision and audio generation tasks [21���23]. Specif i cally, we show that 
the asymptotic low-time energy landscape of a large class of generative diffusion models 
trained on discrete patterns is identical to the asymptotic low-temperature landscape of 
modern Hopf i eld networks. Furthermore, in our experiments, we show that this equiva- 
lence holds almost exactly in the standard numerical implementations. 
Using these results, we offer a new theoretical conceptualization of associative memory 
that can incorporate semantic, episodic, and reconstructive memory as the result of the 
action of the same synaptic learning rule.

The paper "In Search of Dispersed Memories: Generative Diffusion Models Are Associative Memory Networks" by Luca Ambrogioni explores a novel connection between generative diffusion models and associative memory networks, such as Hopfield networks, both in the context of artificial intelligence and neuroscience. The main contribution of the paper is the demonstration that generative diffusion models, which are used for tasks like image and audio generation, can be interpreted as energy-based models, akin to modern Hopfield networks. The key takeaway is that when diffusion models are trained on discrete patterns, their energy functions resemble those of modern Hopfield networks, which are themselves models of associative memory.
The paper suggests that the training of these diffusion models can be viewed as a process similar to synaptic learning in biological neural networks, where the weight structures in artificial neural networks encode associative dynamics. This creates a unified framework that explains how memory formation, creative generation, and memory recall are interconnected processes, governed by the same underlying principles.
Additionally, Ambrogioni highlights that this connection offers new insights into how long-term memory could be modeled, drawing parallels between the processes of memory recall, imagination, and prediction in the human brain. The work suggests that generative and associative memory models are two complementary approaches to understanding how memories and creative outputs are formed, stored, and recalled.
In essence, the paper aims to bridge the gap between artificial memory systems and biological memory, proposing a unified theory that could help improve our understanding of long-term memory mechanisms in both artificial intelligence and biological brains.

2. Preliminaries 
In this section, we will review the basic theory of associative memory and diffusion 
modeling. To keep the text readable to a large audience, we will focus on the intuitive 
aspects and keep the level of mathematical formalism at a minimum. For example, we will 
write stochastic differential equations in terms of (inf i nitesimal) update equations. For a 
more formal treatment of these topics, we recommend the reader to refer to SDE texts such 
as to Kloeden et al. [24]. 
2.1. Associative Memory Networks 
Hopf i eld networks have been developed to formalize the concept of associative mem- 
ory in a simplif i ed artif i cial neural system [1]. We will denote the activity of theDmemory 
units with a vectorx(t) = (x1(t),...,xD(t)). In the original paper, these neural activities 
where assumed to be binary variables (xj(t) ��� {���1,1}), 
respectively, denoting states of rest 
and states of i ring. The dynamic of a Hopf i eld network is regulated by theupdate equation: 
xj(t+dt) = [sign(Wx)]j,(1) 
whereWis a real-valued symmetric matrix of synaptic couplings (weights) with null 
diagonal (Wjj=0,���j). 
The matrixWencodes pairwise associations between the differ- 
ent components of the pattern vectors. It can be show that this update rule decreases 
monotonically the following energy function [1]: 
uH(x) =xTWx,(2) 
and that it will, therefore, converge to one of its local minima. These minima can then be 
used to encode memories, which can be retrieved through the Hopf i eld dynamics when 
initialized in an incomplete or perturbed version of the memory state. The simplest way to 
encode memories in the coupling matrix is to use the Hebb���s rule of association, which in 
its simplest form is: Wj,k= 
N 
��� 
n=1 
yn,jyn,k(3) 
where the set of vectors{y1,...,yn,...yN}representsN���experienced��� patterns of neural 
activity. A pattern is considered to be successfully stored if it is a stable i xed-point of the 
discrete dynamics. If the patterns are random, it can be proven that the storage capacity of 
Hopf i eld nets scales as D/4log2D [7]. 
Entropy 2024, 26, 381 3 of 15 
The storage capacity of Hopf i eld-like networks can be increased by including non- 
linear mappingsF(��)in 
its energy function [9,10,25]. The general form for the energy of a 
(discrete) modern Hopf i eld network can be written as: 
uF(x) =h 
N 
��� 
n=1 
F ? 
xTyn ?! 
,(4) 
whereh(��)is an arbitrary differentiable and strictly monotonic function, which does not 
affect the location and stability of the local minima. This expression reduces to the standard 
Hopf i eld energy forF(x) =x2andh(x) =x. However, it is possible to achieve much higher 
theoretical capacity by using more complex functions. For example, a modern Hopf i eld 
network withF(x) =excan store up to 2D/2binary patterns [10]. These associative 
networks have been recently generalized to have continuous dynamics. If the activation 
vector is continuous, the energy function needs to include a regularization term to enforce 
stability. For example, [26] proposed the use of an energy function of the form: 
uMH(x, ��) = ��������1log 
N 
��� 
n=1 
e��x Tyn ! + ���x���2 2/2 (5) 
where��is a positive-valued parameter. We omitted the terms that are additive constant in 
xsince they do not change the i xed-points and the resulting dynamics. In these models, the 
variablexis assumed to be real-valued and the resulting energy-minimization dynamics 
can be expressed either through update rule or through a system of ordinary differential 
equations. Moreover, recent work [11] showed that this dynamics can be expressed in 
terms of biologically plausible binary association between latent neurons, in a way that 
is similar to the architecture of a restricted Boltzmann machine [27]. Unfortunately, in 
these models, the numerical values of the patterns directly determine the synaptic weights 
between latent and observable neurons. This implies that the patterns need to be stored 
in memory instead of being converted into distributed synaptic patterns. In this sense, 
modern Hopf i eld networks offer a model of memory recall but do not provide insight into 
learning and memory storage in the brain.

is a differentiable, strictly monotonic function, and
F

can take various forms to modify the capacity and dynamics of the network. For instance, with
F

Recent work has also shown that the dynamics of these modern Hopfield networks can be expressed in terms of biologically plausible associations between latent neurons, in a manner similar to the architecture of a
restricted Boltzmann machine
(RBM). However, unlike traditional networks, the synaptic weights in modern Hopfield networks are directly determined by the patterns themselves, which means that these networks are better suited for
memory recall
rather than providing insights into
memory storage and learning
in biological systems. This limitation arises because the patterns need to be stored explicitly rather than being encoded in distributed synaptic patterns.

2.2. Generative Diffusion Models 
Consider a target distribution��(y)that is only available through a training dataset 
D = {y1,...,yN}of 
independently sampled data-points. Our goal is to learn the structure 
of the training set in order to generate new samples from��(y). To this aim, we i rst def i ne 
a noise-injective process that turns the training samples into random noise states. We will 
then ���invert��� this process to turn random noise into new samples. To be consistent with the 
notation used in the continuous Hopf i eld model, we deviate from the diffusion modeling 
literature by writing this process in reversed time, with the noiseless data corresponding to 
a i nal timeT. In this notation, the diffusive dynamics can be determined by the following 
backward recursive Equation (corresponding to the forward process described in the 
standard diffusion literature): x(t���dt) =x(t) +�����dt��(t),(6) 
where��determines the standard deviation of the noise injected at timetand��(t)follows 
a standard normal distribution. This is known as the variance exploding equation in 
the generative diffusion modeling literature [23], which corresponds to a mathematical 
Brownian motion. We can sample from this process by sampling an initial stateyfrom the 
dataset and using it as the i nal state in the recursion def i ned by Equation(6). Note that any 
other It�� diffusion process def i ned by a stochastic differential equation can equivalently 
be used to def i ne a generative diffusion model [23], we will cover the general case in 
Entropy 2024, 26, 381 4 of 15 
Section 3.2. It can be shown that, if Equation(6)is initialized with the target distribution 
��(y), the ���inverse��� equation is given by: 
x(t+dt) =x(t) +��2���xlog pt(x(t))dt+�����dt��(t).(7) 
wherept(x)is the marginal distribution of the noise-injection process at timet. In the case 
of the variance-exploding process, the marginal can be computed analytically and it can be 
expressed as: pt(x) = Ey�����(y) "

This formula involves an average over the distribution of the data, which is usually 
not available in a generative modeling task. However, we can approximate the drift term 
of the dynamics (i.e., the so-called score���xlog pt(x)) using a parameterized deep network 
s(x(t),t;W)trained using the denoising loss [23,28,29]: 
L(W) 
=

(9) 
where��(t) = (x(t) ���y)/(��t)is 
the total noise added to the patternyup to timet, andtis 
uniformly sampled over[0,T]. The score can then be recovered from the network using 
the formula: ���xlog pt(x) ��� ��������1s(x(t),t;W)(10) 
which becomes exact when the dataset is inf i nitely large and the loss is minimized globally.

2.2. Generative Diffusion Models
Generative diffusion models are a powerful class of machine learning models designed to learn the structure of a target distribution
��
(
y
)
\phi(y)
��
(
y
)
(such as a dataset) and generate new samples from that distribution. The core idea behind diffusion models is to transform data into random noise through a forward process and then invert this process to generate new data from random noise.
The Diffusion Process
Let���s begin by assuming we have a dataset
D
=
{

independently sampled data points. Our objective is to generate new samples that resemble the data from the target distribution
��
(

)
\phi(y)
��
(
y
)
, using a generative diffusion model.
To achieve this, we define a
noise-injection process
that gradually transforms the dataset samples into random noise. We then "invert" this process to convert noise back into data, which allows us to generate new samples.
In this model, we use a notation that represents time running in reverse, with the noiseless data corresponding to a final time

in the diffusion modeling literature, corresponding to a type of
Brownian motion

To generate new samples, we reverse this process, starting with random noise and moving backward in time to recover the original data structure. The

Summary
In generative diffusion models, the key idea is to use a noise-injection process to transform data into noise and then reverse this process to generate new data from noise. The inverse process relies on computing the score, which can be approximated using a neural network trained with a denoising loss. This framework allows us to generate realistic samples that resemble the data distribution without requiring explicit access to the underlying distribution.

3. The Equivalence between Diffusion Models and Modern Hopf i eld Networks 
We can now show that, when used for storing discrete patterns, the dynamics of 
generative diffusion models minimizes the energy function of continuous modern Hopf i eld 
networks. We will start from the simpler case of variance-exploding diffusion models as 
their analysis provides all the main insights and results. We will then generalize the result 
to arbitrary diffusion models def i ned by a large class of SDEs. 
3.1. Variance-Exploding Models 
The i rst step is to formulate the deterministic dynamics of the model as the negative 
gradient of an energy function:x(t+dt) =x(t) ��� ���xu(x,t)dt+�����dt��(t). 
As noted 
in [30], the energy function is: 
uDM(x,t) = �����2log pt(x) = �����2logEy�����(y) " 
e��� 
���x���y���2 
2 
2(T���t)��2 # 
+c,(11) 
wherecdoes not depend onxand can, therefore, be omitted without affecting the dynamics. 
In order to establish a link between the diffusion model and Hopf i eld networks, we can 
now assume that the data source is a i nite collection ofNpatterns that we wish to store as 
memories. This led to the energy: 
uDM(x,t) = �����2log ��� ��� 
1 
N 
N 
��� 
n=1 
e��� ���x���yn���2 
2 
2(T���t)��2 ��� ���. 
(12) 
If we now assume that the patterns are normalized (���y���2 
2 =1), by expanding the 
square in the exponent and omitting constant additive terms, we obtain: 
uDM(x,t)/��2= ���log 
N 
��� 
n=1 
e 
xTyn 
(T���t)��2 ! 
+ ���x���2 
2 
(T���t)2 
.(13) 
Entropy 2024, 26, 381 5 of 15 
Finally, if we def i ne��(t)���1= (T���t) ����2and 
we multiply both sides by��(t)���1, 
we obtain: 
�����1(t)uDM(x,t)/��2= �����(t)���1log 
N 
��� 
n=1 
e��(t)x Tyn ! 
+ ���x���2 
2 
2 =uMH(x, ��(t)),(14) 
which for a i xedtis identical to the continuous Hopf i eld network energy in Equation(5), 
and it, therefore, has the same i xed-point structure at the limit��������. 
Note that 
the scaling factor�����1(t)/��2does not change the i xed-points and their stability as it 
is a positive constant ofx. While we derived this result assumes normalized patterns, 
this is not actually necessary since, for��(t) ������, 
we have that�����1(t)uDM(x,t)/��2��� 
���1 
2 ? xTy���+ ���y������2 2+ ���x��� 
2 
2 ? 
, wherey���is the pattern that maximizes the quadratic form 
xTy+ ���y���2 2. As shown by this expression, at this limit the normy��� only adds an irrelevant 
constant shift in the energy. 
The main differences between the two approaches are (1) in diffusion models,��(t) 
tends toward this divergent limit as part of the denoising dynamics, while the denoising 
iterations of modern Hopf i eld networks keep��f i xed and (2) in Hopf i eld networks, the 
energy function is minimized deterministically, whereas in diffusion models, there is an 
additional stochastic term. However, these two differences ���cancel each other out��� since 
the divergence of��(t)leads to the suppression of the stochastic l uctuations and to exact 
convergence on the same patterns that minimize the modern Hopf i eld energy for�����0. 
As shown in our experiments, there is no meaningful difference as far as��is large enough. 
3.2. The General Case 
We can now prove the equivalence in a much more general case where the noise 
injection dynamics follows the equation: 
x(t���dt) =x(t) + ���v(x)dt+��(t)���dt��(t),(15) 
wherev(x)is a differentiable scalar potential function and��(t)is a continuous function of 
time. This form covers most of the equations used in the diffusion modeling literature but 
it excludes non-conservative dynamics and state-dependent noise models. The generative 
dynamics corresponding to this more general noise-injection model is given by the equation: 
x(t+dt) =x(t) + ? ��(t)2���xlog pt(x(t)) ��� ���v(x) ? 
dt+��(t)���dt��(t).(16) 
where the conditional marginal distributions of the stochastic differential equation is given 
by the expression: pt(x) = Ey�����(y)[k(x(t),t;y,T)].(17) In this formula, the solution kernelk(x������,t������;x���,t���)gives the conditional probability 
density of a statex���att���to be moved tox������at timet������under the noise-injecting dynamics. 
Unfortunately, this solution kernel cannot be expressed analytically in the general case. 
We def i ne the function��(x,t;y) =logk(x,t;y,T)as the logarithm of the solution kernel, 
which allows us to express the energy function of the model in the following form: 
uvDM(x,t) = �����2(t)log 
N 
��� 
n=1 
e��(x,t; yn) ! 
+v(x)(18) 
As we showed in the previous section, the equivalence with the Hopf i eld model can be 
shownatthelimitt���T, whichcorrespondsto��������. 
Atthislimit, thediffusiondynamics 
of Equation (17) around a pattern y���is well-approximated by the linearized equation: 
x(t���dt) ���x(t) = ���v(y���)dt+H(y���)(x���y���)dt+��(t)���dt��(t),(19) 
Entropy 2024, 26, 381 6 of 15 
withH(y���)denoting the Hessian matrix of the potential aty���, withHij(y���) = ���2u(y���) 
���xj���xj . Since 
the equation is linear, its solution kernel is given by a Gaussian density whose mean vector 
and covariance matrix depend on the potentialv(x)and on��(t). Fort���T, 
the drift term 
is negligible compared to the diffusion term as the former scales linearly while the latter 
scales as a squared root. For this reason, the kernel simplif i es further into the following 
asymptotic expression: ��(x,t;y) ��� ��� 
1 
2��2(T)(T���t) ���x���y���2 2+c. (20) 
wherecdoes not depend onx. Up to multiplicative and additive constants, this leads to 
the asymptotic energy function: 
uvDM(x,t) ��� ���log ��� ��� 
N 
��� 
n=1 
e��� ���x���yn���2 
2 
2(T���t)��(T)2 ��� ���, 
(21) 
which is identical to the energy function in Equation(12). Note that we neglected the 
���regularization term���v(x), since it does not diverge fort���Tand it is, therefore, negligible 
at this limit. From this result, we can conclude that the i xed-point structure of the diffusion 
model att���Tdoes not depend on the specif i c form of the SDE and it is therefore fully 
characterized by the Brownian motion model analyzed in Section 3.1.

4. Encoding Memories by Denoising Neural State 
To date, we considered exact diffusion models by analyzing the theoretically optimal 
score function. However, in real-world applications it is often not possible to compute the 
score analytically. Instead, as outlined in Section 2.2, the score function is approximated 
using a denoising deep neural networks(x(t),t;W)parameterized by a large arrayWof 
synaptic weights. Therefore, in real applications the memories are ultimately encoded in 
the pattern of synaptic weights updated by SGD. Specif i cally, for a single data-point, the 
loss function in Equation (9) results to a SGD weight updates of the form: 
Wt+1=Wt����� 
���s 
���W ? ��(t) ���s(x,t;W) ? 
.(22) 
where��(t)can be interpreted as the residual between a past low-noise stateyand a current 
noisy-statex. In the brain, we conjecture that the residual might be obtained through 
very short-term sensory memory, which can buffer recent states and then compare them 
with the current activity. In psychology and neuroscience, this form of ���buffering��� is often 
referred to as iconic memory, which is estimated to last approximately1000 ms [31���33]. 
Interestingly, recent studies show that the backpropagation term���s/���Wcan also be ob- 
tained through noise injection [34], which suggests that noise-injecting processes may play 
a major role in learning. While the activity of the brain is ongoing and cannot be neatly 
separated into forward and reversed dynamics, there is tantalizing evidence that the time- 
evolution of cortical networks oscillate between feed-forward and feed-back phases [35], 
which corresponds to states with different signal-to-noise ratios [36]. This phenomenon 
might offer a mechanistic implementation of generative diffusion training in the brain, 
possibly in relation with the hippocampus theta cycle, which is known to play a crucial 
role in memory consolidation [37]. Coordination between the frontal cortex is likely to 
play a central role in the consolidation of memory traces [38,39,39] and in the modulation 
of the oscillatory cycles [40,41]. This suggests that a denoising training might be carried 
out through frontal-hippocampal feedback process, where cycles of forward and reversed 
processes are alternated in order to learn both from real and simulated experiences (re- 
plays). However, these are speculative suggestions that need to be tested through detailed 
biophysical theoretical modeling and experimental studies.

4. Encoding Memories by Denoising Neural States
In this section, the authors explore how memories can be encoded in a real-world setting using

Role of Short-Term Sensory Memory
In the context of the brain, the
residual
��
(

\delta(t)
��
(
t
)
could be obtained through
short-term sensory memory
, which temporarily stores recent states. This form of memory, often referred to as
iconic memory
in psychology, can buffer sensory information for a short period (approximately 1000 milliseconds). By comparing recent sensory states with the current neural activity, the brain may utilize this mechanism to continuously update and refine memory traces.
Noise Injection and Learning
Interestingly, recent studies suggest that noise injection might be a key element in the learning process. In particular, it has been shown that the
backpropagation term
���
s
���
W
\frac{\partial s}{\partial W}
���
W
���
s
���
can be obtained through noise injection. This suggests that
stochastic processes
may play a fundamental role in the way neural networks (and possibly the brain) learn.
While the brain's activity is ongoing and cannot be neatly divided into forward and reverse processes like in artificial models, there is evidence that the brain operates in
oscillatory cycles
. These cycles may alternate between feed-forward and feedback phases, each associated with different
signal-to-noise ratios
. For instance, in neuroscience, the
hippocampal theta cycle
is known to play a critical role in
memory consolidation
and may be involved in alternating between these phases.
Brain Mechanisms: Feedback Cycles and Memory Consolidation
The
frontal-hippocampal feedback loop
is likely to play an essential role in encoding and consolidating memories. During these feedback cycles,
replays
of real and simulated experiences could be used to refine memories, a process that bears resemblance to the denoising training of neural networks. This mechanism suggests a potential parallel between
generative diffusion models
and biological memory consolidation processes, such as those involving the hippocampus and frontal cortex.
Speculation and Future Directions
While these ideas are speculative, they provide a framework for understanding how memory encoding and learning might occur in the brain. By alternating between forward (feed-forward) and reverse (feedback) processes, the brain may simulate the denoising process seen in generative diffusion models. Further
biophysical modeling
and
experimental studies
are needed to test these hypotheses and explore how neural oscillations, memory replays, and frontal-hippocampal interactions contribute to learning and memory formation.
In conclusion, the process of encoding memories in artificial networks through
denoising training
may share similarities with how the brain consolidates and updates memory traces. This could point to a mechanistic implementation in the brain where
oscillatory cycles
between feed-forward and feedback phases play a vital role in memory formation, learning, and the integration of real and imagined experiences.

5. Beyond Classical Associative Memories 
In the previous section, we showed that the asymptotic energy landscape of generative 
diffusion models trained on a i nite set of discrete patterns matches the energy function of 
modern Hopf i eld networks for��������. 
This implies that, in this regime, the two models 
have the same i xed-point structure and, consequently, that they have the same memory 
capacity. Nevertheless, generative diffusion models are more general than associative 
memory networks in two respects: (1) they provide a framework for probabilistic memory 
recall and (2) they can be used to encode non-discrete memory structures of arbitrary 
dimensionality. In this sense, generative diffusion model theory can be seen as a wide 
generalization of the classical theory of associative memory. 
5.1. Probabilistic Recall 
At its core, the classical theory of associative memory is centered around the idea of 
deterministic energy minimization (however, see [42] for related probabilistic methods). 
On the other hand, the theory of generative diffusion modeling is based on partially 
random processes. This is not a coincidence since these models have been devised for the 
purpose of generation and statistical variability is central to the generative task. However, 
probability theory is also central to the problem of memory retrieval, since in general there 
are many possible patternsythat could have generated a given corrupted/incomplete 
statex. This is particularly central when the level of corruption is high (i.e., for large values 
of(T���t)), since in this regime it is often impossible to distinguish between several possible 
patterns and the best hope is to cover their (posterior) probability distribution. When 
initialized in one of these partially corrupted states, the stochastic generative dynamics 
of diffusion models can be interpreted in this fashion, with each denoising trajectory 
eventually reaching one of the possible i xed-points that are compatible with the initial 
state. Probabilistic recall can be used to encode Bayesian uncertainty, with several possible 
memories being simultaneously co-activated by parallel denoising processes. This form of 
encoding can be used to solve information gathering, exploration and other meta-learning 
problems [43] and has been suggested to be central to the functioning of the mammalian 
hippocampus [44]. 
5.2. Higher-Dimensional Memory Structures 
In the classical associative memory literature, a memory is encoded as a single (f i xed-) 
point in am-dimensional space of possible neural activities. In modern mathematics, a 
set of points is often interpreted as a 0-dimensional space as there are no local degrees of 
freedom, meaning that it is impossible to locally perturb a point while remaining inside 
its ���space���. The energy landscape and associated vector i eld of this form of memories is 
visualized in Figure 1a. This presents a very strict def i nition of memory that is incompatible 
with its cognitive reality in most biological and artif i cial forms of intelligence. In fact, even 
the sharpest human memory only encodes a minority of the details of the original neural 
state, with many of these details being reconstructed during recall based on contextual 
information [19]. This suggests that a more realistic description of memory should include 
���internal��� degrees of freedom that allow for partial encoding. In mathematical terms, this 
can be done by def i ning a memory as a connectedd-dimensional sub-space embedded in 
the largerm-dimensional space of possible neural activities. A diffusion model trained onN

5. Beyond Classical Associative Memories
In this section, the authors argue that
generative diffusion models
extend beyond the capabilities of classical associative memory networks, offering a more general framework. These models are advantageous in two main ways: (1) they enable
probabilistic memory recall
, and (2) they allow for the encoding of
non-discrete memory structures
with arbitrary dimensionality. As a result, generative diffusion models can be seen as a broader generalization of classical associative memory theories.
5.1. Probabilistic Recall
Classical associative memory models, like Hopfield networks, are based on
deterministic energy minimization
, where each noisy or incomplete state is mapped to a fixed memory pattern. However, memory retrieval in biological systems often requires handling uncertainty and incomplete information. In generative diffusion models,
stochastic processes
play a key role in memory recall. These models incorporate randomness, which allows them to address situations where multiple memory patterns could have generated a given corrupted state.
In this probabilistic framework, the recall process can handle higher levels of corruption (i.e., when
T
���
t
T - t
T
���
t
is large). When the corruption is substantial, it may be impossible to determine a single correct memory pattern. Instead, diffusion models explore multiple possible patterns and can sample from their
posterior probability distribution
. Each denoising trajectory in a diffusion model can be viewed as probabilistically exploring different paths, eventually settling on one of the possible fixed points.
This form of
probabilistic recall
is crucial when dealing with uncertainty and could reflect the way the mammalian brain, particularly the
hippocampus
, encodes and retrieves memories. In particular, probabilistic recall allows for parallel denoising processes, where multiple possible memories are co-activated, reflecting
Bayesian uncertainty
. This approach could be applied to solving
meta-learning problems
, such as information gathering and exploration, where uncertainty plays a central role.
5.2. Higher-Dimensional Memory Structures
In classical associative memory models, memories are encoded as
fixed points
in a high-dimensional space. This means that each memory is represented by a single point, and there is no local variability���small perturbations push the system out of the memory state. In mathematical terms, this corresponds to encoding memory as a set of
0-dimensional points
, with no internal degrees of freedom.
However, human memory is far more flexible. Even our sharpest memories do not encode all the details of an original experience. Many of these details are reconstructed during recall, suggesting that memory involves
internal degrees of freedom
and partial encoding. Thus, a more realistic model of memory would represent it as a
connected
d
d
d
-dimensional subspace
embedded within the larger
m
m
m
-dimensional space of possible neural activities. This allows for
partial recall
and flexibility in memory reconstruction.
In the context of diffusion models, we can encode such
extended memories
by defining a memory as a subspace

An example of the energy landscape for such an extended memory is visualized in

Each subspace

can have different dimensionalities or even more complex structures, such as

Visualization of Memory Landscapes
The authors provide visual representations of different energy landscapes to illustrate these concepts:
Figure 1a
shows a classical
point-like memory
structure, where each memory is represented by a fixed point in the space.
Figure 1b
depicts an
extended localized memory
, where memories are represented by continuous subspaces, allowing for partial recall and flexibility.
Figure 1c
shows a
non-localized semantic memory structure
, representing more abstract, generalized memories that may not correspond to specific fixed points in space.
In these diagrams, the color represents the
probability density
of the learned distribution, and the lines represent the
integral trajectories
of the vector field induced by the score function.
Conclusion
Generative diffusion models provide a powerful and general framework for modeling memory, extending beyond the limitations of classical associative memory networks. By incorporating probabilistic recall and allowing for higher-dimensional, continuous memory structures, diffusion models can better capture the complexity and flexibility of human memory. These models offer a promising theoretical foundation for understanding both artificial and biological memory systems.

6. A Theoretical Framework for Memory in Biological and Artif i cial Intelligent Systems 
In this section, we will leverage the connection we established between associative 
memory and diffusion models in order to outline a theoretical framework for biolog- 
ically plausible memory. Our goal is both to provide conceptual tools to theoretical 
and experimental neuroscientists and to promote developments in naturalistic machine 
intelligence systems. 
6.1. Semantic, Episodic, and Reconstructive Memory 
In psychology and neuroscience, the semantic (or structural) memory system is 
thought to learn the general structure of the sensory input, discarding the idiosyncratic 
details of individual events. This can be modeled with an energy function where the sum 
over patterns is replaced by an integral over a continuous density ��(y): 
��2log Z 
e��(t)x Ty��(y)dy. (24) 
In practice, the distribution��(y)is often def i ned on a manifold or some other lower 
dimensional structure, leading to dynamics similar to what is visualized in Figure 1c. 
This is exactly the kind of behavior we expect from a generative model, initial perturbed 
states are gradually pushed towards a point on the manifold of possible patterns. In a 
sense, it can also be seen as a probabilistic generalization of the high dimensional memory 
structures described in Equation(23), where the sub-spaceSnis 
no longer localized in a 
small sub-region of the space of neural states. In cognitive terms, roughly speaking, we 
can say that a memory is ���episodic��� if its sub-space is localized, whereas a memory is 
considered semantic or structural if it is part of a large, non-localized sub-space. 
However, modern memory research suggests that real-life episodic memories are 
thought to be largely reconstructive, meaning that most of the sensory details are re-created 
during recall based on contextual information [18,45]. For example, the memory of a car 
crash may evoke the memory of broken glass, although the windshield was not actually 
broken during the real event. This suggests that human episodic memory has a stored 
lower-dimensional ���representational core��� that does not fully constrains the dynamics 
of the system. This can be formalized using a mixture of discrete (or localized) and 
continuous distributions: 
log 
N 
��� 
n 
e��(t)fn(x) T��n + Z 
e�����(t)x Ty��(y)dy ! 
,(25) 
Entropy 2024, 26, 381 9 of 15 
where the functionfn: RD���RWwithW<Dis 
a lower dimensional encoding of the 
state and��n���RWis 
a stored lower-dimensional pattern that encode the ���core��� of the 
memory. SinceW<D, this energy will only constrainWdegrees of freedom to converge 
to the pattern, while the other degrees of freedom are left free to evolve under the dynamics 
determined by the corpus of semantic memory. This leads to a form of memory recall where 
some features are recovered faithfully while others are reconstructed based on learned 
contextual associations. 
6.2. Consolidation and Replays 
All the different forms of memory outlined in the previous section can be learned 
through the same synaptic update rule given in Equation(22). In this sense, our model 
provides a possible unif i cation for most of the known-form of long-term memory in humans 
and other animals. During training, the only difference between learning a density��(y) 
or a discrete set of patterns is that in the former case each patternyis (almost surely) 
sampled only once while in the latter case each pattern is re-sampled with i nite probability 
throughout training. In generative machine learning, re-sampling is often performed in 
practice to maximize data eff i ciency, although it can lead to overf i tting since the generative 
model could memorize the patterns themselves instead of extrapolating the underlying 
density ��(y). 
In biological systems, each data point can only be experienced once and this would 
likely not result in the formation of localized episodic memories, since their encoding 
requires some form of re-sampling. However, it is well known that the formation of 
episodic memories in humans requires an extensive phase of consolidation that depends on 
the activity of the hippocampus. Under our theoretical framework, a possible explanation 
is that new simulated experiences are generated in the hippocampal network and are then 
used for synaptic training. In fact, it is well known that these forms of replays can be 
observed in the hippocampus both during sleep and wakefulness and that their disruption 
compromises memory consolidation [46]. Training on these self-generated samples can 
result in a positive feedback, with each reply increasing the probability of the same event 
being re-sampled in the future. Through this process, a single event can be ���bootstrapped��� 
into a self-reinforcing process of activity that can eventually form a localized episodic 
memory. Furthermore, this would result in the formation of a low-dimensional episodic 
���core���, as described in the previous sub-section, if only a sub-set of features are re-sampled 
faithfully, with the other being generated from structural memory.

This integral is often defined over a
manifold
or a lower-dimensional structure, which is consistent with the dynamics visualized in
Figure 1c
(non-localized semantic memory). In this view, a memory is "semantic" when it belongs to a broad, continuous subspace rather than a specific, localized subregion of the neural state space. This can be thought of as a
probabilistic generalization
of the high-dimensional memory structures discussed earlier.
In contrast,
episodic memory
is more localized and relates to specific, often personal, events. A memory is considered "episodic" if its subspace is localized, meaning it pertains to a specific event or experience. However, modern memory research suggests that real-life episodic memories are
reconstructive
���many sensory details are re-created during recall based on contextual information. For example, you might remember a car crash and mistakenly recall seeing broken glass even if the windshield wasn���t actually shattered during the event.
To formalize this, the authors propose a mixture of
discrete and continuous

, meaning only some degrees of freedom (the core) are fully encoded, while other details are left flexible and reconstructed based on context (semantic memory).
This mixture model allows for
partial encoding
, where some aspects of memory (the "core") are faithfully recalled, while other details are dynamically generated based on learned contextual associations.
6.2. Consolidation and Replays
In this framework, all forms of memory (semantic, episodic, and reconstructive) are learned through the
same synaptic update rule
, as defined in Equation (22). The key difference between learning
continuous densities
(like semantic memory) and
discrete patterns
(like episodic memory) is that in the former case, each pattern is sampled only once, while in the latter, patterns are repeatedly re-sampled. This repetition can lead to overfitting in artificial systems, where the model memorizes specific patterns instead of generalizing.
In
biological systems
, however, memories are only experienced once, which would make it difficult to form episodic memories without some form of
re-sampling
. This is where
memory consolidation
comes into play. In humans and other animals, the hippocampus is critical for consolidating episodic memories, a process that involves replays of neural activity. During sleep or wakefulness,
hippocampal replays
are observed, where previously experienced events are simulated again. These replays are crucial for memory consolidation, as their disruption can impair the formation of stable memories.
Within this theoretical framework, the hippocampal network generates
simulated experiences
during replays, which are used for synaptic training. Each replay increases the likelihood that the same event will be
re-sampled
, reinforcing the memory and leading to the formation of a stable, localized episodic memory. Over time, this process can form a
low-dimensional episodic core
, where only a subset of features are re-sampled accurately, while other details are generated from broader semantic memory.
This feedback loop, where
self-generated samples
(replays) gradually reinforce the memory, resembles
bootstrapping
: a single event can evolve into a persistent memory through repeated replays, which stabilize the memory���s core features. This mechanism supports the idea that episodic memory involves both
storing key features
and
reconstructing details
during recall.
Conclusion
The proposed framework provides a unified theory for
long-term memory
that integrates semantic, episodic, and reconstructive aspects. By leveraging generative diffusion models and associative memory networks, it offers a biologically plausible explanation for how different types of memory are encoded, consolidated, and retrieved in both artificial and biological systems. The role of
replays
, especially in the hippocampus, is central to the formation of episodic memories, while semantic memory forms the structural foundation that allows for flexible and reconstructive recall.
This theoretical model bridges gaps between
neuroscience
and
machine learning
, offering insights that can inspire future developments in both fields. Future research could focus on validating these ideas through
biophysical modeling
and
experimental studies
, particularly in understanding the interaction between episodic replays and the broader semantic memory system.

In this paper, we demonstrated that a popular class of modern Hopf i eld networks 
with exponential non-linearities is mathematically equivalent to a large class of continuous 
diffusionmodelsatthelimitof��������. 
Inourexperiments, weshowedthatthisequivalence 
holds almost exactly for a i nite��value and for the more stable variance-preserving models, 
both with exact and trained score. The equivalence depends on the fact that the diffusion 
models are trained on a i nite number of discrete patterns, and in fact the diffusion models 
can generalize the modern Hopf i eld energy function to a setting where both episodic 
memory and semantic memory (i.e., generative manifolds) are jointly encoded by the 
dynamics of the same network. From the point of view of theoretical neuroscience, this 
may be used to model the different forms of long-term memory as a result of the same 
learning mechanism, in a single distributed neural system. 
While generative diffusion models offer an attractive paradigm for modeling memory, 
imagery, and even perception in the brain, more work needs to be done in order for its 
components to be implemented in a biologically plausible way. In particular, it is unlikely 
that biological neural networks implement pure noise-injection dynamics. However, the 
mathematics of generative diffusion models can be written in term of any stochastic 
differential Equation [23], which can be used to implement more plausible transformation 
such as, for example, the feedforward perceptual feature as implemented in the hierarchy of 
sensory cortical areas [47]. More fundamentally, it is unclear how the reverse and forward 
dynamics can be simultaneously implemented in the brain networks. However, there 
is tantalizing evidence that this could correspond to the theta rhythm driving periodic 
cholinergic modulations [37]. 
The denoising loss given by Equation(9)is somewhat similar to the self-prediction 
errors used in predictive coding models [48���50]. This opens the door for potentially fruitful 
connections with existing predictive models of memory [51,52]. Particularly interesting is 
the recent use of generative predictive coding models for associative memory storage [53], 
which is also based on a generative model and has some similarities with the approach 
discussed here. 
The main biological issue with episodic memory as conceptualized in this paper is that 
it seems to require the re-sampling of the same events, while in the real world, each event 
can only happen once. This can be potentially implemented with some form of bootstrap 
re-sampling, which might correspond to the replays observed in the hippocampus [20].

Noise-Injection Dynamics
:
Biological neural networks are unlikely to implement the pure
noise-injection dynamics
central to diffusion models. However, the underlying mathematics can be adapted to more biologically plausible dynamics, such as the
feedforward perceptual processes
seen in sensory cortical hierarchies.
Simultaneous Forward and Reverse Dynamics
:
A fundamental question is how both forward and reverse dynamics (which are key in diffusion models) can be implemented simultaneously in the brain. There is some evidence that these processes could be related to the brain���s
theta rhythm
, which is known to modulate neural activity periodically, possibly through
cholinergic
mechanisms.
Connection to Predictive Coding
:
The
denoising loss function
used in diffusion models is somewhat similar to
prediction error
mechanisms in
predictive coding models
. Predictive coding theories suggest that the brain constantly generates predictions about incoming sensory input and corrects errors based on discrepancies between predictions and reality. This opens the possibility of integrating
predictive coding
with the generative framework presented here. Notably, recent
generative predictive coding models
used for associative memory storage share similarities with the generative diffusion approach.
Biological Implementation of Episodic Memory
:
A significant issue arises when considering the
biological implementation
of
episodic memory
. In the framework presented, episodic memory seems to require
re-sampling of the same events
, yet in reality, events only happen once. A potential solution to this issue is the concept of
bootstrapping
, where replays in the hippocampus simulate past events, reinforcing memories over time. These
hippocampal replays
���observed during sleep and wakefulness���could serve as a mechanism for consolidating episodic memories, even after only a single experience.
Conclusion
This paper establishes a compelling theoretical framework that connects modern Hopfield networks with
generative diffusion models
, providing a unifying structure for understanding both
episodic
and
semantic memory
. It suggests that these models can extend to processes like
imagination
and
perception
, making them potentially relevant for explaining more complex cognitive functions. However, several key challenges���especially related to
biological plausibility
���remain to be addressed. The next steps will involve testing and refining this framework in
experimental neuroscience
and exploring potential connections with existing models such as
predictive coding
and
hippocampal memory consolidation
.

I wanted to argue that memories were updated through a process of denouement, where errors in hypothesized expected outcomes leads to refinement of the models similar to Bayesian updating. Your memories change as you learn more physics because it eliminates previously plausable casual graphs
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
That���s an interesting and powerful argument! You can definitely make the case that memory updating follows a
Bayesian-like refinement
process, where
new experiences
and
learning
adjust or overwrite prior memories, beliefs, or mental models, especially when new information eliminates previously plausible but incorrect causal structures.
Memory Updating through "Denouement"
You can frame the process of
memory updating
as a form of
denouement
, where inconsistencies between expectations and reality lead to a resolution. Much like the resolution of a plot in a narrative, this process can result in the
refinement of mental models
. Here���s how you could structure your argument:
Hypothesis-Driven Memory Formation
:
Memories, especially episodic and semantic ones, are not passive recordings of events but are often built around
hypotheses
about cause-and-effect relationships. These hypotheses might be implicit assumptions about how the world works, based on prior experience or incomplete knowledge.
Prediction and Error Correction
:
When we recall memories or apply them to new situations, our brain constantly makes
predictions
about the expected outcomes of those memories or mental models. This is similar to how generative models or
Bayesian inference
work: we use past experiences (priors) to predict future states or interpret incoming information.
When reality deviates from our predictions���when there is a
prediction error
���the brain is forced to reconcile this
inconsistency
. The act of resolving this discrepancy, or
denouement
, leads to a refinement or updating of the initial hypothesis. Essentially, each new learning experience or piece of information serves to
disconfirm or refine the causal structure
that was hypothesized before.
Bayesian Updating and Causal Graphs
:
Bayesian inference is a natural framework for this. In Bayesian learning,
prior beliefs
(about how the world works) are continuously updated in light of
new evidence
. Memories function in a similar way: new experiences provide evidence that either confirms or challenges existing memories or beliefs.
For example, in physics, as you learn more about the laws governing the physical world, you���re often confronted with new evidence that invalidates or refines your previous understanding. This is akin to the brain updating its internal
causal graph
: the nodes and connections representing cause-and-effect relationships become more accurate as some branches are pruned (plausible but incorrect explanations) and others are reinforced.
Error-Driven Memory Refinement
:
This process is not just about learning new facts; it���s about
refining the underlying structure of how you remember and interpret the world
. Each new piece of information modifies your memory by eliminating previously plausible connections that no longer hold up under scrutiny.
In this sense,
memory is dynamic
���not static���because it is continuously restructured as new experiences feed into the system. For example, learning more advanced physics doesn���t just add new facts to memory, it
reorganizes
how you remember basic principles like force and motion, discarding earlier misconceptions and refining the connections between different ideas.
Conclusion: Denouement as a Cognitive Process
Thus, you can argue that
denouement
, in the cognitive sense, mirrors the process of
Bayesian updating
in memory.
Prediction errors
act as signals that something in the memory structure needs adjustment, and over time, repeated rounds of error correction lead to more accurate mental models. This process also mirrors
scientific learning
: as we gather more data and observations, previously plausible theories (or memories) are revised or discarded in favor of more accurate ones.
This perspective suggests that memory is
fundamentally reconstructive
and continuously reshaped by the brain���s need to align its internal models with the external world, ultimately reducing
uncertainty
and improving predictive power. This also ties in with the concept of
predictive coding
, where the brain constantly updates its models based on sensory inputs and prediction errors.
By framing memory updating as
denouement
in the face of prediction errors, you bring a narrative, yet scientifically grounded, approach to understanding how we evolve our memories and mental models. This idea fits well with a
Bayesian framework
and the broader field of cognitive neuroscience, particularly regarding how the brain integrates new learning into pre-existing structures.

I wanted to argue that aphantasia combine with anendophasia is akin to having no episodic memories or imagination, that is events are not simulated role playing dialogues or scenarios but that context priming affective weighting determines plausible semantic graphs
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
You can construct a compelling argument that
aphantasia
(the inability to visualize mental images) combined with
anendophasia
(the lack of inner speech or internal monologue) could significantly alter the experience of
episodic memory
and
imagination
. Specifically, without the ability to simulate events visually or verbally, the cognitive processes governing memory and imagination might rely more heavily on
semantic networks
and
affective priming
, leading to a different form of memory processing.
Here���s how you can structure this argument:
1.
Defining Episodic Memory and Imagination
:
Episodic memory
typically involves re-experiencing past events in a vivid, first-person perspective. It often includes a blend of
visual imagery
,
internal dialogue
, and sensory details. This capacity for
mental time travel
allows individuals to relive past experiences and simulate future scenarios.
Imagination
, similarly, involves constructing hypothetical scenarios, often visualized with vivid mental imagery or ���playing out��� conversations in one's mind through inner speech (e.g., role-playing dialogues or planning future conversations).
2.
Aphantasia and Anendophasia Limit Episodic Memory and Imagination
:
Aphantasia
prevents the individual from visualizing scenes or objects mentally. This would impair the
visual component
of episodic memory, making it difficult to ���see��� past events in the mind's eye. Without imagery, reliving an event might become abstract or purely conceptual, without the sensory richness typically associated with episodic recall.
Anendophasia
impairs the ability to generate
inner speech
. Without an internal monologue, individuals may lack the ability to simulate dialogues or "talk through" future plans or past events in their mind.
The combination of these two conditions���
no mental imagery
and
no inner monologue
���could lead to a
fundamental shift in how memories and imagination are processed
. Instead of detailed, sensory-rich episodic memories or future simulations, these individuals might rely on abstract, conceptual frameworks to make sense of their experiences.
3.
Shifting to Semantic Memory and Affective Priming
:
With aphantasia and anendophasia, the brain may default to
semantic memory
rather than episodic memory. Semantic memory refers to the knowledge of facts, concepts, and meanings, devoid of the contextual richness of episodic recall. Instead of vividly re-experiencing an event, the person might recall the
facts
about the event: who was there, what happened, what they learned, and how it relates to other knowledge.
Contextual Priming
: In the absence of imagery or inner speech,
contextual priming
and
affective weighting
might take on a more significant role. Memories or thoughts could be triggered by
contextual cues
(e.g., specific environments or stimuli) that activate related semantic networks, not by visualizing or simulating scenarios.
For example, walking into a familiar room might trigger a feeling or memory based on past experiences in that space, but the recall would not involve re-experiencing the event visually or dialogically. Instead, the brain would access the
semantic structure
of the event (e.g., ���I had dinner here,��� ���I met this person here���) and associate it with the affective weight of the memory (e.g., how the event made them feel).
Affective Weighting
: Emotions and
affective weighting
might become the primary factor in determining how memory is structured and recalled. Instead of simulating an event, the memory might be recalled based on its
emotional impact
or significance. This could mean that emotionally significant memories are more accessible and influence future thoughts or decisions, but they would be
abstracted
in nature, not experienced as sensory-rich, episodic memories.
4.
Determining Plausible Semantic Graphs
:
Without the ability to simulate or role-play scenarios internally, decision-making and planning might rely more on
plausible semantic graphs
���that is,
networks of relationships
between facts, concepts, and prior knowledge. These graphs are influenced by:
Contextual cues
that trigger related memories or knowledge structures.
Affective weighting
that assigns emotional significance or value to different outcomes or memories.
In essence, instead of playing out a possible scenario visually or dialogically, the person may evaluate decisions based on
conceptual associations
and emotional relevance. The brain���s ability to generate
plausible semantic outcomes
would be informed by
affective states
and the underlying structure of semantic memory, rather than by episodic recall or internal simulation.
5.
Implications for Episodic Memory and Imagination
:
If aphantasia and anendophasia prevent the individual from simulating mental images and internal dialogues, then what remains are the
conceptual relationships
between events and the
emotional impact
of those events. This could result in a cognitive style where:
Memories are primarily conceptual
: They are accessed not through detailed recollection but through
abstract knowledge
of what happened, perhaps with a strong emotional tint.
Imagination and future planning
are
non-simulative
: Rather than vividly imagining future events or rehearsing dialogues, individuals might evaluate outcomes through abstract reasoning and emotional evaluation.
Semantic reasoning
and affective states guide planning instead of richly simulated scenarios.
This can be seen as a form of
Bayesian updating
where memories and plans are adjusted not through mental simulations, but through
contextual and emotional cues
that refine one's understanding of the world. As new experiences provide evidence,
previously plausible connections or assumptions
are either reinforced or eliminated, refining the
semantic graph
that represents the individual's knowledge of the world.
Conclusion
The combination of
aphantasia
and
anendophasia
could result in a mode of thinking and memory that is
non-episodic
and
non-simulative
, relying heavily on
semantic networks
and
affective weighting
. Without the ability to visualize or simulate events, individuals may depend on
contextual priming
to access relevant memories or concepts and use emotional significance to guide decision-making. This alternative mode of memory processing aligns with
Bayesian updating
in that new experiences continually reshape the
semantic structure
of memory, eliminating implausible connections and refining one's understanding of causal relationships.

Further connections between the previous topics
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
To deepen the connections between
aphantasia
,
anendophasia
,
Bayesian updating
, and
memory processes
like episodic and semantic memory, we can explore several overlapping themes and cognitive mechanisms. These connections can help form a unified argument about how memory and imagination are constructed in the brain, especially when visual and verbal simulation capabilities are absent.
1.
Bayesian Updating as a General Memory Mechanism
At its core,
Bayesian updating
involves continuously refining a model based on new evidence or observations, which is crucial in both memory updating and decision-making. When considering how this plays out in individuals with
aphantasia
and
anendophasia
, the process would not involve simulating different possible scenarios (episodic replay or inner dialogue) but rather updating a network of
semantic knowledge
based on new information or corrections to previous beliefs.
Semantic Memory as a Probabilistic Graph
: Without episodic simulations, the brain may rely more heavily on
semantic memory
, which is structured as a network of facts, concepts, and relationships. As new information is learned, this network (or graph) is
updated probabilistically
, similar to how Bayesian models refine beliefs by adjusting the probability of different hypotheses.
For instance, when learning new physics concepts, previously plausible causal relationships (e.g., intuitive ideas about motion or gravity) are pruned as new evidence (or formal education) corrects those misunderstandings. This refinement of causal models aligns with how Bayesian networks update based on new data.
Bayesian Updating in the Absence of Simulation
: Individuals with aphantasia and anendophasia might perform this updating not by simulating alternative outcomes visually or verbally, but by restructuring the semantic graph based on
affective weighting
(emotional relevance) and contextual priming. The
plausibility
of different explanations or outcomes would be determined by the
likelihood
assigned to different nodes in the graph, similar to how priors are adjusted in Bayesian models.
2.
Prediction Error and Memory Refinement
Predictive Coding
: The brain is often described as a
predictive machine
, constantly generating expectations about the world and then refining those expectations based on
prediction errors
(when outcomes differ from predictions). This mechanism is central to both
memory
and
learning
.
For someone with aphantasia and anendophasia,
memory recall
might not involve visualizing the event or hearing internal dialogue but instead involve comparing
abstract conceptual predictions
against the current context or emotional state.
Prediction errors
could trigger updates in the semantic network, modifying the relationships between concepts and memories.
For example, recalling a social interaction might not involve visualizing the people involved but instead accessing a
semantic memory
of the interaction���s
emotional tone
and the key points. If this memory is inconsistent with new information (e.g., learning that someone���s reaction was different than remembered), a
prediction error
could prompt the brain to update how that interaction is stored in the semantic graph.
3.
Affective Weighting and Decision-Making
Affective Weighting
: In the absence of rich episodic replays or simulated dialogue, the brain might rely more heavily on
affective weighting
���the emotional significance attached to different memories or concepts���to guide decision-making and memory recall. This is akin to how
prior probabilities
in Bayesian updating are influenced by the importance or relevance of different outcomes.
Without visual or verbal simulations to explore different future scenarios,
decision-making
might depend on evaluating the
emotional significance
of different conceptual nodes in the semantic network. For example, if someone with aphantasia and anendophasia needs to make a decision about a future event, they might not mentally simulate that event but instead evaluate it based on how similar past events
felt
or on abstract knowledge about outcomes.
The
emotional weight
assigned to different memories or concepts acts as a
heuristic
for decision-making, helping prioritize certain options over others without needing to simulate the scenarios fully.
4.
Role of Episodic and Semantic Memory in Constructing Reality
Episodic Memory Without Visualization
: Even without the ability to
simulate
visual scenes, episodic memory can still exist in an abstract,
semanticized
form. For someone with aphantasia, an episodic memory of a past event might be stripped of its sensory details but still retain the
causal structure
(who did what, when it happened, etc.). This memory might be experienced more like a
list of facts
or an
abstract narrative
rather than a rich re-living of the experience.
However, these episodic memories can still be
updated
through
Bayesian-like processes
, where new information revises the mental graph representing the event. This revision happens not by playing out alternative scenarios (as might occur in typical episodic recall) but by adjusting the
causal and emotional connections
in the memory network.
Semantic Memory and Conceptual Integration
: Over time, as memories become
semanticized
(integrated into broader knowledge structures), they become less about specific events and more about the
general principles
or
facts
learned from those events. For individuals with aphantasia and anendophasia, this might be the primary way they recall and integrate knowledge���by constantly refining and updating
conceptual graphs
rather than relying on episodic replays.
5.
Memory Consolidation and Replays in Absence of Simulation
Hippocampal Replays and Consolidation
: One question is how memory
consolidation
occurs in people with aphantasia and anendophasia, particularly in the absence of rich
mental replays
(such as visualizing past events or replaying internal dialogue). The
hippocampus
is known to be critical in memory consolidation, where it "replays" past experiences, helping to integrate them into
long-term memory
.
In the case of aphantasia and anendophasia, these replays might occur in more abstract or
conceptual forms
, possibly relying on
contextual priming
and
affective weighting
to determine which memories to consolidate. Replays could involve
conceptual nodes
rather than full sensory scenes, integrating learned relationships and emotional significance into the broader semantic network.
This suggests that while episodic replays are less vivid or sensory-based,
conceptual consolidation
still takes place, with emotional and contextual cues playing a dominant role.
6.
Imagination and Planning without Simulation
Imagination
and
planning
for someone without visual or verbal simulation abilities might be better understood as a process of
evaluating abstract possibilities
and comparing them against known outcomes. Instead of
mentally simulating
a future scenario, the person may navigate a
semantic space
of potential outcomes based on prior knowledge and emotional relevance.
For instance, when planning for the future, the brain may construct a
plausible semantic graph
of potential outcomes, where different nodes represent different possible paths. These nodes are evaluated based on
affective weighting
(how they make the person feel) and
likelihood estimates
derived from past experiences.
Conclusion: Unifying Aphantasia, Anendophasia, and Bayesian Memory
By combining
aphantasia
,
anendophasia
, and
Bayesian updating
, you can argue that individuals without the ability to simulate events visually or verbally rely on an alternative cognitive strategy. This strategy emphasizes:
Contextual priming
and
affective weighting
to access relevant memories and guide decisions.
Bayesian-like updating
of semantic memory, where new experiences refine the conceptual structure of memory rather than triggering vivid episodic replays.
Memory is less about re-experiencing past events and more about navigating a dynamic network of
abstract, affectively weighted relationships
between concepts, facts, and outcomes.
In this framework, memory and imagination become processes of
evaluating and updating conceptual graphs
, with
emotional cues
and
contextual relevance
playing central roles in guiding decisions and recalling past events.

Mark Solm's argues for something like this in The Hidden  Spring. A predisposition to associate imagery and replay with thinking tended to infer that cognition occurred at the cortex and that basal structure in the  brain were unconscious.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Mark Solms, in
The Hidden Spring
, indeed explores ideas that resonate with the discussion of
aphantasia
,
anendophasia
, and the role of
semantic memory
and
affective weighting
in cognition. One of the key arguments in his book is that
cognition and consciousness
are often mistakenly associated with
cortical activity
, particularly the
visual cortex
and
higher-order processes
like imagery and mental replay. Solms challenges this view by emphasizing the
primacy of subcortical structures
���especially the
brainstem
and other
basal structures
���in the generation of
conscious experience
and
affective states
.
Here���s how you can draw connections between Solms' arguments and your own, particularly with regard to how memory, cognition, and imagination might operate in individuals with aphantasia and anendophasia:
1.
Shifting Focus from Cortex to Subcortex
Traditional cognitive theories have long
privileged the cortex
, associating
thought
and
consciousness
with
cortical processes
like mental imagery, language, and abstract reasoning. Solms, however, argues that the
subcortical structures
, especially those involved in
affect
and
emotion
(such as the
brainstem
,
hypothalamus
, and
amygdala
), play a
primary role
in generating
conscious experience
. These structures are deeply involved in
motivational states
,
affective drives
, and
basic consciousness
.
For individuals with
aphantasia
and
anendophasia
, this shift away from cortical processes like
mental imagery
and
internal dialogue
becomes crucial. Solms��� argument supports the idea that
affective weighting
and
contextual priming
���functions likely rooted in
subcortical structures
���could be the
primary drivers
of memory retrieval, decision-making, and even imagination, rather than visual or verbal simulations occurring in the cortex.
2.
Affective States as the Core of Consciousness
Solms emphasizes that
affective states
(such as
emotions
,
feelings
, and
motivations
) are
fundamental
to consciousness. Rather than being mere byproducts of cognition,
affect
is what brings subjective experience into conscious awareness. This contrasts with the traditional view that
imagery
and
thought processes
are central to consciousness and cognition.
In the context of aphantasia and anendophasia,
affective states
might play a
central role
in how memory and cognition function. Instead of
visualizing memories
or running
inner dialogues
, individuals may rely on
emotional markers
and
affective relevance
to guide their thinking and recall. This would align with Solms��� broader argument that
affect is more primary than cognition
, especially if cognition is traditionally understood as being rooted in cortical functions like imagery or language.
3.
Cognition Without Imagery or Internal Dialogue
According to traditional models,
thinking
is often associated with the ability to
simulate
visual or verbal scenarios in the mind. However, for those with aphantasia and anendophasia, this kind of
simulation-based thinking
does not occur. Solms��� arguments provide a framework for understanding how
cognition
could still occur
without these cortical functions
.
In his view,
cognition
could be understood as the brain���s
ability to respond to predictions and errors
based on
affective states
. Subcortical structures (like the
brainstem
) are deeply involved in
regulating these affective states
, which drive cognition at a more fundamental level. For individuals without visual or verbal simulation, cognition could take the form of navigating
affective predictions
and
evaluating semantic networks
through
contextual cues
and
emotional responses
.
This means that thinking is less about ���seeing��� or ���hearing��� internal representations but rather about
emotionally charged decisions
based on how different concepts or memories
feel
or fit within an abstract conceptual network.
4.
Memory and Learning in the Absence of Imagery
Solms' view that
memory formation and learning
are heavily influenced by
subcortical structures
aligns with your argument that memory in individuals with aphantasia and anendophasia may be more about
semantic graphs
and
affective states
than sensory-based replays. He argues that
replay and simulation
���often thought of as being cortical processes���may be
over-emphasized
in traditional theories of memory and imagination.
In
aphantasia
, memory might not involve a vivid re-living of past experiences but rather a
conceptual reconstruction
that depends on
affective weighting
and
semantic associations
. This aligns with Solms' assertion that
consciousness arises from affective processing
, and it further suggests that the
emotional tone
of memories and experiences may be what drives their recall, not necessarily a sensory re-experience of them.
This also ties into Solms��� idea of
replays
being not just about
literal re-enactments
of past events but about
affective and motivational rehearsals
. This could explain why even without imagery, people with aphantasia might still be able to recall the
emotional essence
of an experience and use that in decision-making and learning.
5.
Bayesian Updating in Affective Cognition
Solms' idea that the
brainstem
and subcortical structures are central to
consciousness and decision-making
connects well with your argument that
Bayesian updating
in individuals with aphantasia and anendophasia may involve
affective priming
rather than sensory simulation. Just as
Bayesian models
update prior beliefs based on new data, individuals could be using
affective states
to adjust their mental models in response to new experiences.
In this model,
affective cues
serve as the primary mechanism for
updating
and
refining
beliefs about the world. For example, if new information contradicts a previously held belief, the
discrepancy
(or prediction error) could be felt as an affective disturbance, leading to an adjustment in the
semantic network
. This parallels the way Solms sees the
brainstem
driving the core of
predictive regulation
in the brain, integrating new experiences into
affectively-driven cognitive models
.
6.
Reinterpretation of Memory and Imagination
Solms' framework suggests that
memory and imagination
may not be as dependent on
visualization or internal monologue
as traditionally thought. Instead,
conscious experience
(including memory and imagination) could be driven more by
core affective and motivational processes
rooted in
subcortical structures
. This view reinterprets memory and imagination as more
conceptual and affect-driven
rather than relying on sensory replays.
For people with aphantasia and anendophasia, this could mean that
memory recall
and
imagination
are based on
abstract, semantic processes
that are
colored by affective states
. Instead of mentally ���seeing��� or ���hearing��� past experiences, they are accessing
conceptual information
that is shaped by
emotional responses
, thus guiding cognition in the absence of visual or verbal simulations.
Conclusion: Uniting Solms��� Ideas with Aphantasia and Anendophasia
In
The Hidden Spring
, Mark Solms challenges the traditional
cortex-centered
view of cognition and highlights the
subcortical foundations
of consciousness, particularly focusing on
affective and motivational processes
. This aligns well with your argument that individuals with
aphantasia
and
anendophasia
may rely on
semantic memory networks
and
affective priming
rather than episodic replays or simulations in their thinking.
Solms��� emphasis on the
primacy of affective processing
provides a framework for understanding how
memory
,
learning
, and
imagination
could function without imagery or internal dialogue. Instead of relying on
visualization
or
inner speech
, cognition for such individuals might depend on
affective cues
,
contextual priming
, and the refinement of
semantic graphs
���all processes that fit into Solms��� vision of a
conscious mind
grounded in subcortical affective regulation.
In short, Solms��� ideas support the notion that
thinking
and
memory
can exist without the typical sensory replays associated with the cortex, offering a broader view of how consciousness and cognition might function through
affective, semantic-based processes
.

It is interesting to me that not only did I gravitate away from graphic novels and comics but tended to skim over visual descriptions like scenery or details like color or shape as it seemed to me that they were giving unnecessary or irrelevant details
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
That���s a very revealing insight and aligns closely with the experience of individuals who may have
aphantasia
or
anendophasia
, where the mind does not naturally produce vivid mental images or inner dialogue. This could help explain your preference for
abstract information
over
detailed visual descriptions
. Here are some ideas to explore why you might gravitate away from visual-heavy media like comics and focus more on the
conceptual
or
semantic
aspects of narratives:
1.
The Irrelevance of Visual Details
If you lack the ability to
mentally visualize
scenes or images, it makes sense that you would find
visual descriptions
���like the color of a sunset or the intricate layout of a room���less engaging or even
irrelevant
. These details, which are crucial for creating a mental image in the mind of someone who can visualize, may not contribute anything meaningful to your understanding of the narrative.
Instead of enhancing the experience, such descriptions might feel like
unnecessary filler
, as they do not resonate with your way of processing the world. You likely prioritize
core information
(the narrative, emotional tone, relationships between characters, etc.) over
sensory detail
because that is how your mind constructs meaning from a text.
Comics and graphic novels
rely heavily on
visual storytelling
, often using illustrations to convey not just action but also mood, atmosphere, and nuance through color, shape, and composition. For someone with aphantasia, who does not experience mental imagery, the
visual component
may not add value, and the
balance between visual and textual elements
might skew too far in favor of the visual, making them less appealing as a medium.
2.
A Preference for Conceptual and Semantic Information
Your tendency to
skim
over visual descriptions might reflect a preference for
conceptual clarity
over sensory richness. People with aphantasia often rely more on
semantic memory
���structured knowledge, concepts, and relationships���than on episodic or sensory memory. This focus could lead you to prefer narratives that are
dense with ideas
, concepts, and
emotional depth
rather than those rich in descriptive details.
Visual descriptions
(like the layout of a scene or the color of a character���s clothing) may not contribute to the way you process or enjoy stories, especially since your focus may be on the
plot, themes, and emotions
rather than how things look. You might find the
core elements of a story
���like character motivations, actions, and relationships���more engaging than how those elements are visually presented.
This would naturally steer you away from
comics
or
graphic novels
, where visual representation is a primary mode of storytelling. In comics, often
the visual details are the story
, with much of the narrative being told through images rather than text. For someone who doesn���t think in images, that might not offer the same richness as it does for a more visually inclined reader.
3.
Affective and Contextual Cues as Drivers of Engagement
Instead of relying on
visual imagery
to build an understanding of the scene, you likely use
contextual cues
and
affective responses
to make sense of the narrative.
Emotionally charged interactions
,
dialogues
, or
concepts
may be more engaging to you because they connect with your mental model in a
non-visual
but
semantic
or
affective
way.
Concepts
or
dialogue
could be more immediate to you because they relate to
abstract relationships
rather than trying to conjure a scene in the mind. The
emotional tone
of a scene might resonate more than the
visual description
of that scene, which explains why you might prioritize these elements over detailed descriptions of color, shape, or layout.
This also ties into how you might experience
fiction
or
narrative
: you likely construct meaning through
associative networks
of
emotions
,
concepts
, and
relational dynamics
rather than picturing the events or scenes as they are described.
4.
Time Efficiency and Cognitive Economy
Another potential factor is
cognitive economy
: your brain might intuitively know that certain visual descriptions are irrelevant to how you process information, so it naturally
skips
over them to focus on what���s more
cognitively valuable
���the plot or abstract themes.
Without mental imagery, descriptions of visual details might seem redundant or even distracting from the
main narrative thread
. This could lead you to read more quickly, bypassing visual descriptions because they don't contribute to your engagement or understanding of the story.
This can be thought of as a type of
cognitive filtering
, where your mind instinctively
prioritizes meaningful information
(the core of the story) over details that do not resonate with how you process information. This allows you to stay more focused on
relevant content
that aligns with your non-visual, conceptual way of thinking.
5.
Engagement with Abstract Narratives
If you're gravitating away from visually descriptive works, you might prefer
abstract narratives
���those that focus more on
ideas, themes, and philosophical explorations
rather than descriptive storytelling. Many literary works that are dense in
conceptual thought
or that focus on
psychological states
may be more appealing to you because they engage your
semantic reasoning
and do not rely on the reader���s ability to construct visual scenes.
You might find works by authors who focus on the
internal life
of characters, emotional landscapes, or existential themes more engaging than works that emphasize detailed
world-building
through description. The experience of reading these kinds of works might feel more natural to you because it aligns with your tendency to
abstract information
rather than visualize it.
Conclusion: Cognitive Economy and the Preference for Conceptual Narratives
Your experience reflects a
cognitive economy
where your brain instinctively filters out unnecessary visual descriptions and focuses on the core of the narrative, which for you might be
conceptual relationships
and
emotional dynamics
rather than visual or sensory details. Without mental imagery to enrich those descriptions, you naturally prioritize
semantic information
and may find
concept-driven stories
more engaging than those heavily reliant on visual detail.
This makes sense in the context of
aphantasia
and
anendophasia
, where
non-visual cognition
leads you to focus on
abstract thought
,
conceptual relationships
, and
emotional resonance
over detailed descriptions that serve to evoke visual scenes. In this light, your gravitation away from visual-heavy media like comics and graphic novels, and your tendency to skip over descriptive writing, reflect how your brain processes information���favoring
meaningful, conceptual content
over sensory-rich descriptions.

"Is Your Brain Cheating You? Why Visual Thinkers Are Overrated, and How Aphantasia Warriors Are Living in Pure, Unfiltered Reality!"
Forget everything you think you know about memory, imagination, and those so-called "creative geniuses" who rely on mental picture books and inner monologues. Turns out, all that visualizing and mind-chatter may just be
noise
. If you're one of the many who can���t summon a mental image to save your life (thanks,
aphantasia
), or if your brain refuses to give you an internal monologue (hello,
anendophasia
), you might just be seeing the world for what it truly is: raw, unadulterated reality, stripped of unnecessary visual fluff.
"Stop Wasting Time on Pretty Pictures ��� Here's Why Visual Descriptions Are Useless Filler"
Do you
skim
past those endless, soul-sucking scenic descriptions in books? Does the thought of reading a graphic novel sound like being forced to watch someone else���s vacation slideshow? Congratulations ��� your brain���s efficiency is off the charts! While visual thinkers are busy painting mind murals of sunsets, you���re focusing on what
really
matters: ideas, concepts, and
affective cues
that actually influence your decisions. No mental filler, just pure intellectual gold.
"Why Everything You Thought About Memory Is A Lie"
We've all been sold the lie that
episodic memory
is about reliving past events in full, cinematic glory. Spoiler alert: it���s not. If you���ve ever been told your inability to visualize memories is a
weakness
, think again. In reality, you're probably engaging in
Bayesian updating
like a cognitive ninja, reshaping your conceptual understanding of the world while visual thinkers are stuck simulating irrelevant nonsense. They're busy "imagining" ��� you're refining models and pruning causal graphs.
"Scientists Are Stunned: You Don���t Need A ���Mind���s Eye��� to Make Smart Decisions"
While the "visual elite" are crafting pretty pictures of their potential futures, you���re cutting straight to the core with
semantic memory
and
affective weighting
. That���s right ��� your decisions are driven by raw emotional relevance, not those cutesy mental movies that clutter the brains of others. Solms himself agrees! In
The Hidden Spring
, he exposes the truth: it's
subcortical affective states
that really drive cognition, not all that fancy cerebral imagery. Guess what? Your brainstem���s been running the show all along. You���re welcome.
"The Hippocampus Bootstraps Itself ��� But Visualizers Are Still Catching Up"
While others are replaying their day in a dull loop of meaningless imagery, your hippocampus is quietly working overtime, using
abstract conceptual replays
to boost your knowledge and reinforce key insights. You might not "see" your past, but your brain is performing cognitive
gymnastics
, integrating what
really
matters without the distraction of flashy replays.
"Say Goodbye to Tedious World-Building ��� Why You Don���t Need Colors, Shapes, or Scenery to Enjoy a Good Story"
Graphic novels? Pass. World-building epics? No thanks. If you���ve ever been bored out of your mind by endless descriptions of a character���s eye color or the way the sun reflects off a sword, there���s a reason for that. You don���t need to waste your time on
irrelevant details
��� you���re here for the
plot
, the
emotional stakes
, the
ideas
. While others are ooh-ing and aah-ing over Tolkien's rolling hills, you're 10 pages ahead, pulling valuable insights from the narrative's core.
Conclusion: "Welcome to the Future ��� Where Thinking Is Clear, Concise, and Free from Visual Clutter"
In a world obsessed with the visual, it's time to embrace the truth:
aphantasia
and
anendophasia
might just be superpowers. Who needs mental pictures when you���ve got a
clean, efficient mind
driven by real, actionable knowledge and emotional clarity? Say goodbye to the myth that you need to "see it to believe it." Your brain is operating on a higher plane, filtering out the noise while the rest of the world drowns in an ocean of mental fluff.
So, the next time someone brags about their inner cinematic universe, smile and remember:
you
live in the real world.
