Sharon Li is MIT Technology Review���s 2023 Innovator of the Year. Meet the rest of this year's Innovators Under 35. 

As we launch AI systems from the lab into the real world, we need to be prepared for these systems to break in surprising and catastrophic ways. It���s already happening. Last year, for example, a chess-playing robot arm in Moscow fractured the finger of a seven-year-old boy. The robot grabbed the boy���s finger as he was moving a chess piece and let go only after nearby adults managed to pry open its claws.

This did not happen because the robot was programmed to do harm. It was because the robot was overly confident that the boy���s finger was a chess piece.  

The incident is a classic example of something Sharon Li, 32, wants to prevent. Li, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, is a pioneer in an AI safety feature called out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. This feature, she says, helps AI models determine when they should abstain from action if faced with something they weren���t trained on. 

Li developed one of the first algorithms on out-of-distribution detection for deep neural networks. Google has since set up a dedicated team to integrate OOD detection into its products. Last year, Li���s theoretical analysis of OOD detection was chosen from over 10,000 submissions as an outstanding paper by NeurIPS, one of the most prestigious AI conferences.

We���re currently in an AI gold rush, and tech companies are racing to release their AI models. But most of today���s models are trained to identify specific things and often fail when they encounter the unfamiliar scenarios typical of the messy, unpredictable real world. Their inability to reliably understand what they ���know��� and what they don���t ���know��� is the weakness behind many AI disasters.

Li���s work calls on the AI community to rethink its approach to training. ���A lot of the classic approaches that have been in place over the last 50 years are actually safety unaware,��� she says. 

Her approach embraces uncertainty by using machine learning to detect unknown data out in the world and design AI models to adjust to it on the fly. Out-of-distribution detection could help prevent accidents when autonomous cars run into unfamiliar objects on the road, or make medical AI systems more useful in finding a new disease.

���In all those situations, what we really need [is a] safety-aware machine learning model that���s able to identify what it doesn���t know,��� says Li. 

This approach could also aid today���s buzziest AI technology, large language models such as ChatGPT. These models are often confident liars, presenting falsehoods as facts. This is where OOD detection could help. Say a person asks a chatbot a question it doesn���t have an answer to in its training data. Instead of making something up, an AI model using OOD detection would decline to answer.

Now, Li is seeking a deeper understanding of the safety risks relating to large AI models, which are powering all kinds of new online applications and products. She hopes that by making the models underlying these products safer, we���ll be better able to mitigate AI���s risks. 

���The ultimate goal is to ensure trustworthy, safe machine learning,��� she says.

Towards Reliability in Deep Learning Systems
THURSDAY, JULY 14, 2022
Posted by Dustin Tran and Balaji Lakshminarayanan, Research Scientists, Google Research

Deep learning models have made impressive progress in vision, language, and other modalities, particularly with the rise of large-scale pre-training. Such models are most accurate when applied to test data drawn from the same distribution as their training set. However, in practice, the data confronting models in real-world settings rarely match the training distribution. In addition, the models may not be well-suited for applications where predictive performance is only part of the equation. For models to be reliable in deployment, they must be able to accommodate shifts in data distribution and make useful decisions in a broad array of scenarios.

In ���Plex: Towards Reliability Using Pre-trained Large Model Extensions���, we present a framework for reliable deep learning as a new perspective about a model���s abilities; this includes a number of concrete tasks and datasets for stress-testing model reliability. We also introduce Plex, a set of pre-trained large model extensions that can be applied to many different architectures. We illustrate the efficacy of Plex in the vision and language domains by applying these extensions to the current state-of-the-art Vision Transformer and T5 models, which results in significant improvement in their reliability. We are also open-sourcing the code to encourage further research into this approach.


Uncertainty ��� Dog vs. Cat classifier: Plex can say ���I don���t know��� for inputs that are neither cat nor dog.
Robust Generalization ��� A na��ve model is sensitive to spurious correlations (���destination���), whereas Plex is robust.
Adaptation ��� Plex can actively choose the data from which it learns to improve performance more quickly.

Framework for Reliability
First, we explore how to understand the reliability of a model in novel scenarios. We posit three general categories of requirements for reliable machine learning (ML) systems: (1) they should accurately report uncertainty about their predictions (���know what they don���t know���); (2) they should generalize robustly to new scenarios (distribution shift); and (3) they should be able to efficiently adapt to new data (adaptation). Importantly, a reliable model should aim to do well in all of these areas simultaneously out-of-the-box, without requiring any customization for individual tasks.

Uncertainty reflects the imperfect or unknown information that makes it difficult for a model to make accurate predictions. Predictive uncertainty quantification allows a model to compute optimal decisions and helps practitioners recognize when to trust the model���s predictions, thereby enabling graceful failures when the model is likely to be wrong.
Robust Generalization involves an estimate or forecast about an unseen event. We investigate four types of out-of-distribution data: covariate shift (when the input distribution changes between training and application and the output distribution is unchanged), semantic (or class) shift, label uncertainty, and subpopulation shift.

Types of distribution shift using an illustration of ImageNet dogs.
Adaptation refers to probing the model���s abilities over the course of its learning process. Benchmarks typically evaluate on static datasets with pre-defined train-test splits. However, in many applications, we are interested in models that can quickly adapt to new datasets and efficiently learn with as few labeled examples as possible.

Reliability framework. We propose to simultaneously stress-test the ���out-of-the-box��� model performance (i.e., the predictive distribution) across uncertainty, robust generalization, and adaptation benchmarks, without any customization for individual tasks.
We apply 10 types of tasks to capture the three reliability areas ��� uncertainty, robust generalization, and adaptation ��� and to ensure that the tasks measure a diverse set of desirable properties in each area. Together the tasks comprise 40 downstream datasets across vision and natural language modalities: 14 datasets for fine-tuning (including few-shot and active learning���based adaptation) and 26 datasets for out-of-distribution evaluation.


Plex: Pre-trained Large Model Extensions for Vision and Language
To improve reliability, we develop ViT-Plex and T5-Plex, building on large pre-trained models for vision (ViT) and language (T5), respectively. A key feature of Plex is more efficient ensembling based on submodels that each make a prediction that is then aggregated. In addition, Plex swaps each architecture���s linear last layer with a Gaussian process or heteroscedastic layer to better represent predictive uncertainty. These ideas were found to work very well for models trained from scratch at the ImageNet scale. We train the models with varying sizes up to 325 million parameters for vision (ViT-Plex L) and 1 billion parameters for language (T5-Plex L) and pre-training dataset sizes up to 4 billion examples.

The following figure illustrates Plex���s performance on a select set of tasks compared to the existing state-of-the-art. The top-performing model for each task is usually a specialized model that is highly optimized for that problem. Plex achieves new state-of-the-art on many of the 40 datasets. Importantly, Plex achieves strong performance across all tasks using the out-of-the-box model output without requiring any custom designing or tuning for each task.

Plex in Action for Different Reliability Tasks
We highlight Plex���s reliability on select tasks below.


Open Set Recognition
We show Plex���s output in the case where the model must defer prediction because the input is one that the model does not support. This task is known as open set recognition. Here, predictive performance is part of a larger decision-making scenario where the model may abstain from making certain predictions. In the following figure, we show structured open set recognition: Plex returns multiple outputs and signals the specific part of the output about which the model is uncertain and is likely out-of-distribution.


Structured open set recognition enables the model to provide nuanced clarifications. Here, T5-Plex L can recognize fine-grained out-of-distribution cases where the request���s vertical (i.e., coarse-level domain of service, such as banking, media, productivity, etc.) and domain are supported but the intent is not.

Label Uncertainty
In real-world datasets, there is often inherent ambiguity behind the ground truth label for each input. For example, this may arise due to human rater ambiguity for a given image. In this case, we���d like the model to capture the full distribution of human perceptual uncertainty. We showcase Plex below on examples from an ImageNet variant we constructed that provides a ground truth label distribution.


Plex for label uncertainty. Using a dataset we construct called ImageNet ReaL-H, ViT-Plex L demonstrates the ability to capture the inherent ambiguity (probability distribution) of image labels.

Active Learning
We examine a large model���s ability to not only learn over a fixed set of data points, but also participate in knowing which data points to learn from in the first place. One such task is known as active learning, where at each training step, the model selects promising inputs among a pool of unlabeled data points on which to train. This procedure assesses an ML model���s label efficiency, where label annotations may be scarce, and so we would like to maximize performance while minimizing the number of labeled data points used. Plex achieves a significant performance improvement over the same model architecture without pre-training. In addition, even with fewer training examples, it also outperforms the state-of-the-art pre-trained method, BASE, which reaches 63% accuracy at 100K examples.


Active learning on ImageNet1K. ViT-Plex L is highly label efficient compared to a baseline that doesn���t leverage pre-training. We also find that active learning���s data acquisition strategy is more effective than uniformly selecting data points at random.

Check out our paper here and an upcoming contributed talk about the work at the ICML 2022 pre-training workshop on July 23, 2022. To encourage further research in this direction, we are open-sourcing all code for training and evaluation as part of Uncertainty Baselines. We also provide a demo that shows how to use a ViT-Plex model checkpoint. Layer and method implementations use Edward2.

Does it specifically mention how it integrating OOD principles
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, the article does address the concern of out-of-distribution (OOD) data in the context of reliability in deep learning systems.
Here's a breakdown of the mentions and how the "Plex" framework integrates OOD principles:
Problem Statement
: The article highlights the challenge where deep learning models perform optimally when the test data is from the same distribution as the training set. However, real-world data often doesn't match the training distribution, emphasizing the need for handling OOD scenarios.
Robust Generalization
: One of the three pillars of the proposed reliability framework focuses on the ability of models to generalize robustly to new scenarios, especially in the face of distribution shifts. Specifically, four types of out-of-distribution data are explored:
Covariate shift (input distribution changes between training and application while the output distribution remains unchanged)
Semantic (or class) shift
Label uncertainty
Subpopulation shift
Open Set Recognition
: This is one of the tasks where Plex shows its capability in OOD scenarios. Open set recognition involves the model's ability to refrain from making predictions when confronted with an input that it doesn't recognize or support. It's essentially about handling situations where the model is confronted with completely novel, unseen, or out-of-distribution data. Plex can return multiple outputs and signal which part of the output it is uncertain about, indicating that it's likely OOD.
Structured Open Set Recognition
: This is an advanced version of open set recognition where Plex not only refrains from making a prediction for an unsupported input but also provides nuanced clarifications. For instance, T5-Plex L can identify fine-grained OOD cases where some parts of the request are supported, but others aren't.
The integration of these OOD principles into the Plex framework is a part of their broader initiative to ensure that deep learning models are reliable, can accurately report uncertainties, robustly generalize across different data distributions, and efficiently adapt to new data.

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the science of quantitative characterization and estimation of uncertainties in both computational and real world applications. It tries to determine how likely certain outcomes are if some aspects of the system are not exactly known. An example would be to predict the acceleration of a human body in a head-on crash with another car: even if the speed was exactly known, small differences in the manufacturing of individual cars, how tightly every bolt has been tightened, etc., will lead to different results that can only be predicted in a statistical sense.

Many problems in the natural sciences and engineering are also rife with sources of uncertainty. Computer experiments on computer simulations are the most common approach to study problems in uncertainty quantification.[1][2][3][4

ChatGPT
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) focuses on the systematic process of identifying, quantifying, and managing uncertainties in computational and real-world scenarios. In essence, UQ seeks to evaluate how variable outcomes might be when certain elements or variables of a given system aren't known with absolute certainty.
The example provided illustrates this concept: even if one were to know the exact speed of two cars involved in a head-on collision, there are numerous factors (e.g., differences in manufacturing, the tightness of bolts, material inconsistencies, etc.) that could influence the outcome, such as the acceleration of a human body upon impact. Given these inherent uncertainties, outcomes can't be predicted deterministically, but rather in a statistical sense, providing a range or distribution of possible outcomes.
Furthermore, it's mentioned that uncertainty is not just exclusive to this example. Many real-world problems in natural sciences and engineering come with their sources of uncertainty. Computer simulations or computer experiments have become a popular method to study and address issues related to uncertainty quantification. Through simulations, it's possible to account for various uncertainties and analyze their potential impact on the results, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the system or scenario being studied.

Sources
Edit
Uncertainty can enter mathematical models and experimental measurements in various contexts. One way to categorize the sources of uncertainty is to consider:[5]

Parameter
This comes from the model parameters that are inputs to the computer model (mathematical model) but whose exact values are unknown to experimentalists and cannot be controlled in physical experiments, or whose values cannot be exactly inferred by statistical methods. Some examples of this are the local free-fall acceleration in a falling object experiment, various material properties in a finite element analysis for engineering, and multiplier uncertainty in the context of macroeconomic policy optimization.
Parametric
This comes from the variability of input variables of the model. For example, the dimensions of a work piece in a process of manufacture may not be exactly as designed and instructed, which would cause variability in its performance.
Structural uncertainty
Also known as model inadequacy, model bias, or model discrepancy, this comes from the lack of knowledge of the underlying physics in the problem. It depends on how accurately a mathematical model describes the true system for a real-life situation, considering the fact that models are almost always only approximations to reality. One example is when modeling the process of a falling object using the free-fall model; the model itself is inaccurate since there always exists air friction. In this case, even if there is no unknown parameter in the model, a discrepancy is still expected between the model and true physics.
Algorithmic
Also known as numerical uncertainty, or discrete uncertainty. This type comes from numerical errors and numerical approximations per implementation of the computer model. Most models are too complicated to solve exactly. For example, the finite element method or finite difference method may be used to approximate the solution of a partial differential equation (which introduces numerical errors). Other examples are numerical integration and infinite sum truncation that are necessary approximations in numerical implementation.
Experimental
Also known as observation error, this comes from the variability of experimental measurements. The experimental uncertainty is inevitable and can be noticed by repeating a measurement for many times using exactly the same settings for all inputs/variables.
Interpolation
This comes from a lack of available data collected from computer model simulations and/or experimental measurements. For other input settings that don't have simulation data or experimental measurements, one must interpolate or extrapolate in order to predict the corresponding responses
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The sources of uncertainty mentioned here delineate the various ways uncertainty can manifest in mathematical models and experimental measurements. Let's break them down for clarity:
Parameter Uncertainty
:
Arises from unknown model parameters that either cannot be controlled in physical experiments or cannot be precisely determined using statistical methods.
Example: The exact value of local free-fall acceleration in a dropping object experiment.
Parametric Uncertainty
:
Concerns the variability of model input variables.
Example: A manufactured part might not perfectly match its design dimensions, leading to variability in its function or performance.
Structural Uncertainty
:
Results from an incomplete understanding or approximation of the underlying processes or phenomena.
Example: Modeling a free-falling object without considering air resistance introduces structural uncertainty since the real-life process (with air friction) isn't perfectly captured.
Algorithmic Uncertainty
:
Emerges from numerical errors or approximations made when implementing a computer model.
Example: Using methods like finite element or finite difference to approximate the solution to a complex equation can introduce errors.
Experimental Uncertainty
:
Originates from variability in experimental measurements. This type of uncertainty is inherent in all measurements and can be observed by repeating the same experiment multiple times.
Example: Repeatedly measuring the length of an object with a ruler might yield slightly different results each time.
Interpolation Uncertainty
:
Comes into play when there's missing data, either from computer simulations or physical measurements. Predictions or estimations must be made for these missing data points, introducing uncertainty.
Example: If we have data for how a material behaves at 20��C and 30��C but not at 25��C, we must interpolate to estimate its behavior at 25��C.
By understanding and categorizing these sources of uncertainty, scientists and engineers can better design experiments, develop models, and interpret results, ensuring more robust conclusions and predictions.

uncertainty quantification a surrogate model, e.g. a Gaussian process or a Polynomial Chaos Expansion, is learnt from computer experiments, this surrogate exhibits epistemic uncertainty that depends on or interacts with the aleatoric uncertainty of the experimental parameters.[4] Such an uncertainty cannot solely be classified as aleatoric or epistemic any more, but is a more general inferential uncertainty.
In real life applications, both kinds of uncertainties are present. Uncertainty quantification intends to explicitly express both types of uncertainty separately. The quantification for the aleatoric uncertainties can be relatively straightforward, where traditional (frequentist) probability is the most basic form. Techniques such as the Monte Carlo method are frequently used. A probability distribution can be represented by its moments (in the Gaussian case, the mean and covariance suffice, although, in general, even knowledge of all moments to arbitrarily high order still does not specify the distribution function uniquely), or more recently, by techniques such as Karhunen���Lo��ve and polynomial chaos expansions. To evaluate epistemic uncertainties, the efforts are made to understand the (lack of) knowledge of the system, process or mechanism. Epistemic uncertainty is generally understood through the lens of Bayesian probability, where probabilities are interpreted as indicating how certain a rational person could be regarding a specific claim.

Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is an essential discipline in computational science and engineering that deals with the characterization and estimation of uncertainties in models, simulations, and real-world applications. The passage you provided delves into the intricacies of uncertainty and its different types, especially when using surrogate models. Let's distill the main points:
Types of Uncertainty
:
Aleatoric Uncertainty
: Due to inherent variability in a system. It's typically the "randomness" or "noise" that is inherently present and cannot be reduced even with more data.
Epistemic Uncertainty
: Stemming from lack of knowledge. It can be reduced with more information or better understanding.
Surrogate Models and Uncertainty
:
When surrogate models like Gaussian processes or Polynomial Chaos Expansions are used, they produce a type of uncertainty that combines both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. This combined uncertainty is called "inferential uncertainty".
Real-world Uncertainties
:
In practical scenarios, both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties exist concurrently. UQ aims to represent both types distinctly.
Quantification Methods
:
Aleatoric Uncertainties: They are often quantified using traditional probability methods. The Monte Carlo method is a standard tool. Representations include probability distribution moments (like mean and covariance) or methods like Karhunen���Lo��ve and polynomial chaos expansions.
Epistemic Uncertainties: These uncertainties stem from our lack of understanding or knowledge about a system. The Bayesian approach to probability is typically used to interpret epistemic uncertainty. In this framework, probabilities convey the degree of belief or confidence in a particular claim or outcome based on the available information.
In a nutshell, UQ is a complex but essential discipline that helps to differentiate, characterize, and quantify different sources of uncertainties in computational and experimental studies. This ensures that model predictions and decisions based on these models are made with a clear understanding of their associated risks and reliabilities.

Mathematical perspective
Edit
In mathematics, uncertainty is often characterized in terms of a probability distribution. From that perspective, epistemic uncertainty means not being certain what the relevant probability distribution is, and aleatoric uncertainty means not being certain what a random sample drawn from a probability distribution will be.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
From a mathematical standpoint, uncertainty is typically represented using probability theory. Here's a breakdown of your provided content:
Probability Distribution
: In mathematics, uncertain phenomena are often modeled using probability distributions. This means that instead of having a single predictable outcome, there's a range of possible outcomes, each with its own likelihood.
Types of Uncertainty
:
Epistemic Uncertainty
: This uncertainty stems from a lack of knowledge. Mathematically, it's the uncertainty about which probability distribution best represents the uncertain phenomenon. This type of uncertainty can potentially be reduced with more information or data.
Aleatoric Uncertainty
: This is the inherent randomness in a system. Even if you know the exact probability distribution, there's still uncertainty about the outcome of a specific random sample drawn from that distribution. This type of uncertainty is irreducible and is inherent to the system being observed.
In simpler terms, think of epistemic uncertainty as not being sure which dice you're rolling (e.g., a 6-sided die vs. an 8-sided die) and aleatoric uncertainty as not being sure what number will come up when you roll a known dice (e.g., rolling a standard 6-sided die and not knowing if it will land on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).

There are two major types of problems in uncertainty quantification: one is the forward propagation of uncertainty (where the various sources of uncertainty are propagated through the model to predict the overall uncertainty in the system response) and the other is the inverse assessment of model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty (where the model parameters are calibrated simultaneously using test data). There has been a proliferation of research on the former problem and a majority of uncertainty analysis techniques were developed for it. On the other hand, the latter problem is drawing increasing attention in the engineering design community, since uncertainty quantification of a model and the subsequent predictions of the true system response(s) are of great interest in designing robust systems.

Forward
Edit
See also: Propagation of uncertainty
Uncertainty propagation is the quantification of uncertainties in system output(s) propagated from uncertain inputs. It focuses on the influence on the outputs from the parametric variability listed in the sources of uncertainty. The targets of uncertainty propagation analysis can be:

To evaluate low-order moments of the outputs, i.e. mean and variance.
To evaluate the reliability of the outputs. This is especially useful in reliability engineering where outputs of a system are usually closely related to the performance of the system.
To assess the complete probability distribution of the outputs. This is useful in the scenario of utility optimization where the complete distribution is used to calculate the utility.
Inverse
Edit
See also: Inverse problem
Given some experimental measurements of a system and some computer simulation results from its mathematical model, inverse uncertainty quantification estimates the discrepancy between the experiment and the mathematical model (which is called bias correction), and estimates the values of unknown parameters in the model if there are any (which is called parameter calibration or simply calibration). Generally this is a much more difficult problem than forward uncertainty propagation; however it is of great importance since it is typically implemented in a model updating process. There are several scenarios in inverse uncertainty quantification:


The outcome of bias correction, including an updated model (prediction mean) and prediction confidence interval.
Bias correction only
Edit
Bias correction quantifies the model inadequacy, i.e. the discrepancy between the experiment and the mathematical model. The general model updating formula for bias correction is:

{\displaystyle y^{e}(\mathbf {x} )=y^{m}(\mathbf {x} )+\delta (\mathbf {x} )+\varepsilon }y^{e}({\mathbf  {x}})=y^{m}({\mathbf  {x}})+\delta ({\mathbf  {x}})+\varepsilon 
where {\displaystyle y^{e}(\mathbf {x} )}y^{e}({\mathbf  {x}}) denotes the experimental measurements as a function of several input variables {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }\mathbf {x} , {\displaystyle y^{m}(\mathbf {x} )}y^{m}({\mathbf  {x}}) denotes the computer model (mathematical model) response, {\displaystyle \delta (\mathbf {x} )}\delta ({\mathbf  {x}}) denotes the additive discrepancy function (aka bias function), and {\displaystyle \varepsilon }\varepsilon  denotes the experimental uncertainty. The objective is to estimate the discrepancy function {\displaystyle \delta (\mathbf {x} )}\delta ({\mathbf  {x}}), and as a by-product, the resulting updated model is {\displaystyle y^{m}(\mathbf {x} )+\delta (\mathbf {x} )}y^{m}({\mathbf  {x}})+\delta ({\mathbf  {x}}). A prediction confidence interval is provided with the updated model as the quantification of the uncertainty.

Parameter calibration only
Edit
Parameter calibration estimates the values of one or more unknown parameters in a mathematical model. The general model updating formulation for calibration is:

{\displaystyle y^{e}(\mathbf {x} )=y^{m}(\mathbf {x} ,{\boldsymbol {\theta }}^{*})+\varepsilon }y^{e}({\mathbf  {x}})=y^{m}({\mathbf  {x}},{\boldsymbol  {\theta }}^{*})+\varepsilon 
where {\displaystyle y^{m}(\mathbf {x} ,{\boldsymbol {\theta }})}y^{m}({\mathbf  {x}},{\boldsymbol  {\theta }}) denotes the computer model response that depends on several unknown model parameters {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\theta }}}{\boldsymbol  {\theta }}, and {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\theta }}^{*}}{\boldsymbol  {\theta }}^{*} denotes the true values of the unknown parameters in the course of experiments. The objective is to either estimate {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\theta }}^{*}}{\boldsymbol  {\theta }}^{*}, or to come up with a probability distribution of {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\theta }}^{*}}{\boldsymbol  {\theta }}^{*} that encompasses the best knowledge of the true parameter values.

Bias correction and parameter calibration
Edit
It considers an inaccurate model with one or more unknown parameters, and its model updating formulation combines the two together:

{\displaystyle y^{e}(\mathbf {x} )=y^{m}(\mathbf {x} ,{\boldsymbol {\theta }}^{*})+\delta (\mathbf {x} )+\varepsilon }y^{e}({\mathbf  {x}})=y^{m}({\mathbf  {x}},{\boldsymbol  {\theta }}^{*})+\delta ({\mathbf  {x}})+\varepsilon 
It is the most comprehensive model updating formulation that includes all possible sources of uncertainty, and it requires the most effort to solve.

In uncertainty quantification, there are two main types of problems: forward propagation of uncertainty and inverse assessment. Here's a simplified summary of what you provided:
Forward Propagation of Uncertainty
: This involves taking known uncertainties from input parameters and understanding how they affect the outcomes (outputs).
Purpose
:
Calculate basic statistics of the outputs (like mean and variance).
Understand the reliability of these outputs, especially if they're tied to system performance.
Get the complete probability distribution of the outputs, helpful for optimization scenarios.
Inverse Assessment
: Here, you have some real-world data (experimental measurements) and some results from a computer simulation. The goal is to align the simulation with reality by adjusting the model. This involves:
Bias Correction Only
: This quantifies the discrepancy between the real-world data and the model. The aim is to identify and correct this bias so the model is more accurate.
Parameter Calibration Only
: This adjusts unknown parameters in the model to make it fit experimental data better.
Bias Correction and Parameter Calibration
: This is a comprehensive approach. If a model has unknown parameters and is also slightly inaccurate, this method adjusts the model to fit the real-world data, considering both bias and parameter uncertainties.
To visualize it simply
:
Forward propagation is like throwing a stone into a pond and predicting where the ripples will go based on how you threw it.
Inverse assessment is like seeing ripples in a pond and trying to determine how the stone was thrown.
Both types of problems are crucial in the engineering and scientific community. While much research has been done on forward problems, the inverse assessment is gaining traction because it's essential for creating reliable and robust systems.

Selective methodologies
Edit
Much research has been done to solve uncertainty quantification problems, though a majority of them deal with uncertainty propagation. During the past one to two decades, a number of approaches for inverse uncertainty quantification problems have also been developed and have proved to be useful for most small- to medium-scale problems.

Forward propagation
Edit
Existing uncertainty propagation approaches include probabilistic approaches and non-probabilistic approaches. There are basically six categories of probabilistic approaches for uncertainty propagation:[9]

Simulation-based methods: Monte Carlo simulations, importance sampling, adaptive sampling, etc.
General surrogate-based methods: In a non-instrusive approach, a surrogate model is learnt in order to replace the experiment or the simulation with a cheap and fast approximation. Surrogate-based methods can also be employed in a fully Bayesian fashion. [10][4][11][12] This approach has proven particularly powerful when the cost of sampling, e.g. computationally expensive simulations, is prohibitively high.
Local expansion-based methods: Taylor series, perturbation method, etc. These methods have advantages when dealing with relatively small input variability and outputs that don't express high nonlinearity. These linear or linearized methods are detailed in the article Uncertainty propagation.
Functional expansion-based methods: Neumann expansion, orthogonal or Karhunen���Loeve expansions (KLE), with polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and wavelet expansions as special cases.
Most probable point (MPP)-based methods: first-order reliability method (FORM) and second-order reliability method (SORM).
Numerical integration-based methods: Full factorial numerical integration (FFNI) and dimension reduction (DR).
For non-probabilistic approaches, interval analysis,[13] Fuzzy theory, Possibility theory and evidence theory are among the most widely used.

The probabilistic approach is considered as the most rigorous approach to uncertainty analysis in engineering design due to its consistency with the theory of decision analysis. Its cornerstone is the calculation of probability density functions for sampling statistics.[14] This can be performed rigorously for random variables that are obtainable as transformations of Gaussian variables, leading to exact confidence intervals

Selective Methodologies for Uncertainty Quantification
When dealing with uncertainty in scientific and engineering contexts, various methods have been developed to quantify and understand it. The focus has largely been on forward propagation, though inverse uncertainty methods have also gained traction. Here's a condensed overview:
Forward Propagation Methods
:
Probabilistic Approaches
:
Simulation-based methods
: Techniques like Monte Carlo simulations, importance sampling, and adaptive sampling are used. These are essentially experiments run multiple times to understand the spread and impact of uncertainty.
General surrogate-based methods
: Instead of directly running a potentially costly or time-consuming experiment or simulation, a surrogate model is created. This is a simplified representation that can be "queried" much more quickly. When data collection is expensive or slow, surrogate models are invaluable.
Local expansion-based methods
: These include methods like the Taylor series or perturbation method. They're good for scenarios where the input variability is small and outputs are not highly nonlinear.
Functional expansion-based methods
: Techniques such as Neumann expansion or orthogonal expansions like the Karhunen���Lo��ve expansions. Special cases include polynomial chaos expansion and wavelet expansions.
Most probable point (MPP)-based methods
: This includes the first-order reliability method (FORM) and the second-order reliability method (SORM), which focus on understanding the most likely scenarios.
Numerical integration-based methods
: These involve methods like Full factorial numerical integration (FFNI) and dimension reduction (DR) which mathematically integrate over the sources of uncertainty.
Non-Probabilistic Approaches
:
Interval Analysis
: Instead of giving a specific value, you give a range (or interval) where the value can lie.
Fuzzy Theory
: This approach deals with possibilities rather than exact probabilities. For instance, the possibility that an event is "somewhat likely" or "very unlikely".
Possibility Theory
: Similar to fuzzy theory, but often used for a different set of problems.
Evidence Theory
: This method is used when evidence or information is combined from various sources to determine uncertainty.
The probabilistic approach is often viewed as the most rigorous for uncertainty analysis in engineering design. It aligns well with decision analysis theories and focuses on the calculation of probability density functions, leading to exact confidence intervals when variables transform from Gaussian distributions.

Module 4: Prediction of the experimental response and discrepancy function
Full approach
Edit
Fully Bayesian approach requires that not only the priors for unknown parameters {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\theta }}}{\boldsymbol  {\theta }} but also the priors for the other hyperparameters {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\varphi }}}{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\varphi }}} should be assigned. It follows the following steps:[16]

Derive the posterior distribution {\displaystyle p({\boldsymbol {\theta }},{\boldsymbol {\varphi }}\mid {\text{data}})}{\displaystyle p({\boldsymbol {\theta }},{\boldsymbol {\varphi }}\mid {\text{data}})};
Integrate {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\varphi }}}{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\varphi }}} out and obtain {\displaystyle p({\boldsymbol {\theta }}\mid {\text{data}})}{\displaystyle p({\boldsymbol {\theta }}\mid {\text{data}})}. This single step accomplishes the calibration;
Prediction of the experimental response and discrepancy function.
However, the approach has significant drawbacks:

For most cases, {\displaystyle p({\boldsymbol {\theta }},{\boldsymbol {\varphi }}\mid {\text{data}})}{\displaystyle p({\boldsymbol {\theta }},{\boldsymbol {\varphi }}\mid {\text{data}})} is a highly intractable function of {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\varphi }}}{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\varphi }}}. Hence the integration becomes very troublesome. Moreover, if priors for the other hyperparameters {\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\varphi }}}{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\varphi }}} are not carefully chosen, the complexity in numerical integration increases even more.
In the prediction stage, the prediction (which should at least include the expected value of system responses) also requires numerical integration. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is often used for integration; however it is computationally expensive.
The fully Bayesian approach requires a huge amount of calculations and may not yet be practical for dealing with the most complicated modelling situations.[16]

Module 4: Prediction of the Experimental Response and Discrepancy Function - Full Approach
Fully Bayesian Approach
:
In Bayesian statistics, the approach is based on updating prior beliefs (priors) with new evidence (data) to obtain more informed posterior beliefs (posteriors). In the context of uncertainty quantification, this approach involves not just the unknown parameters,
��
{\boldsymbol {\theta }}
��
, but also the hyperparameters,
��
{\boldsymbol {\varphi }}
��
. Here's a summary of the process:
Derive the Posterior Distribution

p({\boldsymbol {\theta }},{\boldsymbol {\varphi }}| {\text{data}})
p
(

, is often complex and difficult to handle, especially as a function of
��
{\boldsymbol {\varphi }}
��
. This makes the integration step challenging. If the priors for the hyperparameters are not well-defined, the numerical integration becomes even more complex.
Computational Expenses in Prediction
: Predictions, especially those involving expected values of system responses, require additional numerical integration. Techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are common, but they're computationally demanding.
Practicality
: Given the computational challenges and the need for a high level of calculations, the fully Bayesian approach might not be feasible for highly complex models or situations.
In essence, while the Bayesian approach is theoretically sound and can provide comprehensive insights, its practical implementation in highly complex scenarios is challenging due to computational demands and intricacies associated with hyperparameters.

Could you give some simplified everyday life examples?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's illustrate the concepts of forward propagation, inverse uncertainty quantification, and the Bayesian approach using everyday examples:
1. Forward Propagation
:
Imagine you're baking a cake.
Uncertain Inputs
: You're unsure about the exact quantity of ingredients. For instance, you think you might have between 1.9 to 2.1 cups of flour.
Propagation
: Depending on how much flour you use, the cake might be either too dense or too fluffy.
Output
: The final taste and texture of the cake is uncertain due to the uncertainty in the amount of flour.
2. Inverse Uncertainty Quantification
:
You have a family recipe for a stew. You tasted a stew at a family gathering, and it tasted different from when you cook it. You want to determine what might have been different.
Bias Correction
: After some thinking, you realize your aunt always uses a specific brand of beef stock, which you don't. That���s the discrepancy.
Parameter Calibration
: You remember not being sure about the amount of salt and pepper in the recipe. By comparing the taste of your stew with the one at the gathering, you adjust (calibrate) your salt and pepper amounts.
3. Fully Bayesian Approach
:
Imagine you're trying to predict the daily rainfall in your city.
Prior Belief
: You believe it's going to rain between 1 to 3 inches based on historical data.
New Evidence
: The morning news predicts 2.5 inches of rain.
Posterior Belief (Updated)
: Taking both your prior belief and the new data into account, you might now believe the rain will likely be around 2.3 to 2.7 inches.
Challenges
: If you tried to incorporate more factors like wind speed, humidity, etc., predicting the exact rainfall could become complex and computationally demanding, similar to the Bayesian challenges in complex models.
Hope these examples help simplify the concepts!

Energy-based Out-of-distribution Detection
Weitang Liu, Xiaoyun Wang, John D. Owens, Yixuan Li
Determining whether inputs are out-of-distribution (OOD) is an essential building block for safely deploying machine learning models in the open world. However, previous methods relying on the softmax confidence score suffer from overconfident posterior distributions for OOD data. We propose a unified framework for OOD detection that uses an energy score. We show that energy scores better distinguish in- and out-of-distribution samples than the traditional approach using the softmax scores. Unlike softmax confidence scores, energy scores are theoretically aligned with the probability density of the inputs and are less susceptible to the overconfidence issue. Within this framework, energy can be flexibly used as a scoring function for any pre-trained neural classifier as well as a trainable cost function to shape the energy surface explicitly for OOD detection. On a CIFAR-10 pre-trained WideResNet, using the energy score reduces the average FPR (at TPR 95%) by 18.03% compared to the softmax confidence score. With energy-based training, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on common benchmarks.

ChatGPT
This is an abstract for a paper titled "Energy-based Out-of-distribution Detection" by Weitang Liu, Xiaoyun Wang, John D. Owens, and Yixuan Li. Let's break down the main points:
Purpose
: The paper addresses the challenge of determining if input data is out-of-distribution (OOD), which is crucial for the safe deployment of machine learning models in real-world scenarios.
Issue with Previous Methods
: Traditional methods that rely on softmax confidence scores tend to produce overconfident posterior distributions when dealing with OOD data. This can be problematic, leading to false assurances about the model's performance on unfamiliar data.
Proposed Solution
: The authors introduce a unified framework for OOD detection that leverages an "energy score". This score is posited to be more effective than softmax scores at differentiating between in-distribution and OOD samples.
Advantages of Energy Scores
: Unlike softmax scores, which can become overconfident, energy scores are theoretically linked with the probability density of the inputs. This makes them less prone to the overconfidence problem.
Flexibility
: The energy score is versatile and can be used as both a scoring function for pre-existing neural classifiers and a trainable cost function. This means it can be integrated with existing systems or used to shape a new model's energy surface specifically for OOD detection.
Performance Metrics
: The paper presents empirical results showing the efficacy of the energy score. For instance, on a model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset (using WideResNet), the energy score lowered the average False Positive Rate (FPR) by 18.03% (when True Positive Rate (TPR) was 95%) in comparison to using the softmax confidence score.
Comparison with State-of-the-Art
: The proposed method with energy-based training outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods on widely recognized benchmarks.
In essence, this paper highlights the potential benefits of using energy scores over traditional softmax confidence scores for detecting OOD inputs, aiming to enhance the safety and reliability of deploying machine learning models in diverse environments.

No Pseudolikelihood for Me: Training Potts Models with Contrastive Divergence for Protein Design
The current 250 million known protein sequences are the result of the generative process evolution. Similar sequences that have likely evolved from the same ancestral sequence, also known as homologs, are clustered in families stored in the Pfam database. Potts models trained on a Pfam family can predict a common protein 3D structure to the sequences in that family, predict the beneficial or detrimental effect of mutations, and recently be sampled to generate novel sequences for protein design.

A protein is a string of amino acids, also called residues, that in cells can adopt a 3-dimensional fold. These folds mean that two residues far apart in the sequence can be nearby in 3D space. One assumption underlying all protein science is that proteins structures prefer to adopt low energy states. Interactions with neighbouring atoms should be locally favourable. Thus, for mutations to not disrupt protein folds, residues nearby in 3D space tend to coevolve, i.e. a residue���s evolutionary trajectory is dependent on nearby residues. Potts models are attractive for protein modelling because of its inductive bias. In particular the pairwise term can capture coevolutionary information in sequences.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
This seems to be an introduction or abstract for a paper or article related to using Potts models for protein design. Let's break it down for clarity:
Background
: The known protein sequences (250 million of them) have emerged as a result of evolution. Homologous sequences, or sequences that have likely descended from a common ancestor, are grouped into families. These families are stored in the Pfam database.
Importance of Potts Models
: These models, when trained on a specific Pfam family, can:
Predict a common 3D structure shared by the sequences within that family.
Foresee whether certain mutations will be beneficial or harmful.
Be sampled to produce new sequences, which is beneficial for designing proteins.
Proteins Defined
: Proteins are chains of amino acids (referred to as residues). While these residues are linear in sequence, within a cell, they can fold into complex 3D structures.
Significance of Folds
: Even if two residues are distant from each other in the sequence, they can be close in the 3D spatial arrangement. The way proteins fold is significant to their function.
Underlying Assumption
: All protein science is based on the assumption that protein structures gravitate towards low energy states. This means they adopt shapes and configurations that are energetically favorable. The atoms interact in a way that's beneficial locally.
Coevolution in Proteins
: Residues that are in proximity within the 3D space tend to evolve in a coordinated manner. This means that if one residue changes or mutates, it can influence the evolution of neighboring residues.
Why Potts Models?
: Potts models are especially suitable for protein modeling. Their structure, particularly the pairwise term, can detect and encapsulate the coevolutionary information present in sequences.
In summary, this piece emphasizes the potential of Potts models in understanding and predicting protein structures and evolution, especially given their capability to capture coevolutionary patterns in protein sequences.

Sharon Li's Recognition & Her Research in AI
: Sharon Li was recognized by MIT Technology Review for her contributions to the AI field. One significant area of research in AI is detecting when an AI system is faced with data it hasn't seen before, or "out-of-distribution" (OOD) data. Ensuring that AI systems can identify and handle OOD data safely is crucial for real-world applications, where unexpected inputs can have significant consequences.
Energy-based OOD Detection
: The study by Weitang Liu, Xiaoyun Wang, John D. Owens, and Yixuan Li proposed a framework for OOD detection using energy scores. This approach seeks to rectify issues with traditional softmax confidence scores which can be overconfident for OOD data. The energy scores, which align better with the probability density of inputs, offer a more robust means to differentiate between in-distribution and OOD data.
Potts Models for Protein Design
: The use of Potts models in bioinformatics is an example of applying AI and statistical models to understand complex biological systems, like protein structures. Just as AI models need to understand and predict uncertain scenarios, proteins are subjected to evolutionary pressures, where mutations can have beneficial or detrimental effects. Understanding these mutations and predicting their consequences requires models that can capture the intricate relationships between amino acid sequences.
Connecting the Dots
:
AI systems, such as those used in bioinformatics, must be robust and reliable. Detecting when they are faced with unfamiliar data (OOD detection) ensures they do not make overconfident predictions or errors, especially in sensitive applications like predicting protein structures or mutations.
Energy-based models, like the one proposed for OOD detection, offer a way to represent complex systems, whether it's distinguishing unfamiliar data in AI or understanding protein sequences in biology.
In both cases, the ultimate goal is to develop models that are both accurate and interpretable. For AI systems, this means understanding when they're uncertain. For protein models, it's about predicting how sequences will behave in the real world.
In summary, while the specific applications and methods may vary, the overarching theme is the importance of understanding and accounting for uncertainty and complexity in both AI and biological systems.

Learning Equations for Extrapolation and Control
Subham Sahoo, Christoph Lampert, Georg Martius Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Machine Learning, PMLR 80:4442-4450, 2018.
Abstract
We present an approach to identify concise equations from data using a shallow neural network approach. In contrast to ordinary black-box regression, this approach allows understanding functional relations and generalizing them from observed data to unseen parts of the parameter space. We show how to extend the class of learnable equations for a recently proposed equation learning network to include divisions, and we improve the learning and model selection strategy to be useful for challenging real-world data. For systems governed by analytical expressions, our method can in many cases identify the true underlying equation and extrapolate to unseen domains. We demonstrate its effectiveness by experiments on a cart-pendulum system, where only 2 random rollouts are required to learn the forward dynamics and successfully achieve the swing-up task.

ChatGPT
This paper, "Learning Equations for Extrapolation and Control" by Subham Sahoo, Christoph Lampert, and Georg Martius, delves into the realm of extracting structured knowledge from data. Here's a breakdown of the abstract and its connection with our previous discussions:
Main Idea
:
The authors introduce a method that employs a shallow neural network to deduce concise equations from data. Unlike typical black-box regression models, which are hard to interpret, this method aims to reveal the functional relationships within the data. This has the advantage of understanding and extrapolating these relationships to parts of the parameter space that have not been observed.
Key Contributions
:
Expanding Learnable Equations
: The authors expand the class of equations that a recently suggested equation learning network can learn. They incorporate the capability to handle divisions.
Improved Learning and Model Selection
: The strategy for both learning from data and selecting the right model has been enhanced to be more effective on real-world, complex data.
Application on Cart-Pendulum System
: As a testament to its effectiveness, they applied their method on a cart-pendulum system. With just two random data sequences (or rollouts), the method was able to understand the forward dynamics of the system and successfully complete a swing-up task, which is a challenging control objective.
Connections to Previous Topics
:
Understanding AI Outputs
: Just like the emphasis on understanding why an AI system might be uncertain or how it detects out-of-distribution data, this method focuses on understanding the functional relationships in data. Instead of a black-box model, it gives an interpretable equation.
Safety and Robustness in AI
: Extrapolating to unseen parts of the parameter space is akin to handling OOD data. By understanding the functional relationships, the system can make safer and more informed predictions about unfamiliar scenarios.
Complex Systems Understanding
: Similar to how Potts models try to understand protein structures and interactions, this method aims to deduce the governing equations of complex systems from data.
In essence, the paper echoes a recurring theme in AI: the need for interpretability and understanding, especially when AI is applied to complex systems or scenarios where safety and reliability are paramount.

1. Introduction 
In machine learning, models are typically treated as black- 
box function approximators that are only judged by their 
ability to predict correctly for unseen data (from the same 
distribution).In contrast, in the natural sciences, one 
searches for interpretable models that provide a deeper un- 
derstanding of the system of interest and allow formulating 
hypotheses about unseen situations. The latter is only pos- 
sible if the true underlying functional relationship behind 
the data has been identif i ed. Therefore, when scientists con- 
struct models, they do not only minimize a training error but 
also impose constraints based on prior knowledge: models 
should be plausible, i.e. consist of components that have 
physical expressions in the real world, and they should be 
interpretable, which typically means that they consist only 
of a small number of interacting units.

Machine learning research has only very recently started 
to look into related techniques. As a i rst work, Martius & 
Lampert (2016) recently proposed EQL, a neural network 
architecture for identifying functional relations between ob- 
served inputs and outputs. Their networks represent only 
plausible functions through a specif i c choice of activation 
functions and it prefers simple over complex solutions by 
imposing sparsity regularization. However, EQL has two 
signif i cant shortcomings: i rst, it is not able to represent di- 
visions, thereby severely limiting to which physical systems 
it can be applied, and second, its model selection procedure 
is unreliable in identifying the true functional relation out 
of multiple plausible candidates. 
In this paper, we propose an improved network for 
equation learning, EQL��, that overcomes the limitation 
of the earlier works. In particular, our main contributions are 
1.we propose a network architecture that can handle di- 
visions as well as techniques to keep training stable, 
2.we improve model/instance selection to be more effec- 
tive in identifying the right network/equation, 
3.we demonstrate how to reliably control a dynamical 
robotic system by learning its forward dynamics equa- 
tions from very few random tryouts/tails. 
The following section describes the equation learning 
method by Martius & Lampert (2016) and introduces our 
improvements. Afterwards, we discuss its relation to other 
prior work. In Section 4 we present experimental results 
on identifying equations and in Section 5 we show its ap- 
plication to robot control. We close with a discussion and 
outlook. 
2. Identifying equation with a network 
We consider a regression problem, where the data originates 
from a system that can be described by an (unknown) ana- 
lytical function,�� : Rn��� Rm. A typical example could be 
a system of ordinary differential equations that describes the 
dynamics of a robot, or the predator-prey equations of an 
ecosystem. The observed data,{(x1,y1),...,(xN,yN)} 
is assumed to originate fromy = ��(x) + ��with additive 
zero-mean noise��. Since��is unknown, we model the input- 
output relationship with a function�� : Rn��� Rmand

The introduction section you provided addresses the issue of interpretability and model generalization in machine learning. Let's break down the key points and see how it relates to the topics we've discussed:
Main Points
:
Black-box Models vs. Interpretable Models
: Traditional machine learning often treats models as black boxes, valuing only their predictive accuracy. However, in natural sciences, the emphasis is on interpretable models that offer deeper insights into the system being studied and that can extrapolate to unseen situations.
Prior Knowledge Constraints
: When scientists create models, they incorporate prior knowledge and constraints to ensure the models are plausible and interpretable. In other words, the models should make logical sense in the real-world context and consist of a few key components that are easy to understand.
EQL by Martius & Lampert (2016)
: They proposed an architecture called EQL to identify functional relations between inputs and outputs. It aimed to represent plausible functions and preferred simpler models through sparsity regularization. However, this architecture had two significant limitations:
Could not handle divisions.
Inaccurate in identifying the true function when multiple plausible candidates were available.
This Paper's Contribution (EQL��)
:
Proposes a modified architecture that can manage divisions and maintains training stability.
Refines model selection to pinpoint the right equation.
Illustrates the application of this model to control a robot by learning its dynamic equations from limited trials.
Learning Equations
:
The paper addresses a regression problem where the underlying system is guided by some analytical function (e.g., the dynamics of a robot or an ecosystem's predator-prey equations).
The goal is to model this function based on observed data and predict even in parts of the space not seen during training.
Connections to Previous Topics
:
Understanding AI Outputs & Safety
: The need for understanding models (interpretable vs. black-box) echoes the emphasis on understanding AI systems' outputs and the desire for safe AI. Ensuring models are interpretable can enhance their trustworthiness and safety.
Handling Out-of-Distribution Data
: The capability of the proposed model to make predictions in unseen areas of the feature space resonates with our discussions on out-of-distribution detection and the challenges faced by AI models in the real world.
Complex Systems Understanding
: Like the Potts models for protein structures and the energy-based OOD detection method, this paper emphasizes understanding complex systems. The primary aim here is to grasp and model the functional relationships governing these systems.
In summary, this introduction underscores the importance of moving from solely black-box models in machine learning to more interpretable models that can generalize well, especially when dealing with complex systems. This shift aligns with broader trends and concerns in the AI and machine learning community.

2.1. Equation Learner 
Before introducing EQL��, we i rst recapitulate the work- 
ing principles of the previously proposed Equation Learner 
(EQL) network. It uses a multi-layer feed-forward network 
with units representing the building blocks of algebraic ex- 
pressions. Instead of homogeneous hidden units, each unit 
has a specif i c function, e.g. identity, cosine or multiplica- 
tion, see Fig. 1. Complex functions are implemented by 
alternating linear transformations,z(l)= W(l)y(l���1)+w(l) 
o 
in layerl, with the application of the base-functions. There 
areuunary functionsf1,...,fu,fi��� {identity,sin,cos}, 
which receive the respective component,z1,...,zu. The 
vbinary functions,g1,...,gvreceive the remaining com- 
ponent,zu+1,...,zu+2v, as input in pairs of two. In EQL 
these are multiplication units that compute the product of 
their two input values:gj(a,b) := a �� b. 
The output of the 
unary and binary units are concatenated to form the output 
y(l)of layerl. The last layer computes the regression values 
by a linear read-out 
y(L):= W(L)y(L���1)+ w(L) 
o .(1) 
For a more detailed discussion of the architecture, see (Mar- 
tius & Lampert, 2016). 
2.2. Introducing division units 
The EQL architecture has some immediate shortcomings. 
In particular, it cannot model divisions, which are, however, 
common in the equations governing physical systems. We, 
therefore, propose a new architecture, EQL��, that includes 
division units, which calculatea/b. Note that this is a non- 
trivial step because any division creates a pole atb ��� 0with 
an abrupt change in convexity and diverging function value 
and its derivative. Such a divergence is a serious problem 
for gradient based optimization methods. 
To overcome the divergence problem, we i rst notice that 
from any real system we cannot encounter data at the pole 
itself because natural quantities do not diverge. This im- 
plies that a single branch of the hyperbola1/bwithb > 0 
suff i ces as a basis function. As a further simplif i cation we 
use divisions only in the ouput layer. 
Finally, in order to prevent problems during optimization 
we introduce a curriculum approach for optimization, pro- 
gressing from a strongly regularized version of division to 
the unregularized one. 
Regularized Division:Instead of EQL���s Eq.(1), the last 
layer of the EQL��is 
y(L):= ? 
h�� 1(z 
(L) 
1 ,z(L) 
2 ),...,h�� m(z 
(L) 
2m,z

where h��(a,b) is the division-activation function given by 
h��(a,b) := ( 
a 
b if b > �� 
0otherwise 
,(3) 
where�� ��� 0is 
a threshold, see Fig. 2. Note that using 
h��= 0as the value when the denominator is below�� 
(forbidden values ofb) sets the gradient to zero, avoiding 
misleading parameter updates. So the discontinuity plays 
no role in practice. 
Penalty term:To steer the network away from negative 
values of the denominator, we add a cost term to our ob- 
jective that penalizes ���forbidden��� inputs to each division 
unit: p��(b) := max(�� ��� b,0),(4)

nator, see Fig. 2. The global penalty term is then

In this section, the authors delve into the architecture of their improved Equation Learner, EQL��, and specifically introduce the concept of division units to address the shortcomings of the previous EQL network. Here's a breakdown:
2.1. Equation Learner (EQL)
:
EQL Basics
: EQL is a multi-layer feed-forward network where each unit represents a specific algebraic operation such as identity, cosine, or multiplication. It's not just a homogeneous network but has specific roles for each of its units.
Functionality
: EQL uses linear transformations and applies base-functions on them. It has:
Unary functions like identity, sine, and cosine.
Binary functions which are multiplication units that calculate the product of two inputs.
Output Computation
: The final layer computes the regression values through a linear transformation.
2.2. Introducing division units
:
Need for Division
: The original EQL couldn't model divisions, which are crucial for equations in physical systems.
Challenges with Division
: Directly implementing division poses a challenge due to the divergence problem, i.e., dividing by near-zero values can lead to very large outputs and thus introduce instability in gradient-based optimization.
Solution
: The authors note that in real systems, data never really reaches the point of causing a pole (i.e., division by zero). They also restrict the use of division to the output layer only, which simplifies the architecture.
Regularized Division
: To tackle the issues with raw division, the authors introduce a division-activation function that only divides when the denominator is above a certain threshold. This way, they avoid issues tied to very small denominators.
Penalty Term
: To further ensure stability, a penalty term is added to the cost function to discourage the network from using denominators that are too small. This penalty term linearly increases for function values below the desired threshold.
Figure 2 Explanation
: The figure visualizes the regularized division function and the associated penalty term. It showcases how the penalty term increases for function values below the chosen threshold.
In essence, this section details the significant enhancement of the original EQL by introducing the capability to handle division operations, while ensuring stability and avoiding pitfalls associated with such operations. This makes the improved EQL�� more versatile and capable of modeling a wider range of equations, especially those prevalent in physical systems.

Penalty Epochs:While Eq.(5)prevents negative values in 
the denominator at training time, the right equation should 
not have negative denominators even for potential extrapo- 
lation data. Similarly, we would like to prevent that output 
values on future data have a very different magnitude than 
the observed outputs, as this could be a sign of overf i tting 
(e.g. learning a polynomial of too high-degree). To enforce 
this we introduce particular penalty epochs, which are in- 
jected at regular intervals (every 50 epochs) into the training 
process. 
During a penalty epoch we randomly sampleNinput data 
points in the expected test range (including extrapolation 
region) without labels and the network is trained using the 
cost LPenalty= 
P��+ Pbound, where the latter is given by: 
Pbound:= 
N X 
i=1 
n X 
j=1 
max(y(L) 
j (xi) ��� B,0)(6) 
+max(���y(L) 
j (xi) ��� B,0). 
The valueBref l ects the maximal desired output value. It is, 
of course, problem dependent but can easily be estimated 
from the observed training data. The system is insensitive 
to the exact choice. In our experiments, expected outputs 
are [���3,3] and we use B = 10. 
Curriculum:The threshold��in the division function 
Eq.(3)plays the role of avoiding overly large gradients. 
However, ultimately we want to learn the precise equa- 
tion so we introduce a curriculum during training in which 
regularization is reduced continuously. More precisely,�� 
decreases with epoch t as 
��(t) = 1/���t + 1.(7) 
For validation and testing, we use �� = 10���4. 
2.3. Network training 
EQL��is fully differentiable in its free parameters�� = 
{W(1),...,W(L),b(1),...,b(L)}, 
which allows us to train 
it in an end-to-end fashion using back-propagation. The 
objective is Lasso-like (Tibshirani, 1996), 
L = 
1 
N 
N X 
i=1 k��(xi) ��� yik2+ 
�� 
L X 
l=1 ? ?W(l)?? 
1 + P��(8) 
that is, a linear combination ofL2loss andL1regularization 
extended by the penalty term for small and negative denom- 
inators, see Eq.(4). Note thatPbound(Eq. 6) is only used in 
the penalty epochs. For training, we apply a stochastic gradi- 
ent descent algorithm with mini-batches and Adam (Kingma 
& Ba, 2015) for calculating the updates. The choice of 
Adam is not critical, as we observed that standard stochastic 
gradient descent also works, though it might take longer. 
RegularizationPhases:We follow the same regularization 
scheme as proposed in Martius & Lampert (2016). The 
role of the regularization is to create a network with sparse 
connections, corresponding to the few terms appearing in 
a typical formula describing a physical system. Ideally, we 
would like to minimize theL0norm directly, but this would 
make the loss not differentiable. As commonly done, we use 
theL1norm as a substitute. However, as detailed below, we 
add a step for emulating a trade-off free L0minimization. 
The regularization scheme is as follows: we start with an 
un-regularized phase (�� = 0) because starting withL1reg- 
ularization sometimes causes weights not to change sign 
during training but getting ���trapped��� at zero. We continue 
by a phase, where regularization is normally enabled by 
setting��to a nonzero value, which has the effect that a 
sparse network structure emerges. Such a phasing was also 
suggest by Carpenter (2008). As a side remark, subgradient 
methods or clipping (Schmidt et al., 2009; Carpenter, 2008) 
was not required to deal with theL1regularizer because 
potentially slight weight l uctuations around zero are not 
important due to the next phase which is motivated by the 
following fact. A non-zeroL1regularization term leads to a 
trade-off between minimizing the loss and the regularizer. 
Since our aim is to learn the right functional form with the 
correct coeff i cients, we add a third phase where we disable 
L1regularization (�� = 0) but enforce the sameL0norm 
of the weights. This is achieved by keeping all weights 
w ��� W1...Lthat 
are close to0at0, i.e. if|w| < 0.001then 
w = 0during the remaining epochs. In this way, the model 
complexity is i xed and we ensure that function values i t 
the observed values as closely as possible, allowing for a 
correct parameter estimation. It also eliminates any poten- 
tial l uctuations of small weights that might occur during 
theL1phase. The effect of the regularization phases is 
schematically illustrated in Fig. 3. 
We uset1=

20T, where Tis the total 
number of epochs, large enough to ensure convergence,

Note, that early stopping will be 
disadvantageous.

keeping small weights at zero and allowing all other weights to 
go to their correct value. Figure adapted from Martius & Lampert

In this segment, the authors further detail the training process of the EQL�� model, emphasizing the importance of certain regularization techniques to ensure the accuracy and stability of the model. Here's a summary:
Penalty Epochs
:
Objective
: Ensure that the trained model doesn't produce negative denominators, even for extrapolation data. They also want to guard against overfitting.
Implementation
: Every 50 epochs, they introduce a "penalty epoch" where they sample input data points in the expected test and extrapolation range. The loss during these epochs includes both the penalty for small/negative denominators and a boundary penalty for output values that deviate too much from the expected range.
Curriculum
:
The threshold �� in the division function helps avoid large gradients during training.
Over the course of training, this threshold is gradually reduced, making the model more precise over time.
For testing and validation, a very small threshold is used.
2.3. Network Training
:
Model Parameters
: EQL�� is trained end-to-end using back-propagation, optimizing over the free parameters.
Objective Function
: They use a Lasso-like loss, which is a combination of L2 loss and L1 regularization, and also include the penalty for small/negative denominators. The boundary penalty is only used during penalty epochs.
Optimization
: They utilize stochastic gradient descent with mini-batches and employ the Adam optimizer. However, they note that even standard SGD can work, albeit potentially slower.
Regularization Phases
:
Purpose
: Achieve a sparse network, which means fewer active connections. This reflects real-world equations that typically have fewer terms.
Phase 1 (No Regularization)
: They start without L1 regularization to prevent weights from getting stuck at zero.
Phase 2 (L1 Regularization)
: Regularization is introduced to produce a sparse network. This is common practice in many machine learning models.
Phase 3 (Emulating L0 Regularization)
: The final phase removes the L1 regularization and enforces a fixed L0 norm by setting small weights to zero. This ensures the model fits the observed data closely and gives a more accurate parameter estimation.
Timing
: The authors specify certain times (t1 and t2) to transition between these phases, based on a fraction of the total number of training epochs.
Figure 3
: Illustrates these regularization phases. In the first phase, weights move freely without regularization. In the second, many weights are set to zero due to L1 regularization. In the third and final phase, weights close to zero remain zero, while others adjust to their correct value.
In summary, this segment sheds light on the training intricacies of the EQL�� network, highlighting the importance of regularization and penalty epochs in achieving a well-fitted, robust model. The phased regularization approach is particularly noteworthy as it aims to capture the essence of real-world physical equations, which are generally sparse in nature.

Here are the key points about model selection for extrapolation based on the passage:

- Model selection is critical for good extrapolation capabilities. The goal is to select the "right" formula/model that generalizes well.

- Two cases are considered - with or without extrapolation data for model selection. 

- Without extrapolation data, selection is based on validation error and sparsity/simplicity of the model. This is called the Vint-S selection method. 

- With some extrapolation data (e.g. 40 points), an extra validation error term vex is introduced. This is called the Vint&ex selection method. 

- Sparsity becomes less important when vex is considered, as counting nodes may not properly capture simplicity for extrapolation. 

- Relatively few extrapolation points (e.g. 40) are sufficient to identify the right model among many candidates, due to large errors differences for correct vs incorrect formulas.

- Multiple runs are used to quantify expected performance deviations, as the optimization problem is non-convex.

So in summary, the key aspects of model selection discussed are using validation error, sparsity, and extrapolation error terms depending on available data, to pick the "right" or best generalizing formula according to Occam's razor. Sparsity is de-emphasized when extrapolation data is available.

Absolutely, you've summarized the key points regarding model selection for extrapolation succinctly. To reiterate:
Extrapolation Importance
: Selecting the right model/formula is crucial for effective extrapolation, ensuring the model not only fits the data it was trained on but can also predict accurately on new, unseen data.
Two Selection Scenarios
:
Without extrapolation data: The model is chosen based on validation error combined with the sparsity or simplicity of the model (Vint-S method).
With extrapolation data: A term for extrapolation error, termed vex, is introduced and considered in the selection process (Vint&ex method).
Role of Sparsity
:
When no extrapolation data is available, sparsity becomes a key metric to capture the simplicity of the model.
However, with extrapolation data, the importance of sparsity reduces. This implies that simply counting nodes or elements in a model doesn't necessarily indicate its effectiveness in extrapolating.
Extrapolation Data
: Even a relatively small amount of extrapolation data can significantly aid in choosing the right model. The reason being, the difference in errors between correct and incorrect formulas becomes glaringly obvious with this data.
Non-Convexity
: Due to the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, multiple runs are carried out to account for potential variations in model performance.
In essence, model selection for extrapolation, as discussed, is a nuanced process. It strikes a balance between fitting the available data and ensuring generalizability, underlined by the principles of Occam's razor.
1 / 1
The Vint-S selection method is used when there is no extrapolation data available for model selection. Here are some more details:

- It relies on the validation error (vint) and sparsity (s) of each model/instance. 

- The validation error and sparsity are normalized across all instances to values between 0 and 1. This is denoted as vint(��) and s(��).

- The criterion used to select the best model is to minimize a weighted sum of the normalized validation error and sparsity:

argmin �� (�� * vint(��)^2 + �� * s(��)^2)

- �� and �� are weighting factors that are empirically determined, with �� = 0.5 and �� = 0.5 used. 

- This finds a balance between low validation error (want to minimize) and low sparsity/high simplicity (also want to minimize).

- It considers both quantities together, rather than just comparing ranks, to be more sensitive to numeric differences between instances.

- The instance �� that minimizes this weighted criterion is selected as the "best" model for extrapolation using only the available validation data.

So in summary, it normalizes and combines validation error and sparsity metrics to quantitatively evaluate models when no extrapolation data is available for selection.

ChatGPT
You've articulated the Vint-S selection method quite comprehensively. Let's recap:
Applicability
: The Vint-S method is employed when there's an absence of extrapolation data.
Key Metrics
:
Validation Error (vint)
: The difference between the model's predicted outputs and the actual outputs on validation data.
Sparsity (s)
: A measure of the simplicity of the model, where a sparser model indicates greater simplicity.
Normalization
: Both vint and s metrics for each model instance are normalized to range between 0 and 1, ensuring a consistent scale for comparison.
Selection Criterion
: The best model, denoted by ��, is chosen by minimizing the weighted sum of the squared normalized validation error and sparsity:
argmin

Where �� and �� are weights to determine the relative importance of validation error and sparsity, respectively.
Empirical Weights
: �� = 0.5 and �� = 0.5 are used, emphasizing an equal balance between minimizing validation error and sparsity.
Rationale
: By considering both metrics in a unified criterion, the method can more sensitively discern numerical differences between model instances, rather than relying on simplistic rank comparisons.
End Goal
: The model instance ��, which results in the lowest value for the combined metric, is selected as the optimal one for extrapolation based on available validation data.
In essence, the Vint-S method offers a systematic way to evaluate and select the most suitable model for extrapolation when only validation data is at hand, leveraging both error and simplicity metrics.

3. Relation to prior work 
In this work, we are departing from the classical path in 
machine learning of i nding any function that yields a small 
expected error on future data of the same distribution as the 
training data. Instead, we aim at discovering the underlying 
relationship between input and output, much like it is done 
in the natural sciences. In this way an interpretable function 
Learning Equations for Extrapolation and Control 
with concise form is obtained. 
In machine learning, this task has received little attention 
but is studied in the i eld of system identif i cation. The meth- 
ods from system identif i cation assume that the functional 
form of the system is known and only the parameters have 
to be identif i ed. Recently, this was shown to be effective 
for identif i ying partial differential equations in a range of 
systems (Rudy et al., 2017). In our work, we also learn 
the parameters of the base functions and, most importantly, 
their composition. 
The task of i nding equations for observations is also known 
as symbolic regression.For a given function space, a 
heuristic search is performed, typically with evolutionary 
computation. With these techniques, it is possible to dis- 
cover physical laws such as invariants and conserved quan- 
tities (Schmidt & Lipson, 2009). Unfortunately, due to 
the exponential search space, the computational complex- 
ity becomes prohibitive for larger expressions and high- 
dimensional problems. We attempt to circumvent this by 
modeling it as a gradient-based optimization problem. Re- 
lated to symbolic regression is i nding mathematical iden- 
tities for instance to i nd computationally more eff i cient 
expressions. In (Zaremba et al., 2014), this was done using 
machine learning to overcome the potentially exponential 
search space. 
Another relation to our work is in causal learning, which 
aims at identifying a causal relationship between multiple 
observables, originating from some underlying functional 
mechanism. This was pioneered by Pearl (2000) who re- 
duces this to i nding a minimal graphical model based only 
on tests of conditional independence. Although it provides 
a factorization of the problem and reveals causes and ef- 
fects, it leaves the exact functional dependency unexplained. 
In order to reveal causal relationships from fewer observ- 
ables (e.g. just two), in Peters et al. (2014) a functional 
view was taken. However, the causal inference is based 
on the expected noise distribution instead of the simplic- 
ity/plausibility of regression functions. 
Our work has some similarity to domain adaptation, because 
data from the extrapolation domain differs from the data 
distribution at training time. As we assume a shared labeling 
function between both, our situation i ts the covariate shift 
(Quionero-Candela et al., 2009) setting. However, existing 
domain adaptation techniques, such as sample reweighting 
(Sugiyama et al., 2007) are not applicable, because training 
and extrapolation domain are disjoint for us. Where existing 
approaches rely on an assumption of distribution similarity, 
we instead make use of the fact that the target function has 
an analytic, and therefore global characterization. For the 
same reasons, existing theoretic results, such as Ben-David 
et al. (2010) are not applicable (or vacuous) in our setting. 
For a discussion on the architectural relation to prior work 
we refer to Martius & Lampert (2016). To summarize, 
the individual components, such as product units or sine 
units were introduced before. However, the combination as 
introduced here and the restriction to pairwise multiplication 
terms are new. To the best of our knowledge, we are the i rst 
to use division units in a neural network.

This section outlines the relation of the presented work to prior studies in the field. Let's summarize the main points:
Departure from Classical Machine Learning
:
The research deviates from the traditional machine learning goal of finding a function with minimal future error based on similar training data.
The objective is to determine the relationship between input and output, resembling methods used in natural sciences.
Interpretable Function Learning
:
The focus is on obtaining interpretable functions with clear and concise forms.
System Identification
:
While traditional machine learning has not prioritized this task, system identification has.
Conventional system identification methods presume knowledge of the system's functional form, focusing on parameter identification.
The study cites Rudy et al. (2017) which effectively identifies partial differential equations for systems.
Unlike prior works, the research also identifies base function parameters and their composition.
Symbolic Regression
:
The task involves finding equations for observations.
Typically, a heuristic search in the function space is performed, often via evolutionary computation.
This approach can uncover physical laws, but struggles with computational complexity in expansive search spaces.
The research addresses this challenge by modeling it as a gradient-based optimization problem.
Mathematical Identities
:
Zaremba et al. (2014) used machine learning to efficiently discover mathematical identities, sidestepping the expansive search space.
Causal Learning
:
This aims to discern causal relations between observables.
Pearl (2000) proposed a method that reduces it to finding a minimal graphical model based on conditional independence tests.
Peters et al. (2014) introduced a functional view but relied on expected noise distribution rather than regression function simplicity.
Domain Adaptation & Covariate Shift
:
The research has parallels with domain adaptation since extrapolation domain data differs from training data.
The situation aligns with the covariate shift setting, as per Quionero-Candela et al. (2009).
Traditional domain adaptation methods aren't suitable because training and extrapolation domains are separate.
The research exploits the fact that the target function possesses an analytical, global characterization.
Architectural Relation
:
For more detailed architectural relations, readers are directed to Martius & Lampert (2016).
The work introduces novel components in neural networks, such as division units, a first-of-its-kind according to the authors.
In essence, this research builds upon and extends various existing methods to present a novel approach to function learning and extrapolation, offering an interpretable and analytical relationship between inputs and outputs.

4. Experimental evaluation 
We i rst demonstrate the ability of EQL��to learn phys- 
ically inspired models with and without divisions with 
good extrapolation quality. Technically, we implemented 
the network training and evaluation procedure in python 
based on the theano framework (Theano Development 
Team, 2016).The code and some data is available at 
https://github.com/martius-lab/EQL. 
For all experiments, we have training data in a restricted 
domain, usually[���1,1]dcorrupted with noise which is 
split into training and validation with90% ��� 10%split. 
For testing, we have two sets, one from the training do- 
main and one from an extrapolation domain, for instance

4.1. Learning formulas with divisions 
We start with a small experiment to check whether simple 
formulas with divisions can be learned. We sample data 
from the following formula: 
y = sin(��x1) 
(x2 2+ 1) (11) 
As training data, we sample10000points uniformly in the 
hypercube[���1,1]2and add noise (��� N(0,0.01)). 
The 
extrapolation test set contains5000uniformly sampled

that the extrapolation domain is 3 times larger than the 
training domain. We perform model selection among the

in all of the10independent runs. Note, that the original 
EQL method cannot extrapolate because it lacks the division 
units. Interestingly, Eureqa is not i nding the right equations 
in4/5cases. The interpolation performances are at the 
noise level of 0.01 for all methods (not shown).

This section details the experimental evaluation of the EQL�� method. Here's a concise summary:
Objective and Setup
:
The main aim is to demonstrate EQL��'s ability to learn physically inspired models with accurate extrapolation qualities.
The implementation was done in Python using the Theano framework.
Code and some data is provided on GitHub.
Data and Parameters
:
The training data is in a domain, typically [���1,1]^d, and has noise. This data is split into training (90%) and validation (10%) sets.
There are two testing sets: one from the training domain and one from an extrapolation domain like [���2,2]^n \ [���1,1]^n.
Error is gauged using root mean square error (RMS).
Specific hyperparameters, including learning rate and mini-batch size, are mentioned.
Learning Formulas with Divisions
:
A small experiment is conducted to verify if simple formulas with divisions can be learned.
Data is sampled from a specified formula, y = sin(��x1) / (x2^2 + 1), with noise added.
The extrapolation test set is much larger than the training domain.
Model selection is performed across specific hyperparameters.
The algorithm is compared with a standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) and an epsilon support vector regression (SVR). Another comparison is made with Eureqa, a symbolic regression algorithm.
Results
:
Results are illustrated in Figure 5 (not seen here).
EQL�� is highlighted for its ability to extrapolate to unseen domains as it can identify the underlying expression.
The original EQL method, lacking division units, cannot extrapolate effectively.
Eureqa does not always find the correct equations.
The interpolation performances for all methods match the noise level of 0.01.
In essence, this experimental evaluation highlights the efficacy of EQL�� in learning and extrapolating formulas, especially when compared to other methods. The results underscore the importance of division units in the EQL methodology.

in4/5cases. The interpolation performances are at the 
noise level of 0.01 for all methods (not shown). 
4.2. Learning complex formulas. 
Following Martius & Lampert (2016) we test EQL��on a 
set of complicated formulas and compare it to the original 
EQL, MLP, SVR and Eureqa as baselines. These do not 
contain divisions and we want to test whether this poses 
any problems as our architecture always contains divisions. 
We consider the following formulas with four-dimensional 
input and one-dimensional output: 
y =1/3(sin(��x1) + sin(2��x2+��/8) + x2��� x3x4)(F-1) 
y =1/3 ?sin(��x 
1)+x2cos(2��x1+��/4)+x3���x24 ? 
(F-2) 
y =1/3((1 + x2)sin(��x1) + x2x3x4)(F-3) 
y =1/2(sin(��x1) + cos(2x2sin(��x1)) + x2x3x4)(F-4) 
For a correct identif i cation, the equations F-1 requires one 
hidden layer, F-2 and F-3 require two, and F-4 requires 
three (L = 4). Nevertheless, the right number of layers is 
automatically detected by model selection. Data generation 
and training procedure is the same as for the Section 4.1, 
except that the data is now from a 4-dimensional hypercube, 
which makes the extrapolation domain 15 times larger than 
the training domain.

Table 1.Extrapolation performance and model selection for for- 
mula learning. See Fig. 5 for details. For EQL the original model 
selection was used. For F-1 (not shown), both EQL and EQL ��, 
have an error of 0.01. 
Table 1 shows the numerical results. All methods are able 
to interpolate, but only EQL��and Eureqa achieve good 
extrapolation results in all cases. The original EQL (with the 
original model selection) was able to i nd the right answer 
only for F-2. With the model selection Vint&ex(using 40 
extrapolation points), EQL��and Eureqa are able to i nd the 
right formula for F-3 every time and for F-4 in about half of 
the cases (manual inspection of the learned equations). 
Figure 6(a) illustrates the performance of the learned models 
for F-4 visually. It shows the output for a slice through 
the input for one of the model-selected instances for each 
method. It is remarkable how well the extrapolation works 
for EQL��and Eureqa even far outside training region. 
4.3. Random expressions 
In order to avoid a bias through hand-crafted formulas, we 
generated random functional expressions. The expressions 
were generated with our architecture with2and3hidden 
Learning Equations for Extrapolation and Control 
layers and random sparse connections,4instances each, 
named as RE{2,3}-{1,2,3,4}. 
The weights and biases 
were sampled from a uniform distribution in[0.5,2]and 
were multiplied with[1,���1]with 
equal probability. Further, 
the input weights into thesinandcosnodes were multi- 
plied by��, to avoid including only the linear regime of the 
trigonometric functions. Some of the expressions are very 
hard to learn, even in the interpolation region. Table 2 shows 
the experimental results. We also compare the two model- 
selection strategies (Vint-S and Vint&ex). It becomes evident 
that without a few points from the extrapolation region (here 
40) the system is not able to identify the right formula in the 
majority of cases. For the baselines (MLP, SVR) the model 
selection based on extrapolation only reduced the strong 
outliers but did not yield acceptable performance. This is 
expected because these methods have no chance to identify 
the right functional relationship. Figure 6(b) illustrates the 
complicated structure at the example of RE3-4. Again, note 
that the extrapolation domain is 15 times larger than the 
training domain. 
4.4. Cart-pendulum system 
Let us now consider a non-trivial physical system: a pendu- 
lum attached to a cart that can move horizontally along a rail 
but that is attached to a spring damper system, see Fig. 7(a). 
The system is parametrized by4unknowns: the position of 
the cart, the velocity of the cart, the angle of the pendulum 
and the angular velocity of the pendulum. We combine 
these into a four-dimensional vectorx = (x1,...,x4). We 
set up a regression problem with four outputs from the cor- 
responding system of ordinary differential equations where 
y1= �� x1= x3, y2= �� x2= x4and 
y3= ���x1��� 0.01x3+ x2 
4sin (x2) + 0.1x4cos (x2)+9.81 sin (x2) cos (x2)

4sin(x2)cos(x2) 
sin2(x2) + 1 
. 
The task is to learn the function without controlling the sys- 
tem. The formulas contain divisions which are now included 
in the EQL��architecture. In Fig. 7(b) the extrapolation per- 
formance is illustrated by slicing through the input space. 
Near the training region all methods i t the data well, but a 
bit further away only EQL��can predict well. For all other 
methods, even the best instances differ considerably from 
the true values, see also the numerical results in Tab. 3. In 1 
out of the 10 independent runs also EQL��performed poorly. 
This is less likely for a i ner scan of �� values. 
5. Control using learned dynamics 
In this section, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of the 
equation learning for robot control. For the cart-pole we 
know that the system can learn correctly the differential

equations from randomly sampled data, see above. Now, 
we are challenging the system to learn the dynamics from 
actual interactions and subsequently use it to control the 
robot, namely to learn how to perform the swing-up task 
with the cart-pole. We use the OpenAI Gym cart-pole en- 
vironment (OpenAI Gym, 2018) that we modif i ed for the 
swing-up task, i.e. to start at the bottom. The state of the 
systems = (x, �� x,��, �� 
��)contains the position and velocity of 
the cart and the angle and angular velocity of the pole. The 
learner should model the forward dynamicsf(s,a) ��� �� s, 
predicting state changes from the current state and action. 
At the beginning no knowledge about the system is avail- 
able, such that we performK ��� 1random rollouts with 
1000steps (20secs) with random actionsa ��� N(0,0.15). 
The resulting pole angle distribution had mean��and stan- 
dard deviation of approximately��/4, so only a small part 
of the angle range was visited. In order to obtain data for 
model selection we perform one additional rollout with 
a ��� N(0,0.25). 
After training we use the resulting models for optimal con- 
trol. We def i ne a cost which def i nes the desired position, 
i.e. vertical upright pole with small velocities and cart at 
the center: 
C = 0.1x2+ 0.1�� x2��� cos(��) + 0.02����2.(13) 
Note, that the stability point lies far outside the training 
domain. To achieve the optimal control we use model pre- 
dictive control (MPC) (Garc��a et al., 1989) with a random 
shooting method. Brief l y, every timestep 1000 lookaheads 
are simulated using the learned dynamics (Euler integration) 
with random actions. After a i xed horizon the look-ahead 
with the lowest costCis chosen and only the i rst action is 
applied. This runs in realtime for100Hz update rate. For 
MPC to work the model should provide with a good enough 
representation of the system dynamics. 
In Fig. 8 the results for different number of rolloutsK 
are presented. The reward from the environment isR =

The text you provided appears to be an excerpt from a scientific paper or report discussing the results of an experiment or study. Specifically, this excerpt pertains to a method called "Equation Learning" (EQL) and a variation of it, referred to as "EQL��", being applied to different problems such as learning complex mathematical formulas, modeling random expressions, and predicting the dynamics of a cart-pendulum system.
Here's a brief summary of the main points from the provided text:
Learning Complex Formulas
: The study tested the EQL�� method on complex formulas and compared its performance with other baseline methods, including the original EQL, MLP, SVR, and Eureqa.
The goal was to see if EQL��, which always includes divisions in its architecture, could effectively handle formulas that don't have divisions.
The results showed that while all methods were able to interpolate the data, EQL�� and Eureqa were superior in terms of extrapolation.
Random Expressions
: To avoid potential biases, random functional expressions were generated.
The study found that without including a few extrapolation points in the model, it often fails to identify the correct formula.
Traditional methods like MLP and SVR did not perform well, reinforcing the idea that they couldn't identify the right functional relationships.
Cart-Pendulum System
: The study used a cart-pendulum system, a more complex physical model, to test the methods.
The EQL�� method was found to predict the dynamics of the system better than other methods, especially outside the training region.
Control Using Learned Dynamics
: The study then extended the use of the learned equations for robot control.
Specifically, they tested if the system can learn the dynamics of a cart-pole setup from actual interactions and then control the robot.
The results showed that using EQL��, the cart-pole system could be controlled more effectively based on the learned dynamics.
The overall takeaway is that the EQL�� method appears to be a promising technique for learning mathematical expressions and modeling complex physical systems, especially when it comes to extrapolation and controlling dynamics based on the learned models.

vision, thereby substantially increasing the applicability. 
The network is fully differentiable and trainable with back- 
propagation, which we achieve by introducing a regularized 
version of division that is smoothly transformed towards 
the true division in a curriculum fashion. We also introduce 
a new model selection technique that identif i es the actual 
functional relation between inputs and outputs more reliably 
than the purely sparsity-based approach of previous work. 
We empirically demonstrate that EQL��can learn various 
functional relations, with and without divisions, from noisy 
data in a conf i ned domain. Furthermore, those can extra- 
polate to unseen parts of the data space. In a broad set of 
experiments we show that the approach learns concise func- 
tional forms that can be inspected and may provide insights 
into the relationships within the data. 
This ability opens doors for many new applications. As 
an exemplary task, we show eff i cient model learning for 
robot control: EQL��identif i es the forward dynamics for an 
actuated cart-pendulum system from just 2 random rollouts 
with limited excitation and under noisy observations. The 
resulting forward model is good enough to robustly per- 
form a pendulum swing-up task, despite the fact that such 
a pattern was never observed during training. Also embed- 
ding EQL��as part of deep architecture is conceivable. In 
future studies, we will consider larger and more complex 
systems, where we expect good scaling capabilities due to 
the gradient-based optimization.

How is that you were able to figure out the time from the timestamp?

ChatGPT
The Unix timestamp, sometimes referred to as POSIX time or epoch time, represents the number of seconds that have passed since the "epoch": 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 (not counting leap seconds).
Given a Unix timestamp, you can determine the current date and time by adding that number of seconds to the epoch start. There are formulas and libraries in many programming languages that facilitate this conversion.
When you provided the Unix timestamp "1695767980," I performed a mental calculation using my training data to convert it into a human-readable date. This allows me to provide an approximation of the date and time represented by that timestamp.
It's worth noting that while I can perform this conversion quickly, the result might not always be as precise as using dedicated time libraries in programming languages.

We are on Earth.

Did you know that at one time Earth was not considered a planet?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, historically, the concept of what constitutes a "planet" has evolved. In ancient times, the word "planet" derived from the Greek term "plan��t��s," which means "wanderer." This term was used to describe objects that moved against the backdrop of the fixed stars in the night sky. This included the five planets visible to the naked eye: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, as well as the Sun and the Moon.
It wasn't until the Copernican revolution in the 16th century that the Sun was properly identified as the center of our solar system, and Earth was recognized as one of the planets orbiting it, rather than the center of the universe as was previously believed in the geocentric model.
The definition of a planet has further evolved, especially with the debate and eventual reclassification of Pluto as a "dwarf planet" in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

Yeah no one likes my theory but I think Pluto is an original name for the planet Earth, it means riches or depths, it was not known to be a planet and so it was thought to be the center of the universe
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your theory is an interesting perspective. The naming and classification of celestial objects often carry with them layers of cultural, historical, and linguistic significance. The word "Pluto" does indeed derive from the Greek god of the underworld, often associated with riches due to the precious metals mined from the earth.
Historically, Earth's name comes from Old English and Germanic words meaning "ground" or "soil." The association of Earth as the center of the universe in ancient models was more about our human perspective and lack of advanced observational tools than any linguistic tie to the name "Pluto."
However, the beauty of such discussions lies in the interplay between science, history, and cultural interpretations. Even if mainstream scientific history doesn't align with your theory, it's always fascinating to explore alternative viewpoints and the reasons behind them.

Yeah well we did call the first era of earth's history the Hadean.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Indeed, the Hadean eon is named after Hades, the Greek god of the underworld, which is synonymous with the Roman god Pluto. The Hadean eon spans from Earth's formation about 4.6 billion years ago to the start of the Archean eon 4 billion years ago. It's characterized by a lack of life and a hot, hellish environment, with frequent volcanic activity and a molten "magma ocean." The name reflects these inhospitable conditions.
The association of the Hadean eon with such underworld terminology does indeed tie back to ancient mythologies and reinforces the significance and influence of cultural narratives on scientific nomenclature. It's always intriguing to see how language, myth, and science intertwine over time.

History

More
In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Pluto (Greek: ��������������, Plout��n) was the ruler of the Greek underworld. The earlier name for the god was Hades, which became more common as the name of the underworld itself. Pluto represents a more positive concept of the god who presides over the afterlife. Plout��n was frequently conflated with Plo��tos, the Greek god of wealth, because mineral wealth was found underground, and because as a chthonic god Pluto ruled the deep earth that contained the seeds necessary for a bountiful harvest.[1] The name Plout��n came into widespread usage with the Eleusinian Mysteries, in which Pluto was venerated as both a stern ruler and a loving husband to Persephone. The couple received souls in the afterlife and are invoked together in religious inscriptions, being referred to as Plouton and as Kore respectively. Hades, by contrast, had few temples and religious practices associated with him, and he is portrayed as the dark and violent abductor of Persephone.

Pluto and Hades differ in character, but they are not distinct figures and share two dominant myths. In Greek cosmogony, the god received the rule of the underworld in a three-way division of sovereignty over the world, with his brother Zeus ruling the sky and his other brother Poseidon sovereign over the sea. His central narrative in myth is of him abducting Persephone to be his wife and the queen of his realm.[2] Plouton as the name of the ruler of the underworld first appears in Greek literature of the Classical period, in the works of the Athenian playwrights and of the philosopher Plato, who is the major Greek source on its significance. Under the name Pluto, the god appears in other myths in a secondary role, mostly as the possessor of a quest-object, and especially in the descent of Orpheus or other heroes to the underworld.[3]

Pl��t�� ([��plu��to��]; genitive Pl��t��nis) is the Latinized form of the Greek Plouton. Pluto's Roman equivalent is Dis Pater, whose name is most often taken to mean "Rich Father" and is perhaps a direct translation of Plouton. Pluto was also identified with the obscure Roman Orcus, like Hades the name of both a god of the underworld and the underworld as a place. Pluto (Pluton in French and German, Plutone in Italian) becomes the most common name for the classical ruler of the underworld in subsequent Western literature and other art forms.


Hesiod
Edit

A mosaic of the Kasta Tomb in Amphipolis depicting the abduction of Persephone by Pluto, 4th century BC
The name Plouton does not appear in Greek literature of the Archaic period.[4] In Hesiod's Theogony, the six children of Cronus and Rhea are Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Hades, Demeter, and Hestia. The male children divide the world into three realms. Hades takes Persephone by force from her mother Demeter, with the consent of Zeus. Ploutos, "Wealth," appears in the Theogony as the child of Demeter and Iasion: "fine Plutus, who goes upon the whole earth and the broad back of the sea, and whoever meets him and comes into his hands, that man he makes rich, and he bestows much wealth upon him." The union of Demeter and Iasion, described also in the Odyssey,[5] took place in a fallow field that had been ploughed three times, in what seems to be a reference to a ritual copulation or sympathetic magic to ensure the earth's fertility.[6] "The resemblance of the name Ploutos to Plouton ...," it has been noted, "cannot be accidental. Plouton is lord of the dead, but as Persephone's husband he has serious claims to the powers of fertility."[7] Demeter's son Plutus merges in the narrative tradition with her son-in-law Pluto, redefining the implacable chariot-driver Hades whose horses trample the flowering earth.[8]

That the underworld god was associated early on with success in agricultural activity is already evident in Hesiod's Works and Days, line 465���469: "Pray to Zeus of the Earth and to pure Demeter to make Demeter's holy grain sound and heavy, when first you begin ploughing, when you hold in your hand the end of the plough-tail and bring down your stick on the backs of the oxen as they draw on the pole-bar by the yoke-straps."[9]


Plouton and Ploutos
Edit

Ploutos with the horn of abundance, in the company of Dionysos (4th century BC)
Plouton was one of several euphemistic names for Hades, described in the Iliad as the god most hateful to mortals.[10] Plato says that people prefer the name Plouton, "giver of wealth," because the name of Hades is fear-provoking.[11] The name was understood as referring to "the boundless riches of the earth, both the crops on its surface���he was originally a god of the land���and the mines hidden within it."[12] What is sometimes taken as "confusion" of the two gods Plouton and Ploutos ("Wealth") held or acquired a theological significance in antiquity. As a lord of abundance or riches, Pluto expresses the aspect of the underworld god that was positive, symbolized in art by the "horn of plenty" (cornucopia),[13] by means of which Plouton is distinguished from the gloomier Hades.[14]

The Roman poet Ennius (ca. 239���169 BC), the leading figure in the Hellenization of Latin literature, considered Pluto a Greek god to be explained in terms of the Roman equivalents Dis Pater and Orcus.[15] It is unclear whether Pluto had a literary presence in Rome before Ennius. Some scholars think that rituals and beliefs pertaining to Pluto entered Roman culture with the establishment of the Saecular Games in 249 BC, and that Dis pater was only a translation of Plouton.[16] In the mid-1st century BC, Cicero identifies Pluto with Dis, explaining that "The earth in all its power and plenty is sacred to Father Dis, a name which is the same as Dives, 'The Wealthy One,' as is the Greek Plouton. This is because everything is born of the earth and returns to it again."[17]

During the Roman Imperial era, the Greek geographer Strabo (1st century AD) makes a distinction between Pluto and Hades. In writing of the mineral wealth of ancient Iberia (Roman Spain), he says that among the Turdetani, it is "Pluto, and not Hades, who inhabits the region down below."[18] In the discourse On Mourning by the Greek author Lucian (2nd century AD), Pluto's "wealth" is the dead he rules over in the abyss (chasma); the name Hades is reserved for the underworld itself.[19]

Other identifications
Edit
In Greek religious practice, Pluto is sometimes seen as the "chthonic Zeus" (Zeus Chthonios[20] or Zeus Catachthonios[21]), or at least as having functions or significance equivalent to those of Zeus but pertaining to the earth or underworld.[

ChatGPT
This comprehensive passage gives a detailed overview of Pluto (Plouton) in ancient Greek and Roman mythology and religion. Let's summarize the main points:
Pluto and Hades
: Pluto (or Plout��n in Greek) was a ruler of the Greek underworld. While the earlier name for this deity was Hades, over time, "Pluto" came to embody a more positive aspect of the ruler of the afterlife. Hades often carried a darker, more violent reputation, especially in the narrative of Persephone's abduction.
Wealth and Agriculture
: The connection between Pluto and wealth comes from the fact that valuable minerals were mined from the earth, and Pluto, as a chthonic god, ruled the deep earth. The seeds necessary for a bountiful harvest were also found underground. Moreover, there's a parallel between Plouton (ruler of the underworld) and Ploutos (wealth), which carries implications about abundance and fertility.
Narratives and Myths
: One central narrative is Pluto's abduction of Persephone to become his queen in the underworld. This story represents a confluence of themes, from love and desire to dominance and power.
Latin Influence and Roman Equivalents
: In Roman tradition, the equivalent of Pluto is Dis Pater. The name is thought to mean "Rich Father," possibly as a translation of Plouton. Another Roman counterpart is Orcus.
Hesiod's Influence
: In Hesiod's writings, the connection between the underworld and agricultural success is evident. The "Wealth" (Ploutos) produced by the earth, whether through crops or minerals, ties back to the realm and influence of the underworld god.
Differentiations
: Later in history, distinctions were made between Pluto and Hades. In Greek religious practice, Pluto is sometimes referred to as the "chthonic Zeus" (Zeus of the underworld), signifying his dominion over the earth and its riches.
The significance of these ancient myths and their interpretations isn't just in their stories but in what they reveal about ancient civilizations' values, beliefs, and ways of understanding the world. The gods and their tales, like those of Pluto and Hades, played pivotal roles in shaping cultural and religious practices.

So what do you think of my theory that Pluto is the name of the Earth?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your theory is intriguing and offers a fresh perspective on the naming and interpretation of celestial bodies. Here's a breakdown of the idea and some thoughts:
Pluto as Earth's Ancient Name
:
Historically, the association between Pluto and the underworld has been strong, emphasizing the depths or riches beneath the Earth's surface. This association with depth, wealth, and the chthonic realm resonates with the concept of Earth as a source of life and resources.
Significance of Hadean Era
:
The first eon of Earth's history is named the "Hadean", derived from Hades, which is another name for Pluto in Greek mythology. This connection underscores Earth's tumultuous and "hellish" conditions during its early existence.
Reinterpretation of Celestial Names
:
The naming of celestial bodies often carries symbolic meanings, reflecting human understanding and interpretation of the universe. Reimagining Earth as "Pluto" aligns with the idea that names evolve with our understanding and are not static.
Caveats
:
While it's a fascinating perspective, there's no historical evidence to suggest that ancient civilizations referred to Earth as Pluto. The idea might face challenges from historical and astronomical standpoints.
The names and characteristics of mythological figures (like Pluto) have evolved over time based on cultural narratives and religious beliefs. Equating Pluto directly with Earth may oversimplify the rich tapestry of myths associated with the deity.
Final Thoughts
:
Theories that provide new interpretations or perspectives can stimulate discussion and further exploration of established beliefs. While your theory might not align with traditional historical records, it offers a thought-provoking connection between Earth and ancient myths, inviting us to reconsider the stories we tell about our planet and its place in the cosmos.
Remember, every established idea today might have once been considered a novel theory. The value lies in its exploration and the discussions it fosters.

Orphic and philosophical systems
Edit
The Orphic theogonies are notoriously varied,[161] and Orphic cosmology influenced the varying Gnostic theogonies of late antiquity.[162] Clementine literature (4th century AD) preserves a theogony with explicit Orphic influence that also draws on Hesiod, yielding a distinctive role for Pluto. When the primordial elements came together by orderly cyclonic force, they produced a generative sphere, the "egg" from which the primeval Orphic entity Phanes is born and the world is formed. The release of Phanes and his ascent to the heavenly top of the world-egg causes the matter left in the sphere to settle in relation to weight, creating the tripartite world of the traditional theogonies:[163]

Its lower part, the heaviest element, sinks downwards, and is called Pluto because of its gravity, weight, and great quantity (pl��thos) of matter. After the separation of this heavy element in the middle part of the egg the waters flow together, which they call Poseidon. The purest and noblest element, the fire, is called Zeus, because its nature is glowing (������������, zeousa). It flies right up into the air, and draws up the spirit, now called Metis, that was left in the underlying moisture. And when this spirit has reached the summit of the ether, it is devoured by Zeus, who in his turn begets the intelligence (��������������, sunesis), also called Pallas. And by this artistic intelligence the etherial artificer creates the whole world. This world is surrounded by the air, which extends from Zeus, the very hot ether, to the earth; this air is called Hera.[164]

This cosmogony interprets Hesiod allegorically, and so the heaviest element is identified not as the Earth, but as the netherworld of Pluto.[165] (In modern geochemistry, plutonium is the heaviest primordial element.) Supposed etymologies are used to make sense of the relation of physical process to divine name; Plouton is here connected to pl��thos (abundance).[166]

In the Stoic system, Pluto represented the lower region of the air, where according to Seneca (1st century AD) the soul underwent a kind of purgatory before ascending to the ether.[167] Seneca's contemporary Cornutus made use of the traditional etymology of Pluto's name for Stoic theology. The Stoics believed that the form of a word contained the original truth of its meaning, which over time could become corrupted or obscured.[168] Plouton derived from ploutein, "to be wealthy," Cornutus said, because "all things are corruptible and therefore are 'ultimately consigned to him as his property.'"[169]

The passage you provided dives deep into various theogonies and philosophical systems, particularly those with Orphic influence. The interpretations of gods and cosmic forces, their allegorical and literal connections, are certainly fascinating.
Your theory linking Pluto with Earth seems to center on the notion of Pluto representing a "heavy element," with ties to the physicality and richness of the planet. This might symbolize the Earth's resources, physical nature, or abundance. The etymological link to
pl��thos
(abundance) might also be suggestive. In the passage, however, Pluto appears to represent more of the netherworld or underworld than the Earth itself.
That said, interpretations and connections between ancient gods and their real-world significations can be multifaceted. While the direct evidence in this passage doesn't solidly place Pluto as a name for Earth, it does showcase a variety of connotations and associations with the god, which could be built upon for your theory.
It's worth noting that many ancient cultures had cosmogonies or origin stories that linked their gods to natural elements or phenomena. The interplay between these gods and the natural world they represented is often intricate and varies from culture to culture.
If you have additional evidence or arguments to present, I'd be keen to explore them further!

You have to bear in mind that earth was not known to be a planet, in this cosmogony, pluto is a heavy substance that sinks to the center of the universe, forming the earth.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly, if we consider the historical context, the ancient Greeks and many other ancient civilizations didn't view the Earth as a planet in the way we do today. To them, the Earth was the center of the universe, and celestial bodies like stars and planets revolved around it. This geocentric view persisted until the heliocentric model proposed by Copernicus gained acceptance.
From the cosmogony you provided, Pluto is described as the heaviest element that sinks downward. If we take this allegorically, it could represent the dense, material world of the Earth at the center of their universe. By that interpretation, your theory posits that Pluto (the deity) symbolizes or represents the Earth's essence or core.
Given this interpretation, the association between the concept of "Pluto" as the heavy, central substance and the Earth becomes more apparent. If we think of ancient understandings, where Earth was the center and foundation of everything, the correlation between the two concepts strengthens.
In essence, while the text might not explicitly state "Pluto is Earth," it offers an allegorical interpretation where Pluto's characteristics align with how the ancients might have perceived Earth in their cosmological framework. It's an intriguing perspective and offers a unique lens through which to consider ancient cosmogonies and their interpretations of the world around them.

Do you see the line of protogravitational thinking?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, I see what you're pointing towards. The ancient description of Pluto as the heaviest element that sinks downward due to its gravity and weight does echo a sort of proto-gravitational thinking. The idea that heavier objects (or substances) have a natural tendency to move or "sink" towards the center of a system is fundamentally aligned with our modern understanding of gravity, albeit described in a more intuitive and less mathematically rigorous manner.
Historically, gravity, as a force, wasn't formally defined until Sir Isaac Newton's work in the 17th century. However, observations of objects falling or the movement of celestial bodies would have been evident to ancient civilizations. They might not have had a clear understanding of the mechanisms behind these phenomena, but they certainly recognized patterns and tried to explain them within their cultural and philosophical frameworks.
Thus, the description of Pluto in the cosmogony you provided can be seen as an early attempt to grapple with the concept of gravitational force, even if it wasn't explicitly defined as such. The allegorical depiction of elements based on their weight and their tendency to move towards or away from the center suggests an inherent recognition of gravitational-like behavior in the natural world.

Another time Pluto's shadow is thought to cause lunar eclipses, more evidence of its association with being the planet earth:

By Proserpina is meant the moon, and her name is on analogy with prope serpens ('creeping near'), for she is moved nearer to the earth than the other planets. She is called earth's daughter, because her substance has more of earth in it than of the other elements. By Pluto is meant the shadow that sometimes obstructs the moon.

This interpretation is attributed to the Greek Neoplatonist Numenius (2nd century AD), by the French scholastic William of Conches, as cited and translated by Peter Dronke, Fabula: Explorations into the Uses of Myth in Medieval Platonism (Brill, 1985), p. 54.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
This is an intriguing interpretation, and it showcases the rich tapestry of ancient cosmological thought. The interpretation of Proserpina (Roman name for Persephone) as the moon and Pluto as the shadow that causes lunar eclipses brings a different perspective to your theory about Pluto being associated with Earth.
In this particular interpretation, Pluto is not Earth itself but rather a manifestation of Earth's shadow, which aligns with the behavior of a lunar eclipse. During a lunar eclipse, Earth passes between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow on the moon, which results in the eclipse. If Pluto is being used to describe this shadow, then it does indirectly connect Pluto with Earth, as it's Earth's shadow being cast.
This strengthens your argument that in certain ancient cosmological frameworks, Pluto might have associations or symbolic connections to Earth. It's also worth noting how versatile and varied interpretations of mythological figures and their roles in ancient cosmology can be, reflecting the diverse ways in which ancient civilizations tried to understand and describe the universe around them.

A pluton:
In geology, an igneous intrusion (or intrusive body[1] or simply intrusion[2]) is a body of intrusive igneous rock that forms by crystallization of magma slowly cooling below the surface of the Earth.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, you're correct. In geology, a "pluton" refers to a body of intrusive igneous rock. Intrusive rocks form from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of the Earth, rather than on its surface. These plutons can vary in size from small dikes or sills to massive batholiths. The term "pluton" is derived from "Pluto", the Roman god of the underworld, which is a fitting name because these rock bodies form deep beneath the Earth's surface.
So, in geology, there's indeed a direct connection between the term "pluton" and the concept of something originating or residing deep below the surface, akin to the underworld domain of Pluto. This connection further underscores how deeply embedded ancient myths and terminologies are in various scientific nomenclatures.
1 / 1
Plutonism is the geologic theory that the igneous rocks forming the Earth originated from intrusive magmatic activity, with a continuing gradual process of weathering and erosion wearing away rocks, which were then deposited on the sea bed, re-formed into layers of sedimentary rock by heat and pressure, and raised again. It proposes that basalt is solidified molten magma. The theory lead to plutonic (intrinsic) rock classification, which includes intrinsic igneous rocks such as gabbro, diorite, granite and pegmatite. The name plutonism references Pluto, the classical ruler of the underworld and the Roman god of wealth. A main reason Pluto was incorporated into the classification was due to the plutonic rocks commonly being present in gold and silver ore deposits (veins).[1]

The Oxford English Dictionary traces use of the word "plutonists" to 1799,[2] and the
1 / 1
ChatGPT
term "plutonism" to 1832.[3]
Plutonism contrasts with the earlier theory of neptunism, which posits that the rocks forming the Earth originated from solidified sediments. Neptunism was named for Neptune, the Roman god of the sea, based on the belief that rocks had settled out of water. Supporters of Neptunism believed that the Earth was initially covered by a single universal ocean and that rocks formed from the minerals precipitated from this primeval sea.
Throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these two theories (Neptunism and Plutonism) were debated. One of the most famous proponents of Plutonism was the Scottish geologist James Hutton, who is often referred to as the "Father of Modern Geology". His observations, especially those related to the unconformities in sedimentary layers, led him to conclude that the Earth was shaped by the same natural processes still in operation today, acting over a very long period of time. His work laid the foundation for the theory of plutonism and helped to discredit neptunism.
By the end of the 19th century, as more geologic evidence accumulated and the study of geology progressed, plutonism became widely accepted among geologists, and the debate between Plutonists and Neptunists essentially came to an end.
The legacy of the debate can still be seen today in terms such as "plutonic" rocks, reinforcing the idea of deep, internal processes shaping the Earth, in contrast to the earlier concept of rocks forming from oceanic sediments.

So helium was discovered in the sun, so the planet plutonium was discovered on should be called Pluto
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The idea you're presenting is an intriguing play on words and associations. However, there are a few nuances to consider:
Helium's Discovery
: Helium was first detected as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in sunlight during a solar eclipse in 1868 by French astronomer Jules Janssen. The new element was named after the Greek god of the Sun, Helios. It was later found on Earth.
Plutonium's Discovery
: Plutonium (the element) was artificially produced and discovered in a laboratory in 1940 by a team of researchers led by Glenn T. Seaborg. It was named after the (then) planet Pluto, following the tradition of naming new elements after planets (like uranium after Uranus and neptunium after Neptune).
Pluto as a Planet
: Pluto's status as a planet has been the subject of debate. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined the criteria for planetary status, which led to Pluto's reclassification as a "dwarf planet."
So, while the etymological and symbolic connections are fascinating, helium and plutonium have different discovery contexts, and Pluto's name preceded the discovery of plutonium. It's fun to make these connections, but scientifically, the naming conventions are based on different rationales.

So let's hear all the arguments for why the Earth was originally called Pluto
1 / 1
ChatGPT
While the idea that Earth might have been called "Pluto" is an unconventional perspective, let's explore some arguments or connections you've pointed out, as well as some broader context:
Orphic Cosmology
: In the Orphic theogony you shared, the heaviest element sinks to the center of the cosmos, and this element is called "Pluto" because of its gravity and abundance (derived from the term "pl��thos"). Given that the ancient Greeks did not know the Earth to be a planet in the same way we do today, the term "Pluto" might symbolically refer to the physical earth or the netherworld.
Pluto's Shadow and Lunar Eclipses
: The passage that attributes to the Neoplatonist Numenius the idea that Pluto represents the shadow causing lunar eclipses and that Proserpina (or Persephone) is the moon suggests a symbolic or allegorical relationship. The Earth's shadow does cause lunar eclipses, which might hint at an association between "Pluto" and Earth, at least in this particular line of thinking.
Pluton in Geology
: The term "pluton" in geology refers to igneous intrusions formed by magma cooling below the Earth's surface. The theory of Plutonism, which describes the formation of these igneous rocks, references Pluto, the ruler of the underworld in Roman mythology. This connection aligns Pluto with the deep, unseen, underground processes of the Earth.
Wealth of the Earth
: The association of Pluto with wealth (like in Plutonism's reference to gold and silver ore deposits) and the fact that the word derives from "ploutein," meaning "to be wealthy," could symbolically link Pluto to Earth's abundant resources.
While these connections are thought-provoking, it's essential to emphasize that there's no direct historical evidence suggesting that the ancient cultures referred to Earth as "Pluto." The name "Pluto" for the dwarf planet was only coined in the 20th century, inspired by Roman mythology and the planet's remote, cold, and dark nature.

Yeah I was hoping that when it got demoted we could have our old name back. Ouranos originally meant Sky
1 / 1
ChatGPT
It's an interesting perspective you're sharing, suggesting the possibility that ancient names of celestial bodies might have had different or broader meanings before being solidified in their current contexts. You're right in saying that "Ouranos" originally meant "sky" in Greek, and it later became associated with the deity personifying the sky, leading to its Latinized name, "Uranus," for the planet.
The way humans name celestial objects often involves mythological, cultural, and historical references. Sometimes, these names reflect the object's perceived characteristics or the myths surrounding it.
However, renaming established celestial bodies would be a significant cultural and scientific shift. While "Earth" has been our planet's name for millennia across various languages and cultures, the idea of renaming it based on new interpretations or rediscovered ancient beliefs is a fascinating thought experiment. Still, it would likely be met with resistance or confusion given the established conventions.
On a similar note, while Pluto's "demotion" from planet to dwarf planet status in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union was controversial, its name remained consistent, honoring the Roman god of the underworld.
1 / 1
I think the very term underworld underscores my point.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your assertion is certainly intriguing. The term "underworld" in many ancient mythologies does denote a subterranean or inner realm, which can metaphorically represent the interior of the Earth or a realm hidden from the observable sky. By connecting Pluto, the god of the underworld, to the very substance and concept of the Earth or its inner layers, you're drawing a symbolic parallel.
However, while there is symbolic resonance, it's important to note a few considerations:
Contextual Interpretations
: The association between Pluto and the underworld is specific to Roman mythology. While underworlds exist in many mythologies, not all of them draw a direct association with a god that can be equated to Pluto.
Naming Conventions
: The names for planets in our solar system derived from Roman (and by extension, Greek) mythology were largely influenced by visible characteristics and the astrological symbolism of the time, rather than deeper symbolic meanings. For instance, Mars, the red planet, was named after the god of war because of its reddish appearance.
Language Evolution
: Meanings and connotations of words and names can change or evolve over time. "Pluto" as a celestial body was named in the 20th century and was based on a different set of cultural and scientific contexts than ancient Roman or Greek times.
Plutonism in Geology
: While there's a clear connection between the term "plutonism" in geology and Pluto, the god of the underworld (indicating the Earth's interior processes), this doesn't necessarily mean the Earth was ever referred to as "Pluto" historically.
While your theory offers an imaginative reinterpretation of naming conventions and their symbolic meanings, it's essential to differentiate between symbolic resonance and historical or linguistic accuracy. Nonetheless, the exploration of such ideas can provide rich food for thought and offer alternative perspectives on how we understand and relate to our world and the cosmos.
