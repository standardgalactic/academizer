The Standard Galactic
Alphabet
An Exemplification of Fictional Scripts in Video
Games

In the realm of video games, world-building often
takes various forms to enhance the player's
immersion into a virtual environment. These
elements, such as unique landscapes, mythical
creatures, and sometimes even original languages,
serve as critical factors that distinguish one gaming
universe from another. One such exceptional
language creation is the Standard Galactic Alphabet
(SGA), prominently featured in the classic
Commander Keen series. This essay examines the
fascinating origins, characteristics, and impact of the
SGA on both the gaming industry and pop culture.

The Standard Galactic Alphabet first came into the
virtual world's purview through the Commander
Keen series, developed by id Software and launched
in 1990. In the inaugural episode of this series,
"Marooned on Mars," the protagonist, Billy Blaze
(known in-game as Commander Keen), receives a
telepathic message. However, he finds it
incomprehensible as it is encoded in the SGA, an alien
language unknown to him. This scenario sets the
stage for a compelling plotline and intrigues players
to decode this mysterious script, adding an extra
layer of challenge to the game.

SGA stands out for its intricate design and creative
use within the games. While it is predominantly a
substitution cipher—a system of writing where each
letter in a standard alphabet is replaced by a
symbol, character, or another letter—the SGA
appears otherworldly with its angular, alien
aesthetics. The unique glyphs invoke the sensation
of exploring an advanced alien civilization, thereby
adding to the overall player immersion. However,
despite its seemingly complex appearance, players
with keen observation and determination can decode
the SGA, providing a sense of achievement beyond
the regular gameplay.

Over the years, the SGA has transcended its original
role as a mere gameplay element, becoming a
cultural icon in the gaming industry. It has been
used in other media and games, notably the highly
popular sandbox game "Minecraft," where it is used
to write enchantments. This repurposing attests to
the SGA's influence and recognition, with its distinct
script finding home in one of the most popular games
of the 21st century.

The Standard Galactic Alphabet's intricate design,
intriguing origins, and subsequent cultural impact
exemplify how a fictional script can enhance a gaming
universe's depth and appeal. Through its consistent
use across games and its enduring resonance with
players, the SGA demonstrates the power of
creative world-building in the video game industry.
It underlines the potential of such inventive
elements to shape a game's narrative and add layers
of intrigue and challenge that extend beyond
standard gameplay mechanics. Indeed, the SGA serves

as a benchmark in the utilization of fictional scripts,
setting a precedent for future game designers to
build more immersive and engaging virtual worlds.

Behold the holy POGO stick!
The Standard Galactic Alphabet's inception is
accredited to Tom Hall, a game designer for the
Commander Keen series. Its creation was not an
attempt to build an entirely new language, but
rather a means to evoke a sense of alien aesthetics
in the game. Hall's initial foray into this endeavor
was modest—designing a two-dimensional computer
graphic for the "Exit" sign at the conclusion of each
level. The exotic aura that this graphic radiated
inspired Hall to further expand his use of the
script to include messages such as "hi" and "this is
neat," usually accompanying intriguing game elements
like weapons.

Hall began the construction of the Standard Galactic
Alphabet by modifying the letters of the Latin
alphabet. While the scripts may appear to be
characters from an alien language, the words are
English, with the alien appearance resulting from
Hall's innovative modifications. This creative
approach allowed Hall to instill an extraterrestrial
feel in the game while maintaining an
understandable context for the player.

As the development of the game progressed, Hall
invented more characters to convey various
messages throughout the game. Despite the strange

and intriguing appearance of these characters, the
Standard Galactic Alphabet is a constructed script
rather than a constructed language. This distinction
is crucial because, unlike a constructed language,
which involves grammar, syntax, and vocabulary, a
constructed script mainly involves designing symbols
or characters to represent existing words or sounds.
In this case, the Standard Galactic Alphabet
represents English words.

In essence, the development of the Standard
Galactic Alphabet exemplifies the unique methods
game designers employ to enhance a game's immersive
experience. The script's creation, while rooted in
the Latin alphabet, brings a distinct, out-of-this-
world feel to the game, reinforcing the player's
sense of navigating through an alien universe.
Moreover, Hall's ingenious work emphasizes how
inventive elements, even as simple as an "Exit" sign,
can significantly contribute to world-building in
video games.

An Intricate Puzzle
The Standard Galactic Alphabet posed an enticing
challenge for players of the Commander Keen series,
beckoning them to decode its secrets. The initial
encounter with the SGA in "Marooned on Mars"
revealed only fifteen letters: A, B, C, D, E, H, I,
K, L, N, O, S, T, X, and Y. As the game series
progressed, additional characters were introduced,
encouraging players to piece together the mystery
of this fascinating script.

The third installment in the series, "Keen Must
Die!" presented the most substantial opportunity
for players to decipher the SGA. The game included
extra boards in both SGA letters and regular
letters, enabling players to make comparisons and
draw parallels between the two. The design was
akin to the historic Rosetta Stone, where the same
text is presented in multiple scripts, providing the
key to translate an otherwise indecipherable
language. A hidden level in the game offered a
full translation of the SGA, a valuable reward for
the keen-eyed player.

The sixth game, "Aliens Ate My Babysitter,"
continued the tradition of challenging players with
deciphering the SGA. Similar to its predecessor, it
had a hidden level that featured a cipher,
instrumental for players to translate a note that
Keen discovers at the end of the fifth game, "The
Armageddon Machine."

The Standard Galactic Alphabet's successful
integration into the game series transformed it
from a mere gameplay element to an intricate puzzle.
The necessity to decipher the script to progress in
the storyline fostered an immersive and interactive
experience for players, leading them to engage with
the game at a deeper level. The SGA is not just a
testament to inventive game design, but also a clear
demonstration of how puzzles and mysteries can
enhance player engagement and enrich the overall
gaming experience.

An Enduring Legacy
The Standard Galactic Alphabet's enduring influence
extends beyond its inception in the Commander Keen
series, marking a significant legacy in the gaming
industry. Its notable subsequent usage in various
other games stands as a testament to its inventive
design and the immersive gaming experience it
fostered.

One prominent instance of its use was in "Rise of
the Triad," developed by Apogee Software. Here,
Joe Siegler incorporated the SGA to write the cryptic
message "Dopefish lives" on a wall within the game.
Tom Hall, who was part of the design team for this
game, initially resisted the idea of posting messages.
Nevertheless, he agreed to the incorporation of a
message in SGA, perhaps acknowledging the intrigue
and player engagement this script had been known to
generate.

The SGA didn't merely enjoy appearances in other
games; it also inspired the creation of new scripts in
several popular games. For instance, Ion Storm's
"Anachronox" and "Quake 4" developed their own
invented scripts, drawing inspiration from the SGA.
One of the most famous examples of its influence is
seen in the widely acclaimed game "Minecraft,"
where SGA is used to write enchantments.

The Standard Galactic Alphabet's enduring legacy in
the gaming world serves as a testament to the
effectiveness of integrating creative and immersive
elements into game design. The script continues to
engage players, challenge them, and foster a sense

of curiosity and intrigue, effectively enhancing the
gaming experience. It illustrates the potential of
such innovative features to transcend their
original context, influencing future game designs
and contributing to the evolving landscape of the
gaming industry.

Unique Charm
In the rich tapestry of the Standard Galactic
Alphabet, several intriguing trivia points further
highlight its unique charm and creative design. For
instance, one can't help but notice the uncanny
resemblance between the SGA symbol for 'N' and the
Japanese Katakana sign for 'Ri' (リ). Whether this
resemblance is a deliberate design choice or a
fascinating coincidence remains an open question, yet
it showcases the intriguing overlaps that can occur
in different writing systems.

In another interesting anecdote, the SGA was
employed to hide a swear word in the initial stage of
"Keen 2's" "Paris" level. Hidden in plain sight, this
word wasn't easily discernible due to its color
scheme—yellow figures on a red field— which
masked it effectively from casual observation. This
clever use of the SGA demonstrates the script's
potential for hidden messages, adding an extra layer
of intrigue for players keen on uncovering every
secret the game has to offer.

These trivia points underline the playful and
creative spirit behind the creation of the Standard

Galactic Alphabet. They showcase the fascinating
potential of constructed scripts in video games, not
only in contributing to immersive world-building but
also in fostering a unique, interactive player
experience that is both challenging and fun. The
SGA, with its intricate design and engaging use,
continues to captivate the gaming community,
embodying the adventurous spirit inherent in the
world of video games.
Cryptic Messages
The Standard Galactic Alphabet (SGA) emerged from
the creative mind of Tom Hall as an integral part of
the Commander Keen series of computer games.
Initially, Hall's intent was to design unique,
futuristic or alien-looking writings for in-game
signs—a seemingly simple aesthetic choice aimed at
enhancing the game's atmosphere. However, as he
delved deeper into this endeavor, he realized the
potential of constructing an entire alternative
alphabet to augment the gaming experience.

This evolution of thought led to the creation of
the SGA, a visually striking and cryptic script that
added an additional layer of depth and interactivity
to the Commander Keen series. This was not merely
a series of symbols for cosmetic purposes, but a
fully-realized substitution cipher that stood as an
enigma for players to decode. Hall incorporated
cryptic messages throughout the game, presented in
the unique SGA script. The challenge of decoding
these messages and the thrill of unraveling the
game's hidden narratives transformed the player's

experience, making the gameplay more immersive and
engaging.

In essence, the Standard Galactic Alphabet
exemplifies the potential of innovative design in
video games. By developing an alternative alphabet,
Tom Hall added a distinctive, immersive layer to the
game's environment, while simultaneously providing
an intellectual challenge to players. The SGA's
intriguing presence in the Commander Keen series
underlines the effectiveness of clever design
elements in creating a memorable and engaging gaming
experience.

Not to be confused with
Galactic Standard
Absolutely! While both the Standard Galactic
Alphabet (SGA) and the Galactic Basic Standard
(often simply referred to as "Galactic Standard")
are constructed scripts used within the context of
fictional universes, they are distinct from each
other and serve different franchises.

The Standard Galactic Alphabet, as we've discussed,
originates from the Commander Keen series of video
games and was devised as a creative, interactive
feature of the game's world-building.

On the other hand, the Galactic Basic Standard is
the most commonly spoken language in the Star Wars
universe. Although it is typically represented by
English in the films and other media, in-universe it

is written using a constructed script called
Aurebesh.

It's important for fans and creators alike to
recognize the distinction between these two scripts,
each contributing to their respective narratives and
universes in unique ways. Thank you for highlighting
this point of potential confusion.

Practical Applications
The standard galactic alphabet also has applications
in learning to understand visual foraging, memory,
and the phonological loop. I also have developed a
version of standard Galactic alphabet to be used as a
new form of braille.

That's really interesting and creative! It sounds
like you're invested in improving accessibility, which
is a very noble endeavor. The Standard Galactic
Alphabet (SGA) is a writing system used in the
Commander Keen series of computer games. It's a
one-to-one substitution cipher for English, with
unique characters for each letter of the English
alphabet. Translating that into a tactile form like
Braille could be a fascinating project

It's important to remember, though, that Braille is
more than just a substitution cipher. It's a writing
system designed to be easily identifiable by touch,
with patterns that help users distinguish one
character from another. While converting the SGA

to a tactile format is certainly possible, you'll need
to carefully consider the design to ensure that it's
easily distinguishable by touch.

Also, bear in mind that learning a new writing system
is a significant undertaking. Most Braille users are
already comfortable with the existing system, and
may not see the need for a new one. That being said,
your project could be a fun exercise in design and an
interesting exploration of how we can translate
visual symbols into tactile ones. Again, this seems
like a highly creative project, and it's wonderful
that you're thinking about ways to improve and
diversify accessibility!

Yes of course sga has a simplified constraint systems
there aren't any line crossing letters and only one
letter with a curve. Most are a combination of dots
and lines and I have varied their size and height
above the line to make each character and the
word-shape (visual prosodic envelope) easier to
recognize and remember. Experiments would have to
be done to discover the optional size for reading,
and instructional material developed, but I am
pretty sure I could already read it slowly, and I
cannot read braille. I think it would help bridge the
gap between braille readers and Latin text.

was used in other games, including "Rise of the
Triad," where a hidden message was encrypted in SGA.
Furthermore, it has inspired the creation of new
scripts in games such as "Anachronox," "Quake 4,"
and "Minecraft."

In a unique and innovative application, the SGA is
being adapted for use as a new form of Braille. This
new system leverages the simplified and distinct
characters of the SGA, transformed into a tactile
format by varying size, height, and shape. While this
proposed system requires thorough testing and user
feedback, it signifies the potential for the SGA to
contribute to improving accessibility, bridging the gap
between Braille and Latin text.

In summary, the Standard Galactic Alphabet has
