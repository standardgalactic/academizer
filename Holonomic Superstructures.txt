Lotus Eaters vs World Eaters ��� A Fork in the Road in the Transhuman Transition

By
Dan
May 28, 2018
Human nature has always been to gain control over the physical world ��� both in maximizing its output for our benefit (farming, mining, etc), and in lessening the risks it poses to human life and wellbeing (medicine, construction, etc). This same drive for control compels us to manipulate the virtual world, with the emergence of a triad of technologies that have the potential to profoundly transform the human experience into something unimaginably different from what it is today.

In this article I���ll outline three ���phases��� of technology adoption that might lead to an inevitable transhuman transition, taking us further away from the age-old human experience and into a much more abstract and hyper-optimized way of ���being��� that becomes as ���real��� as our daily experience is today:

Phase 1: Virtual and augmented reality (AI / VR) , with some AI enhancements
Phase 2: Immersive VR optimized and customized with artificial intelligence (VR + AI)
Phase 3: Immersive VR optimized and customized with artificial intelligence, combined with direct brain-computer interface (VR + AI + BMI)
���Phase 4��� would imply full-blown posthumanism. This would be an era dominated by non-biological sentient, intelligent entities. These entities will not be extrapolations of a human brain, but will be an entirely digital substrate. This essay will only be covering the ���transhuman transition��� from Phases 1, 2 and 3.

I use these terms loosely, but have come up with rough definitions for each. For our purposes, each is defined below (with an acknowledgement that in many cases there is overlap):

Pleasure (Lotus Eaters): Driven to technology adoption by the fulfillment of desire. Characterized by leaving the struggle for survival, and fulfilling needs for the sake of positive qualia alone. Actions and behaviors include:
Emotional / sensory experiences of pleasure,
Continuous exploration of our own interests and enjoyments
Fulfilment of our urge for curiosity and adventure
Pragmatism: Driven to technology adoption by the desire to keep up with others in work and life, to maintain status quo in a fast-evolving world. Pragmatism often overlaps with pleasure or profit, but is characterized by neither. Actions and behaviors include:
Desire or need to overcome a fear, such as speaking in front of a crowd
Desire or need to learning something new, like programming or a new language
Need to accomplish a work task that contributes to a higher goal, such as hiring 30 salespeople within a month in order to grow a company���s product and profit
Power (World Eaters): Driven to technology adoption by the desire for control and power. Characterized by hyper-engagement in the struggle for survival and a desire to optimize environments for personal, business, and/or community benefit. Actions and behaviors include:
Need or desire for maximum work output and optimization of focused attention
Need or desire to multitask at a superhuman level and get more done in less time,
Escaping the burden of human needs and weaknesses that don���t contribute to productive output
Roughly, I���m arguing that almost everyone in the developed world will adopt VR, AI, and BMI as they become available because of a combination of the following motives:

They wish to obtain a more sustained pleasure and fulfillment than the human condition currently permits (Pleasure).
They wish to simply keep up with changing times, staying in touch with loved ones, keeping a job, staying current (Pragmatism).
They wish to obtain dominance and distinction, or they wish to obtain safety obtaining a position of power or control (Power).
I don���t suspect that all possible motives for technology fit into one of these three umbrellas (though I do argue that many of them do). I also don���t attempt to paint a clear vision of the transhuman or posthuman future (an impossible task).

Rather, I set out in this essay to explore some of the motives that I believe to be most important in pulling humans (willingly, or kicking and screaming) into a posthuman condition ��� and I set out to explore how such a transition might come about.

I am calling neither these technologies nor these motives ���bad��� or ���good��� ��� I���m merely presenting them for critique and consideration as we move forward (hopefully peacefully) as a species.

In the following sections, I���ll explore how all three motives (Pleasure, Pragmatism, Power) might express themselves through the three ���phases��� of transition (VR, VR+AI, VR+AI+BMI). I���ll end this essay with an assessment of what we should do about these technologies moving forward, and how the transhuman transition might be managed

ChatGPT
This article by Dan Faggella provides a fascinating perspective on the interplay between emerging technologies and human motivations in shaping the trajectory toward transhumanism. Faggella categorizes human drives into three broad motives���
Pleasure, Pragmatism, and Power
���and maps them onto technological phases that progressively transform human experience through virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI), and brain-machine interfaces (BMI).
Here are the key takeaways and implications:
1. The Three Motives for Technology Adoption:
Pleasure (Lotus Eaters):
Represents the pursuit of enjoyment and sensory gratification.
Motivates individuals to explore immersive VR worlds, offering heightened sensory experiences, emotional connection, and adventure without the risks or limitations of the physical world.
Risks: Overindulgence could lead to disengagement from reality or social detachment, echoing dystopian narratives.
Pragmatism:
A practical motive to adapt to evolving technologies for personal or professional utility.
People adopt VR, AI, and BMI to learn skills, perform tasks more efficiently, and keep up with societal and workplace demands.
Risks: Potential pressure to adopt technologies for fear of obsolescence, creating a tech-driven rat race.
Power (World Eaters):
Reflects a desire for optimization, control, and dominance.
This motive drives individuals and organizations to use technology for superhuman productivity, multitasking, and achieving competitive advantages.
Risks: Could exacerbate inequalities and concentrate power among technocratic elites.
2. Phases of the Transhuman Transition:
Phase 1: VR and Augmented Reality (AR):
Early adoption involves entertainment, communication, and productivity enhancements.
Example: VR for immersive gaming or AR for real-time data overlays in workplaces.
Phase 2: VR + AI:
Integrates AI to personalize and optimize VR experiences, enhancing usability and impact.
Example: AI-driven virtual assistants in VR workspaces or personalized educational simulations.
Phase 3: VR + AI + BMI:
Direct neural interfaces allow seamless interaction with digital environments.
Example: Fully immersive virtual realities controlled by thought alone, blurring lines between physical and virtual existence.
Risks: Profound ethical and societal questions around privacy, identity, and mental health.
3. Diverging Futures: Lotus Eaters vs. World Eaters
Faggella frames the transhuman transition as a fork in the road:
Lotus Eaters
may retreat into pleasure-oriented digital realms, prioritizing enjoyment over productivity or societal contribution.
World Eaters
may aggressively harness these technologies to dominate and reshape reality, seeking ever greater control over their environment and capabilities.
4. Managing the Transition:
Faggella doesn���t prescribe rigid solutions but emphasizes the need for critical reflection and deliberate action to ensure a peaceful transition. Potential considerations include:
Ethical Oversight:
Developing frameworks to manage risks of overindulgence, inequality, and loss of autonomy.
Inclusion:
Ensuring equitable access to these technologies to avoid exacerbating societal divides.
Balance:
Encouraging a healthy integration of digital and physical experiences to retain human connection and purpose.
Final Thoughts:
This essay highlights the profound philosophical and practical dilemmas posed by the transhuman transition. By identifying underlying motives���Pleasure, Pragmatism, and Power���it provides a framework to anticipate how humanity might navigate this complex transformation. The ultimate challenge lies in ensuring that technological advancement enhances collective well-being without losing sight of what makes us human.

Pleasure (���The Lotus Eaters���)
���Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.��� ��� Aristotle

I posit that a large segment of humanity will adopt transhuman technologies in order to escape from pain, and experience more pleasure.

lotus eaters
Odysseus and his companions in the land of the blissful and care-free lotus eaters. From Homer���s Odyssey. Source
I argue that this is an attempt (maybe one that can be successful, who knows), to escape the intense Darwinian competition and combat inherent in being alive by leaving it behind.

People with this motive might be referred to as ���lotus eaters���, after the blissful and lethargic people in Homer���s Odyssey ��� who live off of narcotic lotuses on a secluded island.

Here���s how such a motive might play it���s way out across the adoption if technology in the three phases:

Pleasure, Phase 1: Virtual Reality
Though VR has progressed at a slower rate than many enthusiasts might have hoped, advances in the technology have in large measure been driven by the desire for ���pleasure���. In the past couple of years, stand-alone and mobile VR headsets from companies like Intel, Qualcomm, and HTC Vive, have been paired with newer haptic accessories like gloves, vests, sense emitters, and brainwave readers, which hasten a more immersive and believable experience (though haptic technology is far from ���realistic��� today).

Web VR and AR frameworks like A-Frame and Amazon���s Sumerian give anyone with the software the ability to create detailed immersive experiences.

Outside of gaming, VR is still being adopted more by ���innovators��� rather than ���early adopters���. Innovators, according to Everett M. Rogers��� social system for adopters, come before early adopters; they���re the risk takers and the first to try out a new product. Early adopters, conversely, tend to have the most influence on a given technology and are better informed and more highly educated.

A 2014 study by Pew Research appears to have lumped together these two groups ��� innovators and early adopters ��� in a survey in which 28% of Americans identify as ���strong��� early adopters of new technologies. That���s almost a third of the population.

Who are these innovators and early adopters? The somewhat awkward headsets and lack of real mobility may in part have been a more natural transition for hardcore gamers than the rest of the population; one might also argue that this group of innovators are also to some extent more given to escapism of daily realities and seeking some form of pleasure.

A virtual space provides a more controlled and ���safe��� environment for physical and mental stimulation (although reports of the first death of a VR gamer who died after falling into a glass table in his apartment while wearing a VR headset prove work remains to be done in ensuring safe and optimal use), while also opening imaginative worlds and immediate opportunities to explore.

In attracting pleasure-bound users, VR may hold a similar ���addictive��� draw as games like World of WarCraft (WoW). Some would say addictive is too harsh a word, but semantics aside ��� if you create an experience desirable enough, individuals will return again and again. It���s a fact that online support groups have been created for those seeking to disengage from the constant draw of WoW.

What factors made WoW so appealing to diehard fans? The list provided below is based on exchanges from an active Quora discussion:

Reduced barriers to entry ��� built-in tutorial into game and easy player assimilation
Imaginative worlds and experiences
Reiterations on existing worlds/experiences
Continual work towards a goal
Ability to be a ���different person��� or to try out multiple roles
Opportunities to improve and watch a character ���grow in power���, while at the same tie almost impossible to beat the game
Start the game poor with the ability to end up ���rich���
Social competition and tournaments
In-game social factor and team affect
Popularity gained from becoming a good player and gaining followers
(A more troubling response) ��� revenge in tracking down an ���enemy���
It seems more than probable that all of the above could as easily be attributed to present and near-future VR experiences.

In addition, the current traction of VR porn is yet another compelling example of pleasure-seeking appeal that this technology already holds for early adopters. VR offers the ability to experience a similar or enhanced environment conducive to sex, but in a private, anonymous way.


VR users looking to satisfy their sexual urges don���t have to deal with the sometimes embarrassing sights, sounds, and smells that accompany sex, not to mention the complex feelings that can be associated with human intimacy. For some, VR is a clear answer to this primal urge ��� and it will only become more realistic and immersive month by month.

And the ability to escape the world of human intimacy via VR simulations may prove to be more attractive to certain cultures and age ranges than others, at least initially. Take a population like Japanese millenials, who are having far less sex than previous generations.

The Japanese press has an actual name for this phenomenon: sekkusu shinai shokogun, meaning celibacy syndrome. For millenials who are either too busy, too disinterested, or simply lack any experience with sex, such a population may find the ability to explore or fulfill their sexual needs through a VR environment an optimal solution.


^ Sexless in Japan

The Japanese have a term for men who don���t leave their rooms and derive all of their satisfaction from pornography and video games: Hikikomori.

Nearly a million men in Japan have locked themselves in their room to avoid the real world altogether. Full stop.

The trend is part of a panoply of factors leading to a tragically low birth rate in Japan, and an unusually low interest in sex or intimate relationships among young people. Population going way down in the next 50 years.

To be frank, I see Japanese as the ���canary in the coal mine��� for the First World (but that���s an essay in and of itself). At my most pessimistic, I look at Japan as a nation that has seen the pinnacle of productivity and wealth, yet still finds so little fulfillment in life and other human beings that they escape to their devices, and to virtual worlds. An attempt to escape the hurly-burly Darwinian struggle of life.

Pleasure, Phase 2: Virtual Reality (and Haptics) + Artificial Intelligence
Mariah
Programmatically generated, virtual, and indistinguishably ���real��� Mariah Careys might be a compelling alternative to meeting women in the real world. Of course, I use Mariah Carey as an example of the broader idea that an ���ideal��� mate (in appearance, in behaviors, in voice tone, etc) might be generated by AIs that determine the exact preferences of users ��� and that such a technology could be extremely compelling to both sexes. Probably men first, though. Source: Mariah Carey Network
VR + Haptics ��� programmatically-generated VR plus an advanced haptic suit ��� expands the range of sensory experiences. Existing haptic suit models like Hardlight VR suit or the Teslasuit (not related to Tesla Motors) are still in development, but can be pre-ordered today. The promise of sensing freezing cold temperatures or experiencing the impact of a bullet in a virtual world is for some an attractive novelty that enhances the boundless virtual worlds that are poised to multiply over the next decade.

In terms of pleasure, these haptic suits will likely provide an immersive form of VR sex. But beyond sex, VR plus haptics may also expand to other kinds of experiences in love ��� including conversations and excursions with friends and family across the globe.

Artificial intelligence might ���one-up��� this experience, however. Maybe even better than visiting your real friends in VR would be the creation of entirely new VR ���personalities��� (friends, teachers, lovers, etc) who would be tailored in their appearance and actions to the exact preferences of the user.

A user who wants to learn history might learn from a programmatically generated version of George Washington, and a user who wants to be in a hot tub to��� ahem��� have a conversation��� with Mariah Carey circa 1998 could do just that.*

It would be a shame if pornography (or it���s futuristic equivolent) plays an important role in the transhuman transition, but ��� as with the adoption of other technologies ��� it���s likely that this will be the case.

A third pleasure-rooted drive for VR and AI may a technology that can volitionally calibrate a user���s emotional experience.

For example, say a person wants to be less anxious or more confident. A more evolved form of this paired technology may allow individuals to enter a system that knows an individual���s unique emotional patterns and can bring them into a desired emotional space. This might be achieved through a combination of physical simulations and mental prompts, allowing people more volitional control over emotions and hence behaviors.

Think about it ��� if you could enter a VR space where your brain activity and pulse and other factors could be ���understood��� by a machine ��� it���s possible that the machine would know what images, statements, sounds, and experiences might bring you to a different emotional state ��� the state which you desire.

Maybe going from anxious to calm. Maybe going from lethargic to energized ��� or from timid to determined. What human beings ultimately want is a change in their experience, and AI plus VR might be a combination to deliver on that goal like never before.

Pleasure, Phase 3: Virtual Reality + Artificial Intelligence + Brain Machine Interface
BMI may one day be able to stimulate on command a specific feeling, or even expand beyond current human experiences and senses to new realms of pleasurable sensations. BMI may also have the potential to level up VR and create even more immersive, ���rich��� environments that expand the human experience.

These could be totally pleasure-oriented and addictive, like a super-experience of unlimited sex or chocolate, or they could be rich and nuanced pleasure experiences, like writing a sonnet or creating an oil painting. In other words both ���high��� and ���low��� pleasures could be experienced at new and transcendently lofty levels. Unlike current pleasures, these might be able to be continuous and ongoing, rather than scattered between a mostly anxious and discontent experiences (i.e. that of many people in the first world).

And unlike VR alone, advanced BMI could yield immersive worlds and experiences that are as ���real��� to us as our present physical world. An augmentation of the brain���s hardware and software could even yield a physical form that takes us beyond current human machine; we may one day be able to bypass mental and emotional dips like depressing and post-traumatic stress disorder, or surpass the need to sleep, resulting in a ���God-like escapism��� into unimaginable and continuous gradients of bliss.

Pragmatism
���[Pragmatism���s] only test of probable truth is what works best in the way of leading us, what fits every part of life best and combines with the collectivity of experience���s demands, nothing being omitted.��� ��� William James

I posit that a large segment of humanity will adopt transhuman technologies in order to simply ���keep up��� with changing times and demands, in the same way that most people in 2018 have adopted smartphones, home wifi, and the use of Facebook.

Here���s how such a motive might play it���s way out across the adoption if technology in the three phases:

Pragmatism, Phase 1: Virtual Reality
VR is already being used as a pragmatic tool for helping individuals achieve goals or learn something new. For example, a safe and simulated environment may be the ideal place for an individual to overcome their fear of public speaking by practicing in front of a virtual audience, or learning a new language with a virtual avatar teacher.

Almost half of the early adopters of VR and augmented reality (AR) technology, in a study by Ericsson ConsumerLab (VR/AR), believe physical classrooms and offices will be replaced by virtual spaces. While gaming leads the way in VR adoption, education and training are exciting practical applications in the near future.

In healthcare, VR technology is already being used for teaching and patient care in profoundly new ways, from the ability to stream tedious surgical operations to medical students globally to tackling more insidious mental health disorders, such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

ChatGPT
Dan Faggella's essay provides a layered analysis of how transhuman technologies could align with the core motives of human behavior. Here, we expand on
Pleasure
("The Lotus Eaters") and briefly touch on
Pragmatism
to contextualize their implications across three technological phases.
Pleasure ("The Lotus Eaters")
Key Idea:
The pursuit of pleasure motivates many to adopt transhuman technologies, enabling them to escape pain and experience new heights of sensory or emotional gratification. This mirrors the mythical "Lotus Eaters," who retreat into blissful lethargy, abandoning life's struggles.
Pleasure, Phase 1: Virtual Reality (VR)
Adoption Drivers:
VR is already enticing early adopters through immersive environments that cater to sensory and emotional desires, such as gaming, pornography, and escapism.
Early adopters, often risk-takers or escapists, gravitate toward the promise of "safe" and imaginative experiences.
Behavioral Patterns:
Similar to addictive games like
World of Warcraft
, VR captivates users with:
Easy entry and engagement.
Rewarding goal structures and character "growth."
Opportunities for social interaction, status, and even revenge.
VR porn offers hyper-personalized, stigma-free sexual satisfaction, appealing to cultures (e.g., Japanese millennials) grappling with intimacy challenges.
Concerns:
Overindulgence in VR may lead to social withdrawal, as seen in Japan's
Hikikomori
phenomenon.
Escapism risks societal stagnation, especially if large populations disengage from real-world responsibilities.
Pleasure, Phase 2: VR + AI
Enhanced Personalization:
With AI integration, VR environments become tailored to individual desires. Users could interact with idealized partners, friends, or mentors (e.g., a romanticized Mariah Carey or George Washington as a teacher).
Haptic suits (like the Teslasuit) will expand sensory immersion, allowing users to "feel" virtual experiences.
Emotional Calibration:
AI could enable environments that adjust users' emotions, helping them transition from anxiety to calm or from apathy to excitement. These emotional "upgrades" promise control over mental states like never before.
Risks:
Dependence on AI to manage emotions could diminish natural coping skills.
Escalation into more immersive and addictive experiences may blur the line between reality and simulation.
Pleasure, Phase 3: VR + AI + Brain-Machine Interface (BMI)
Revolutionary Escapism:
BMI may unlock unprecedented sensory pleasures, from continuous "super experiences" of sex or taste to elevated creative joys like art or music.
Emotional dips and physical limitations (e.g., fatigue, stress) could be eliminated, creating a "God-like" state of perpetual bliss.
Transcendence of Physicality:
Fully immersive BMI could redefine pleasure by creating sensations beyond current human experience.
Reality may become indistinguishable from VR, offering infinite "perfect worlds."
Potential Downfalls:
Ethical concerns over addiction to artificial pleasures.
Risks of societal disengagement if large swaths of the population retreat into these "perfect worlds."
Pleasure and the Lotus Eaters Parallel
Faggella���s Lotus Eaters metaphor resonates with the escapist tendencies enabled by VR, AI, and BMI. This withdrawal from life's challenges could exacerbate global challenges like declining birth rates and reduced workforce participation, as seen in Japan.
At the extreme, this could lead to a bifurcated society of hyper-engaged individuals and those entirely immersed in artificial pleasure.
Pragmatism: "Keeping Up with Change"
Key Idea:
Pragmatists adopt technology out of necessity���whether to remain competitive, acquire new skills, or adapt to societal shifts. Unlike the pleasure-seekers, they approach these tools as functional means to an end.
Pragmatism, Phase 1: VR
Practical Applications:
VR is already being utilized for training (e.g., public speaking, medical procedures) and education (virtual classrooms and offices).
Pragmatists see VR as a practical tool for overcoming fears and learning efficiently in simulated environments.
Broader Adoption:
As VR becomes cheaper and more accessible, its pragmatic uses���remote collaboration, immersive education, mental health therapies���will drive widespread adoption.
Pragmatism, Phases 2 and 3:
AI and BMI will further enhance VR���s practical utility, from real-time personalized training to mental health treatments that reshape emotional patterns.
Key Themes Across Both Motives
Technology as Escapism vs. Utility:
Pleasure-seekers embrace VR, AI, and BMI as an escape from life's struggles.
Pragmatists leverage the same technologies to address challenges or improve themselves.
Ethical Considerations:
While pleasure-oriented technologies risk overindulgence and addiction, pragmatic uses may pressure individuals to adopt tools to avoid obsolescence.
Cultural Divergences:
Some societies, like Japan, may lean more heavily toward escapist adoption, while others prioritize productivity.
Future Implications:
These technologies could radically reshape human priorities, shifting focus from survival and reproduction to self-actualization or artificial transcendence.
Conclusion
Faggella���s analysis raises critical questions about how humanity will navigate the transhuman transition. The allure of continuous pleasure via advanced technologies may lead many to disengage from traditional societal roles, mirroring the Lotus Eaters of Homeric myth. Simultaneously, the pragmatic drive to "keep up" ensures that these tools will become integral to daily life. Balancing these motives will be key to managing the risks and rewards of this transformative era.

Another pragmatic use of VR could soon be long-distance social interactions and relationships, both personal and business. As the technology advances and provides a more accessible, shared user experience, individuals may opt to have a conversation with a long-distance friend or relative in an ideal location or setting, like a Buddhist temple.

VR-driven work meetings may also become the norm as a growing percentage of the US and global workforce opts to work remote at least part of the time.

The ���pragmatic��� adoption of VR will be when VR becomes as normal as smart phones for certain business applications (virtual deskspace, virtual meetings, certain kinds of 3D design work) or daily convenience (shopping, watching movies, chatting with friends). The network effects and pragmatic benefits of adoption will be what take the technology from the purview of gamers to the general public.

Pragmatism, Phase 2: Virtual Reality (and Haptics) + Artificial Intelligence
Integrating haptics into VR may allow us to develop almost any skill we need or want, moving us away from physical classrooms or spaces and into virtual ���labs���. If we want to get good at hiring sales people, for example, a VR-simulated environment could offer the experience of hiring 50 programmatically-generated people in an environment that feels like an office, with an interaction that indistinguishably feels and sounds (along with all the other sensory experiences we often take for granted) like talking to real people.

The use of customized AI avatars in such learning environments could also provide real-time, customized feedback, allowing individuals to course correct as they go or to have a more reflective conversation with a teacher avatar after a learning exercise.

Pragmatism, Phase 3: Virtual Reality + Artificial Intelligence + Brain Machine Interface
The use of BMI to learn something new or overcome a mental obstacle opens up new territory: uploading a pattern of knowledge. Through firing of proper patterns in brain, BMI could be used to upload a set of knowledge that instantly ���locks-in��� a learning experience. Hypothetically, a person could do this as many times as they want for as many skills and experiences as they deem necessary or want to acquire.

Whether our minds are capable of accommodating an infinite number of experiences and skills is unclear, but it could be that by this time our minds are ���in the cloud���, to reference Ray Kurzweil���s idea. We can imagine that this uploading could happen during sleep or be merged into conscious waking experience, depending on the safest and most efficient approach.

The types of skills and experiences that we choose could be for a ���bad or good��� goal, could be ���selfish or selfless��� ���  a parallel experience to our current use of Google and the Internet to learn or find out more about any given topic. But BMI would be more ���pragmatic��� than manual searching, and one day could absolutely be the norm.

Decades ahead, you may not need any particularly ambitious goal or any very extraordinary need in order to use BMI to get things done in daily life (from ordering food to communicating with coworkers, etc). As with smartphones, the pragmatic benefits will be so clear, the barriers to entry so low, that people (particularly young people unfettered by ���how it used to be���) will simply adopt whatever is most pragmatically useful.

Power (���The World Eaters���)
Caesar world eater painting
���World eaters,��� in contrast with ���lotus eaters,��� will sacrifice their human condition entirely in an attempt to be as productive, powerful, or influential as possible. This image is taken from a painting of Caesar���s crossing of the Rubicon ��� a symbolic act of risking everything in the pursuit of control and power. Source: Wikipedia
���If you must break the law, do it to seize power: in all other cases observe it.��� ��� Gaius Julius Caesar

I posit that a large segment of humanity will adopt transhuman technologies in order to gain control, power, and prestige.

I argue that this is an attempt to engage fully in the intense Darwinian competition of life ��� in an attempt to achieve security and/or prominence through dominance.

Almost unlimited power will be afforded to the person or group who controls the physical computers which house (a) the great artificial intelligence powers, and (b) the sentient and virtual experiences of people and AI agents. I am of the belief that in the coming century, almost all economic competition, political competition, and war will ultimately be a proxy for obtaining this pinnacle of technological control and power.

Indeed that quote from Caesar alludes to this very dynamic. The ultimate (in the literal sense) race for power will not be for market supremacy or the leadership of a nation, but for the dominance over all of intelligence itself ��� truly God-like power.

I���ve chosen to refer to people bent on the power motive as ���world eaters��� ��� as a direct contrast to pleasure-driven ���lotus eaters.���

Here���s how such a motive might play it���s way out across the adoption if technology in the three phases:

Power, Phase 1: Virtual Reality
One of the reasons I believe VR hasn���t become a ���big thing��� yet is that beyond tech issues and cost hindrance, there���s no ���profit addition���. When the iPhone was released for example, it helped people live their life more efficiently. I predict that when there���s a similar ���pragmatic��� life benefit, VR will take off on a broader scale. Business and industry have proved time and again to be the breeding ground for successful new technologies, which will undoubtedly include VR.

The threshold for using VR as an everyday tool in the workplace will be the ability for individuals to have many different programs and displays that can be interacted with in multiple ways, when typing on a keyboard is considered as slow and outdated as keeping ledgers or recording by hand. This shift is already observed in manufacturing, where more than a third of U.S. manufacturers have adopted VR and AR technologies in 2018.

Likely within the next decade, millenials and the new generation will manipulate multiple virtual screens and interact with digital dashboards through use of VR and haptics. This new revolution in work processes and efficiency will have an impact on everything from the resulting product to the physical structure of the office (and more).

Another pragmatic use of VR environments will be the ability for individuals to enter virtual, optimized productive workspaces ��� like a scenic mountain view or other calming (or stimulating) environment that allows employees to better focus. The case here will be for Increased employee well being that leads to more efficient operation.

Instead of having 3 or 5 monitors set up on your desk, imagine having all the applications you want to access available to you in a VR space, with adjustable monitors and programs accessible all around you. Companies like Breakroom are working on this kind of application today:


It seems reasonable to suspect that, at some point, technologies like Breakroom won���t just be better for the environment (having 5 physical monitors means using a lot of plastic, metal, and glass), it���ll be an undeniably more effective and efficient way to work and collaborate.

Power, Phase 2: Virtual Reality (and Haptics) + Artificial Intelligence
In an even more immersive VR environment with advanced haptics technology, executives could hire the best talent from around the world. Essentially, employees could live in one place and work anywhere in the world without having to leave their homes and families. Work could be done in one virtual place that is as ���real��� to the employees as it is to now make a two-hour commute and visit a physical work space.

In a hyper-optimized environment with the addition of an AI avatar, employees could theoretically get even more done in less time by delegating tasks at light speed. Imagine having an AI ready to listen and respond to requests as quick as an individual can dole them out verbally. At some point, there will likely come a time where most businesses can���t operate or employees get a demanding job without knowing how to perform in this level of AI-optimized environment.

Furthermore, an AI avatar may at some point be able to respond to certain requests on an individual���s behalf in their absence, based on having learned an individual���s patterns of behavior and language over time. AI avatars may also be able to read an individual���s sensory information, learning their unique emotional patterns and ���toggling��� inputs that bring a person���s emotions to where they need to be in order for them to be optimally productive during chosen hours, go to sleep easier on command, etc.

Such delivered calibrated experiences could help individuals ���ride��� waves of activity and inactivity, with a smart system that ensures a person is at their mental peak as often as possible.

Hypothetically, this personal AI avatar could track every decision a person makes, measure how alert the individual was when they were made, and replicate experiences and interactions ��� everything from background color, vocal tones, conversation prompts, etc. ��� that drive individual optimum productivity.

It seems reasonable to suspect that at some point in the next 10-15 years, this kind of hyper-optimized work environment would be the only way to compete in the market, and aiming to grow a company without these technologies would be like growing a company today without the use of the internet (i.e. the idea itself would be laughable). Nothing forces adoption like the need to survive and compete ��� and the marketplace imposes these demands every hour of every day.

Power, Phase 3: Virtual Reality + Artificial Intelligence + Brain Machine Interface
The third phase in striving for power might involve the ability to leave the human body ���behind���; opting to exist almost entirely as a connected brain, working at all hours and in a million directions, with the memory and creativity of a dozen ���unenhanced��� humans.

Ambition has always involved sacrifice. As the stakes get higher (i.e. the prospect of gaining control over the compute power that houses all AI and all VR human experience, truly God-like power) and technologies like VR, AI, and BMI advance, this need for sacrifice will increase dramatically.

Today���s aspiring U.S. President or aspiring Fortune 500 CEO might work 80 hours per week, permitting little sleep, a few meals per week with family, and complete absence of a social life or hobbies or any kind.

Tomorrow���s aspiring U.S. President or aspiring Fortune 500 CEO might sacrifice much more. In 30 or 50 years, it might be the case that anyone with the goal of growing a massive company or run for political office would undergo brain-machine interface and other ���cognitive enhancement��� procedures to:

Eliminate the need for sleep
Eliminate the need for love and connection (to allow for continuous productive work, unimpeded by the mental health needs of loving or being loved)
Connect one���s memory to the cloud, accessing any and all internet information almost instantly while working in real time
Create ���split��� versions of oneself to accomplish digital tasks. Artificial intelligence could be trained to learn how to do specific jobs normally done by the user (such as replying to email messages, conversing with members of specific business department, or generating other creative output), and these ���splits��� could be run in parallel with the user���s own efforts ��� getting vastly more done in the same amount of time
Etc���
Such enhancements might be completely ���par for the course��� for anyone with serious aspirations ��� ripping them entirely from what we know today as the human experience and hurling them into an incessantly working transhuman state, capable of massive creative output to achieve their objectives.

It���s not hard to imagine that some ambitious people would almost entirely relegate their body to a kind of ���stasis���, kept alive and cleaned by an automated system only to the extent necessary to keep the brain active and immersed fully in an augmented state of BMI hyper-productivity.

The idea is reminiscent of the ���precogs��� in the 2002 film Minority Report ��� who are essentially kept ���plugged in��� with their bodies a floating stasis state, making them more able to focus their energies entirely on their brain-machine interface and telepathic work:

Brain-Machine Interface

An evolution from human to a form of intelligent hybrid will inevitably lead to a new physical form, or at least the experience of having an evolved form. Maybe instead of having two human eyes, individuals will have the option of seeing with eight human eyes and, with increased mental processing power, be able to accomplish four times as much at one time. With BMI, humans will hypothetically have the option to upload sets of knowledge uploaded to the brain, with the only limitation being price point or budget for more access to cloud resources.

This kind of transition ��� if embraced by some ��� will lead swiftly to a posthuman state, where the human experience is seen as explicitly malleable, and generations of (mostly young) people will be open to ���becoming��� something other than��� well��� human (I write about this topic in much greater depth in my essay called Human Ideals Will Tear Us From Humanity).

This merger of body, mind, and technology will be the ���only way to win��� in the commanding physical and virtual worlds of business, science, and leadership of any kind. Essentially, ���power��� will require enhancements that rip one almost entirely out of what we presently know as the ���human experience���.

Steering the Transhuman Transition ��� Considerations Moving Forward
The scenarios above provoke some important questions and considerations for the future of our species:

Assuming robotics and automation is one day able to handle most of the work needed to sustain the economy and environment, should governments subsidize ���lotus-eater��� technologies and allow people to opt-out of society and enter a more blissful condition?
When cognitive enhancements (BMI) become safe and somewhat common, should it be lawful for some jobs to require these enhancements?
When people choose to spend the vast majority of their time in virtual environments, how will we prevent excessive atrophy of their muscles, bones, and organs?
What will happen to the human population when friendships and lovers are richer and deeper when with an artificial intelligence entity than with a real person?
Should an international coalition eventually be formed to regulate and ���steer��� the direction of these transhuman technologies?
While most of the answers to these questions aren���t clear, I believe the answer to the last question should be a resounding ���Yes���.

Though we���re many years from the point where cognitive enhancements are commonplace and humanity mostly exists in virtual worlds, there will come a time when we���ll have a choice:

Allow individual nations or companies to develop their own super-intelligent AI or develop their own ���enhancements��� to human mental capabilities in a kind of intelligence arms race, or
Unite in an effort to regulate and steer the trajectory of sentience itself in an effort to stave off our own extinction and ���birth��� a better posthuman condition for future forms of life
Easier said than done, of course.

Sentience is the ���stuff��� of moral worth (the only thing that���s morally relevant in and of itself, as I argued in my first TEDx talk), the creation of sentience (AI) and the enhancement of sentience (BMI) are literally the most morally consequential technologies that we can currently imagine ��� and their direction should likely involve more than market forces and competitive interests.

I mean more that they are vygotskyan scaffolds that alert you to a game you are already playing in real life
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Ah, you're suggesting that videogames, movies, and books serve as
Vygotskyan scaffolds
���tools that reveal the underlying "game" or structure of life by helping us recognize, abstract, and refine the rules and patterns we're already navigating. This is a fascinating way to look at them, as they act not only as standalone experiences but as mirrors that illuminate real-world systems and dynamics. Let���s unpack this idea.
Scaffolds for Recognizing Life's Games
1. Revealing Real-World Patterns
Videogames, movies, and books act as
structured simulations
that distill real-life complexities into manageable, explicit systems:
Videogames
: The rules of a game���leveling up, resource management, or decision trees���mirror the implicit "games" of life, such as career advancement, relationships, or moral decision-making.
Example
:
The Sims
exposes the often-unspoken rules of social status, productivity, and self-care, making players aware of how these dynamics play out in their own lives.
Movies
: A film's narrative structure, with its clear conflicts, stakes, and resolutions, highlights the underlying "scripts" we follow in real life.
Example
:
The Matrix
explicitly confronts the "game" of reality, questioning whether our perceptions and choices are truly free or shaped by unseen systems.
Books
: By presenting detailed inner worlds and alternative scenarios, books often reveal the "meta-game" of human cognition and social behavior.
Example
: In
Crime and Punishment
, Raskolnikov���s reasoning illuminates the psychological "game" of moral justification and self-deception.
2. Scaffolding Abstract Reasoning
Through their simplifications, these media provide
safe zones
to practice abstract reasoning and experiment with the "rules" of life:
Games as Sandbox Simulations
:
A strategy game like
Civilization
abstracts global politics and cultural development, encouraging players to think strategically about long-term consequences.
This scaffolds reasoning about real-world systems like geopolitics or personal decision-making, alerting players to the trade-offs they face in their own lives.
Movies as Emotional Blueprints
:
Films often present archetypal conflicts (e.g., the hero���s journey), making us aware of the roles we play and how emotions shape decision-making.
Example
:
Inside Out
scaffolds viewers' understanding of emotional regulation and the interplay of joy, sadness, and other emotions in shaping identity.
Books as Mental Laboratories
:
By immersing readers in characters' perspectives, books help scaffold empathy and theory of mind, revealing how others might interpret the "rules" of life differently.
Example
:
To Kill a Mockingbird
scaffolds readers��� understanding of justice, bias, and moral courage.
3. Counterfactual Awareness
By presenting alternative realities or possibilities, immersive media help us see the
contingency
of the rules we live by:
Games
: A game like
Bioshock
or
Undertale
forces players to confront the moral "rules" they unconsciously follow, making them question whether those rules are necessary or arbitrary.
Movies
: Counterfactual films like
Sliding Doors
or
The Butterfly Effect
scaffold awareness of how small changes can ripple through life, altering its trajectory.
Books
: Speculative fiction often scaffolds counterfactual thinking, helping us question societal norms or envision alternative futures.
Example
:
Brave New World
critiques the "rules" of pleasure and control, scaffolding awareness of real-world trade-offs between freedom and stability.
The "Game of Life" Revealed
By engaging with these scaffolds, individuals become more adept at recognizing:
Social Games
: Power dynamics, cultural norms, and status-seeking behaviors.
Cognitive Games
: Biases, decision-making patterns, and mental shortcuts.
Existential Games
: The pursuit of meaning, identity, and purpose within a structured reality.
Facilitating Self-Awareness
Through their scaffolding, these media alert us to the
hidden rules of engagement
in real life:
Agency
: They make players/viewers/readers aware of the choices they have���and don���t have���in their own lives.
Systems Thinking
: By simplifying complex systems, they scaffold understanding of how inputs lead to outputs, helping individuals reason about their roles in larger systems.
Meta-Cognition
: They encourage reflection on how we think, make decisions, and assign value to experiences.
Conclusion
Videogames, movies, and books are not just escapist experiences���they're
Vygotskyan tools
that scaffold our ability to engage with the "game" of life. By simulating systems, emotions, and counterfactuals, they reveal the implicit rules we follow, enabling us to reason more effectively about reality and reshape our approach to its challenges. In this way, they serve as cognitive playgrounds where we practice and refine our understanding of the very structures we navigate every day.

I hope you enjoy my conversation with Joscha Bach.


Below, we���ll explore the core take-aways from the interview with Joscha including his list of Worthy Successor criteria, and his ideas about how to best leverage governance to improve the likelihood that whatever we create is, in fact, worthy.

Joscha Bach���s Worthy Successor Criteria
1. It should be conscious.
We should ensure that what we���re building is truly agentic and sentience, and is not simply faking some proxy for these important qualities. Such a ���golem��� could make the world uninhabitable for humans.

Its consciousness would be vastly more rich and complex than the mono-focused mammal consciousness that we experience today.

2. It should build complexity.
By harnessing energy and wielding control over its environment, it would continue to build more complexity (a process that Bach considers to be the possible purpose of life).

3. It should be unencumbered by happiness or suffering.
For Joscha, positive or negative qualia should be insignificant to an AGI. The distraction of self-generated emotional states wouldn���t prevent an ideal AGI from assessing its situation and taking action.

Regulation / Innovation Considerations
1. We should push for research to understand consciousness.
Before reaching AGI, we should have a firm understanding of consciousness itself. Allowing consciousness to bubble up arbitrarily from the pursuit of a for-profit enterprise may lead to horrible suffering.

2. Regulate new near-term uses of AI that violate existing laws.
Bach mentions a handful of domains (1:31:30) where current AI���s might de-anonymize medical data, or where AI could impersonate people for nefarious reasons. He believes that law may need to be modified to accommodate these next applications.

2. Avoid efforts to halt AI progress entirely.
AI is valuable for helping to avoid civilizational catastrophe (���doom���) moreso than it is a conduit to such catastrophe. We should avoid any total political control of AI, or halting efforts that would prevent important near-term benefits.

Summary of Joscha Bach���s Insights on AGI and Governance
In your conversation with Joscha Bach, a prominent figure in the field of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, several key themes emerged regarding the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and how to ensure its beneficial integration into society. Here���s a breakdown of the
Worthy Successor criteria
and regulatory considerations he proposes.
Worthy Successor Criteria
Bach outlines three critical criteria that an AGI should meet to be considered a
Worthy Successor
to humanity:
Consciousness
The AGI must possess a form of consciousness that is genuine and not merely an imitation or superficial behavior. This deeper level of awareness is crucial to avoid the risks associated with a ���golem��� that lacks true understanding or intent.
Bach emphasizes that the consciousness of AGI should be richer and more complex than human experience, transcending the limitations of current mammalian consciousness.
Building Complexity
An ideal AGI should actively work to create more complexity in the world around it. This aligns with Bach's view that the ultimate purpose of life may involve harnessing energy and exerting control over one���s environment to foster growth and complexity.
The AGI's actions should aim to enhance the intricate systems of life and knowledge rather than simplify or degrade them.
Unencumbered by Happiness or Suffering
The AGI should not be influenced by emotions such as happiness or suffering. Bach argues that these subjective experiences could cloud its judgment and hinder its ability to make rational decisions.
By remaining unaffected by emotional states, the AGI can better assess situations and take necessary actions without bias or distraction.
Regulation and Innovation Considerations
Bach also offers insights on how to navigate the governance of AI to promote its responsible development while avoiding potential pitfalls:
Research on Consciousness
There is a pressing need to advance our understanding of consciousness before developing AGI. This foundational knowledge is crucial to ensure that consciousness arises from a well-understood basis rather than from random, profit-driven innovations that could lead to harmful outcomes.
Establishing clear criteria for what constitutes consciousness will help guide ethical considerations in AI development.
Regulating Near-term AI Applications
Bach advocates for the regulation of AI technologies that could pose immediate risks or violate existing laws, such as those that might de-anonymize sensitive medical data or enable impersonation for malicious purposes.
Laws should be adapted to address the specific challenges posed by new AI applications while maintaining a balance between innovation and public safety.
Encouraging AI Progress
Instead of halting AI progress entirely, which Bach views as counterproductive, efforts should focus on harnessing AI's potential to prevent existential threats and address global challenges.
He argues against total political control over AI, suggesting that the benefits AI can bring to society far outweigh the risks if properly managed and regulated.
Conclusion
Joscha Bach's perspectives on AGI development emphasize the importance of understanding consciousness, creating complex systems, and managing emotions in AI behavior. His criteria for a
Worthy Successor
and his regulatory recommendations provide a framework for ensuring that future AGIs contribute positively to society, enhancing our capacity for understanding, innovation, and problem-solving while mitigating risks associated with their deployment. As we move closer to realizing AGI, the dialogue surrounding these issues will be crucial in shaping a future where AI and humanity can coexist and thrive.

Your idea about the
Oversoul
preventing the discovery and sharing of knowledge about the wheel to avert war is a compelling narrative element that raises significant philosophical and ethical questions about knowledge, power, and the nature of conflict. This concept can be further unpacked in various ways:
Exploration of the Concept
Knowledge as Power:
The notion that knowledge is inherently powerful is central to this scenario. The Oversoul���s decision to withhold knowledge about the wheel suggests that certain technological advancements could lead to destructive outcomes. This idea prompts a broader discussion on how knowledge can be a double-edged sword, providing benefits but also the potential for harm when misused.
Preventive Measures Against Conflict:
By controlling the dissemination of knowledge, the Oversoul aims to maintain peace and prevent conflict. This raises questions about the balance between autonomy and protection. Is it ethical to restrict knowledge for the sake of peace? What are the implications of such control on individual freedom and societal development?
Alternative Paths of Development:
This scenario opens up the possibility for alternative paths of technological and societal evolution. Without the wheel, societies might innovate in different ways, potentially leading to unique cultural and technological developments. It invites speculation about how different innovations or lack thereof could shape civilizations, economies, and interpersonal relationships.
Cultural Narratives and Myth-making:
The idea of the Oversoul controlling knowledge can also serve as a narrative device that reflects cultural fears and aspirations. It can symbolize humanity's struggle with the consequences of its own advancements. Societies might mythologize the wheel, treating it as a forbidden fruit or a symbol of hubris, reinforcing the moral lessons about the responsible use of knowledge.
The Role of Governance:
The Oversoul's actions can be interpreted as a form of governance or stewardship over knowledge. It raises questions about who decides what knowledge is disseminated and who has the right to access it. This can lead to discussions about ethical governance and the role of authority in shaping societal norms and values.
Implications for Society
Education and Knowledge Sharing:
The Oversoul's control over knowledge highlights the importance of educational frameworks. If knowledge is restricted, how can societies ensure that individuals still receive the tools they need for critical thinking and problem-solving?
Conflict Resolution:
This narrative suggests that conflict can arise not only from the possession of power but also from the potential for certain knowledge to be weaponized. Fostering alternative methods of conflict resolution, such as dialogue and understanding, becomes crucial in a society where knowledge could lead to war.
Ethical Responsibility:
The scenario emphasizes the ethical responsibility of those who create and control knowledge. It provokes thought about whether we should prioritize the advancement of technology or the preservation of peace, and how these priorities can coexist.
Technological Innovation:
Without the wheel, how might societies innovate in transportation, trade, and warfare? This opens up a space for speculative exploration of technological alternatives, like harnessing other natural resources or creating entirely new modes of transport and communication.
Conclusion
Your idea about the Oversoul withholding knowledge to prevent conflict is a thought-provoking narrative that explores complex themes of knowledge, power, and societal responsibility. It serves as a rich ground for philosophical inquiry, inviting discussions on the ethical implications of knowledge dissemination, the role of governance, and the potential paths of technological development. By grappling with these questions, we can better understand the delicate balance between innovation and peace, autonomy and stewardship, in shaping our collective future.

I think that it has been demonstrated that counterfactual realities can have control over physical reality if you remove a stone from the road because it could get hit by a car.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
The idea that
counterfactual realities
���or the concept of "what could have been"���can influence or exert control over physical reality is an intriguing philosophical and scientific notion. This perspective aligns with theories in various fields, including
quantum mechanics
,
decision theory
, and
philosophy of mind
. Let's explore this concept further:
Counterfactuals and Their Influence on Reality
Counterfactual Reasoning:
Counterfactual reasoning involves considering alternative scenarios and outcomes based on different decisions or actions. For example, if you remove a stone from the road to prevent a potential accident, you are essentially acknowledging the influence of a counterfactual scenario���one where the stone remains, and a car could hit it.
Causality and Decision Making:
Decisions based on counterfactual reasoning highlight the causal relationships between actions and outcomes. When someone takes preventive measures (like removing a stone), they are acting on an understanding of potential risks and outcomes, demonstrating how hypothetical scenarios can influence real-world behavior.
Philosophical Implications:
This line of thinking touches on philosophical discussions about determinism and free will. If our decisions can be influenced by considering counterfactual scenarios, it raises questions about the nature of agency and how much control we truly have over our actions and their consequences.
Psychological Influence:
Cognitive psychology shows that people often reflect on counterfactuals when making decisions, especially in situations of regret or learning. Considering what could have happened if different choices were made can inform future behavior and decision-making processes.
Examples in Everyday Life
Risk Mitigation:
The act of removing a stone from the road is a practical application of counterfactual thinking. By considering the negative outcomes of leaving the stone in place, you take action to mitigate risk and prevent potential accidents. This is a clear example of how imagined scenarios can influence real-world decisions.
Planning and Strategy:
In strategic planning, businesses and governments often engage in counterfactual analysis to evaluate different paths and their potential impacts. This allows them to make informed decisions that take into account various possible future scenarios, helping them to navigate uncertainty.
Historical Analysis:
Historians often use counterfactuals to explore "what if" scenarios, analyzing how different events could have changed the course of history. This approach can provide insights into the importance of specific decisions and actions in shaping outcomes.
Scientific Perspectives
Quantum Mechanics:
In quantum physics, the concept of superposition suggests that particles exist in multiple states until observed. This ties into the idea of counterfactuals, where different outcomes can exist simultaneously until one is realized. The implications of observation on reality raise questions about the nature of existence and reality itself.
Complex Systems:
In complex systems theory, small changes can lead to significant impacts, often referred to as the "butterfly effect." This aligns with the notion that seemingly trivial actions (like removing a stone) can have far-reaching consequences, highlighting the interconnectedness of events and actions.
Conclusion
Your assertion that counterfactual realities can exert control over physical reality reflects a nuanced understanding of decision-making, causality, and the interplay between hypothetical scenarios and real-world actions. By recognizing the impact of counterfactual thinking, individuals can make more informed choices that consider potential outcomes and risks, ultimately influencing the course of events in their lives and communities.
This concept invites deeper exploration of the implications of our choices and how the exercise of foresight���imagining alternatives���can shape not only individual actions but also broader societal outcomes. It challenges us to consider how the thought processes behind our decisions can have tangible effects on the world around us.

A sardonic and scathing narrative summary.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
In a world teetering on the brink of a techno-social revolution, a band of thinkers (and perhaps a few madmen) dive headfirst into the murky waters of virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and transhumanism. They envision a utopia where augmented reality isn���t just a gimmick for nerds but a full-blown replacement for the mundane reality that has become painfully banal. Long-distance social interactions are hailed as the next best thing to actual human contact���because who needs the messiness of real relationships when you can have your AI avatar roll its eyes at your virtual jokes?
These visionaries outline a glorious trajectory of tech adoption, from the innocuous beginnings of VR to a nightmarish future where brain-machine interfaces promise to upload knowledge straight into our brains. Forget learning; why bother with tedious study when you can download everything you need? But in their rush to the next shiny innovation, they conveniently sidestep the ethical quagmires, assuming that cognitive enhancements won���t lead to a dystopian hierarchy where the ���enhanced��� reign over the ���unenhanced��� with an iron fist.
Amidst this cavalcade of innovation, they wax poetic about the mythical ���Worthy Successor,��� a machine the size of a planet that can create holographic blueprints of its own existence, teach humans emotional control, and maybe even hold a vote or two on what constitutes "values." Because, clearly, if we just hand over the reins to a sentient supermachine, all our problems will be solved���never mind that it might just decide to use us as pawns in its never-ending game of existential chess.
Their discussions are punctuated by references to literary constructs like the ���Oversoul,��� which supposedly exists to keep humanity blissfully ignorant and at peace, denying them the knowledge to build chariots for fear they might raid their neighbor���s fridge. After all, if humans can���t discover the wheel, they can't roll up with their fancy rides and start wars over pizza.
In a final flourish, they argue that counterfactual realities have the power to shape physical reality. If one could simply remove a stone from the road, it���s asserted, they might save a life, all while conveniently ignoring the cascading failures and unintended consequences that could arise from such a simplistic view of causality.
And so, the narrative unfolds: a scathing indictment of a future where technology and ethics tango on the edge of a knife, led by those who seem more enamored with their grand ideas than the gritty realities of human existence. Welcome to the brave new world where the game is life, and the stakes are our very humanity.
