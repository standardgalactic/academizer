Function Vectors in Large Language Models
Eric Todd, Millicent L. Li, Arnab Sen Sharma, Aaron Mueller, Byron C. Wallace, David Bau
We report the presence of a simple neural mechanism that represents an input-output function as a vector within autoregressive transformer language models (LMs). Using causal mediation analysis on a diverse range of in-context-learning (ICL) tasks, we find that a small number attention heads transport a compact representation of the demonstrated task, which we call a function vector (FV). FVs are robust to changes in context, i.e., they trigger execution of the task on inputs such as zero-shot and natural text settings that do not resemble the ICL contexts from which they are collected. We test FVs across a range of tasks, models, and layers and find strong causal effects across settings in middle layers. We investigate the internal structure of FVs and find while that they often contain information that encodes the output space of the function, this information alone is not sufficient to reconstruct an FV. Finally, we test semantic vector composition in FVs, and find that to some extent they can be summed to create vectors that trigger new complex tasks. Our findings show that compact, causal internal vector representations of function abstractions can be explicitly extracted from LLMs.

This abstract describes an intriguing study on how large language models (LLMs), specifically autoregressive transformer models, internally represent functions. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

Discovery of Function Vectors (FVs): The researchers have identified a neural mechanism within LLMs that encapsulates the essence of an input-output function in a vector form, referred to as a function vector (FV).

Causal Mediation Analysis and In-Context Learning (ICL) Tasks: Through causal mediation analysis on various ICL tasks, it was found that a handful of attention heads in the LLMs carry these FVs. These vectors represent the tasks demonstrated during in-context learning compactly and robustly, maintaining their functionality across different contexts, including zero-shot and natural text settings.

Robustness and Versatility of FVs: FVs are shown to be resilient to changes in context, suggesting that once an LLM learns a task through ICL, it can apply this knowledge to a broad range of inputs beyond the specific examples it was trained on.

Analysis Across Tasks, Models, and Layers: The study conducted experiments across various tasks, LLMs, and their layers. It found significant causal effects of FVs in the middle layers of these models, indicating that these layers play a crucial role in task execution within LLMs.

Internal Structure of FVs: An investigation into the internal makeup of FVs revealed that although they encode information relevant to the function's output space, this information alone isn't enough to fully reconstruct an FV. This suggests a complex internal structure that goes beyond simply encoding output space.

Semantic Vector Composition: The researchers also explored the possibility of combining FVs to create new vectors that can execute complex tasks, indicating a form of compositional semantics within the model's representation of tasks.

Implications: The findings highlight that LLMs develop compact, causal, and internally consistent vector representations of function abstractions. These can be explicitly extracted and potentially manipulated for various applications, providing a deeper understanding of how these models understand and process information.

This research opens exciting avenues for further exploring the internal workings of LLMs, offering potential methods for enhancing model interpretability, efficiency, and capability in processing complex tasks.

Since the study of the lambda calculus (Church, 1936), computer scientists have understood that 
the ability for a program to carry references to its own functions is a powerful idiom. Function 
references can be helpful in many settings, allowing expression of complex control l ow through 
deferred invocations (Sussman, 1975), and enabling l exible mappings from inputs to a target task. In 
this paper we report evidence that autoregressive transformers trained on large corpora of natural text 
develop a rudimentary form of function references. 
Our results begin with an examination of in-context learning (ICL; Brown et al., 2020). ICL 
mechanisms have previously been studied from the perspective of making copies (Olsson et al., 2022) 
and from a theoretical viewpoint (Von Oswald et al., 2023; Garg et al., 2022; Dai et al., 2023), but 
the computations done by large models to generalize and execute complex ICL functions are not yet 
fully understood. We characterize a key mechanism of ICL execution: function vectors (FVs), which 
are compact vector representations of input-output tasks that can be found within the transformer 
hidden states during ICL. An FV does not directly perform a task, but rather it triggers the execution 
of a specif i c procedure by the language model (Figure 1).

Function vectors arise naturally when applying causal mediation analysis (Pearl, 2001; Vig et al., 
2020; Meng et al., 2022; 2023; Wang et al., 2022a) to identify the l ow of information during ICL. 
We describe an activation patching procedure to determine the presence of a handful of attention 
heads that mediate many ICL tasks. These heads work together to transport a function vector that 
describes the task; the FV can be formed by summing outputs of the causal attention heads. 
We test the hypothesis that function vectors are a general mechanism spanning many types of 
functions. To quantify the role and eff i cacy of function vectors, we curate a data set of over 40 diverse 
ICL tasks of varying complexity. We calculate FVs for these tasks and investigate impact of FVs in 
triggering those functions across a variety of LMs scaling up from 6B to 70B parameters. 
We further ask whether FVs are portable: are the effects of an FV limited to contexts very similar to 
those where it is extracted, or can an FV apply in diverse settings? We compare the effects of FVs 
when inserted into diverse input contexts including differently-formatted forms, zero-shot formats, 
and natural text contexts. We i nd that FVs are remarkably robust, typically triggering function 
execution even in contexts that bear no resemblance to the original ICL context. 
A key question is whether the action of FVs can be explained by word-embedding vector arith- 
metic (Mikolov et al., 2013; Levy & Goldberg, 2014; Merullo et al., 2023). We examine decodings of 
FVs (Nostalgebraist, 2020), and i nd that although FVs often encode a function‚Äôs output vocabulary, 
those vocabularies do not fully identify an FV. In other words, to invoke functions, FVs need to carry 
some additional information beyond their encoding of the top vocabulary words. 
Finally, we investigate whether the space of FVs has its own vector algebra over functions rather than 
words. We construct a set of composable ICL tasks, and we test the ability of FVs to obey vector 
algebra compositions. Our i ndings reveal that, to some extent, vector compositions of FVs produce 
new FVs that can execute complex tasks that combine constituent tasks. We emphasize that FV vector 
algebra is distinct from semantic vector algebra over word embeddings: for example, composed FV 
vectors can specify nonlinear tasks such as calculating the antonym of a word, that

The document outlines a comprehensive study into the emergence of function vectors (FVs) within autoregressive transformers trained on vast corpora of natural language text, highlighting a foundational aspect of computer science: the power of function references. Here's a detailed exploration of the major points presented:

Foundation in Computer Science: It starts by acknowledging the long-understood value in computer science of programs being able to reference their own functions, a concept dating back to the work of Church in 1936 and further explored by Sussman in 1975. This capability allows for complex control flow through deferred function invocations and enables flexible mappings from inputs to target tasks.

Function References in Large Language Models (LLMs): The paper presents evidence that LLMs, specifically autoregressive transformers, develop a rudimentary form of function references through the mechanism of function vectors. This represents a significant step in understanding how LLMs manage to perform tasks across various contexts.

In-Context Learning (ICL) and Function Vectors: The study focuses on ICL, a mechanism that allows models to learn and execute tasks based on contextual examples. The authors introduce the concept of function vectors, which are compact vector representations within the transformer's hidden states that enable the execution of specific tasks demonstrated during ICL.

Activation Patching and Causal Mediation Analysis: The researchers applied causal mediation analysis to reveal how a small number of attention heads within the model mediate a wide range of ICL tasks by transporting an FV. They describe an "activation patching" procedure to identify these attention heads and how they contribute to forming an FV.

Empirical Testing of Function Vectors: Over 40 diverse ICL tasks were curated to test the generality and effectiveness of FVs. These tasks ranged in complexity, and the study examined the impact of FVs across models of varying sizes, from 6B to 70B parameters.

Robustness and Portability of FVs: The study found that FVs are remarkably robust, able to trigger function execution in a wide variety of contexts, including those significantly different from the original ICL context. This suggests that FVs possess a degree of portability that enables their use in diverse settings.

Beyond Word Embedding Arithmetic: The research also explores whether the action of FVs can be reduced to the arithmetic of word-embedding vectors. The findings suggest that FVs carry additional information beyond just encoding the output vocabulary of a function, indicating a more complex representation within the model.

Vector Algebra of FVs: Finally, the paper investigates the potential of FVs to adhere to a vector algebra, enabling the composition of FVs to execute complex, combined tasks. This aspect of FVs is distinct from the semantic vector algebra over word embeddings and points to a novel area of functionality within LLMs.

This study illuminates a sophisticated mechanism by which LLMs encapsulate and execute complex tasks, contributing significantly to our understanding of how these models process and generate language. The concept of function vectors opens up new avenues for research into the internal workings of LLMs and their potential capabilities.

2.1A MOTIVATINGOBSERVATION 
When a transformer processes an ICL prompt with exemplars demonstrating taskt, do any hidden 
states encode the task itself? We seek causal features rather than just correlations. 
We can investigate this question with the following simple test: Gather a set of ICL promptsPtfor 
the tasktand compute the average activation¬Øht ‚Ñìat the last token of each prompt at a particular layer 
‚Ñìof the model (Figure 2a). Then perform an intervention where¬Øht ‚Ñìis added to the representation 
after ‚Ñì when the transformer completes a previously unseen zero-shot prompt (Figure 2b). 
Surprisingly, we i nd that adding the average activations in this way at particular layers induces the 
model to perform the task in the new context. For example, ift =antonym, the red line in Figure 
2c shows that adding¬Øht 12at layer 12 in GPT-J causes the model to produce antonyms in a zero-shot 
context, with 24.3% accuracy. That suggests that¬Øht 12does encode the antonym task. 
The effect of¬Øht ‚Ñìleads us to ask: Can we distill a more effective hidden-state representation of the task 
t? In the rest of Section 2 we describe an analysis of the mechanisms of ICL that leads to a function 
vector representation vtwhose stronger causal effects are shown as a green line in Figure 2c.

The method section of the paper discusses a motivating observation that underpins the rest of their analysis on function vectors (FVs) in transformer-based language models. The observation and methodology unfold as follows:

2.1 A Motivating Observation
Initial Question: The research begins with a fundamental question: when a transformer processes an In-Context Learning (ICL) prompt that includes exemplars of a task 
ÔøΩ
t, are there any hidden states within the transformer that specifically encode this task? The focus is on identifying causal features that directly influence the model's behavior, rather than mere correlations.

Experimental Setup: To explore this question, the researchers employ a straightforward experiment:

Gather ICL Prompts: A set of ICL prompts

ÔøΩ
t in a new context.
Surprising Findings: The intervention yields surprising results. For instance, when the task

t is generating antonyms, adding the average activation

  at layer 12 in a model like GPT-J induces the model to produce antonyms in a zero-shot context with a notable accuracy of 24.3%. This suggests that the average activation at this layer does indeed encode information specific to the antonym generation task.

Analysis of Function Vectors (FVs)
Following this observation, the researchers aim to refine their approach to identify a more potent representation of the task within the model's hidden states. This leads to the development of a function vector representation 
ÔøΩ
ÔøΩ
v 
t
‚Äã
 , which demonstrates stronger causal effects in inducing the model to perform the task in new contexts.

Figure 2 Illustration: The process and findings are visually represented in Figure 2, which includes:
(a) The computation of average activation over a set of antonym ICL prompts.
(b) The intervention where this average activation is added to a zero-shot context, prompting the model to produce antonyms for previously unseen words.
(c) A comparison of systematic effects, showing both the initial intervention's impact (in red) and the stronger effects achieved by employing the function vector (FV) representation (in green).
This section sets the stage for a deeper exploration of FVs in the paper, highlighting the potential of targeted interventions within a model's hidden states to encode and execute specific linguistic tasks, thereby revealing a nuanced understanding of how transformers process and apply learned tasks in varied contexts.

2.3CAUSALMEDIATION TOEXTRACTFUNCTIONVECTORS FROMATTENTIONHEADS 
To distill the information l ow during ICL, we apply causal mediation analysis. 
Given a transformer modelfand an ICL promptpt 
i ‚àà Ptfrom a dataset representing taskt, we 
prompt the model with only input-output pairs(xi,yi). Therefore, the LM must infer the implicit 
relationship between these(x,y)pairs to correctly predict the answer given a novel queryxiq. We 
seek to identify model components with a causal role in the prediction ofyiq. We restrict our analysis 
to the attention heads since those are the components used by transformer LMs to move information 
between different token positions (Vaswani et al., 2017; Elhage et al., 2021). Formally, for each 
attention head a‚Ñìjand task dataset Pt, we take the mean of task-conditioned activations ¬Ø at 
‚Ñìj as 
¬Ø at 
‚Ñìj = 
1 
|Pt| X 
pt i‚ààPt 
a‚Ñìj(pt i). (2) 
We then run the model on an uninformative ICL promptÀú pt 
i ‚àà 
Àú 
Ptwhere eachxis matched with a 
random outputÀú pt 
i = [(xi, Àú yi)]. Now, the model is less likely to generate the correct outputyqas it 
cannot infer the relationship from incorrect ICL examples (notwithstanding the observation from Min 
et al. (2022) that some tasks can be guessed from incorrect labels). While running the model onÀú pt i, 
we replace an attention head activationa‚Ñìjwith mean task-conditioned activation¬Ø at 
‚Ñìj (Eq. 2) and 
measure its causal indirect effect (CIE) towards recovering the correct answer yqas 
CIE(a‚Ñìj| Àú pt i) = f(Àú p 
t i| a‚Ñìj 
:= ¬Ø at ‚Ñìj)[yiq] ‚àí f(Àú p 
t i)[yiq]. (3) 
The intuition here is to measure the degree to which using the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù mean attention head output 
¬Ø at ‚Ñìj‚Äîcomputed over the uncorrupted prompts for taskt‚Äîincreases the mass assigned to the target 
responseyiq, relative to the likelihood of this token under the corrupted promptÀú pt i. A larger value 
implies that the corresponding head is more inf l uential in promoting the correct response. 
Then each attention head‚Äôs average indirect effect (AIE) is calculated by averaging this difference 
across all tasks t ‚àà T and (corrupted) prompts: 
AIE(a‚Ñìj) = 
1

each attention head in GPT-J, and (b) the 
top 10 heads‚Äô weights on individual tokens for one example promptpt i. The most strongly implicated 
heads appear in middle layers. Attention weights are strongest on the output tokens of each exemplar. 
To identify the set of attention heads with the strongest causal effects, we repeat this process for each 
attention heada‚Ñìjinf, for all layers‚Ñì, and all head indicesj. We gather the attention heads with 
highest AIE over all layers as the set A.1 
Figure 3a shows the AIE per attention head in GPT-J over many tasks (see Appendix G for larger 
models). The 10 attention heads with highest AIE (which make upA) 
are highlighted in pink (square 
outlines) and are clustered primarily in early-middle layers of the network. The average attention 
pattern of these heads at the i nal token is shown for two tasks in Figure 3b. These heads primarily 
attend to token positions corresponding to example outputs; this observation is consistent with the 
high salience of ICL label tokens observed by Wang et al. (2023a) and while this resembles the same 
pref i x-matching attention pattern as ‚Äúinduction heads‚Äù (Elhage et al., 2021; Olsson et al., 2022) not 
all heads in A reproduce this pattern on other contexts with repeated tokens (Appendix H). Due to their high causal inf l uence across many tasks (see Appendix G for breakouts by task), we 
hypothesize that this small set of heads is responsible for transporting information identifying the 
demonstrated ICL task. We can represent the contribution ofAas 
a single vector by taking the sum 
of their average outputs, over a task, which we call a function vector (FV) for task t: 
vt= X

We can then test the causal effect of an FV by adding it to hidden states at any layer‚Ñìas the model

 ), where each input is paired with a random output. The model's performance on these corrupted prompts serves as a baseline for assessing the causal impact of replacing an attention head's activation with the mean task-conditioned activation.

Causal Indirect Effect (CIE): The causal indirect effect measures the change in the model's performance (specifically, the likelihood of producing the correct answer) when an attention head's activation is replaced with the mean task-conditioned activation, compared to the baseline performance on the corrupted prompt.

Average Indirect Effect (AIE): AIE is calculated for each attention head by averaging the CIE across all tasks and corrupted prompts. This metric helps identify which attention heads are most influential in guiding the model to the correct response across a range of tasks.

Findings and Implications
Identification of Key Attention Heads: The analysis reveals that a small subset of attention heads, particularly those in the middle layers of the model, have the highest AIE. These heads are deemed most responsible for transporting task-relevant information during ICL.

Function Vectors (FVs): By summing the average outputs of the attention heads with the highest AIE, the researchers construct what they call a function vector (FV) for each task. The FV encapsulates the collective contribution of these key attention heads to task execution.

Testing FVs: The causal effect of an FV is tested by adding it to the hidden states at any layer as the model processes a prompt, then measuring the model's performance on the task. This approach allows for a direct assessment of how well the FV captures and facilitates the model's ability to execute the ICL task.

Conclusion
This methodology underscores the intricate role of attention heads in processing ICL tasks and introduces the concept of FVs as a compact representation of task-specific information flows within transformer models. By identifying and leveraging FVs, this research provides a novel way to understand and enhance the task-specific capabilities of language models.

3.2THEDECODEDVOCABULARY OFFUNCTIONVECTORS 
Several studies have gleaned insights about the states and parameters of transformers by viewing 
them in terms of their decoded vocabulary tokens (Nostalgebraist, 2020; Geva et al., 2021; 2022; 
Dar et al., 2023; Belrose et al., 2023). Therefore we ask: can we understand an FV by decodingvt 
directly to a token probability distribution? Results are shown in Table 5, which lists the top i ve 
tokens in the decoded distribution D(vt) for each task (additional tasks in Appendix I). 
A clear pattern emerges: for most tasks, the decoded tokens lie within the task‚Äôs output space. The 
Singular-Plural function vector decodes to a distribution of plural nouns, and Present-Past decodes 
to past-tense verbs. However, that is not the case for all tasks: English-French decodes to nonsense 
tokens, and the Antonym task decodes to words that evoke the abstract idea of reversal. 
Given these meaningful decodings, we then ask whether the token vocabulary is suff i cient to recreate 
a working function vector. That is, we begin with the token distributionQt= D(vt), and determine 
whether a function vector can be reconstructed if we know the top words inQt. Denote byQtkthe 
distribution that resamplesQtwhile restricting to only the topkwords. We perform an optimization 
to reconstruct aÀÜ vtkthat matches the distributionQtkwhen decoded (where CE is cross-entropy loss): 
ÀÜ vtk= argmin 
v CE(Qtk,D(v))(6) 
In Table 6, the performance ofÀÜ vtkis evaluated when used as a function vector. We i nd that, while it 
is possible to partially recreate the functionality of an FV, good performance typically requires more

not enough on its own to construct a working function vector. That suggests that the FV contains 
some needed information beyond that expressed by its top decoded tokens.

Although Table 6 suggests that function vectors cannot be understood as simple semantic vector 
offsets on word embeddings, we can ask whether function vectors obey semantic vector algebra over 
the more abstract space of functional behavior by testing the composition of simple functions into 
more complex ones. We begin with three conceptually decomposable ICL tasks: the list-oriented 
tasks First-Copy, First-Capital, and Last-Copy, as illustrated in Figure 5a. Using ICL, we collect FVs 
for all three tasks and denote them vAC, vBC, and vAD.

combine a task with First-Copy and Last-Copy to produce a composed Last-‚àóvector; 
then, we test 
the accuracy ofv‚àó BDas a function vector. We compare to the accuracy of the FV extracted from ICL, 
as well as accuracy of the same model performing the task using ICL. Results for GPT-J are reported 
in Table 7; see Appendix K for results for Llama 2 (13 and 70 billion parameter models). We i nd that 
some FVs can be composed, with algebraic compositions outperforming FVs and even ICL on some 
tasks. Other tasks, including some for which ICL and FVs perform well, resist vector composition.

further understanding the mechanisms of LMs.

ChatGPT
The sections on decoding the vocabulary of function vectors (FVs) and vector algebra on FVs explore two innovative aspects of how FVs operate within transformer models. Here's a summary of the key insights and implications from these sections:

Decoded Vocabulary of Function Vectors
Decoding FVs: The researchers attempt to understand FVs by decoding them directly into token probability distributions. This approach yields distributions that for many tasks align with the task's output space. For instance, a function vector for singular-plural tasks decodes to plural nouns, and for present-past tasks, to past-tense verbs.

Limitations of Decoded Vocabulary: However, not all FVs decode meaningfully. For example, the English-French translation task results in nonsense tokens, and the Antonym task decodes to words related to the concept of reversal rather than direct antonyms.

Reconstructing FVs: An experiment was conducted to see if FVs could be reconstructed from their top decoded tokens. While it was possible to partially recreate an FV's functionality, the performance was generally insufficient, indicating that an FV contains crucial information beyond just its top decoded tokens.

Vector Algebra on Function Vectors
Algebraic Composition of FVs: The study explores whether FVs can be algebraically combined to execute new, complex tasks. By performing operations like addition and subtraction on FVs associated with simple tasks, new FVs are generated that are hypothesized to represent more complex tasks.

Experiments and Results: Initial experiments show that some FVs can indeed be composed algebraically, and these composed vectors outperform both individual FVs and in-context learning (ICL) in some cases. This suggests a novel way to construct task-specific vectors without direct training on those tasks.

Implications for Understanding LMs: The ability to algebraically compose tasks implies that FVs may represent underlying mechanisms of language models that are capable of both identifying relevant context and transforming it according to the task. This hints at a deeper, more flexible understanding of how LMs process and execute language tasks.

Conclusions
These sections underscore the sophisticated nature of function vectors within transformer models, revealing that:

FVs encode task-specific information in a way that's not fully captured by simple token distributions.
The functionality encoded by FVs can be manipulated and combined through vector algebra to generate new task-specific functionalities.
These findings open up exciting possibilities for future research into the operational mechanisms of language models, suggesting ways to enhance their flexibility and efficiency in task execution.

4RELATEDWORK 
A cousin to function vectors has been independently observed in concurrent work by Hendel et al. 
(2023); they study causal effects ofht ‚Ñì(similar to Section 2.1) on a different set of models and tasks. 
Task Representations. Our work shows that it is possible to extract FVs with strong causal effects 
from LLMs; this is an advance over previous examinations that have added task representations to 
LLMs, e.g. Lampinen & McClelland (2020); Shao et al. (2023); Mu et al. (2023); Panigrahi et al. 
(2023); Ilharco et al. (2023), who devised ways to create compositional task encodings for LLMs 
using metamappings, codebooks, soft-prompts or sets of model parameter perturbations that Ilharco 
et al. calls task vectors. Unlike these previous works that create function representations, we i nd that 
compact FVs already exist within LLMs and show how to extract them. Likewise Lake & Baroni 
(2018); Hill et al. (2018) show RNN hidden states cluster on similar tasks. Our work differs because 
FVs are causal, not just correlative, so they can be explicitly extracted and inserted. 
In-Context Learning. Since its observation in LLMs by Brown et al. (2020), ICL has been studied 
intensively from many perspectives. The role of ICL prompt forms has been studied by Reynolds & 
McDonell (2021); Min et al. (2022); Yoo et al. (2022). Models of inference-time metalearning that 
could explain ICL have been proposed by Aky¬®urek et al. (2022); Dai et al. (2023); Von Oswald et al. 
(2023); Li et al. (2023b); Garg et al. (2022). Analyses of ICL as Bayesian task inference have been 
performed by Xie et al. (2021); Wang et al. (2023c); Wies et al. (2023); Hahn & Goyal (2023); Zhang 
et al. (2023); Han et al. (2023). And ICL robustness under scaling has been studied by Wei et al. 
(2023); Wang et al. (2023b); Pan et al. (2023). Our work differs from those studies of the externally 
observable behavior of ICL by instead focusing on mechanisms within transformers. 
Mechanisms of task performance in LMs. Our work is related to Merullo et al. (2023); Halawi 
et al. (2023) which analyze components during execution of ICL tasks and identify causes of false 
statements. Also related are several methods that modify activations at inference time to steer LM 
behavior (Li et al., 2023a; Hernandez et al., 2023a; Subramani et al., 2022; Turner et al., 2023; Rimsky 
et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023). Our work is consistent with Wang et al. (2023a) which 
observes salience of label tokens during ICL, Wang et al. (2022b) which observes individual neurons 
that correlate with specif i c task performance, and Variengien & Winsor (2023) shows task requests 
are processed in middle layers. We measure causal mediators across a distribution of different tasks 
to i nd a generic function-invocation mechanism that identif i es and distinguishes between tasks. 
Mechanistic Interpretability. We also build upon the analyses of Elhage et al. (2021) and Olsson 
et al. (2022), who observed prevalent in-context copying behavior related to jumps in performance 
during training. We isolate FVs using causal mediation analysis methods developed in Pearl (2001); 
Vig et al. (2020); Meng et al. (2022); Wang et al. (2022a); Geva et al. (2023). Our examination of 
FVs in vocabulary uses the logit lens of Nostalgebraist (2020); Geva et al. (2021); Dar et al. (2023). 
Analyzing the Attention Mechanism. Our work is related to previous attention-weight analy- 
ses (Voita et al., 2018; Clark et al., 2019; Voita et al., 2019; Kovaleva et al., 2019; Reif et al., 2019; 
Lin et al., 2019; Htut et al., 2019; Kobayashi et al., 2020), that have found attention weights that 
align with linguistic structures. Our work is motivated by the observation that attention weights 
alone do not fully explain model outputs (Jain & Wallace, 2019; Wiegreffe & Pinter, 2019; Bibal 
et al., 2022). The focus of our paper is to extend our understanding of attention by investigating the 
content of the information transported by the attention heads in ICL to open a new window into the 
human-interpretable role that attention plays in language processing.

ChatGPT
The related work section situates the study within a broader context of research on function vectors, task representations, in-context learning (ICL), mechanisms of task performance in language models (LMs), mechanistic interpretability, and analyses of the attention mechanism. Here's a summary of how this work relates to and advances beyond existing literature:

Function Vectors and Task Representations
This study builds upon and extends previous research by identifying and extracting function vectors (FVs) with strong causal effects directly from large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior work that added task representations to LLMs through various methods (e.g., metamappings, codebooks, soft-prompts), this research finds that compact, influential FVs naturally exist within LLMs.
In-Context Learning
ICL has been widely studied since its identification in LLMs. This work differentiates itself by not just examining the externally observable behaviors of ICL but focusing on the internal mechanisms within transformers that facilitate ICL. This approach provides deeper insights into how transformers process and execute ICL tasks.
Mechanisms of Task Performance in LMs
Related to works that analyze components during the execution of ICL tasks and the causes of false statements, this study contributes by examining causal mediators across different tasks to identify a generic mechanism for function invocation within LLMs.
Mechanistic Interpretability
The study leverages causal mediation analysis methods to isolate FVs, building upon analyses that have observed in-context copying behaviors and performance jumps. The use of the logit lens for examining FVs in vocabulary adds to the mechanistic interpretability of how LMs operate.
Analyzing the Attention Mechanism
While previous analyses have explored attention weights and their alignment with linguistic structures, this work goes further by investigating the content transported by attention heads during ICL. This not only challenges the view that attention weights alone fully explain model outputs but also enhances understanding of the role attention plays in language processing.
In essence, this research intersects with and advances a variety of discussions in the field of computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. By focusing on the causal aspects of function vectors within the context of ICL and attention mechanisms, it opens new avenues for understanding and leveraging the internal dynamics of large language models.

5DISCUSSION 
Function vectors are a surprising i nding. The metalearning capabilities of LLMs that have been 
studied since Brown et al. (2020) seem complex enough be inscrutable. Yet in this paper we have 
found a simple mechanism in a range of transformer LLMs that is common across tasks and robust 
to shifts in context: function vectors (FVs) that represent the task within a hidden state. FVs can be 
explicitly extracted from a small i xed set of attention heads that can be easily identif i ed, and these 
FVs represent a range of tasks just as simply as word vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013)‚Äîyet our i ndings 
also reveal FVs must be a distinct phenomenon (Appendix A). Although FVs are not yet a complete 
accounting of how ICL works, they do provide new clarity on one level of mediation within ICL, and 
they open up a new path for future research to fully characterize function execution within LLMs.

ETHICS 
While our work clarifying the mechanisms of function representation and execution within large 
models is intended to help make large language models more transparent and easier to audit, under- 
stand, and control, we caution that such transparency may also enable bad actors to abuse large neural 
language systems, for example by injecting or amplifying functions that cause undesirable behavior.

ChatGPT
The discussion section highlights the significant discovery of function vectors (FVs) within the realm of large language models (LLMs) and their implications for understanding and leveraging the metalearning capabilities of these models. Here's a summary of the key points and ethical considerations:

Discovery and Implications of Function Vectors
Surprising Finding: The identification of function vectors is presented as an unexpected discovery, given the complex and often inscrutable nature of the metalearning capabilities in LLMs.

Simplicity and Commonality: Despite the complexity of LLMs, FVs represent a simple and common mechanism across different tasks and models. They are robust to contextual shifts and can be systematically extracted from a select set of attention heads.

Analogy to Word Vectors: FVs encapsulate tasks within the hidden states of transformers as succinctly as word vectors represent semantic information. This analogy underscores the compact and efficient way FVs encode task-related information.

Distinct Phenomenon: While FVs share some superficial similarities with word vectors, the discussion clarifies that they are indeed a distinct phenomenon, offering unique insights into the internal workings of LLMs.

Contribution to Understanding ICL: The discovery of FVs provides clarity on one aspect of the mediation process in ICL, marking a step forward in unraveling how LLMs generalize and execute tasks based on context.

Ethical Considerations
Enhancing Transparency and Control: The elucidation of function representation and execution mechanisms within LLMs aims to make these models more transparent, understandable, and controllable. This is intended to facilitate better auditing and governance of LLMs, contributing positively to the field of AI.

Potential for Abuse: The paper also raises an ethical caution, noting that increased transparency could inadvertently empower malicious actors. The ability to manipulate or exploit FVs could lead to the injection or amplification of undesirable behaviors in language models.

Conclusion
This discussion underscores the dual nature of advancements in understanding LLMs: on one hand, they hold the promise of making AI systems more interpretable and manageable, fostering innovation and safety in AI development. On the other hand, there's a need for vigilance and responsible use of these insights to prevent misuse. The discovery of function vectors opens new avenues for research while also prompting a careful consideration of the ethical implications of these technological advancements.

So what is the difference between a function vector and a word vector? Is it a sequence or set of word vectors? Or is it a particular set of vectors that represent or point to functions?

ChatGPT
The concept of function vectors (FVs) and word vectors represents two distinct types of representations within language models, each with its own purpose and underlying structure. Here‚Äôs how they differ:

Word Vectors
Definition: Word vectors, also known as word embeddings, are dense numerical representations of words in a high-dimensional space. Each word in the vocabulary is mapped to a vector, with the position and distance between vectors capturing semantic and syntactic similarities between words.
Purpose: The primary purpose of word vectors is to represent words in a way that reflects their meanings and relationships with other words. This representation allows models to process text in a more nuanced and context-aware manner.
Formation: Word vectors are typically generated through unsupervised learning on large text corpora, using models like Word2Vec, GloVe, or the embeddings layer of deep neural networks like LSTMs or transformers.
Function Vectors (FVs)
Definition: Function vectors are representations within a language model that encapsulate the essence of a particular function or task. Unlike word vectors, which represent semantic entities (words), FVs represent higher-level abstractions‚Äîspecifically, input-output relationships or tasks that the model can perform.
Purpose: FVs enable a model to carry out specific tasks or functions in response to inputs. They are discovered within the model's architecture (specifically within attention heads) and can be thought of as capturing the model's "knowledge" or "skills" for a particular task.
Formation: FVs are not learned in isolation but are identified within the internal states (hidden layers) of a trained model, particularly in transformers. They arise as a result of the model's exposure to task-specific examples during training or fine-tuning, especially in the context of in-context learning.
Key Differences
Level of Abstraction: Word vectors represent individual words or concepts, while FVs represent entire tasks or functions that the model can perform.
Composition: Word vectors are singular entities that map directly to words. FVs, however, are derived from a combination of activations across multiple components of the model (e.g., attention heads) and encapsulate a more complex set of operations or transformations.
Usage: Word vectors are used to understand and process individual words or phrases in text. FVs, on the other hand, are utilized to execute specific tasks, like translating text or generating antonyms, within the model.
In summary, while word vectors serve as the foundational building blocks for representing textual data in models, function vectors represent a higher-order concept that encapsulates the model's ability to perform specific tasks. FVs are not merely sequences or sets of word vectors but are unique representations that emerge from the model's internal mechanics, enabling it to apply learned tasks to new contexts.

ABSTRACT 
Much of the knowledge encoded in transformer language models (LMs) may be ex- 
pressed in terms of relations: relations between words and their synonyms, entities 
and their attributes, etc. We show that, for a subset of relations, this computation is 
well-approximated by a single linear transformation on the subject representation. 
Linear relation representations may be obtained by constructing a i rst-order approx- 
imation to the LM from a single prompt, and they exist for a variety of factual, com- 
monsense, and linguistic relations. However, we also identify many cases in which 
LM predictions capture relational knowledge accurately, but this knowledge is not 
linearly encoded in their representations. Our results thus reveal a simple, inter- 
pretable, but heterogeneously deployed knowledge representation strategy in LMs. 
1INTRODUCTION 
How do neural language models (LMs) represent relations between entities? LMs store a wide variety 
of factual information in their weights, including facts about real world entities (e.g., John Adams was 
elected President of the United States in 1796) and common-sense knowledge about the world (e.g., 
doctors work in hospitals). Much of this knowledge can be represented in terms of relations between 
entities, properties, or lexical items. For example, the fact that Miles Davis is a trumpet player can 
be written as a relation (plays the instrument), connecting a subject entity (Miles Davis), with an 
object entity (trumpet). Categorically similar facts can be expressed in the same type of relation, as 
in e.g., (Carol Jantsch, plays the instrument, tuba). Prior studies of LMs (Li et al., 2021; Meng et al., 
2022; Hernandez et al., 2023) have offered evidence that subject tokens act as keys for retrieving 
facts: after an input text mentions a subject, LMs construct enriched representations of subjects that 
encode information about those subjects. Recent studies of interventions (Hase et al., 2023) and 
attention mechanisms (Geva et al., 2023) suggest that the mechanism for retrieval of specif i c facts is 
complex, distributed across multiple layers and attention heads. Past work establishes where relational 
information is located: LMs extract relation and object information from subject representations. But 
these works have not yet described what computation LMs perform while resolving relations. 
In this paper, we show that LMs employ a simple system for representing a portion of their relational 
knowledge: they implicitly implement (an aff i ne version of) a linear relational embedding (LRE) 
scheme(Paccanaro&Hinton,2001). Givenarelationrsuchasplaystheinstrument, alinearrelational 
embedding is an aff i ne functionLRE(s) = Wrs + brthat maps any subject representationsin the 
domain of the relation (e.g., Miles Davis, Carol Jantsch) to the corresponding object representation 
o(e.g., trumpet, tuba). In LMs, the inputs to these implicit LREs are hidden representations of 
subjects at intermediate layers, and their outputs are hidden representations at late layers that can be 
decoded to distributions over next tokens. Thus, a portion of transformer LMs‚Äô (highly non-linear) 
computation can be well-approximated linearly in contexts requiring relation prediction. 
More specif i cally, we i nd that for a variety of relations: (a) transformer LMs decode relational 
knowledge directly from subject entity representations (sin Figure 1); (b) for each such relation, 
the decoding procedure is approximately aff i ne (LRE); and (c) these aff i ne transformations can be 
computed directly from the LM Jacobian on a prompt expressing the relation (i.e.‚àÇo/‚àÇs). However, 
this is not the only system that transformer LMs use to encode relational knowledge, and we also 
identify relations that are reliably predicted in LM outputs, but for which no LRE can be found.

ChatGPT
This paper investigates how transformer language models (LMs) represent and process relational knowledge, such as the connections between entities and their attributes or between words and their synonyms. The authors discover that for a subset of such relations, the underlying computation can be approximated by a single linear transformation applied to the representation of the subject entity. This linear approximation is termed a Linear Relational Embedding (LRE) scheme.

Key points from the abstract include:

Relation Encoding in LMs: Much of the knowledge stored in LMs involves relations between entities, attributes, and lexical items. This includes factual, commonsense, and linguistic relations.

Linear Relation Representations: The study shows that a portion of this relational knowledge in LMs can be approximated using a linear transformation, specifically through an affine function that maps subject representations to object representations.

Construction of Linear Representations: These linear representations, or LREs, are constructed from the LM's Jacobian matrix derived from a single prompt expressing the relation. The LRE effectively maps any subject within the domain of a particular relation to its corresponding object.

Heterogeneous Knowledge Representation: Despite the presence of LREs for various relations, the study also finds instances where LMs accurately capture relational knowledge without it being linearly encoded. This suggests that LMs employ multiple, heterogeneous strategies for representing and processing relational knowledge.

Research Implications: These findings highlight a simple yet variably deployed strategy within LMs for representing relational knowledge. The identification of LREs offers a more interpretable perspective on how LMs handle specific types of relational information. However, the discovery of relations that do not fit this linear model underscores the complexity of knowledge representation in LMs and suggests areas for further research.

In essence, this research contributes to the understanding of how transformer LMs store and retrieve relational information, revealing both the capabilities and limitations of linear approximations in representing the vast and complex knowledge embedded within these models.

Figure 1:Within a transformer language model, (a) how it resolves many relationsr, such as plays the 
instrument, can be well-approximated by (b) a linear functionRthat maps subject representationssto object 
representations o that can be directly decoded. 
In GPT and LLaMA models, we search for LREs encoding 47 different relations, covering more than 
10k facts relating famous entities (The Space Needle, is located in, Seattle), commonsense knowledge 
(banana, has color, yellow), and implicit biases (doctor, has gender, man). In48%of the relations 
we tested, we i nd robust LREs that faithfully recover subject‚Äìobject mappings for a majority of the 
subjects. Furthermore, we i nd that LREs can be used to edit subject representations (Hernandez 
et al., 2023) to control LM output. 
Finally, we use our dataset and LRE-estimating method to build a visualization tool we call an 
attribute lens. Instead of showing the next token distribution like Logit Lens (nostalgebraist, 2020) 
the attribute lens shows the object-token distribution at each layer for a given relation. This lets us 
visualize where and when the LM i nishes retrieving knowledge about a specif i c relation, and can 
reveal the presence of knowledge about attributes even when that knowledge does not reach the output. 
Our results highlight two important facts about transformer LMs. First, some of their implicit knowl- 
edge is representated in a simple, interpretable, and structured format. Second, this representation 
system is not universally deployed, and superf i cially similar facts may be encoded and extracted in 
very different ways. 
2BACKGROUND: RELATIONS ANDTHEIRREPRESENTATIONS 
2.1REPRESENTATIONS OF KNOWLEDGE IN LANGUAGE MODELS 
For LMs to generate factually correct statements, factual information must be represented somewhere 
in their weights. In transformer LMs, past work has suggested that most factual information is 
encoded in the multi-layer perceptron layers (Geva et al., 2020). These layers act as key‚Äìvalue 
stores, and work together across multiple layers to enrich the representation of an entity with relevant 
knowledge (Geva et al., 2022). For instance, in the example from Figure 1, the representationsof 
Miles Davis goes through an enrichment process where LM populatesswith the fact that he plays 
the trumpet as well as other facts, like him being born in Alton, IL. By the halfway point of the LM‚Äôs 
computation,scontains all the information needed to predict a fact about the subject entity when the 
LM is prompted to retrieve it. 
Oncesis populated with relevant facts, the LM must decode the fact most relevant to its current 
prediction task. Formally, a language model is a distributionpLM(x)over stringsx, so this information 
must be retrieved when the LM is prompted to decode a specif i c fact, such as when it estimatespLM(¬∑ | 
Miles Davis plays the). Internally, the object must be decoded and written into the i nal representation 
obefore the next word (trumpet) is predicted. Techniques like the logit lens (nostalgebraist, 2020) 
and linear shortcut approaches (Belrose et al., 2023; Din et al., 2023) reveal that the LM‚Äôs i nal 
prediction can be read off ofowell before the i nal layer, and recent work (Geva et al., 2023) suggests 
that this occurs because specif i c attention heads (before the i nal layer) specialize in reading specif i c 
relations. Meanwhile, prior work studying the structure of s suggests that even though transformers 
are complex, non-linear neural networks, attributes of entities can be linearly decoded from their 
representations (Li et al., 2021; Hernandez et al., 2023). 
But how transformer LMs themselves map from enriched entity representations to language-based 
predictions has remained an open question. Here, we will show that for a subset of relations the 
transformer LMs implement the learned readout operation in a near-linear fashion.

This section delves into the core findings and methodologies employed to understand how transformer language models (LMs) encode and process relational knowledge, specifically focusing on Linear Relational Embeddings (LREs). Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

Understanding Relational Knowledge in LMs
Relational Knowledge: The paper examines how transformer LMs represent various types of relational knowledge, including facts about entities (e.g., "The Space Needle is located in Seattle"), commonsense knowledge (e.g., "banana has color yellow"), and implicit biases (e.g., "doctor has gender man").
Linear Relation Representations: It finds that a significant portion of these relations can be approximated by linear functions (LREs) that map subject representations to object representations, which can then be directly decoded to output specific facts or attributes.
Identifying Linear Relational Embeddings (LREs)
Scope and Scale: The study covers 47 different relations, encompassing over 10,000 facts. It explores these relations across GPT and LLaMA models.
Success Rate: In 48% of the tested relations, robust LREs were identified that accurately recover subject-object mappings for a majority of the subjects. This suggests that a substantial part of relational knowledge in LMs can be linearly approximated.
Applications and Implications of LREs
Editing Subject Representations: The discovery of LREs enables the editing of subject representations to control LM outputs, highlighting a practical application of LREs in steering the behavior of LMs.
Attribute Lens: The researchers developed a visualization tool, termed "attribute lens," which allows visualization of the object-token distribution at each layer for a given relation. This tool provides insights into how and when the LM retrieves knowledge about specific relations, revealing the presence of attribute knowledge even when it does not influence the final output.
Key Findings on Transformer LMs
Simplicity and Interpretability: Some of the implicit knowledge within transformer LMs is represented in a simple, structured, and interpretable format, contrary to the often complex and opaque nature of these models.
Non-Uniform Deployment: The linear representation system for relational knowledge is not uniformly used across all types of relations. Similar facts may be encoded and decoded in markedly different ways, indicating a heterogeneous approach to knowledge representation within LMs.
Background on Knowledge Representation
Encoding of Factual Information: Past work has suggested factual information is primarily encoded in the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers of transformer LMs. These layers function as key-value stores that enrich entity representations with relevant facts.
Decoding Process: Once enriched with facts, the LM decodes the most relevant fact for its current prediction task. The object representation is then utilized for predicting the next word, with certain attention heads specializing in reading specific relations.
Contribution to Understanding LMs
This work sheds light on a near-linear fashion in which transformer LMs map enriched entity representations to language-based predictions for a subset of relations. This finding opens up new avenues for understanding the underlying mechanisms through which LMs encode and retrieve relational knowledge, marking a significant step towards demystifying the operational intricacies of these powerful computational models.

2.2NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS OF RELATIONS 
Why might we expect a linear representation scheme for relational information in the i rst place? 
Separate from (and largely prior to) work on neural language models, a long line of artif i cial 
intelligence research has studied how to represent relational knowledge. A classic symbolic approach 
is to encode relational knowledge triplets of the form (subject, relation, object). For example, one 
might express the fact that Rome is the capital of Italy as (Rome, is-capital-of, Italy). This triplet 
format is extremely l exible, and has been used for a variety of tasks (Richens, 1956; Minsky, 1974; 
Lenat, 1995; Miller, 1995; Berners-Lee et al., 2001; Bollacker et al., 2008). 
While representing relational triplets symbolically is straightforward, it is far less clear how to embed 
these relational structures in deep networks or other connectionist systems. Surveys (Ji et al., 2021; 
Wang et al., 2017) list more than 40 techniques. These variations ref l ect the tension between the 
constraints of geometry and the l exibility of the triplet representation. In many approaches, subject 
and object entitiessandoare represented as vectorss ‚àà Rm,o ‚àà Rn; 
for a given relationr, we 
def i ne a relation functionR : Rm‚Üí Rn, 
with the property that when(s,r,o)holds, we have 
o ‚âà R(s). 
One way to implementRis to use linear transformations to represent relations. For instance, in linear 
relational embedding (Paccanaro & Hinton, 2001), the relation function has the formR(s) = Wrs 
whereWris a matrix depending on relationr. A modern example of this encoding can be seen in the 
positional encodings of many transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). More generally, we can writeR 
as an aff i ne transformation, learning both a linear operatorWrand a translationbr(Lin et al., 2015; 
Yang et al., 2021). There are multiple variations on this idea, but the basic relation function is: 
R(s) = Wrs + br.(1)

ChatGPT
The discussion on neural representations of relations delves into why a linear representation scheme might be expected for encoding relational knowledge within neural language models (NLMs) and other connectionist systems. This interest stems from a longstanding inquiry in artificial intelligence about how to represent and process relational knowledge. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts presented:

Background on Relational Knowledge Representation
Symbolic Representation: Historically, relational knowledge has been represented using symbolic approaches, typically in the form of triplets (subject, relation, object). This format has been versatile across various tasks, allowing straightforward expression of relationships like "Rome is the capital of Italy."
Challenges with Deep Networks: Translating the symbolic triplet representation into a format that can be embedded within deep neural networks presents challenges. This difficulty arises from the need to reconcile the geometric constraints inherent to neural representations with the flexibility offered by symbolic triplet representations.
Linear Representations in Neural Networks
Vector Representations: In neural approaches, entities (subjects and objects) are represented as vectors within high-dimensional spaces. A relation function 
ÔøΩ
R maps from the subject vector space to the object vector space, approximating the relationship between the subject and object entities.
Linear Transformation: One common method to implement 
ÔøΩ
R is through linear transformations, where each relation 
ÔøΩ
r is associated with a specific transformation matrix 
ÔøΩ
ÔøΩ
W 
r
‚Äã

=
ÔøΩ
ÔøΩ
ÔøΩ
R(s)=W 
r
‚Äã

Affine Transformation: Expanding on the linear model, relations can also be represented as affine transformations, which include both a linear mapping

W 
r
‚Äã
  and a translation vector 
ÔøΩ
ÔøΩ

 . This model provides a more general framework for representing relational transformations.
Significance and Applications
Translational Encodings in Transformers: The concept of using linear or affine transformations to encode relations finds modern application in the positional encodings of transformers. These encodings allow transformers to capture the relative positions of words or entities within sequences, facilitating the understanding of relational structures.
Generalizability: The linear or affine models for relational knowledge representation offer a structured, interpretable method for embedding relational information within neural networks. This approach underscores the potential for neural models to internalize and process relational knowledge in a manner that mirrors some aspects of symbolic reasoning.
In essence, the exploration of linear representation schemes for relational knowledge in neural systems builds upon foundational ideas from artificial intelligence, adapting them to the context of deep learning and neural language models. By implementing relations through linear or affine transformations, neural networks can approximate the functionality of symbolic triplet representations, enabling sophisticated processing of relational knowledge within a connectionist framework.

3FINDING ANDVALIDATINGLINEARRELATIONALEMBEDDINGS 
3.1FINDINGLRES 
Consider a statement such as Miles Davis plays the trumpet, which expresses a fact(s,r,o)connecting 
a subjectsto an objectovia relationr(see Figure 1). Within the transformer‚Äôs hidden states, lets 
denote the representation5of the subjects(Miles Davis) at layer‚Ñì, and letodenote the last-layer 
hidden state that is directly decoded to get the prediction of the object‚Äôs i rst tokeno(trumpet). The 
transformer implements a calculation that obtainsofromswithin a textual contextcthat evokes the 
relation r, which we can write o = F(s,c). 
Our main hypothesis is thatF(s,c)can be well-approximated by a linear projection, which can be 
obtained from a local derivative ofF. Denote the Jacobian ofFasW =‚àÇF/‚àÇs. Then a i rst-order 
Taylor approximation of F about s0is given by: 
F(s,c) ‚âà F(s0,c) + W (s ‚àí s0) 
= Ws + b,(2) 
where b = F(s0,c) ‚àí Ws0 
This approximation would only be reasonable ifFhas near-linear behavior when decoding the 
relation from anys. In practice, we estimateWandbas the mean Jacobian and bias atnexamples 
si,ciwithin the same relation, which gives an unbiased estimate under the assumption that noise in 
F has zero value and zero Jacobian in expectation (see Appendix B). That is, we def i ne:

changes in scale of outputs. That means that even if Equation 2 is a good estimate of the direction of 
change of F, it may not be an accurate estimate of the magnitude of change. 
In practice, we i nd that the magnitude of change inF(s,c)is underestimated in our calculated 
W(see Appendix C for empirical measurements). To remedy this underestimation we makeW 
in Equation (2) steeper by multiplying with a scalar constantŒ≤ (> 1). So, for a relationrwe

This section outlines the methodology for finding and validating Linear Relational Embeddings (LREs) within transformer language models, focusing on how these models encode relational knowledge between subjects, relations, and objects. Here's an overview:

Finding LREs
Contextual Embeddings: The process starts by considering a factual statement (e.g., "Miles Davis plays the trumpet") that links a subject 
ÔøΩ
s (Miles Davis) to an object 
ÔøΩ
o (trumpet) through a relation 
ÔøΩ
r. The goal is to understand how the transformer model processes this information to predict 
ÔøΩ
o from 
ÔøΩ
s within a given textual context 
ÔøΩ
c that evokes relation 
ÔøΩ
r.

Linear Projection Hypothesis: The key hypothesis is that the transformation from 
ÔøΩ
s to 
ÔøΩ
o, denoted 
ÔøΩ
(
ÔøΩ
,
ÔøΩ
)
F(s,c), can be approximated by a linear projection. This approximation is based on the local derivative of 
ÔøΩ
F, represented by the Jacobian 
ÔøΩ
=

ÔøΩ

ÔøΩ
F around a point 
ÔøΩ

‚Äã
 .

Estimating the Linear Model: The linear model is estimated by calculating the mean Jacobian 
ÔøΩ
W and bias 
ÔøΩ
b across multiple examples of the same relation, providing an unbiased estimate under certain assumptions. This method captures the average way in which the transformer model linearly projects subjects to objects for a given relation.

Limitations and Adjustments
Layer Normalization: A challenge arises from the transformer's use of layer normalization, which affects the scale of inputs and outputs. This means that while the direction of change in 
ÔøΩ
F can be estimated, the magnitude of change might not be accurately captured.

Adjusting Magnitude Estimates: To address the underestimation of the magnitude of change by 
ÔøΩ
W, the authors propose adjusting the estimated linear model by multiplying 
ÔøΩ
W with a scalar constant 
ÔøΩ
>

Œ≤>1, making the model's prediction more accurate in terms of magnitude. This results in an affine transformation

Conclusion
This methodology presents a structured approach to uncovering and validating the existence of LREs within transformer models, suggesting that a significant portion of relational knowledge processing can be approximated linearly. The insights gained from this analysis contribute to our understanding of how deep learning models encode and retrieve relational information, offering a more interpretable framework for analyzing complex neural networks. However, the adjustments made to account for layer normalization highlight the complexities involved in modeling the behavior of transformers accurately.

3.2EVALUATINGLRES 
When a linear relation operatorLREis a good approximation of the transformer‚Äôs decoding algorithm, 
it should satisfy two properties: 
Faithfulness.When applied to new subjectss, the output ofLRE(s)should make the same 
predictions as the transformer. Given the LM‚Äôs decoder headD, we def i ne the transformer prediction 
o and LRE prediction ÀÜ o as: 
o = argmax 
t 
D(F(s,c))tand ÀÜ o = argmax 
t 
D(LRE(s))t 
And we def i ne faithfulness as the success rate ofo 
? 
= ÀÜ o, i.e., the frequency with which predictions 
made by LRE from only s match next-token predictions made by the full transformer: 
argmax 
t D(F(s,c))t 
? 
= argmax 
t D(LRE(s))t(5) 
Causality.If a learnedLREis a good description of the LM‚Äôs decoding procedure, it should be 
able to model causal inf l uence of the relational embedding on the LM‚Äôs predictions. If it does, then 
invertingLREtells us how to perturbsso that the LM decodes a different objecto‚Ä≤. Formally, given 
a new object o‚Ä≤, we use LRE to i nd an edit direction ‚àÜs that satisf i es: 
LRE(s + ‚àÜs) = o‚Ä≤(6) 
With Œ≤ = 1, we can edit s as follows:6 
Àú s = s + ‚àÜs, where ‚àÜs = W‚àí1 
r (o‚Ä≤‚àí o)(7) 
We obtaino‚Ä≤from a different subjects‚Ä≤that is mapped byFtoo‚Ä≤under the relationr.Àú shere is 
essentially an approximation of s‚Ä≤. Figure 2 illustrates this procedure.

would be an approximation of s‚Ä≤and patching Àú s in place of s should change the prediction to o‚Ä≤= guitar (f). 
Note that Equation (7) requires invertingWr, but the inverted matrix might be ill-conditioned. To 
make edits more effective, we instead use a low-rank pseudoinverseW‚Ä† 
r, which prevents the smaller 
singular values from washing out the contributions of the larger, more meaningful singular values.

This section elaborates on how Linear Relational Embeddings (LREs) are evaluated within transformer language models to determine their accuracy and effectiveness in replicating the model's decision-making process. Two key properties, faithfulness and causality, are used to assess the quality of LREs:

Faithfulness
Definition: Faithfulness measures how well the predictions made by the LRE align with those made by the full transformer model. It is defined as the success rate at which the LRE's predictions match the transformer's next-token predictions for new subjects 
ÔøΩ
s.
Evaluation: To evaluate faithfulness, the output 
ÔøΩ
o of the transformer and the output 
ÔøΩ
^
o
^
  of the LRE are compared. If the argmax token 
ÔøΩ
t from both outputs match, the LRE is considered faithful.
Causality
Definition: Causality assesses whether the LRE can model the causal influence of the relational embedding on the LM‚Äôs predictions. A good LRE should allow for the modification of the subject 
ÔøΩ
s such that the LM decodes a different, specified object 
ÔøΩ
‚Ä≤
o 
‚Ä≤
 .
Editing Procedure: This involves finding an edit direction 
Œî
ÔøΩ
Œîs that, when applied to 
ÔøΩ
s, leads the LM to predict a new object 
ÔøΩ
‚Ä≤
o 
‚Ä≤
 . The process uses the LRE to calculate 
Œî
ÔøΩ
Œîs and applies it to 
ÔøΩ
s to approximate a different subject 
ÔøΩ
‚Ä≤
s 
‚Ä≤
  that would naturally lead to 
ÔøΩ
‚Ä≤
o 
‚Ä≤
  under the given relation 
ÔøΩ
r.
Illustration and Methodology
Example: The paper illustrates this with the relation "plays the instrument", showing how to change the prediction from "trumpet" (associated with Miles Davis) to "guitar" (associated with Cat Stevens) by applying 
Œî
ÔøΩ
Œîs to the subject representation.
Pseudoinverse Adjustment: Due to potential issues with inverting 
ÔøΩ
ÔøΩ
W 
r
‚Äã
 , such as ill-conditioned matrices, a low-rank pseudoinverse 
ÔøΩ
ÔøΩ
‚Ä†
W 
r
‚Ä†
‚Äã
  is used instead. This adjustment helps to focus on the most significant singular values, making the edits more effective.
Evaluation of Intervention Success
The intervention is considered successful if 
ÔøΩ
‚Ä≤
o 
‚Ä≤
  becomes the top prediction of the LM after applying the edit 
Œî
ÔøΩ
Œîs to the subject representation 
ÔøΩ
s.
Success is determined based on the first token of the object, acknowledging that this approach may have limitations in capturing the full scope of relational knowledge encoded by the LM.
Conclusion
Evaluating LREs through faithfulness and causality provides insight into how well these linear approximations capture the transformer model's method of processing relational information. By demonstrating that certain relational knowledge can be effectively manipulated through LREs, this methodology underscores the potential for interpretable and controllable models in understanding and directing the output of complex language models.

Representation probes.The structure of the information represented within a neural network is a 
foundational problem that has been studied from several perspectives. One approach is to identify 
properties encoded representations by training a probing classif i er to predict properties from the 
representations (Ettinger et al., 2016; Shi et al., 2016; Hupkes et al., 2018; Conneau et al., 2018; 
Belinkov et al., 2017; Belinkov & Glass, 2019). However, such approaches can overestimate the 
knowledge contained in a network if the classif i er learns to solve a task on its own (Belinkov, 2022); 
the problem can be mitigated by comparing to a control task (Hewitt & Liang, 2019) or by limiting 
the training of the probe (Voita & Titov, 2020). Our method differs from probing by avoiding the 
introduction of a training process entirely: we extract the LRE from the LM itself rather than training 
a new model. 
Knowledge representation.Ever since emergent neural representations of relations were i rst 
observed in the original backpropagation paper (Rumelhart et al., 1986), neural representations of 
knowledge and relations have been a central problem in artif i cial intelligence. Section 2 surveys 
work in this area including knowledge graph embedding (Wang et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2021) and 
emergent knowledge representations within a transformer language model (Li et al., 2021; Meng 
et al., 2022; Hase et al., 2023; Hernandez et al., 2023; Geva et al., 2023). This paper builds on past 
work in by showing that relational aspects of this knowledge are encoded linearly. 
Knowledge extraction.The most direct way to characterize knowledge in LMs is to prompt or 
query them directly (Petroni et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2020; Shin et al., 2020; 
Cohen et al., 2023). However, recent work has suggested that model knowledge and knowledge 
retrieval may be localized within small parts of a language model (Geva et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2021; 
Meng et al., 2022; Geva et al., 2023). In this paper we further investigate the localized retrieval of 
knowledge and ask whether knowledge about relations and objects can be separated, and whether 
relations are represented as a linear relational embedding. 
7CONCLUSION 
Reverse-engineering the full mechanism of an LLM is a daunting task. In this work, we have found 
that a certain kind of computation, relation decoding, can often be well-approximated by linear 
relational embeddings. We have also found that some relations are better-approximated as LREs than 
others; relations that have an easier or harder random baseline fall on either end of the spectrum. We 
have shown thatLREs estimated from a small set of examples lead to faithful representations that are 
causally linked to the LM‚Äôs behavior. Furthermore,LREcan be used to provide specialized attribute 
lens on the LM‚Äôs intermediate computation, even revealing cases of LM falsehoods.

ETHICSSTATEMENT 
By revealing and decoding internal model relations before they are explicitly expressed in model 
output,LREs can potentially be used to provide information about internal biases or errors, and the 
causal effects could provide a way to mitigate undesired biases. However, such representation-level 
representation might be only superf i cial without correcting internal biases in the model; exploring 
such applications is a natural step for future work.

ChatGPT
The paper presents an innovative approach to understanding and visualizing the knowledge encoded in transformer language models (LMs) through Linear Relational Embeddings (LREs). Here's a summary of the main points and contributions:

Main Contributions
Attribute Lens Visualization: The paper introduces the attribute lens, a tool that visualizes the hidden states of LMs like GPT-J when processing specific subjects under different relations. This visualization reveals how the model predicts attributes associated with a subject, enhancing our understanding of how LMs internally represent relational knowledge.

Evaluating LREs: LREs are validated based on their faithfulness to the original model predictions and their ability to causally influence the LM's outputs. The methodology demonstrates that LREs can approximate the LM's computation for relation decoding, making predictions that align with those of the full model and allowing for targeted edits to subject representations to change predicted attributes.

Related Work
Representation Probes: The study distinguishes itself from traditional probing methods by extracting LREs directly from the LM without training a new model. This approach addresses the limitations of probing classifiers, which may not accurately reflect the knowledge contained in the network.

Knowledge Representation: Building on a rich history of research into neural representations of knowledge and relations, this work contributes by showing that LREs can linearly encode relational aspects of knowledge within LMs.

Knowledge Extraction: Unlike methods that directly query LMs to characterize their knowledge, this paper explores localized retrieval and linear representation of relational knowledge, offering new insights into how LMs encode and retrieve relational information.

Conclusion
The paper underscores the complexity of reverse-engineering LMs but demonstrates that relation decoding within these models can often be effectively approximated through LREs. These findings suggest a new pathway for interpreting and manipulating the knowledge encoded in LMs.
Ethics Statement
The paper highlights the potential ethical implications of LREs, suggesting they could be used to identify and mitigate internal biases or errors in LMs. However, it also cautions that addressing superficial representations without tackling underlying biases might not lead to substantial improvements. This area represents an important direction for future research, aiming to enhance the transparency and accountability of AI systems.
In essence, this work provides valuable insights into the internal workings of transformer LMs, offering tools and methodologies that could lead to more interpretable and controllable models, with significant implications for addressing ethical concerns in AI.

Connections between the two articles

ChatGPT
The two discussed articles, although distinct in their specific focus and methodologies, both contribute to the broader understanding of how large language models (LLMs) represent and process information. Here are several connections and complementary insights they offer in the realm of computational linguistics and AI research:

Understanding of Internal Representations
Function Vectors (FVs): The first article introduces the concept of function vectors within LLMs that encapsulate the essence of a particular function or task, demonstrating how LLMs abstract complex relationships into compact, internal representations.
Linear Relational Embeddings (LREs): The second article explores Linear Relational Embeddings as a means to approximate the LLM‚Äôs handling of relational knowledge, indicating that some aspects of model computation, especially regarding relations, can be linearized.
Representation and Processing of Relational Knowledge
Both articles delve into how LLMs encode and utilize relational information, albeit from different angles. FVs are highlighted as a mechanism for executing specific tasks, while LREs focus on encoding specific types of relational knowledge (e.g., factual, commonsense relationships) linearly.
Methodological Innovation for Interpretability
Attribute Lens: The introduction of the attribute lens in the second article as a visualization tool for understanding how LLMs predict attributes under different relations complements the broader pursuit in the first article of making the mechanisms of LLMs more interpretable.
Direct Extraction vs. Probing/Querying: Each article proposes methods that bypass traditional probing or querying techniques. The first article discusses directly extracting FVs without additional training, while the second emphasizes the estimation of LREs from the model's own computations, aiming for an interpretation of model behavior without altering or training new models.
Ethical Considerations and Model Bias
Both articles touch upon the ethical implications of their findings, suggesting that a deeper understanding of how LLMs represent and process information could lead to better tools for identifying and mitigating biases within these models. The second article specifically mentions the potential of LREs in revealing internal biases or errors before they manifest in outputs.

Integrating augmented reality (AR) as the initial phase of embedding interactive and holographic information within architectural structures is a visionary step towards creating more intuitive and informative spaces. The evolution of this concept into incorporating physical proxies, graphical embeds within building materials, and dedicated areas for cutaway structures to reveal operations, projectors, and printers further expands the scope and impact of this approach. Here‚Äôs how this phased integration could unfold and enrich architectural experiences:

Phase 1: Augmented Reality Integration
Foundation: Use AR technology to overlay digital information‚Äîsuch as blueprints, operational guides, and historical data‚Äîdirectly onto the physical environment. This can be accessed through smartphones, tablets, or AR glasses.
User Engagement: Allow users to interact with their surroundings in a deeply personalized way, adjusting settings, learning about architectural features, and accessing maintenance guides through intuitive AR interfaces.
Phase 2: Physical Proxies and Graphical Embeds
Material Integration: Develop building materials that incorporate micro-graphics or color-changing elements, which can act as physical proxies for information layers. These could be activated or illuminated under specific lighting conditions or through AR-enabled devices to reveal additional details or instructions.
Interactive Surfaces: Embed touch-sensitive surfaces or materials in the architecture that can change appearance or display information when interacted with, providing a more tactile engagement with the building's informational layer.
Phase 3: Cutaway Structures and Embedded Technology
Visible Operations: Designate areas within the building where the internal structure and operations are intentionally made visible, using cutaways or transparent materials. This can include viewing areas for mechanical rooms, plumbing, or structural supports.
Embedded Projectors and Printers: Install projectors and printers within the architecture that can dynamically display information on surfaces or produce physical documents with details about the building, maintenance procedures, or updates. This system could be triggered automatically by sensors or on-demand by occupants.
Potential Applications and Benefits
Enhanced Learning and Accessibility: Making architectural and operational information readily accessible supports educational purposes and ensures that all users, regardless of technical expertise, can understand and interact with their environment effectively.
Innovative Maintenance and Upgrades: Streamlining the process for maintenance and upgrades through easily accessible instructions and embedded printing technology can reduce costs and downtime, ensuring that buildings remain functional and up-to-date.
Dynamic Spaces: The ability to change the information displayed or embedded within the building materials allows spaces to adapt over time, reflecting updates, changes in use, or evolving historical contexts.
Sustainability: Integrating technology to make operational systems visible encourages transparency and accountability in sustainable building practices, enabling occupants to understand and contribute to energy-saving measures actively.
This multi-phase approach to embedding augmented reality, physical proxies, and dynamic informational systems within buildings not only redefines the interaction between people and their built environment but also opens up new avenues for architectural design, maintenance, education, and sustainability. As technology advances, the potential for creating spaces that are informative, interactive, and adaptive to their occupants' needs and preferences becomes increasingly achievable.
