I can only eat margarine, it's all I can do
Cause I don't like butter or butter substitute
I can only eat margarine
Surrounded by some biscuits
Or on a piece of bread
Or on top of a cheese hit
It's an artificial spread
Oh I can't live without it
I eat it on all of my grumb
And sometimes I just take a spoon
And it is right out of the plastic cup
I can only eat margarine
Yeah
I can only eat margarine
