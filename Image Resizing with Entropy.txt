Abstract 
One of the most popular techniques in the field of image retargeting or content-aware 
resizing a digital image is the seam-carving technique. The performance of image resizing 
algorithms based on seam-carving indicates that these algorithms are highly dependent on 
the extraction of importance map techniques. So far, various algorithms have been proposed 
to extract the importance map. In this paper, a new method based on information entropy 
is proposed to extract of importance map. Also, a new method for selecting the most opti- 
mal seam based on the calculation of the Lyapunov exponents is presented. In simulating 
the proposed method, two datasets MSRA and RetargetMe have been used, which use two 
statistical opinions criteria and aspect ratio similarity (ARS) to evaluate the performance 
of the proposed method. Simulation results based on dynamical systems analysis showed 
that the proposed algorithm performs better than the classical seam-carving and generalized 
seam-carving algorithms.

1 Introduction 
Images are one of the most important types of digital media. Nowadays, due to the wide 
variety of software for displaying an image on the media such as handsets, computers, 
and tablets, the problem of displaying images with different dimensions and resolutions on 
different display devices is one of the interesting research fields [1, 21, 26]. 
There are different methods for image resizing such as scaling and cropping. The crop- 
ping method is used to remove the outer parts of the digital image. It cuts a part of the 
image unintentionally to the size of the final image and discards the rest of the image. In 
this method, the removed parts may contain important information that is discarded. Unlike 
the cropping method, the scaling operator does not remove any part of the image but rather 
rescales the image uniformly to achieve the desired dimensions. One of the disadvantages 
of the scaling method is neglecting the content of the image as the whole image becomes

ods, content-aware resizing methods have been proposed. One of the most popular method 
in this field is seam carving (SC) technique [1, 44]. The SC method selects and deletes a 
left-to-right or top-down line of interconnected pixels with the lowest energy. By deleting or 
sequentially inserting the seams, the image size is reduced or increased. The selected seams 
ensure that the image structure is preserved and the low-energy pixels are eliminated and

This research paper presents a novel method for image resizing based on the seam-carving technique. The researchers propose a new approach for extracting the importance map of an image using information entropy. In addition, they introduce a method for selecting the optimal seam for resizing based on the calculation of the Lyapunov exponents.
Seam-carving is a popular technique in content-aware image resizing, where the image size is manipulated by deleting or inserting lines of interconnected pixels, called seams, with the least energy. The chosen seams help preserve the image structure while eliminating low-energy pixels, thus achieving a balance between the original and resized image.
The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using two datasets, MSRA and RetargetMe, and it's evaluated based on statistical opinions criteria and aspect ratio similarity (ARS). Simulation results indicate that the proposed method outperforms both classical and generalized seam-carving algorithms.
In the larger context, this work aims to improve image display across diverse media types and sizes, addressing a common problem in the digital media landscape. The technique could improve upon traditional methods of image resizing, like cropping and scaling, which often lose important image content or fail to maintain the relative importance of different image features.

Chaotic dynamical systems have potential applications in image processing and sig- 
nal processing. Over the last two decades dynamical systems tools have a central role for 
qualitative analysis of the digital images. In the field of image processing, based on informa- 
tion entropy, various tasks including pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) [8], image 
encryption [2, 64], image and video watermarking [3, 16], digital steganography[55], image 
compression, and medical image segmentation have been done and acceptable results have 
been obtained [17, 56]. In this paper, information entropy is used to identify low impor- 
tance areas in the image. Given the importance of this discussion, we try to introduce a new 
importance map that can identify the low importance areas in the image using entropy and 
perform better than the classical seam carving methods.

In this section, we will try to explore the seam carving related techniques in more detail. 
Essentially, image resizing based on content-aware techniques are divided into three cate- 
gories: (1) cropping techniques, (2) wrapping techniques, and (3) seam carving techniques. 
The details of each of these methods are described in the next subsections. 
2.1 Content-awarecropping 
In these techniques, the image���s important content is first identified and then the cropping 
is applied to the original image. The basis for identifying important regions is to obtain a 
salient map in the images [28, 49]. In the mentioned methods, also face detection technique 
is proposed to improve the quality of the proposed method. In method [11], the image 
attention model is used to extract semantic information of the image such as face and text 
[49]. Also in method [65], particle swarm optimization is used as an optimization algorithm 
for auto-cropping of image. 
A semi-automatic identification algorithm based on the attention region is presented 
using human gaze estimation in method [48]. The proposed method in [34] has used the sup- 
port vector machine as a machine learning algorithm for the identification process of salient 
distribution. A quality classifier for identifying acceptable regions is presented in method 
[41], and in method [38], a technique for searching a cropping window is used to obtain a 
19418Multimedia Tools and Applications (2023) 82:19417���19440 
region of the image with the highest salient density. The major disadvantage of cropping- 
based techniques is the existence of several important regions in the image, which can only 
identify one important region and discard the rest of the image regions.

The paper discusses the role of chaotic dynamical systems in image and signal processing, emphasizing their potential for the qualitative analysis of digital images. Over the past two decades, techniques based on information entropy have been successfully used for tasks such as pseudo-random number generation, image encryption, watermarking, digital steganography, image compression, and medical image segmentation.
In this paper, the authors utilize information entropy to identify areas of low importance in an image, striving to introduce a new importance map that can better discern these areas than classical seam carving methods.
The paper is structured into several sections, beginning with an exploration of techniques related to content-aware image resizing. It then delves into dynamical systems, entropy analysis, and Lyapunov exponent. The paper presents the proposed image resizing algorithm, followed by a performance evaluation and comparison with similar algorithms. The final section concludes the paper.
The authors also discuss various image resizing methods such as cropping, wrapping, and seam carving techniques. Content-aware cropping is one such technique, where important image content is first identified using a salient map, and then cropping is applied. Some methods enhance the process using face detection techniques, semantic information extraction, particle swarm optimization for auto-cropping, or human gaze estimation for semi-automatic identification. However, the limitation of cropping-based techniques is that they can only identify one important region and discard the rest, which might also hold essential content.

2.2 Seamcarvingmethods 
In image processing techniques, the seam carving is an operation that resizes a digital image 
(enlarges or reduces) based on awareness of the image content. Accordingly, pixels of the 
image that play a key role in the human visual system is retained and the rest ignored to 
improve the efficiency of the human perception process [9]. 
A seam is a path with 8-connected of low-importance pixels from top to bottom or left to 
right, which called vertical and horizontal seams, respectively. In other words, the vertical 
seam consists of a path of pixels in the columns of an image and a horizontal seam of paths 
of pixels in the rows of an image. Removing seams will reduce the size of the image as well 
as duplicate the seams to increase the size of an image. The basic seam carving algorithm 
[1] uses the gradient energy function to determine the importance of each pixel based on the 
following equation: e(I) =| 
��� 
���x I | + | 
��� 
���y I |(1) 
Where I, e(I) is a source image and its calculated energy, respectively. A vertical seam in 
the seam carving technique is defined as follows: 
Sx= {Sx i} 
n 
i=1 = {x(i),i}n i=1,s.t., ���i,| x(i) ��� x(i ��� 1) |��� 1, 
(2) 
where x : [1,...,n] ������ [1,...,m]. The definition of the horizontal seam will be similar to 
the definition of the vertical seam.The following equation expresses the vertical seam pixels 
(S): IS= {I(Si)}n 
i=1 = {I(x(i),i)}n 
i=1 
(3) 
The following equation, which is the sum of the pixel energies, is used to calculate the cost 
of a seam S that contains n pixel: 
Scost(s) = Scost(Is) = 
n ? 
i=1 
e(I(si))(4) 
By minimizing the cost of the seam, the optimal seam (S���) can be calculated based on the 
following equation: S���= min Scost(IS) = min 
n ? 
i=1 
e(I(Si))(5) 
Dynamic programming methods can be used to find the optimal seam. The first step in 
finding the optimal vertical seam is to calculate the minimum cumulative energy. To obtain 
this energy (M), all possible connections from the second row to the last row for entry (i,j) 
are calculated as follows: 
M(i,j) = e(i,j) + min ��� ��� ��� 
M(i ��� 1,j ��� 1), 
M(i ��� 1,j), 
M(i ��� 1,j + 1), 
(6) 
The last value obtained from the last row contains the maximum cumulative energy. For this 
reason, the last row values are used to select the optimal seam, the least value representing 
19419Multimedia 
Tools and Applications (2023) 82:19417���19440 
the desired seam is selected and the bottom-up operation is performed in the vertical seam 
method. The seam carving process is repeated over and over to resize the image as best as 
possible. In reducing the image size, after removing the seam, the neighboring pixels are 
shifted to the left or up. This method has also been used for image and video resizing in 
2009 by Shamir and Vidan [52]. 
Due to the use of the basic seam carving technique of the backward method, as well as 
ignoring the energy injected into the image after the removing of the optimal seam, Method 
[44] used a forward energy criterion. According to this method, the seams are selected as the 
optimal seam from the minimum total energy injected and the cumulative energy obtained. 
The authors have reported that this method produces fewer artifact effects on the resized 
image. The cumulative matrix (M) is calculated as follows: 
M(i,j) = e(i,j) + min ��� ��� ��� 
CL(i,j) + M(i ��� 1,j ��� 1), 
CU(i,j) + M(i ��� 1,j), 
CR(i,j) + M(i ��� 1,j + 1), 
(7) 
where CL, CUand CRare image gradients resulting from non- adjacent pixels becoming 
neighbors after removing the seam, which are calculated as follows:
CU(i,j) = ?I(i,j + 1) ��� I(i,j ��� 1)?, 
CL(i,j) = ?I(i ��� 1,j) ��� I(i,j ��� 1)? + CU(i,j), 
CR(i,j) = ?I(i ��� 1,j) ��� I(i,j + 1)? + CU(i,j). 
(9) 
where|.|denotestoL2���norminthisequation.Basedonthereportedresultsofthismethod, 
images with different background colors have better results. 
Method [13], as the sparse seam carving method, presents the energy calculated in (7) as 
follows: M(i,j) = e(i,j) + min ��� ��� ��� 
CL(i,j) + M(i ��� 1,j ��� 1) + ��S(i,j), 
CU(i,j) + M(i ��� 1,j) + ��S(i,j), 
CR(i,j) + M(i ��� 1,j + 1) + ��S(i,j), 
(10) 
In this equation S(i,j) is the constraint term and its control parameter is ��. Constraint term 
is defined by the following equation: 
S(i,j) = 
1 
k ? 
(r,c)���N(i,j) 
W(r,c)(11) 
Where K is the normalization factor, N(i,j) including the 8-neighborhood of (i, j) and W 
is the seam map that is updated at each step. The authors have reported that the proposed 
method works better than other methods for images containing lines and edges. 
19420Multimedia Tools and Applications (2023) 82:19417���19440 
In method [21], the authors used the neighborhood inhomogeneity factor (NIF) as a new 
importance map that introduced the NIF as a set of inhomogenous neighbors in a pixel. 
Another method of seam carving is to use a low-order polynomial-time algorithm to 
optimally select multiple seams instead of one seam [25]. In other methods, scaling and 
wrapping have been used as a new operator in seam carving techniques. For example, in 
method [50], a hybrid importance map is used, using a gradient map, saliency map, and 
depth map. Also, an adaptive algorithm for weighting each of the three maps is presented. 
In method [67], a hybrid seam carving and wrapping method are presented, in which, after 
identifying high-energy seams,the wrapping techniquesare appliedto the image usingthese 
seams. Another method of seam carving is to use a low-order polynomial-time algorithm to 
optimally select multiple seams instead of one seam [25]. In paper [20], a new method based 
on four principles of psychology for context-aware saliency is proposed, the purpose of 
which is to identify the scene regions in the image. Another method uses a global gradient- 
based feature to identify the rough position of salients objects in an image [27]. 
Detecting seam carving is an important security challenge in image forensics. Of course, 
in the research literature, various methods have been proposed to identify seam carving 
based on security methods [35, 62, 63, 69].

The paper then delves into seam carving methods in image processing, a technique that resizes digital images based on content awareness. In essence, the seam carving operation maintains the pixels that play a crucial role in the human visual system, while disregarding the rest to improve the perception process.
Seam carving describes a path of low-importance pixels running either vertically or horizontally across the image. To determine the importance of each pixel, the basic seam carving algorithm employs a gradient energy function. In resizing the image, seams are removed to reduce the image size and duplicated to enlarge it.
The paper also discusses the process of identifying optimal seams, which involves calculating the minimum cumulative energy and employing dynamic programming methods. It details the mathematical processes behind these operations.
This section further discusses various seam carving techniques, including those that use forward energy criteria to address issues related to the basic seam carving method, like ignoring the energy introduced to the image after removing the optimal seam. This method reportedly yields fewer artifacts in the resized image. Other techniques include sparse seam carving, which works particularly well with images containing lines and edges, and methods that leverage the neighborhood inhomogeneity factor (NIF) as a new importance map.
The authors also examine methods that select multiple seams using a low-order polynomial-time algorithm and techniques that combine seam carving with scaling and wrapping. They mention that the hybrid importance map technique uses a gradient map, saliency map, and depth map, and includes an adaptive algorithm for weighting each of these three maps.
The final part of this section touches upon the relevance of seam carving detection in image forensics, acknowledging that various methods have been proposed in the research literature to identify seam carving based on security methods.

3.1 Informationentropy 
One of the ways to detect randomness property in a signal is to use entropy analysis. The 
entropy was introduced in 1949 by Shannon for data communication and storage [51]. The 
concept of entropy in physics is related to the degree of irregularity and uncertainty. The 
entropy of a digital image is the randomized estimate that is used to measure the sharpness 
of the histogram peaks. The entropy rate of a digital image is defined by

3.2 MaximalLyapunovexponent 
In the analysis of time series, the presence of a positive Lyapunov exponent indicates the 
phenomenon of chaos in a time series [31]. The first method for calculating Lyapunov expo- 
nent of a time series was proposed by Wolf in 1985 [58]. There are many computational 
errors in using this algorithm to obtain the Lyapunov exponent. For this reason, other meth- 
ods use deterministic dynamical approximation. In this section, the algorithm proposed by 
Rosenstein [43] and Kantz [30] is discussed. These methods use exponential divergence in 
closely related trajectories to calculate Lyapunov exponent. 
A point, such as sn0, is chosen in the time series space, and all neighborhoods distance 
less than ? are considered. The mean distances of all neighborhoods from this point are 
calculated in phase space, and the logarithm of this mean distance at time��n will contain 
all deterministic fluctuations in the dynamical system. For all reference points in phase 
space (n0), the effective expansion rate fluctuations in the mean state will be calculated. The 
mathematical equation of this model is as follows: 
S(��n) =

ln ��� ��� 
1 
| ��(Sn0) | ? 
Sn�����(Sn0) 
| Sn0+��n��� Sn+��n| ��� ���. 
(13) 
Where Sn0in this equation represents the reference point in the phase vector and ��(Sn0) is 
the neighborhood of Sn0with distance ��. It should be noted that Sn0is the last element of 
Sn0and Sn0+��nis the outside time when covered by the delay vector Sn0. In this equation, 
the neighborhood size should be assumed to be as small as possible.

The given pseudocode (Algorithm 3) corresponds to the main part of the image resizing process, which involves the selection of optimal seams based on the entropy importance map and Lyapunov threshold.
Here's a brief overview of the steps:
The function
ProposedSeamCarving
takes in two parameters: the input image 'I' and the mode 'Type'. 'Type' is used to determine whether the function is in the increasing mode (Type = 1) or decreasing mode (Type = 2).
The function initializes several variables and arrays. The function
EntropyEnergy
is used to calculate the entropy energy map 'E' of the image 'I'.
A while-loop runs until a certain condition is met (not provided in the given pseudocode). If the column number 'col' exceeds the number of columns in the image minus 2, the loop breaks.
If the variable 'flag' equals 0, the energy map 'E' is updated. Then, the function starts selecting the seams from the entropy importance map 'E'. It initializes the 'Seam' array that will contain the seam coordinates.
Inside another while-loop, the function iterates over the rows of the importance map 'E' and finds the position with the minimum energy in the neighbourhood of the current pixel to include in the seam.
Once the seam is selected, it calculates the sum of the logarithmic difference of the energies of the adjacent pixels in the seam. This sum divided by the number of pixels in the seam minus 2 gives the Lyapunov exponent for the seam. If the Lyapunov exponent is less than the Lyapunov threshold (LT), the function performs a resizing operation on the image with the selected seam.
If the Lyapunov exponent is greater than the LT, the column is incremented, and the loop continues to the next column.
Finally, if the mode 'Type' equals 1, the function performs an operation on the energy map 'E' (not provided in the given pseudocode). If not, it assigns 'IR' to 'J'.
The algorithm returns the resized image 'J'.
The helper function
MyMin
is used to find the minimum value in the array 'A'. It returns the location 'Loc' of the minimum value.
The process is controlled by the variable 'Type', where 1 corresponds to the increasing mode, and 2 corresponds to the decreasing mode. In the increasing mode, columns are added to the image, while in the decreasing mode, columns are removed.
Please note that some parts of the algorithm and helper functions like
EnergyUpdate
,
MyImResize
and the operation on 'E' when 'Type' equals 1 are not provided in the given pseudocode. The complete understanding of the algorithm would require these missing details.

The results of visual analysis and quantitative analysis show that the proposed algorithm 
can be used as a practical task. Of course, there are still drawbacks. One of the drawbacks 
of seam carving methods is their low execution speed. Also, using salient object detection 
techniques can increase the performance accuracy of this algorithm. For this reason, in 
future work, the study of increasing the execution speed and accuracy of the algorithm 
through deep learning methods can fill this gap. This algorithm can also be commonly used 
in many other media, such as video and audio, with changes in its nature. 
6 Conclusions and future works 
Over the past two decades, the use of content-based image resizing techniques has made 
significant progress and has been a favorite of many image processing researchers. In the 
seam carving techniques, the use of a high-performance significance map can increase the 
accuracy of this algorithm. For this reason, in this paper, a new entropy-based significance 
map is proposed to resize the image in the seam carving algorithm. In fact, the main content 
of this paper is the use of dynamical systems analysis theory, which uses the most important 
process of dynamic systems analysis, the Lyapunov exponent, to search for optimal seams. 
To show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, two standard datasets were used and 
the results were presented as visual analysis and quantitative analysis based on standard 
criteria. For visual analysis, the proposed method and other methods were evaluated with 
user feedback and the results showed that Based on the statistics obtained from users, the 
proposed method has been satisfied by users. The aspect ratio similarity criterion was also 
used for quantitative analysis and the simulation results showed that the performance of the 
proposed algorithm performed better than other methods. In future work, attempts will be 
made to identify the salient regions of the image using machine learning algorithms such as 
deep learning to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

The conclusion highlights that content-based image resizing techniques have significantly progressed over the past two decades, with seam carving techniques being a popular area of focus. However, the efficiency of these algorithms often depends on the effectiveness of the significance map used.
In this study, the authors introduced a new entropy-based significance map for resizing images in the seam carving algorithm, which leverages the theory of dynamical systems analysis. Specifically, they used the Lyapunov exponent, a key metric in dynamical system analysis, to search for optimal seams. This innovative approach aims to improve the accuracy and performance of the seam carving process.
Evaluation of the proposed method was conducted on two standard datasets and included both visual and quantitative analyses. User feedback was used for the visual analysis, while the aspect ratio similarity criterion was used for the quantitative analysis. The results suggested that the proposed method performed better than other techniques and was well received by users.
However, the authors acknowledge that the algorithm has limitations, primarily its execution speed, and recognize the potential benefits of incorporating salient object detection techniques to improve performance accuracy.
Looking ahead, the authors plan to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of their algorithm by identifying the salient regions of the image using machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning. This will likely increase the effectiveness of the significance map and therefore the overall performance of the seam carving process. They also suggest the possibility of adapting their approach for other types of media, including video and audio, which shows the versatility and broad potential applications of their method.

Bayesian Probabilities and the Histories Algebra

We attempt a justif i cation of a generalisation of the consistent histories programme 
using a notion of probability that is valid for all complete sets of history proposi- 
tions. This consists of introducing Cox���s axioms of probability theory and showing 
that our candidate notion of probability obeys them. We also give a generalisation of 
Bayes��� theorem and comment upon how Bayesianism should be useful for the quantum 
gravity/cosmology programmes. 
KEY WORDS: Bayesian probability; consistent histories; linear positivity. 
PACS: 02.50.Cw; 03.65.Ta; 04.60.-m. 
During this paper we will introduce a novel notion of probability within 
the framework of a histories theory. Firstly, we shall introduce Cox���s axioms of 
probability theory and then show that our proposed notion of probability obeys 
them. Secondly, we shall discuss the implications of such Bayesian probability 
assignments on the physical foundations of quantum history theories, quantum 
cosmology and relational gravity theories. 
So, one can derive the standard rules of Bayesian probability theory from 
axioms that notions of probable inference should obey. This was shown by Cox 
(1961) who gave two simple axioms and derived probability theory from them. 
One of the axioms is that the probability that two propositions �� and �� are both 
true upon a given hypothesis I should depend only upon the probability of one 
of the propositions upon the same hypothesis and the probability of the other 
proposition upon the same hypothesis conjoined with the presumption that the 
former proposition is true. This can be written schematically as: 
p(�� ��� �� | I) := F[p(�� | ��I),p(�� | I)](1) 
where F is some function to be determined that is suff i ciently well-behaved for 
our purposes. 
Cox���s other axiom is simply that the probability of the negation of a propo- 
sition upon a given hypothesis should depend only upon the probability of that

This paper explores a generalized concept of the consistent histories programme using a probability concept applicable to all complete sets of historical propositions. This concept involves introducing Cox's axioms of probability theory and demonstrating that the proposed probability notion complies with them. In addition, a generalization of Bayes' theorem is proposed and suggestions on how Bayesianism could be beneficial to quantum gravity/cosmology programs are discussed.
The paper introduces a new concept of probability within a histories theory framework. It presents Cox's axioms of probability theory and demonstrates that the proposed probability concept complies with them. The implications of such Bayesian probability assignments on the foundational elements of quantum history theories, quantum cosmology, and relational gravity theories are also explored.
Cox's approach, which derives the standard rules of Bayesian probability theory from axioms that notions of probable inference should follow, is discussed. One of the axioms states that the probability of two propositions �� and �� being both true given a hypothesis I should depend only on the probability of one of the propositions upon the same hypothesis and the probability of the other proposition upon the same hypothesis conjoined with the presumption that the former proposition is true.
Another axiom of Cox's states that the probability of a proposition's negation upon a given hypothesis should depend only on the probability of that proposition itself. This has implications for developing a theory that links probabilities with historical propositions, which are crucial in quantum history theories and quantum cosmology.

proposition upon the same hypothesis. This can similarly be written as: 
p(���� | I) := G[p(�� | I)].(2) 
Of course, there is an implicit zeroth axiom that probabilities should be 
represented by real numbers. Using such axioms Cox derived that the standard 
probability rules must be obeyed. 
However, once one attempts to derive probability as a form of probable 
inference one is not wholly clear about the status of the zeroth axiom. Certain 
probabilities must be considered real when they are to be interpreted as relative 
frequencies but, in terms of a theory of probable inference, there is no a priori 
reason why probabilities should be real. In fact, we can split up the zeroth axiom 
into two further axioms (Jaynes, 2003). Firstly we can presume the transitivity of 
probability assignments: 
Axiom 0a:If p(�� | I) > p(�� | I) and p(�� | I) > p(�� | I) 
then p(�� | I) > p(�� | I)(3) 
where ���>��� is an ordering notion that is def i ned on the space we use to represent 
probabilities. 
Secondly, we can presume what is called ���universal comparability���: 
Axiom 0b:For all ��,�� we have that either p(�� | I) > p(�� | I) 
or p(�� | I) < p(�� | I) or p(�� | I) = p(�� | I).(4) 
The combination of axioms 0a and 0b ensures that probability assignments 
can be real numbers. Obviously axioms 0a and 0b are restrictions upon the type of 
probability space we desire for notions of probable inference. However, we might 
easily not desire axiom 0b, especially in the light of quantum theory and special 
relativity. There are physical reasons why we might not be able to universally 
compare certain propositions probabilistically. For example, should we be able to 
compare two statements that involve spacelike separated regions, or that involve 
incompatible variables? A form of probability that does compare such statements 
might involve unjustif i ed inference. So not only do we argue that probabilities 
need not be real numbers, we also argue that, in certain physical situations, they 
should not be real numbers. The reals simply might not have enough structure to 
represent a plausible notion of probability in certain situations. See also (Isham, 
2003) for other reasons why we might choose not to use reals for all notions of 
probability. 
This is a thesis argued rather cogently by Youssef (1994, 2001) who argues 
that complex numbers and quaternions could also be consistent with Cox���s two 
axioms (or rather axioms analogous to Cox���s). Such work attempts a derivation 
of the consistency of complex numbers with Cox���s two axioms by presuming 
a distributive lattice of propositions. One can then derive quantum mechanical 
Bayesian Probabilities and the Histories Algebra1291 
features for such probability theories. We shall not comment upon this work 
much more but rather we take a slightly different tack; we would like to discuss 
quantum history theories (Griff i ths, 1984; Omnes, 1988; Gell-Mann and Hartle, 
1990; Isham, 1994).

The paper further presents an implicit 'zeroth' axiom that probabilities should be represented by real numbers. The author argues that when trying to derive probability as a form of probable inference, the status of the zeroth axiom becomes ambiguous. Although probabilities must be considered real when interpreted as relative frequencies, there's no a priori reason why probabilities should be real in a theory of probable inference.
This 'zeroth' axiom can be further divided into two additional axioms. Axiom 0a posits the transitivity of probability assignments. Axiom 0b, on the other hand, proposes 'universal comparability', asserting that for all ��,�� either p(�� | I) > p(�� | I), p(�� | I) < p(�� | I), or p(�� | I) = p(�� | I).
Despite ensuring that probability assignments can be real numbers, the author argues that these axioms are restrictions on the type of probability space desirable for notions of probable inference. The paper suggests that there might be circumstances, particularly in light of quantum theory and special relativity, where probabilities should not be real numbers.
The paper then references Youssef's work arguing that complex numbers and quaternions could be consistent with Cox���s two axioms. Such work tries to derive the consistency of complex numbers with Cox���s two axioms by presuming a distributive lattice of propositions, which can then derive quantum mechanical features for such probability theories.
Following this, the paper shifts focus to discuss quantum history theories. In these theories, a homogeneous history is defined as an ordered tensor product of Heisenberg picture projection operators. This framework can potentially provide a rich context for exploring quantum mechanical probabilities beyond the real number space.

This is because we have a certain amount of distributivity for such histories:

Thispropertyarisesbecausehistorypropositionsareprojectionoperatorsonsome

such that: N�� ?

tr(C����) = tr(C1�������) 
tr(C����) =

tr(C����) = 1.(21) 
Thus updating by Bayes��� theorem in this manner gives a posteriori probabilities 
that behave in exactly the same manner as the a priori ones. For complete sets 
of homogeneous histories that are def i ned over the same temporal support, they 
add up to 1 and are additive (as long as the a priori history commutes with the a 
posterioriones).Thisis,ofcourse,exactlywhatBayes���theoremisabout;onetakes 
probabilities and updates them to give something that are also good probabilities. 
An opposing programme would be to keep probabilities real (presum- 
ably because they are to be interpreted as frequencies), but to try and give a 
1298Marlow 
pedagogical justif i cation for a non-additive measure of relative frequency (Sorkin, 
1995). Such a task would probably involve frequencies which don���t converge to 
a single value (Aerts, 2002; Anastopoulos, 2005). For frequencies that don���t con- 
verge to a single value, the most natural interpretation is that we are confusing 
contexts somehow���this isexactly thejustif i cationgiven inMarlow(2006) forthe 
LPprobabilities,albeitwithinaBayesianframework.However,ourBayesiananal- 
ysis need not be incompatible with notions of relative frequencies as such notions 
(or non-convergent generalisations) should be derivable from it as in the classical 
case. So, although the presumption that probabilities are complex might initially 
seem patently absurd, there is a certain amount of internal consistency to the ar- 
gument. Feynman has often cogently argued for the use of ���negative probabilities��� 
in physics (Feynman, 1987) but these ���negative probabilities��� don���t behave like 
probabilities according to Cox���s axioms. The added structure provided by using 
complex numbers is exactly what is required in order to make a ���good��� notion of 
probability for all complete sets of homogeneous history propositions. The real 
part of our complex notion can give the standard real notion of Bayesian probabil- 
ities for LP history propositions and, furthermore, can give us the standard notion 
of relative frequency for the d-consistent subset. 
Although not yet complete, this programme includes the two main previous

The paper continues to delve into the specifics of the consistent histories programme in quantum mechanics, exploring the interaction of various histories. The author emphasizes that these histories possess a degree of distributivity, which is critical for their logical manipulations.
The paper presents an example with two-time homogeneous histories, illustrating how this property arises because history propositions are projection operators on a larger histories Hilbert space. In this context, distributivity is obeyed for mutually commuting projection operators.
The author introduces a form of Bayes' theorem that updates a priori probabilities to yield a posteriori probabilities that behave similarly. For complete sets of homogeneous histories defined over the same temporal support, the author demonstrates that they add up to 1 and are additive, as long as the a priori history commutes with the a posteriori ones.
The author mentions alternative programmes that keep probabilities real but offer pedagogical justification for a non-additive measure of relative frequency. Such a task might involve frequencies that do not converge to a single value, suggesting the confusion of contexts.
The author argues for the use of complex numbers, stating that it provides the added structure needed to establish a robust notion of probability for all complete sets of homogeneous history propositions. The real part of the complex notion can deliver the standard real notion of Bayesian probabilities for LP history propositions and can give us the standard notion of relative frequency for the d-consistent subset.
This Bayesian histories programme, although not complete, incorporates the two main previous quantum history theories in certain limits. The author suggests that it also points to where we should look to find a physical justification for quantum history theories, namely in relation to axiom 0b, arguing that it is foundationally compatible with a relational philosophy.

Abstract 
Thepossibilityquestionconcernsthestatusofpossibilities:dotheyformanirreducible 
categoryoftheexternalreality,oraretheymerelyfeaturesofourcognitiveframework? 
If fundamental physics is ever to shed light on this issue, it must be done by some 
future theory that unif i es insights of general relativity and quantum mechanics. The 
paper investigates one programme of this kind, namely the causal sets programme, 
as it apparently considers alternative developments of a given system. To evaluate 
this claim, we prove some algebraic facts about the sequential growth of causal sets. 
These facts tellagainst alternative developments, given thatcausal setsare understood 
as particular events. We thus interpret causal sets as multi-realisable objects, like 
states.Thisinterpretation,however,isunderminedbyanargumentfortheprobabilistic 
constraint of general covariance, as it says that multiple paths along which a causal 
set is produced are not physically different. 
1 Introduction:The Possibility Question 
In ���Dilemma of determinism��� (1884) William James succinctly contrasts the two 
camps in the the modality debate.1One camp admits that ���possibilities may be in 
excess of actualities���, [...] [ so that ] actualities seem to l oat in a wider sea of 
possibilities from out of which they are chosen���. The other camp, which he called 
���determinists���, says that possibilities ���exist nowhere, and that necessity on the one 
hand and impossibility on the other are the sole categories of the real. Possibilities 
that fail to get realized are [...] pure illusions: they never were possibilities at all.[...] 
The cloud of alternatives our minds escort this mass of actuality withal is a cloud of 
sheer deceptions, to which ���impossibilities��� is the only name that rightfully belongs���.

This abstract and introduction are from a paper by Tomasz Placek about the modal aspects of causal sets, which is an approach to quantum gravity. The core question he investigates is the "possibility question", which is about whether possibilities are part of reality or are just features of our cognitive framework. Placek argues that a unifying theory of general relativity and quantum mechanics may illuminate this issue.
The paper focuses on the causal sets programme, which considers alternative developments of a given system. To evaluate this claim, the paper delves into the algebraic aspects of the sequential growth of causal sets. The results suggest that, rather than considering causal sets as particular events, they are better viewed as multi-realisable objects, akin to states. However, this interpretation encounters a challenge when considering the probabilistic constraint of general covariance.
In the introduction, Placek cites a 19th-century philosopher William James, who framed the possibility question as a stark choice: either possibilities exist alongside actualities, or they are merely illusions, and the only categories of the real are necessity and impossibility. While James was skeptical about the ability of science to resolve this question, Placek suggests that an advanced understanding of the relation between scientific theories and experimental data may yield a resolution to the possibility question. The introduction concludes with the author expressing optimism that future science might help to settle this high-level debate.

quantum mechanics. According to some interpretations, moreover, a measurement���s 
possible results are understood as determined by values of a hidden factor, so the 
results are not alternative possibilities, in the required sense. In any case, without

2 On the Causal Sets Programme 
Our concern in this paper is indeterministic (modal) aspects of the causal sets 
programme, which was launched by Raphael Sorkin and collaborators.3This is a 
programme in quantum gravity that isbased on two ideas: (i) a deep structure of quan- 
tum space-time, which the theory identif i es with a causal set (���causet���, in short), is 
discrete, and (ii) a causet is partially ordered by a causally interpreted ordering. The 
programme advances a few further claims that might as well draw a metaphysician���s 
attention. To quote, 
Another [feature of the theory] is a complete departure from determinism ��� 
even at the fundamental scale, when all aspects of the ���state of the system��� are 
���known���, the classical limit of the theory is postulated to be stochastic in nature. 
[...] Unitarity will likely have to be abandoned to formulate the quantum theory 
in a discrete setting. [...] Locality as a fundamental physical principle seems to 
be abandoned. [11, p. 109]. 
Toaddonemoremetaphysicallycontroversialdoctrine,thereisrealbecomingaccord- 
ing to the programme. That is, the universe is thought of as growing in consecutive 
stages, where the stages are def i ned in causal rather than temporal terms. Time and, 
generally, space-time, is constituted in the growth. 
As expected, the sheer number of controversial claims has commanded attention 
of metaphysicians, philosophers of science, and physicists. The programme has been 
discussed, criticised, or defended from many perspectives. For a discussion from a 
philosophy of physics perspective, see W��thrich and Callender [15], W��thrich [14], 
and the references therein.

In this part of the introduction, the author discusses the limitations of our current understanding of quantum mechanics and general relativity in tackling the "possibility question". He suggests that to make progress, we need to consider theories that unify quantum mechanics and general relativity, known as quantum gravity theories.
He identifies the causal sets programme, a specific approach to quantum gravity, as a potentially promising avenue to investigate. This programme views the universe as composed of discrete, causally related sets, and sees the universe as growing in distinct stages.
The causal sets programme makes several controversial claims that have sparked debate among physicists and philosophers. For instance, it suggests that even with complete knowledge of a system's state, outcomes can be stochastic or probabilistic rather than deterministic. Moreover, it may require the abandonment of unitarity (a key principle in quantum mechanics) and locality (the idea that objects can only be influenced by their immediate surroundings). The programme also posits that "real becoming" happens, i.e., the universe grows in stages defined by causal relations rather than temporal ones, with spacetime itself emerging from this growth process.
The remainder of the paper, the author explains, will delve into the mathematical structure of causal sets and their growth, examining the implications these findings have for the concept of alternative possibilities. The author aims to shed light on the modal aspects of the causal sets programme in the hope of contributing to the larger debate on the nature of possibilities.

3 Causal Order 
As a causet is a partial order ?, i.e., a ref l exive, antisymmetric, and transitive order,4 
thatisfurthersubjecttoalocalf i nitenessassumption(seebelow),wefocusf i rstonthe 
order. Calling the order ���causal��� indicates that it is to generalize the causal ordering 
of general relativity, GR, def i ned as 
x ?GRy 
iff there exists a future-directed causal curve from x to y. 
The focus on this concept of general relativity comes from a diagnosis that ���of all the 
major concepts in our current best theories, the spacetime causal order from general 
relativity and the path integral from quantum theory will survive the coming rev- 
olution��� [5, p. 247], which in turn is based on a number of mathematical results, a 
particularlyimportantonebeingMalament���s[9]theorem.Thetheoremsaysthatforan 
important class of GR space-times (the so-called future and past distinguishing space- 
times), a causal isomorphism preserves the metric structure up to a conformal factor. 
This is typically glossed by saying that causal ordering determines metric structure up 
to conformal factor.5 
Since a null-curve is causal, and a point can be connected to itself by a null-curve, 
? is ref l exive. In some contexts, however, one may prefer to work with a related strict 
order (i.e., irref l exive and transitive) rather than a partial causal order ?. This strict 
order is def i ned by the equivalence x ��� y ��� x ? y ��� x ?= y. Depending on the 
context, we will freely switch between ? and ���. 
Irref l exivity and transitivity of ��� imply asymmetry, x ��� y ��� ��(y ��� x). Asym- 
metry of ��� as well as anti-symmetry of ? in turn prohibit loops, x ��� y ��� y ��� x 
(or x ? y ��� y ? x ��� x ?= y). The prohibition of causal loops signals a departure 
from the general relativistic causal ordering, which permits such loops. This remark 
is not intended as criticism, since causal loops in GR are often seen as anomalous, 
or an artefact of the theory that allows for too many models, with many unphysical 
ones.6A more worrisome observation is that causal ordering of GR seems to have 
deterministic underpinnings. After all, globally hyperbolic space-times have the ini- 
tialvalueproblem(IVP)well-posed,bytheChoquet-BruchatandGerochtheorem[3], 
meaning that there is a unique (up to isometry) maximal globally hyperbolic space- 
time that extends an initial data set and satisf i es Einstein���s i eld equations. As globally 
hyperbolic space-times are often considered generic models of GR, the result pro- 
vides evidence for the determinism of GR, if restricted to generic space-times. Thus, 
restricting ourselves to globally hyperbolic space-times, if we have x ?GRy 
and 
x ?GRz 
and know that x belongs to space-time M, then y and z must both belong 
to the same space-time M. This is to be contrasted with a modal-temporal ordering

In this section, the author turns his attention to the concept of causal order in the causal sets programme. In the context of general relativity, causal order is defined by the existence of a future-directed causal curve from one point to another. This concept is important as it's believed to survive the forthcoming revolution in theoretical physics and will likely have a role in future theories.
The author points out that in the causal sets programme, causal order is interpreted as a partial order (i.e., reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive) and further subject to a local finiteness assumption. This order is central to how the programme views the progression of events in the universe. However, it deviates from the concept of causal order in general relativity, where causal loops are possible. In the causal sets programme, such loops are prohibited, signaling a departure from the traditional understanding.
This is not necessarily a drawback, as causal loops in general relativity are often seen as problematic or anomalous. A more challenging issue is that the causal order in general relativity seems to have deterministic underpinnings, due to the well-posedness of the initial value problem in globally hyperbolic space-times. This contrasts with the causal sets programme's emphasis on non-determinism and stochasticity.
The author ends this section by expressing his intent to examine the concept of ordering in the causal sets programme more closely, focusing on its implications for modality, or the study of possibility and necessity.

General covariance casts a somewhat unfriendly light on our interpretation of ele- 
ments of Cf i n 
D as states. Recall that a typical element A ��� Cf 
i n 
D has multiple parents, 
and hence can be reached by multiple paths, all starting with the singleton-based 
causet. However, since the premises of General Covariance are satisf i ed, the proba- 
bilities of reaching A along different paths should be the same. Now reading A as a 
multi-realizable state, we get that no matter how this A is arrived at, the probability 
of its production should be the same. This might appear somewhat strange, as we 
may imagine (drawing on our everyday���s experience) that some paths leading to a 
given state are easier than the other. To explain away this weirdness, we turn to the 
argument for general covariance, only to learn that this argument concludes that paths 
are not physically real. But if they are not physically real, they can hardly play the role 
of alternative possible paths leading to C. After all, if the paths do not to carry any 
physical information, what information are they supposed to carry? The only answer, 
I think, is that this information regards our ways of representing reality rather than 
any information about reality itself, where ways of representing might result from the 
formal methods we use. Clearly, one needs a much more substantial differentiation of 
paths to consider them as alternative possible ways of producing a given causet. 
Havingseentheproblemsproducedbytheprobabilisticconstraintofgeneralcovari- 
ance, one might be tempted to reject it. Obviously, the constraint invokes the standard 
desideratum that physical laws be invariant under arbitrary differentiable coordinate 
transformations, with the underlying idea that a choice of coordinates is conven- 
tional, and hence should have any bearing on what the laws of nature look like. But, 
since causets do not live in differentiable manifolds and continuous spacetime is only 
apparent, there is no single clear-cut answer how to apply the idea underlying general 
covariance to causets. Probabilistic general covariance is just one proposal, and (we 
think) not a fortunate one. One rendering of the idea is to require that ordering of 
elements in a causet has no physical signif i cance. This seems to imply that there is 
only physically meaningful way of becoming for any given causet. This is a rejection 
of indeterministic becoming. 
7 Discussion 
In this paper we have focused on the modal aspects of causets. Let us recall where the 
argumentation set out in this paper leads us. After proving a few facts about causets, 
we argued that causets cannot be understood as particular events, as objects that are 
not multi-realizable. For this concept of eventhood there is a persuasive criterion for 
co-possibility, which is based on the later witness intuition. Since any two causets in 
Cf 
i n 
D have an upper bound (i.e., a later witness, exactly), any two causets in Cf 
i n 
D are 
co-possible, and hence Cf 
i n 
D admits exactly one maximal set of co-possible causets, 
i.e., just one history, identif i ed thus with Cf i n 
D itself. The modalities are trivialised and 
no room is left for substantial possibilities. 
We were therefore compelled to turn to a different understanding of causets. As a 
typical causets has many parents and belongs to multiple maximal chains in Cf i n 
D

In this section, the author grapples with the implications of general covariance, a key tenet of general relativity, for the causal sets programme. In the context of general relativity, general covariance denotes the principle that physical laws should remain the same regardless of the coordinate system used to describe them. The author suggests that this principle poses a challenge when causets are considered as states.
In the causal sets programme, a given causet can be reached by multiple paths. If general covariance holds, the probabilities of reaching a particular causet along different paths should be the same. This implies that the physical state itself is indifferent to the particular path taken to reach it, which is counterintuitive. The author suggests that if paths do not carry physical information, then they might represent different ways of representing reality. This, however, would require a more significant differentiation of paths.
The author then questions the applicability of the principle of general covariance in the context of the causal sets programme. Since causets do not exist in differentiable manifolds, the meaning of general covariance becomes less clear. The author suggests an alternative interpretation: that the ordering of elements in a causet has no physical significance. This would imply only one physically meaningful way of becoming for any given causet, rejecting indeterministic becoming.
The author then reflects on the overall discussion about the modal aspects of causets, arguing that causets cannot be understood as particular events, as they are multi-realizable. The author points out that this multi-realizability of causets challenges the idea of co-possibility, based on the intuition of a 'later witness'. This notion suggests that for any two causets, there exists a 'later witness' causet that includes both, making all causets co-possible. This interpretation however trivializes modalities and eliminates room for substantial possibilities. This compelled the author to consider a different understanding of causets.

considered causets to be multi-realizable, like states or Lewisian non-fragile events. 
On this understanding, causets producible by sequential growth form a state space; 
maximal chains in this state space are (discrete) trajectories. The picture is in radical 
contrast to the orderly trajectories of classical physics, as all trajectories in Cf i n 
D start 
at a (unique) minimal element and multiple trajectories cross at a typical state. Still 
we found the picture promising, as the theory is supposed to be indeterministic, and 
one might hope that probabilities will help to reduce the number trajectories. While 
examining the argument for general covariance, which is a constraint on the proba- 
bilities def i nable on causets, we found that by this argument, the multiplicity of paths 
leading to a given should not be considered physically real. The paths had better be 
taken as our different representations of one physical process. With this diagnosis we 
end up back in a familiar pickle: as now paths converging to a given causet C are not 
thoughtofasalternativeevolutions,whatevercausetsarebelowagivencausettheyare 
co-possible. By a familiar argument, drawing on Fact 8, we get that Cf i n 
D is a (single) 
maximal set of co-possible causets, i.e. a (single) possible history. Is there a way out 
of this predicament, apart from rejecting substantial possibilities? We end this paper 
with two suggestions. 
First, it seems to us that the appeal to the physical irrelevancy of the ordering of 
SLR events may take two forms, and these two forms are conf l ated in the causal sets 
theory. The i rst appeal is operative in the concept of un-numbered causet. Just by 
being un-numbered, the causet does not provide us with any information as to how 
a subset of its SLR elements is ordered (but it gives information on, e.g., how large 
is the subset). The second appeal is at work in the argument for general covariance, 
and it concerns paths of causets rather than a single causet. A (f i nite) path of causets 
represents a particular order of creation of a given causet. Figure 4 shows two paths 
leading to a simple causet C. Are these paths different? If one takes the order of 
creation as trumping relativity, the answer is aff i rmative: path (i) depicts a singleton- 
based causet giving birth to a causet with a single link, which in turn gives birth to a 
causet with one element causally un-related to a causally-related pair. Path (ii) tells 
a different story, about a singleton-based causet giving way to a causet based on a 
causally un-related pair, and i nally���to a causet based on a triple, with one element 
un-related to a causally related pair. Note that since all the involved causets are un- 
numbered, there is no problematic ordering of causally unrelated elements in each 
causet.

Thingsaredifferent,however,ifpriorityisgiventorelativity,tothepointofignoring 
the concept of creation. Then one is deemed to look at the i nal causet C, in a vain 
attempt to i gure out an order of its elements. The attempt is vain, as it must involve 
the dubious task of assigning order of priority to SLR events. 
Thus, to give a chance to alternative multiple possible histories in Cf i n 
D , one option 
is to take the concept of the order of creation seriously: the advice is to let creation 
trump relativity. Since this move undermines the argument for General Covariance, 
for consistency���s sake this constraint should not be postulated. This need not be done 
sincetheirrelevancyoftheorderingofcausallyunrelatedelementsisalreadycaptured 
in un-numbered causets. 
Our second suggestion of how to escape from the predicament is to re-think what 
it means, in terms of the causets theory, that two elements of a causet are not compa- 
rable by the causal ordering. In the present paper we followed the custom of causets 
theoristsidentifyingcausallyincomparableelementswithspace-likerelatedelements. 
However, in a fully l edged modal account, this identif i cation simply appears to be 
wrong.Twoeventsmightbeincomparablebecausetheybelongtodifferentalternative

We leave, however, the task of developing this suggestion and examining its cogency

The author presents a second interpretation of causets as multi-realizable, similar to states or Lewisian non-fragile events. In this understanding, causets producible by sequential growth form a state space, with maximal chains in this state space representing (discrete) trajectories. Despite the contrast with classical physics, the author finds this interpretation promising for the inherently indeterministic nature of the theory.
However, the principle of general covariance poses a problem in this view as well. The multiplicity of paths leading to a given causet should not be considered physically real but rather as different representations of the same physical process. This leads the author back to the problem of co-possibility of causets. As a result, the author ends up with a single possible history, thereby eliminating substantial possibilities.
The author concludes with two suggestions to escape this predicament. The first one is to differentiate between the concepts of un-numbered causet and the order of creation in a path of causets. The author suggests that considering the order of creation seriously could provide an avenue for multiple possible histories in the causal set. This, however, would undermine the argument for general covariance, which would no longer be a necessary constraint.
The second suggestion is to reconsider what it means for two elements of a causet to be non-comparable in terms of causal ordering. The author proposes that two events might be incomparable because they belong to different alternative evolutions, not because they belong to the same evolution and are space-like related. However, the author acknowledges that this proposal needs further development and scrutiny in future works.

Roughly  speaking,  Bayes��� theo-rem gives a method of calculating conditional probabil-ities.  A  Bayesian  begins  with  a  prior  probability  thatsome aspect of the world holds, then makes observationsthat  modify  that  probability  to  produce  a  posteriorprobability. A familiar example involves a medical test.Imagine a disease that affects one percent of a popula-tion.  A  medical  test  is  not  completely  accurate;  it  ispositive  for  ninety  percent  of  the  people  who  have  thedisease and negative for eighty percent of people who donot have the disease. A person is chosen at random andgiven the test. The test is positive. What is the probabilitythat the person has the disease? Out of 1 000 people, tenwill  have  the  disease,  and  nine  of  these  would  have  apositive  test.  However,  990  people  will  not  have  thedisease, but 20%, or 198 would have a positive test. Thus,9/198 people would have a positive test, but only 9 ofthese would have the disease. Therefore, the conditionalprobability of having the disease, given a positive test, is9/(9/198)/9/207:/0.0435.  Before  the  test  the  prob-ability  of  having  the  disease  is  1%.  This  is  the  priorprobability. After a positive test the probability is 4.35%.This is the posterior probability given the observation ofa  positive  test.  A  similar  calculation  shows  that  theposterior   probability   of   having   the   disease   given   anegative test is 0.00126, i.e. 0.126%.More formally, Bayes theorem is as follows.

Observationsare  then  taken  and  these  probabilities  are  subsequentlymodified   via   Bayes   theorem   to   form   the   posteriorprobabilities. Inferences are then drawn from the poste-rior probabilities.This paper, and others in this volume, are concernedwith   how   animals   integrate   prior   information   andobservations,  so  that  Bayes  theorem  is  also  central  tothe theoretical considerations here. We are not, however,interested   in   what   inferences   can   be   made   aboutunknown parameters, but rather whether animals makedecisions that are optimal given the appropriate poster-ior   probabilities.   We   are   thus   not   concerned   withBayesian statistical inference, but with the related topicof Bayesian decision theory. For a discussion of how thisframework   can   be   applied   to   animal   behaviour   seeMcNamara and Houston (1980).Statisticians  differ  over  the  merits  of  Bayesian  andclassical  statistics.  The  main  criticism  of  the  Bayesianapproach  by  classical  statisticians  concerns  the  use  ofprior  probabilities  by  Bayesians.  Classical  statisticiansask  Bayesians  where  they  get  their  priors.  The  samecriticism   can   be   made   of   Bayesian   decision   theory.Although this may be a problem in some circumstances,we argue that it is not a problem when applying Bayesiandecision theory to animal behaviour. As we detail below,it seems reasonable to assume that evolutionary historyand  previous  experience  determine  well-defined  priors,and  then  very  reasonable  that  natural  selection  couldproduce  animals   that  behave  as  if  they  knew  theseprior probabilities.Where do priors come from?There  are  two  different  processes  that  could  lead  anorganism  to  behave  as  if  it  knew  the  prior  distributionappropriate to its current environment.AdaptationIf  the  ancestors  of  an  organism  have  evolved  in  anenvironment in which the types of local habitat and theirfrequency  of  occurrence  have  been  stable,  then  naturalselection  could  lead  to  the  organism  behaving  as  if  itknew  this  information.  In  fact  to  say  that  behaviour  isadapted to the environment of its ancestors is essentiallysaying that the organism is using this prior information.We  can  regard  the  ���worldview���  of  an  organism  asset  by  the  environment  experienced  by  its  ancestors.This worldview may restrict what the animal is capableof learning. For example, animals may never learn thatan  environment  is  predator  free,  or  never  learn  thatthey will not be interrupted while foraging. In Bayesianterms, the prior probability for these possibilities is zero,and since the prior is zero so is the posterior probability,no matter how strong the evidence to the contrary.A  restricted  worldview  could  restrict  the  flexibilitywith  which  the  organism  responds  to  local  conditions.For example, imagine a squirrel species whose membersfind  themselves  in  one  of  two  habitat  types.  In  onehabitat owls are the squirrels��� sole predator, in the othersnakes  are  the  sole  predator.  If  the  ancestors  of  anindividual  only   experienced   owl   predation,   then   theorganism   will   have   a   rule   about   what   are   possibledangers,  and  how  to  deal  with  these  dangers,  that  hasbeen  shaped  by the  danger of owls.  This  rule  might  beinappropriate when dealing with snakes, and the squirrelmay  never  be  able  to  learn  the  correct  anti-predatorbehaviour  against  snakes.  We  can  only  expect  currentbehaviour  to  be  adapted  to  both  sorts  of  predators  ifancestors  experience  both  in  the  past,  some  ancestorsexperiencing  snakes  and  some  owls.  This  illustrates  ageneral   point   about   phenotypic   plasticity   made   byHouston and McNamara (1992).The   lack  of  flexibility  may   have   profound  conse-quences   for   experimental   design.   If   an   experimentinvolves  a  treatment  that  is  entirely  inconceivable  tothe animal, the response may not be the one predicted bythe experimenter. The animal will be using a rule that isadapted to its natural environment but cannot respondin an adaptive way to the specific novel situation it nowfaces.  Under  these  circumstances  it  is  not  possible  topredict  the  response  of  the  animal  by  considering  thecurrent  situation  alone;  predictions  must  be  based  onprediction   of   the   rule   it   should   use   in   its   naturalenvironment  (McNamara  1996).  However,  since  manyrules may do well in its natural environment, it may be244OIKOS 112:2 (2006)virtually  impossible  to  predict  behaviour  in  the  novelsituation from theoretical considerations.ExperienceAn  animal���s  prior  distribution  may  also  be  determinedby  its  past

The publication "Bayes��� theorem and its applications in animal behaviour" by John M. McNamara, Richard F. Green, and Ola Olsson posits that Bayesian decision theory can be used to model animal behaviour. According to this theory, animals might possess a kind of "prior opinion" or expectation based on past experiences, which could include the quality of food patches or potential mates. Using new information or "sampling information", they can update this prior opinion to a "posterior opinion" or revised expectation. In other words, they combine their prior experience with new data to make optimal decisions.
The paper suggests that these "prior opinions" could be derived from two possible sources. One is the animal's own individual experience while exploring its environment. The other is adaptation to the environment experienced by previous generations. This theory implies that we should often expect to see "Bayesian-like" decision-making in nature.
Bayes' theorem is introduced as a method of calculating conditional probabilities, starting with a prior probability and using new observations to modify that into a posterior probability. This process can be applied in many contexts, such as diagnosing diseases from medical test results.
The authors discuss two processes that could lead an organism to behave as if it knew the prior distribution appropriate to its current environment: adaptation and experience. Adaptation here refers to the organism behaving in a way that reflects the environment of its ancestors, effectively using this prior information. Experience, on the other hand, refers to the animal's own past experiences which shape its expectations and behaviours.
While the authors acknowledge potential criticisms of Bayesian decision theory and Bayesian statistics (particularly regarding the source of priors), they argue that the approach is reasonable and useful when studying animal behavior. They suggest that evolutionary history and past experiences can provide well-defined priors, and natural selection could lead to the development of animals behaving as though they possess knowledge of these prior probabilities.

experience.Biological examplesExample 1: foraging in patchesAn animal is foraging in an environment in which foodoccurs  in  well-defined  patches.  Within  each  patch  foodoccurs  as  discrete  items,  which  the  animal  finds  bysearching the patch. Patches vary in the number of preyitems they contain and maybe other characteristics suchas the ease with which individual items are found. As theanimal  searches  a patch  it  gains  information  about  thecharacteristics  of  this  patch  from  the  number  of  itemsfound so far and the times at which each item was found.Suppose the animal has already had lots of experiencein this environment during which it has gained informa-tion, where this information is equivalent to learning thetypes  of  patches  present  and  their  frequency  of  occur-rence.  The  animal  arrives  at  a  new  patch.  Initially  theprobability that the patch is of any given type is equal tothe frequency of that patch type in the environment as awhole.   This   is   the   prior   probability.   As   the   animalsearches  the patch it  updates  its  estimate of patch typebased   on   its   experience.   Examples   that   have   beenanalysed include the following:a)each patch contains either zero or one item. Thenthe longer the animal continues without finding anitem,  the  more  likely  it  is  that  the  patch  is  empty(McNamara and Houston 1980, 1985a).b)Patches differ in the number of prey items present.Each item in a patch is found after an exponentialtime, independently of the time to find other items.The mean of this exponential search time for eachitem is the same for all items and all patches. In thisexample,   the   current   posterior   probability   thata  patch  contains  a  given  number  of  items  onlydepends on the prior distribution, the total numberof   items   found   on   the   patch   so   far   and   thetotal  time  to  find  these  items  (Oaten  1977,  Green1980,  1984,  1987,  McNamara  and  Houston  1980,McNamara 1982, Valone and Brown 1989, Olssonand Holmgren 1998).c)Each patch contains exactly one item, but differentpatches  vary  in  how  hard  the  item  is  to  find.  Ananalogous problem is that of a squirrel cracking anut/here the habitat is composed of different nuts,which differ in terms of how hard they are to crack.The  squirrel  tries  to  crack  nuts  sequentially.  Thuseach nut acts as a patch. The longer the time spentso  far  in  an unsuccessful  attempt,  the  more  likelythat  this  is  a  hard  nut  (McNamara  and  Houston1985b, Green and Nun ��ez 1986).We would expect the decisions of an animal while on thepatch to depend on both experience on the current patchand previous experience in the environment. For exam-ple, consider an animal that maximises the rate at whichit   obtains   food   items   in   the   environment.   Then   itsdecision  to  leave  a  patch  should  be  influenced  by  themean rate at which it can get items in other patches/thehigher  this  rate  the  sooner  it  should  leave  the  currentpatch.  The  decision  to  leave  should  also  depend  onfuture  prospects  for  food  on  the  current  patch,  whichdepends on posterior information about this patch. Thisinformation  is  determined  by  the  animal���s  experiencein the environment as a whole, which sets the prior, andexperience on the patch (Green 1980, McNamara 1982,Olsson and Holmgren 1998).Example 2: mate choice during an annual breedingseasonCollins et al. (unpubl.) consider the following Bayesianmodel  of  mate  choice.  Suppose  that  each  year  eachfemale  member of a population must choose a male tomate  with.  Males  vary  in  quality,  and  the  female  candetermine  the  quality  of  a  male  by  inspection.  Thefemale   inspects   a   sequence   of   males,   attempting   tochoose  one  of  the  highest  quality  males  in  the  popula-tion   as   a   mate.   However,   the   distribution   of   malequalities   varies   from   year   to   year,   so   that   at   thebeginning  of  a  breeding  season,  before  a  female  hasinspected  any  male,  she  does  not  know  what  range  ofqualities are high for that year. She does, however, haveprior  information  on  how  the  distribution  of  qualityvaries from year to year. For a semelparous species thisinformation   comes   from   the   environment   in   whichancestors evolved. For an iteroparous species the femalehas  this  information  and  her  experience  in  previousyears.  As  the  female  inspects  males  during  the  currentbreeding   season   she   updates   her   estimate   of   thedistribution of quality this year.To illustrate the updating process, suppose that withina given year male quality has a normal distribution withmean m and variances2.

The excerpt you provided gives three examples of Bayesian learning in biological organisms:
Foraging in Patches
: This example discusses an animal's process of foraging for food in discrete patches. As the animal searches for food, it gains information about the food availability and frequency within each patch. It uses this information to estimate whether a patch is likely to have food based on past experience, and how long to continue searching a given patch before moving on. The longer an animal goes without finding food in a patch, the more likely it is to decide that the patch is empty and move on to another.
Mate Choice During an Annual Breeding Season
: This scenario deals with how a female member of a population chooses a male to mate with each year. The distribution of male qualities varies year to year, so at the start of a breeding season, a female does not know what qualities are desirable that year. However, she has prior knowledge of how male qualities vary based on previous years. As she inspects males during the current breeding season, she updates her estimate of male quality distribution.
Growth Under Predation Risk
: In this case, individual organisms are born into environments with varying levels of predation risk. An organism starts with a "prior" estimate of the danger based on the experiences of its ancestors. As it gathers its own experiences���through direct encounters with predators, cues about the presence of predators, or simply surviving over time���it updates this prior estimate, leading to a more accurate understanding of the actual level of predation risk in its environment.
All these examples demonstrate organisms updating their "beliefs" based on new data���hence Bayesian learning���allowing them to make better decisions to enhance their survival and reproductive success.

The information you've provided appears to be from a research paper or a book discussing biological instances of Bayesian inference. Here, the authors use three examples:
Foraging in patches:
This example involves an animal foraging in an environment where food occurs in well-defined patches. The animal's knowledge of the environment influences the probability it assigns to the type of patch it encounters. Based on its past experiences, the animal updates its understanding of the patch type as it finds more items, which influences its decisions on whether to leave or continue searching a patch.
Mate choice during an annual breeding season:
In this scenario, female animals need to choose a male to mate with each year. The quality of potential mates varies, and so does the female's understanding of what constitutes a 'high-quality' mate. Using prior knowledge and observations of male qualities during the current breeding season, the female updates her estimate of quality distribution for that year.
Growth under predation risk:
Here, different individuals are born into environments with varying predation risks. Individuals update their perception of the environment's danger level based on their experiences, which can include direct cues (like the presence of predators) or indirect cues (like still being alive after a certain period).
The authors then discuss how these mathematical calculations could translate into the "rules of thumb" that animals may use in their environments. While the Bayesian approach allows for optimal decisions under uncertainty, it's suggested that animals may not necessarily distinguish between distinct types in their environments (as assumed in the Bayesian model) but rather learn to react to their environment based on their experiences.
Lastly, the authors also discuss the influence of factors such as the number of observations and the ratio of observation error to prior error on the weighting given to current information in Bayesian calculations.

volume.Evidence that animals are BayesianHow can we identify whether animals are Bayesians? Asso  often  when  studying  behaviour,  we  may  have  nomeans  of  establishing  what  is  going  on  in  the  animal���smind  per  se.  Thus,  we  will  probably  never  be  able  toobserve directly  whether  animals  really do  have mentalconstructs that represent prior and posterior probabilitydistributions. In any case, we have argued that it is notnecessary for an animal to have these constructs in orderto exhibit Bayesian type behaviour. Such behaviour canresult  from  the  animal  using  simple  rules.  In  testingwhether   animals   are   Bayesian   we   are   therefore   notconcerned with an animal���s mental constructs, but withcomparing   the   behaviour   of   an   animal   with   thatpredicted  by  a  model  assuming  Bayesian  informationuse, and that predicted by alternative models.The   central   feature   of   a   Bayesian   model   is   thedependence  of  present  behaviour  on  prior  informationand  current  experience.  So  Bayesian  behaviour  couldpossibly be inferred if there is evidence that both of thesecomponents influence the behaviour of organisms in anadaptive  way.  Strong  evidence  for  such  Bayesian  beha-viour would have to show that if either is held fixed andthe  other  altered,  then  this  alters  behaviour  appropri-ately. There are, however, some problems with this simplecriterion.If the prior is set by experience then evidence for theeffect of a prior can be sought by experimentally alteringthis prior experience. If, however, the prior is set partlyby  evolutionary  history,  then  this  aspect  of  the  priorcannot  be  altered  by  experimental  procedures.  Instead,indirect  evidence  of  the  effect  of  the  prior  has  to  beobtained  by  comparative  studies  that  look  at  popula-tions or species with different evolutionary histories.Just because there is evidence that animals are affectedby current experience it does not necessarily mean thatthey   are   learning.   Collins   et   al.   (unpubl.)   give   ahypothetical  example  from  mate  choice.  As  in  example248OIKOS 112:2 (2006)2, suppose that the distribution of male qualities variesfrom year to year. In a particular year a female inspectsmales sequentially and hence gains information on  thisyear���s  distribution.  She  must  choose  a  mate  withoutrecall  of  previously  rejected  males.  Under  the  optimalBayes  rule  the  decision  to  accept  a  male  takes  intoaccount the qualities of all males so far observed. But thefemale can do very well by just employing a decreasingacceptance  threshold  that  depends  on  time  alone.  Thisrule has many of the properties one would associate witha learning rule/if the males observed so far are poorquality  the  female  does  not  accept  any  but  continuessearching  with  a  reduced  threshold.  She  is  thus  lesschoosy, and so behaves as if she has learnt that this yearis a poor year and responds appropriately. But to whatextent can we describe a female that employs this simpledeterministic threshold rule as learning?Evidence from foragingSo what is the evidence that animals exploiting patchilydistributed  food  are  Bayesian  foragers?  In  this  case  ananimal  learns  about  the  environment  from  its  previousexperience.  One  immediate  question  is  what  sort  ofinformation  does  it  learn?  Does  it,  for  example,  justlearn   some   simple   measure   of   overall   environmentquality,  or  does  it  learn  more  subtle  aspects  of  theenvironment.In   some   cases   only   a   simple   overall   measure   ofenvironmental  quality  is  relevant.  For  example,  in  thepatch  use  scenario  envisaged  by  Charnov  (1976)  theenvironment  is  composed  of  food  patches  that  deliverfood rewards as a smooth decreasing flow. The simplestmeasure of overall environmental quality in this settingis  the  maximum  long-term  reward  rateg.  We  mightregard  learning  this  quantity  as  a  Bayesian  problem  initself,   with   the   prior   set   from   evolutionary   historyor  previous  environments  encountered.  Certainly  thereare  simple  Bayes-like  rules  that  an  animal  can  employto   learnggiven   sufficient   time   (McNamara   1985,McNamara  and  Houston  1985a).  Having  learntgtheanimal maximises its rate of energy gain by leaving eachpatch when the local rate falls tog. Here the animal isresponding   to   both   its   previous   experience   in   theenvironment  and  the  current  patch.  But  this  is  onlyevidence  of  Bayesian  behaviour  in  some  weak  sense,since  the  animal  only  needs  to  know one  aspect  of  theenvironment   (g)   and   knows   this   prior   aspect   withcertainty  when  encountering  a  new patch.  Some  of  thepapers in this volume only provide evidence for Bayesianforaging in this sense.In   other   cases   more   detailed   knowledge   of   theenvironment  is  important  if  the  animal  is  to  behaveoptimally on a patch. In particular it is crucial whetherthe  distribution  of  prey  items  is  clumped  with  somepatches containing few items and others many. There iscertainly evidence that animals do make adaptive use ofthis    information    and    other    pertinent    informationin  a  number  of  cases  (Valone  and  Brown  1989,  vanGils et al. 2003) as is reviewed by Valone (Valone 2006)in this volume.There  are  some  additional  difficulties  in  generatingtestable   predictions,   which   have   still   not   been   fullyaddressed. First, it may sometimes be difficult to identifythe  alternative  model  in  a  relevant  manner.  Of  course,the choice of alternative model influences the choice ofpredictions   to   test.   Second,   the   Bayesian   foragingmodels to date assume that animals use no other sourceof information besides the prior and sampling informa-tion.  However,  that  may  not  necessarily  be  the  case.These two issues are partly interwoven.Other  sources  of  information  could  influence  beha-viour  in  a  Bayesian  manner,  or  interact  with  Bayesianbehaviour. For example sensory information could act inthis way. Patch foraging models usually assume that theanimal either uses only sensory information (Valone andBrown 1989), or only sampling information (Green 1980,McNamara   1982)   to

Determining if animals behave in a Bayesian manner is a complex issue, largely due to our inability to observe or measure their cognitive processes directly. However, one approach to addressing this question is by comparing animal behavior to the predictions made by Bayesian models and alternative models.
A crucial feature of a Bayesian model is the dependence of present behavior on both prior information and current experience. If it's observed that an animal's behavior changes adaptively in response to alterations in these two components, that could serve as evidence of Bayesian behavior. There are, however, challenges with this criterion:
When the prior is influenced by the animal's evolutionary history, it can't be directly altered through experimental procedures. Instead, evidence of the influence of the prior can only be obtained indirectly, through comparative studies that consider populations or species with different evolutionary histories.
The presence of learning doesn't necessarily mean that an animal behaves in a Bayesian manner. For example, in the mate choice scenario, the female can optimize her decision without recalling the quality of all the males she has inspected.
In the context of foraging, evidence of Bayesian behavior could be if an animal learns about the environment from its previous experiences and adapts its foraging strategy based on that learned information. For instance, an animal that learns the maximum long-term reward rate (g) and then leaves each food patch when the local rate falls to g is exhibiting Bayesian-like behavior. However, this is only a weak form of Bayesian behavior, as the animal only needs to know one aspect of the environment.
In some cases, more detailed knowledge of the environment is important for optimal foraging. If the distribution of food items is clumped, the animal must adapt its foraging strategy accordingly. However, generating testable predictions for Bayesian foraging behavior has its challenges, such as identifying alternative models and accounting for other potential sources of information (like sensory information) that animals might use alongside prior and sampling information.

behaviour.Partial reinforcement extinction effectConsider a Skinner box experiment in which an animalcan obtain rewards by pressing a lever. Not all responsesare rewarded. The experiment is set up so that, up to acertain time all responses are rewarded with probabilityp, after this time no responses are rewarded. The animalhas  no  information  on  this  extinction  time  other  thanthrough  the  rewards  it  receives.  The  empirical  findingfrom  this  experiment  is  that,  after  extinction,  animalsstop responding more quickly when p is high than whenit is low (reviewed by Mackintosh 1974).McNamara   and   Houston   (1980)   put   a   Bayesianinterpretation  on  this  finding.  In  the  natural  environ-ment food sources always run out eventually. The animalhas a prior probability distribution on the length of timea new source will last. It combines this with the rewardinformation  on  the  source  to  find  the  posterior  prob-ability that the source has extinguished. The larger is p,the  more  likely  that  a  run  of  unrewarded  responses  isdue  to  extinction  rather  than  a  run  of  bad  luck,  andthe   greater   the   posterior   probability   that   extinctionhas occurred.Future directionsWe think it is worth widening the areas to which Bayestheorem  has  been  applied.  Obvious  areas  outside  fora-ging are further applications to mate choice and preda-tion risk.Within,  as  well  as  outside  of  the  realm  of  foragingstudies, we think there has not been sufficient attentionpaid  to  the  effect  of  the  evolutionary  environment  onprior distributions. We give three simple examples.(i)   Most   models   of   foraging   do   not   differentiatebetween   animals   on   the   basis   of   their   evolutionaryenvironment, treating all animals as capable of learningprior distributions from experience. But, for instance, itmay be that only animals whose ancestors have encoun-tered clumped prey distributions are capable of learningwhen prey are clumped and responding accordingly.(ii)   An   animal   whose   ancestors   never   lived   in   apredator-free  environment  may  not  be  able  to  learnthat  its   current   environment   (e.g.   in   a   lab)   is   safe;whereas  others  with  a  different  evolutionary  historymay be capable of learning this.(iii)  One  reason  for  preferring  immediate  to  delayedrewards  is  that  an  animal  may  be  interrupted  and  losethe  reward  if  it  does  not  take  what  is  available  now.Animals  of  different  species  may  have  different  prefer-ences for immediacy as a consequence of their ancestorsexperiencing different interruption rates.In  addition  to gaps  in  knowledge  identified  above,  itappears that more work is needed regarding how groupsof animals form decisions in a Bayesian context (Valoneand  Giraldeau  1993,  Sernland  et  al.  2003).  Also  in  thefield  of  habitat  selection  there  is  a  need  to  evaluatehow Bayesian information processing alters predictions.A  final  remaining  issue  (MacArthur  and  Pianka  1966)that  has  only  rarely  been  touched  upon  (Green  1990,Rodr�� ��guez-Girone ��s   and   Va �� squez   1997,   Olsson   andHolmgren  2000)  is  how  Bayesian  behaviour  influencespopulation and community dynamics.

The partial reinforcement extinction effect demonstrates another potential instance of Bayesian behavior in animals. In a Skinner box experiment, an animal obtains rewards by pressing a lever, but not all responses are rewarded. The reward probability (p) is high up to a certain time, after which no responses are rewarded. The empirical finding from this experiment is that after extinction, animals stop responding more quickly when p is high rather than low. According to McNamara and Houston, this behavior could be interpreted in a Bayesian context: the animal has a prior probability distribution on the time a new food source will last, and when it stops receiving rewards, it updates its belief (posterior probability) that the source has extinguished.
There are a number of potential directions for future research in understanding Bayesian behavior in animals:
Expanding the application of Bayes' theorem:
Currently, most studies focus on foraging behavior, but there is potential to explore other areas like mate choice and predation risk.
Considering the effect of evolutionary environment on prior distributions:
Most models of foraging do not differentiate animals based on their evolutionary environment. For instance, it may be that animals with ancestors who encountered clumped prey distributions are more capable of learning when prey are clumped and responding accordingly.
Understanding group decision making:
There is still much to learn about how groups of animals form decisions in a Bayesian context.
Exploring habitat selection:
There is a need to evaluate how Bayesian information processing alters predictions in the context of habitat selection.
Assessing influence on population and community dynamics:
Rarely touched upon is how Bayesian behavior might influence population and community dynamics. Further exploration is required in this area.
Therefore, understanding if and how animals behave in a Bayesian manner remains an ongoing challenge, with several promising avenues for future research.

ChatGPT
Deleuzian
: For Deleuze, knowledge isn't about stasis and affirmation; it's about becoming, about movement. It's the nomadic journey, not the arrival at a destination.
Bayesian
: Well, in the Bayesian paradigm, knowledge is the result of continuous updating of beliefs based on new evidence. Isn't that a sort of movement?
Deleuzian
: True, but the key difference lies in how that movement is perceived. For Deleuze, it's not about arriving at a more accurate or better understanding. Rather, it's the experience of exploring different ways of knowing and being. The important thing isn't the conclusion, but the journey itself.
Bayesian
: But isn't there some sort of destination? When we gain new information, we adjust our beliefs to accommodate it. This adjustment, or update, is essentially the journey, with the destination being a more accurate understanding of the world.
Deleuzian
: I see where you're coming from, but in Deleuzian thought, the focus isn't on reaching an objective truth. Instead, it's on the process of experimentation and creation of new possibilities of thought.
Bayesian
: So, if I understand correctly, Deleuzian knowledge is more about experiencing the world in different ways, while Bayesian knowledge is about understanding the world more accurately based on new evidence?
Deleuzian
: Yes, you could say that. For Deleuze, knowledge is an active creation of new concepts and modes of thinking. It's not about accurate representation, but about creating new ways of understanding and experiencing reality.
Bayesian
: Well, that certainly provides food for thought. As Bayesians, we see knowledge as an evolving understanding of the world, where the journey is driven by evidence. And in this journey, the aim is to reach a more accurate understanding. But I see now that this is not the only way to think about knowledge.
Deleuzian
: Indeed, there are many paths to knowledge, each with its own value and unique perspective. And in the end, it's not so much about which path is 'right', but rather which one resonates with our own unique way of understanding and experiencing the world.

: But you see, for Deleuze, entropy isn't something to be minimized. It is rather an inherent aspect of reality that enables change and diversity. It's not about reaching a state of equilibrium, but about exploring the fluctuations and differences, the possibilities that arise from disorder and unpredictability.
Bayesian
: Interesting. While we both see entropy as linked to uncertainty, we seem to view it very differently. As a Bayesian, I see entropy as something that quantifies uncertainty in our models and that we seek to reduce with new data.
Deleuzian
: And as a Deleuzian, I would interpret entropy as a characteristic of the vibrant, ever-changing reality that enables newness and diversity. Rather than trying to reduce it, we should embrace it and learn to navigate the unexpected and the chaotic.
Bayesian
: It appears we are approaching the same concept from fundamentally different philosophical perspectives. The dialogue itself, though, helps broaden our understanding of entropy and its implications.
Deleuzian
: Absolutely. We may have different viewpoints, but the exchange of ideas is enriching. After all, as Deleuze himself might have said, it's about the journey of thought, not necessarily the destination.

They argue over the definition of "time"

Bayesian
: From a Bayesian standpoint, we often consider time as a parameter within our models. It's a measurable quantity, a continuous sequence of events that we can use to understand change and predict future events based on prior observations.
Deleuzian
: For Deleuze, on the other hand, time is far from being just a measurable quantity. He conceives of time as being split into two halves - the virtual and the actual. The virtual is the realm of potentiality, the myriad possibilities that could come to be, while the actual is what we experience as the present. Time, in Deleuzian terms, is not linear but a multiplicity, with the past, present, and future co-existing and interacting with one another.
Bayesian
: That is an intriguing perspective. As a Bayesian, we look at time series data to inform our predictions and to understand patterns over a chronological sequence. Our view of time is perhaps more traditional, and tied to the idea of causality and the progression from past to future.
Deleuzian
: Yet, Deleuze would argue that such a linear and chronological understanding of time oversimplifies the complex interplay of different temporal dimensions. For him, the future is not simply what comes next; instead, it exists concurrently with the present and past in the realm of the virtual. Thus, understanding time requires embracing its multiplicity, not just its measurability.
Bayesian
: I see. We are indeed conceptualizing time in quite different ways. As a Bayesian, I look at time as a variable to help model and predict, while you, a Deleuzian, see it as a complex, multidimensional construct with philosophical implications.
Deleuzian
: Precisely. This dialogue illustrates how the same concept can be interpreted and understood differently depending on our philosophical underpinnings. It makes the exploration of knowledge that much more fascinating, doesn't it?
Bayesian
: Absolutely, this has been a truly enlightening conversation.

ChatGPT
In their discussion about the nature of time, the Bayesian and Deleuzian had differing viewpoints stemming from their respective philosophical and mathematical paradigms.
The Bayesian perceived time as a measurable quantity and a continuous sequence of events, primarily used as a parameter within predictive models. This understanding is linear, rooted in causality, and focuses on progression from the past to the future.
Conversely, the Deleuzian interpretation, derived from the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze, viewed time as a multiplicity rather than a linear concept. It's split into the 'virtual' and 'actual', with the virtual representing potentialities and possibilities, while the actual corresponds to the experienced present. According to Deleuze, past, present, and future coexist and interact in a complex manner that transcends traditional chronological understanding.
The conversation highlighted how the same concept - time, in this case - can be interpreted and understood differently depending on one's philosophical or mathematical underpinning. This divergence showcases the richness and diversity of intellectual thought across disciplines.

While the earlier discussion on image resizing with entropy focused on the mathematical concept of entropy as a measure of information or randomness in an image, the conversation about the definition of time touched upon broader philosophical perspectives.
One possible connection between the two discussions could be found in the consideration of time as a source of information or change within the context of image resizing. In image processing, resizing algorithms may take into account the temporal dimension of a sequence of images to preserve the coherence and continuity of the visual information over time.
Additionally, the idea of time as a multiplicity in the Deleuzian perspective aligns with the notion that images themselves can capture moments in time, freezing them as a visual representation of a particular duration. The entropy-based approach to image resizing recognizes the importance of preserving relevant information in the image while adapting its size, and this can relate to the dynamic and multifaceted nature of time in Deleuzian philosophy.
Overall, while the connection between the discussions on entropy and the definition of time may not be immediately apparent, they both touch upon fundamental aspects of information, change, and representation, albeit from different angles of mathematical analysis and philosophical inquiry.

Ah, I see. I apologize for the confusion. In that case, the connection between the earlier discussion on reducing entropy in image resizing and the disagreement over reducing or preserving entropy in their discussion becomes more apparent.
In the context of image resizing, reducing entropy refers to the process of compressing or simplifying the image data to reduce its size. This often involves discarding or approximating certain details or patterns in the image, leading to a loss of information and an increase in entropy. On the other hand, preserving entropy would involve maintaining the complexity and richness of the image data as much as possible during the resizing process.
The Deleuzian may argue in favor of preserving entropy, as they emphasize the importance of multiplicities, complexity, and the potential for new connections and variations. They might view the preservation of entropy as an opportunity to capture the richness and intricacy of the image, allowing for a more open and expansive interpretation of the visual information.
On the contrary, the Bayesian might argue in favor of reducing entropy, drawing on the principle of Occam's razor and the desire for simplicity and efficiency. They might view the reduction of entropy as a means to eliminate unnecessary or redundant information, focusing on the most relevant features and patterns in the image.
In this way, the disagreement between the Deleuzian and the Bayesian regarding the reduction or preservation of entropy reflects a broader philosophical debate about the nature of information, complexity, and the appropriate balance between simplicity and richness in representation.
