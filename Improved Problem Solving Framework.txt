Abstract 
Language models are increasingly being deployed for general problem solving 
across a wide range of tasks, but are still conf i ned to token-level, left-to-right 
decision-making processes during inference. This means they can fall short in 
tasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play 
a pivotal role. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for 
language model inference, âTree of Thoughtsâ (ToT), which generalizes over the 
popular âChain of Thoughtâ approach to prompting language models, and enables 
exploration over coherent units of text (âthoughtsâ) that serve as intermediate steps 
toward problem solving. ToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making 
by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to 
decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when 
necessary to make global choices. Our experiments show that ToT signif i cantly 
enhances language modelsâ problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring 
non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords. 
For instance, in Game of 24, while GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only 
solved 4% of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of 74%. Code repo with all 
prompts: https://github.com/ysymyth/tree-of-thought-llm. 
1Introduction 
Originally designed to generate text, scaled-up versions of language models (LMs) such as GPT [22, 
23,1,20] and PaLM [5] have been shown to be increasingly capable of performing an ever wider 
range of tasks requiring mathematical, symbolic, commonsense, and knowledge reasoning. It is 
perhaps surprising that underlying all this progress is still the original autoregressive mechanism for 
generating text, which makes token-level decisions one by one and in a left-to-right fashion. Is such 
a simple mechanism suff i cient for a LM to be built toward a general problem solver? If not, what 
problems would challenge the current paradigm, and what should be alternative mechanisms? 
The literature on human cognition provides some clues to answer these questions. Research on âdual 
processâ models suggests that people have two modes in which they engage with decisions â a fast, 
automatic, unconscious mode (âSystem 1â) and a slow, deliberate, conscious mode (âSystem 2â) 
[27,28,13,12]. These two modes have previously been connected to a variety of mathematical 
models used in machine learning. For example, research on reinforcement learning in humans and 
other animals has explored the circumstances under which they engage in associative âmodel freeâ 
learning or more deliberative âmodel basedâ planning [6]. The simple associative token-level choices 
of LMs are also reminiscent of âSystem 1â, and thus might benef i t from augmentation by a more 
deliberate âSystem 2â planning process that (1) maintains and explores diverse alternatives for current

Figure 1: Schematic illustrating various approaches to problem solving with LLMs. Each rectangle 
box represents a thought, which is a coherent language sequence that serves as an intermediate

searched in Figures 2,4,6. 
choices instead of just picking one, and (2) evaluates its current status and actively looks ahead or 
backtracks to make more global decisions. 
To design such a planning process, we return to the origins of artif i cial intelligence (and cognitive 
science), drawing inspiration from the planning processes explored by Newell, Shaw, and Simon 
starting in the 1950s [18,19]. Newell and colleagues characterized problem solving [18] as search 
through a combinatorial problem space, represented as a tree. We thus propose the Tree of Thoughts 
(ToT) framework for general problem solving with language models. As Figure 1 illustrates, while 
existing methods (detailed below) sample continuous language sequences for problem solving, ToT 
actively maintains a tree of thoughts, where each thought is a coherent language sequence that serves 
as an intermediate step toward problem solving (Table 1). Such a high-level semantic unit allows the 
LM to self-evaluate the progress different intermediate thoughts make towards solving the problem 
through a deliberate reasoning process that is also instantiated in language (Figures 2,4,6). This 
implementation of search heuristics via LM self-evaluation and deliberation is novel, as previous 
search heuristics are either programmed or learned. Finally, we combine this language-based 
capability to generate and evaluate diverse thoughts with search algorithms, such as breadth-f i rst 
search (BFS) or depth-f i rst search (DFS), which allow systematic exploration of the tree of thoughts 
with lookahead and backtracking.1 / 1ChatGPTThe paper "Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models" proposes a new framework for improving the problem-solving abilities of language models. Unlike traditional approaches that use a left-to-right, token-level decision-making process, the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework allows language models to explore multiple reasoning paths. It enables the model to consider different "thoughts" or coherent units of text as intermediate steps toward solving a problem.ToT allows for more deliberate decision-making by enabling the language model to self-evaluate its choices and backtrack or look ahead as needed. The approach is inspired by human cognitive processes that involve both fast, automatic thinking and slow, deliberate planning. The framework integrates search algorithms like breadth-first and depth-first search for a more systematic exploration.Experiments showed that ToT significantly improves performance in tasks requiring complex planning or search. For example, in the Game of 24, the ToT approach achieved a 74% success rate compared to just 4% using the traditional chain-of-thought prompting with GPT-4.1 / 1ToT Setup.We leverage a depth-f i rst search (Algorithm 2) that keeps exploring the most promising 
subsequent word clue until the state is no longer promising, then backtrack to the parent state to 
explore alternative thoughts. To make search tractable, subsequent thoughts are constrained not to 
change any i lled words or letters, so that the ToT has at most 10 intermediate steps. For thought 
generation, at each state we translate all existing thoughts (e.g.âh2.motor; h1.tasksâ for the state 
in Figure 6(a)) into letter constraints for remaining clues (e.g.âv1.To heap: tm;...â) and prompt 
a proposal prompt5times to come up with candidates for where and what to i ll in the next word. 
Importantly, we also prompt the LM to give a conf i dence level for different thoughts, and aggregate

Figure 6: In Mini Crosswords, (a) how thoughts are proposed and aggregated in a priority queue 
for depth-f i rst search (DFS), and (b) how a state is evaluated based on the possibility of i lling in 
each remaining word clue, and pruned if any remaining clue is deemed not possible to i ll by the LM. 
Then DFS backtracks to the parent state and explore the next promising thought for clue. 
these across proposals to obtain a sorted list of next thoughts to explore (Figure 6(a)). For state 
evaluations, we similarly translate each state into letter constraints for remaining clues, then evaluate 
for each clue if it is possible to i ll given the constraints. If any remaining clue is deemed âimpossibleâ 
to i ll in (e.g.âv1. To heap: tm s â), then the exploration of the stateâs subtree is pruned and DFS 
backtracks to its parent to explore the next promising thought. We limit DFS search steps to 100, and 
simply render the deepest explored state (the i rst explored one if multiple) into the i nal output. 
Results.As shown in Table 3, IO and CoT prompting methods perform poorly with a word-level 
success rate less than16%, while ToT signif i cantly improves all metrics, achieving a word-level 
success rate of60%and solving 4 out of 20 games. Such an improvement is not surprising, given IO 
and CoT lack mechanisms to try different clues, make changes to decisions, or backtrack. 
Oracle and ablation studies.When outputting from the oracle best DFS state (instead of the 
heuristically determined best state) per task, ToT performance is even higher and actually solves 
7/20 games (Table 3, â+best stateâ), indicating our simple output heuristics can be readily improved. 
Interestingly, sometimes when the crosswords game is actually solved, the state evaluator might still 
deem some words as âimpossibleâ and prune â possibly because5 Ã 5crosswords by design have 
some rare or obselete words that GPT-4 cannot recognize2. Given the state evaluation as a pruning 
heuristic is imperfect, we also explore ablating the pruning, and i nd the performance generally worse 
(Table 3, â-pruneâ). However, it could actually i nd the correct solution for 4/20 games (though only 
outputting 1 via heuristic), 3 of which are games ToT+pruning cannot solve within 100 steps. Thus, 
better heuristics for DFS pruning are critical for problem solving in this case. Lastly, we conf i rm the 
importance of backtracking by running an ablation that keeps i lling the most promising clue for at 
most 20 steps, allowing overwrites. This is similar to a âgreedyâ BFS search with breadth limit of 
b = 1, and performs poorly with a word level success of only 20% (Table 3, â-backtrackâ). 
5Related Work 
Planning and decision making.Smart planning and decision making are critical to achieving 
predef i ned goals. As they are trained on vast amount of world knowledge and human examples, LMs 
are known to have already absorbed rich commonsense that makes it possible to propose reasonable 
plans conditioned on problem setting and environmental states [10,39,34,11,32,38,37]. Our 
proposed Tree-of-Thought approach extends existing planning formulations by considering multiple 
potentially feasible plans simultaneously at each problem-solving step, and proceeding with the most 
promising ones. The integration between thought sampling and value feedback organically integrates 
planning and decision-making mechanisms, enabling effective search inside a solution tree. On the 
other hand, traditional decision-making procedures usually require training dedicated reward and 
policy models as in reinforcement learning (for example CHAI [30]), whereas we use the LM itself 
to provide the value estimates for decision making. 
2For example, âagendâ is an obsolete form of âagendumâ, but GPT-4 deems it a typo for âagendaâ. External 
retrieval or web interaction could augment LM for problem solving under knowledge uncertainty.

Self-ref l ection.Using LLMs to assess the viability of their own predictions is becoming an in- 
creasingly important procedure in problem solving. [25,17,21] introduced the âself-ref l ectionâ 
mechanism, in which LMs provide feedback to their generation candidates. [4] improves LMs code 
generation accuracy by injecting feedback messages generated by the LM itself based on its code 
execution results. Similarly, [14] also introduces âcriticâ or review steps over the actions and states, 
deciding the next action to take in solving computer operation tasks. Another recent work very 
relevant to ours is âself-eval guided decodingâ [36]. Similar to our method, self-eval decoding 
also follows a tree-search procedure with leaves sampled from stochastic beam search decoding, 
which are then evaluated by LLM itself with carefully prepared self-eval prompts. Their approach 
however, uses the PAL formulation [7] which represents thoughts as codes, which makes it diff i cult 
to tackle challenging tasks like creative writing which we consider in this paper. Our Tree-of-Thought 
formulation is thus more versatile and handles challenging tasks on which GPT-4 only achieves very 
low accuracy with standard prompts. 
Program-guided LLM generation.Our proposal is also related to recent advancements that or- 
ganize LMâs behavior with symbolic program guidance. For example [24] embeds LMs in an 
algorithmic search procedure to help solve problems like question answering step-by-step, in which 
the search trees are expanded by relevant paragraphs that might provide answers. This approach 
however differs from ours in that trees are expanded by sampling external paragraphs instead of the 
LMâs own thoughts, and there is no ref l ection or voting steps. Another approach, LLM+P [15], goes 
one step further and delegates the actual planning process to a classical planner. 
Classical search methods.Last but not least, our approach can be treated as a modern rendition 
of classical search methods for problem solving. For example it can be considered as a heuristic 
search algorithm like A* [8], in which the heuristic at each search node is provided by the LMâs 
self-assessment. From this perspective, our method is also related to NeuroLogic A*esque decoding 
proposed in [16], which is inspired by A* search but introduces look-ahead heuristics that are 
eff i cient for LMs to improve the beam-search or top-k sampling decoding. This method however is 
constrained to sentence generation tasks, whereas our framework are designed for complex, multi-step 
problem solving guarded by value feedback. 
6Discussion 
Limitations and future directions.Deliberate search such as ToT might not be necessary for 
many existing tasks that GPT-4 already excels at, and as an initial step this work only explores 
three relatively simple tasks that challenges GPT-4 and calls of better search and planning abilities 
incorporated with LMs. However, as we begin to deploy LMs for more real-world decision making 
applications (e.g.coding, data analysis, robotics, etc.), more complex tasks could emerge and present 
new opportunities to study these research questions. Also, search methods like ToT requires more 
resources (e.g.GPT-4 API cost) than sampling methods in order to improve task performances, 
but the modular l exibility of ToT allows users to customize such performance-cost tradeoffs, and 
ongoing open-source efforts [29] should readily reduce such costs in the near future. Lastly, this work 
focuses on using an off-the-shelf LM, and i ne-tuning LMs using a ToT-style high-level counterfactual 
decision making (e.g.deliberating over potential choices for the next paragraph, instead of predicting 
the next token) might present opportunities to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of LMs. 
Broader impact.ToT is a framework that empowers LMs to more autonomously and intelligently 
make decisions and solve problems. While current tasks are limited to reasoning and search problems, 
future applications involving interaction with external environments or humans could bring potential 
danger, e.g.facilitating harmful uses of LMs. On the other hand, ToT also improves the interpretability 
of model decisions and the opportunity for human alignment, as the resulting representations are 
readable, high-level language reasoning instead of implicit, low-level token values. 
Conclusion.The associative âSystem 1â of LMs can be benef i cially augmented by a âSystem 2â 
based on searching a tree of possible paths to the solution to a problem. The Tree of Thoughts 
framework provides a way to translate classical insights about problem-solving into actionable 
methods for contemporary LMs. At the same time, LMs address a weakness of these classical 
methods, providing a way to solve complex problems that are not easily formalized, such as creative 
writing. We see this intersection of LMs with classical approaches to AI as an exciting direction for 
future work. 1 / 1ChatGPTIt seems like you've pasted a comprehensive text about a method referred to as the "Tree of Thoughts" (ToT), which is designed to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of Language Models (LMs) like GPT-4. This method appears to use depth-first search for exploring promising "thoughts" or paths and has a mechanism for backtracking. The text also compares the performance of ToT with other methods and discusses its broader implications and future directions.Would you like to discuss a specific aspect of this text in more detail?1 / 1Connections with the following topics:

It emphasizes how the "Tree of Thoughts" (ToT) methodology can improve performance in tasks that require complex reasoning or decision-making.Here's how it could relate to the topics you've listed:Alefeld, G. and Herzberger, J. - Introduction to Interval Computations: Interval computations deal with uncertainty in numerical calculations. ToT could potentially integrate interval arithmetic to better model the uncertainty in the "promising paths" during its search process.Brooks, R.A. - Symbolic reasoning among 3-D models and 2-D images: ToT may benefit from symbolic reasoning techniques when tasked with interpreting and interacting with 3D models or 2D images, making it more versatile in problem-solving scenarios involving spatial reasoning.Davis, E. - Constraint Propagation with Interval Labels: The concept of constraint propagation could be utilized in ToT to narrow down possible paths more efficiently, potentially improving the depth-first search by adding more sophisticated constraints.Durrant-Whyte, H.F. - Uncertain geometry in robotics: ToT could potentially be adapted for robotics applications, where uncertainty in spatial configurations is a major concern. It might offer a way to plan robot movements while accounting for uncertainties.Fisher, R.B. - From Surfaces to Objects: If ToT is expanded to work with visual data, understanding the transition from surfaces to objects could be crucial. This is especially relevant if the LM needs to interpret 3D scenes or geometric structures.Fisher, R.B., Orr, M.J.L. - Solving Geometric Constraints in a Parallel Network: This could be especially relevant if ToT is adapted for problems involving geometric constraints. A parallel network approach may accelerate the depth-first search algorithm in ToT.Orr, M.J.L. and Fisher, R.B. - Geometric Reasoning for Computer Vision: Again, if ToT is used in a computer vision context, geometric reasoning could significantly improve its effectiveness in understanding and interpreting visual scenes.Would you like to delve into any of these connections further?1 / 1How does this relate to Surfaces and Essences, by Hoffstader?1 / 1ChatGPT"Surfaces and Essences: Analogy as the Fuel and Fire of Thinking" by Douglas Hofstadter explores the role of analogy in cognition and problem-solving. Hofstadter argues that our ability to make analogies lies at the heart of human intelligence.In the context of the "Tree of Thoughts" (ToT) methodology, the essence of analogy-making could be integrated into the depth-first search and backtracking process. For instance, ToT might utilize analogical reasoning to identify "promising paths" more efficiently, relating new problems to previous problems it has solved, and drawing upon those analogies to guide its search process.Additionally, analogical reasoning could enrich the constraints and heuristics used by ToT, just as it does in human problem-solving. For example, ToT might recognize a problem structure it encountered before and apply a similar solution strategy, thanks to its understanding of the analogy between the two problems.So, in essence, integrating the concepts from "Surfaces and Essences" could make ToT more adept at handling complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks, just as analogy-making does for human cognition.1 / 1Connections with conceptual blending, and Boolean 3d operators.1 / 1ChatGPTConceptual blending is a cognitive theory that describes how human minds combine elements from diverse mental spaces to create new ideas, insights, or solutions. In the context of the "Tree of Thoughts" (ToT) methodology, conceptual blending could be implemented as an advanced heuristic. For example, ToT could blend different promising paths or thoughts into a novel, more effective solution strategy, or mix elements from different heuristics to evaluate which paths to explore next.Boolean 3D operators usually refer to computational geometry methods like union, intersection, and difference, often used in CAD or 3D modeling. These operators could find an analog in ToT's decision-making procedures. For instance, ToT could employ Boolean-like operations to combine or filter sets of clues, thoughts, or solutions, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the depth-first search.Integrating conceptual blending and Boolean 3D operators into ToT might offer a more nuanced and dynamic problem-solving approach. Conceptual blending could provide a mechanism for creative problem-solving, while Boolean 3D operators could add mathematical rigor to the logical structuring of the search space.1 / 1What about the layout of the word2vec probability space using forced based layouts? How might we use the concept of geometric distance to represent the similarity or difference between topics?1 / 1ChatGPTIn word2vec, each word is mapped to a point in a high-dimensional space, and the geometric distance between these points can represent the semantic similarity or dissimilarity between the corresponding words. Using force-based layouts like those in t-SNE or UMAP, you can reduce dimensionality while preserving these distances, effectively clustering similar words together in a 2D or 3D space.In the context of ToT, or any other search-based problem-solving method, you might use these geometric representations to prioritize or evaluate possible next steps in the search tree. For example, you could use the word vectors to establish how "close" a proposed solution is to the desired outcome, using that as a heuristic for guiding the search.The concept of geometric distance in this reduced-dimensional space could serve as a way to objectively measure the similarity or difference between topics, clues, or states in the search tree. States that are closer in this word2vec-defined space might be evaluated as more promising or relevant to the problem at hand.1 / 1How does it relate to this: 8:32MO

2.3 Towards an Improved Problem-Solving Framework
We suggest ithat landscape ecology will be better able to provide the scientific
basis for the design and planning of sustainable landscapes by becoming a more
applied problem-solving science (sensu McAlpine et al. 2010), which searches
for
real, integrated solutions to landscape sustainability problems (c.f.Costanza 2009).
The framework we propose explicitly draws on the decision and planning sciences
Ð°
and this allows a formal integration ofthe different problem-solving components
(see Fig. 2.1). Earlier problem solving frameworks have been criticised for being:
(a) elitist (highly exnert orientated with limited public participation and recogni-
ion ofnon-expert knowledge);(b) overly dependent on the capacity of the steering
group/technology/facilitator; and (c) politically simplistic in assuming that it is
possible to produce an enduring consensus which wil be easy implement (Staes
et al. 2008). We believe that the modification the problem-solving framework
of
py landscape ecologists and planning scientists will facilitate greater disciplinary
integration because it requires explicit acknowledgement of the multiple facets of
each problem and the involvement multiple stakeholders.
The framework has seven stases. which are:(l) identifv and contextualise the
problem; (2) set agreed objectives and management actions; (3) conduct data
analysis and integration; (4) understand risks anduncertamnties: (>) conduct
pbjective and participatory decision analysis; (6) apply landscape management and
plannins, actions; and (7) implement monitoring and adaptive managemen

iterative. involving modification of early stages (e.g., management objectives)

dent facilitator occurs throughout the process, for the purposes of both legitimacy
(stakeholder buy-in) and efficiency (stakeholder knowledge) (Friedmann 1987).
An important component ofan applied problem-solving approach is to bring the
social and institutional dimensions ofthe problem to the fore. This is done by

It emphasizes interdisciplinary and stakeholder-inclusive problem-solving approaches, which are similar to how word2vec and other machine learning models incorporate multiple features and variables to predict outcomes.Here's how it could relate to the methods you've mentioned:Conceptual Blending & Boolean 3D Operators: The framework's focus on interdisciplinary solutions and multiple stakeholder perspectives aligns well with the idea of conceptual blending. Boolean 3D operators could serve as formal methods for integrating different problem-solving components, much like how the framework seeks to formally integrate different disciplines and perspectives.word2vec and Force-based Layouts: In the framework, the seven stages take into account data analysis, risk, and uncertainties, which could be quantified and visualized through word2vec or a force-based layout to help in decision-making. The 'geometric distances' between different landscape features, stakeholders, or strategies could offer a formal, data-driven way to measure and compare them.ToT or "Theory of Topics": The framework's emphasis on identifying and contextualizing the problem can benefit from ToT's search-tree model. It can prioritize pathways based on semantic closeness to the target outcome, using word2vec vectors for example.Public Participation and Non-Expert Knowledge: The emphasis on public participation and non-expert knowledge in the problem-solving framework could be facilitated through natural language processing models like word2vec, making the data more accessible and understandable to a general audience.Iterative and Adaptive Management: The framework, like ToT, is not linear but iterative, adjusting its earlier stages based on feedback from later ones. This adaptability is a feature that machine learning models like word2vec also possess, as they can be fine-tuned based on new data or outcomes.In summary, the problem-solving framework could be augmented or partially automated through techniques like word2vec, force-based layouts, and ToT to make it more data-driven, comprehensive, and adaptive.1 / 1ToT is Tree of Thoughts. There is also Chain of Thoughts, graph of Thoughts, grammar of graphics, and blender object scene layouts.1 / 1ChatGPTAh, I see. Thank you for clarifying that ToT stands for Tree of Thoughts. Let's relate these methods to the "Improved Problem-Solving Framework" and other concepts you've mentioned:Tree of Thoughts (ToT): This could represent the hierarchical structure of landscape issues, from general problems to specific solutions. It aligns with the first step of the framework: identifying and contextualizing the problem.Chain of Thoughts: This could be used to map the sequential stages in the problem-solving framework, showing how one stage leads to the next and making it easier to backtrack if necessary.Graph of Thoughts: This could serve as a representation of the interdisciplinary and stakeholder-oriented nature of the framework. Multiple nodes (representing different disciplines or stakeholders) could be connected by edges representing interactions or dependencies.Grammar of Graphics: This provides a systematic way to visualize complex data and could be utilized in the 'data analysis and integration' stage of the framework to present findings in a comprehensible manner.Blender Object Scene Layouts: In the context of landscape ecology, these could serve as 3D visualizations of the landscape, taking into account various metrics and constraints. Boolean 3D operators could be used to modify these layouts based on new data or stakeholder input.Conceptual Blending & word2vec: Both can be used to map the semantic landscape of stakeholder interests and concerns, offering a way to quantify and compare them, similar to using geometric distances in a word2vec probability space.Public Participation and Non-Expert Knowledge: These could be facilitated by using these graphical and computational methods to make the process more accessible, aligning with the framework's focus on inclusive participation.Iterative and Adaptive Management: Methods like ToT and the Chain of Thoughts could help in making the framework more adaptable by providing structured ways to revisit and modify earlier stages based on new information.So, these methods could offer sophisticated ways to implement, visualize, and adapt the problem-solving framework in a more data-driven and stakeholder-inclusive manner.1 / 1Connections with this: Submitted on 30 Jun 2023]
Bluefish: A Relational Grammar of Graphics
Josh Pollock, Catherine Mei, Grace Huang, Daniel Jackson, Arvind Satyanarayan
The Grammar of Graphics (GoG) has become a popular format for specifying visualizations because it unifies different chart types into a consistent, modular, and customizable framework. But its benefits have not yet reached the broader class of data-driven graphic representations -- from annotated charts and hierarchical visualizations to molecular structure diagrams, Euclidean geometry, and mathematical formulae. These graphics are still developed using rigid typologies, monolithic tools, or specialized grammars that lack the customizability and generality of the GoG. In response, we present Bluefish, a relational grammar of graphics that extends the benefits of the GoG to this larger domain. Bluefish provides two key abstractions: user-extensible, domain-specific elements (e.g., mathematical expressions, chemical atoms, or program state stack frames); and perceptual groupings (also known as Gestalt relations) like proximity, nesting, and linking. Users compose these primitives within a Bluefish specification, which the language runtime compiles to a relational scenegraph: a formal representation of a graphic that, compared to traditional tree-based scenegraphs, better preserves semantic relationships between visual elements. To illustrate its flexibility, we show that Bluefish can represent data-driven graphic representations across a diverse range of domains while closely aligning with domain-specific vocabulary. Moreover, to demonstrate the affordances of Bluefish's relational scenegraph, we develop a prototype screen reader tool that allows blind and low-vision users to traverse a diagram without significant additional scaffolding.1 / 1ChatGPTThe "Bluefish: A Relational Grammar of Graphics" paper presents an advancement over the conventional Grammar of Graphics (GoG). It offers extended customizability and applicability to a broader range of data-driven graphic representations, making it highly relevant for complex interdisciplinary work like landscape ecology, AI, and robotics.Bluefish vs GoG: While GoG offers a unified framework for basic charts and graphs, Bluefish adds a layer of customizability that allows for domain-specific elements and perceptual groupings. This makes it more adaptable for specialized fields.Improved Problem-Solving Framework: Bluefish's ability to handle domain-specific elements and semantic relationships can enhance the 'data analysis and integration' stage of the framework, allowing for more nuanced, detailed visualizations that can adapt over time.Computational Papers: The emphasis on "semantic relationships between visual elements" in Bluefish is similar to how topics in computational papers like interval computations and geometric reasoning are closely interrelated. Both are efforts to capture and model complex systems.AI and Robotics: Bluefish could potentially be used to visualize complex 3D models and constraint-based systems in a more intuitive way, similar to Brooks' symbolic reasoning among 3-D models and Durrant-Whyte's uncertain geometry in robotics.Accessibility: Bluefish's prototype screen reader tool aligns with the inclusive participation goal of the problem-solving framework, enabling even visually impaired stakeholders to engage in the process.Word2Vec and Geometric Distance: The "relational scenegraph" in Bluefish could be used to visualize the multi-dimensional space where word vectors reside, offering an intuitive understanding of semantic relationships.Conceptual Blending: Bluefishâs relational scenegraph can represent complex relationships between different visual elements, providing a canvas for 'conceptual blending' where different domain-specific concepts can be integrated and visualized together.Tree of Thoughts and Graphs: Bluefishâs extended capabilities make it a candidate for representing complex thought structures like the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) or Graph of Thoughts in a visually intuitive and semantically meaningful way.In summary, Bluefish provides a flexible, adaptable graphical framework that can serve multiple disciplines and problem-solving approaches, making it a strong candidate for implementing and visualizing complex interdisciplinary projects.1 / 1A list of all of the topics we've discussed so far.1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly, here's a list of the topics we've discussed so far:Computational

Also, it has applications in accessibility, a dimension that can be important in problem-solving frameworks.Many of these topics intersect around the ideas of computational methods, symbolic reasoning, and problem-solving across multiple disciplines.1 / 1The conversation is called Improved Problem Solving Framework, could I get a final summary?1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly. The conversation titled "Improved Problem-Solving Framework" touched on various interconnected themes, including computational methods, cognitive theories, and data structuring, all under the umbrella of problem-solving. The discussion explored how advanced computational methods can enhance problem-solving in fields like landscape ecology. Cognitive theories like conceptual blending and Hofstadter's work offer a lens through which to understand complex problem-solving mechanisms. Data structures like Trees, Chains, and Graphs of Thoughts can serve as the scaffolding for computational problem-solving frameworks. Visualization methods, both in traditional graphics and extended through relational grammars like Bluefish, add another layer for enhanced understanding and accessibility. Overall, these elements could collectively contribute to creating a more robust, interdisciplinary, and efficient problem-solving framework across various domains.1 / 1The main points.1 / 1ChatGPTThe main points are:Computational Methods: Algorithms and frameworks for handling uncertainty and complex reasoning in problem-solving.Cognitive Theories: Understanding human-like problem-solving using conceptual blending and Hofstadter's work on analogies.Data Structuring: Trees, Chains, and Graphs of Thoughts that serve as foundational elements in computational problem-solving.Visualization: Using Grammars of Graphics and tools like Bluefish to make complex data more understandable and accessible.Interdisciplinary Approach: Combining these elements can lead to a more robust and efficient problem-solving framework across various fields.1 / 1Do you see how making up metaphors and scenarios for analogies can lead to a form of visualization?1 / 1ChatGPTAbsolutely. Metaphors and analogies can act as mental models that help us visualize complex concepts or processes. By framing one idea in terms of another, we essentially "see" it from a new angle, aiding both understanding and problem-solving. This is in line with the interdisciplinary approach, integrating cognitive theories and visualization techniques for improved problem-solving frameworks.1 / 1Some metaphors to illustrate these topics.1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly, here are some metaphors to help conceptualize the various topics we've discussed:Interval Computations: Think of interval computations as a "safety net" under a tightrope walker, providing a range where the answer could fall, instead of a single pinpointed spot.Symbolic Reasoning in AI: Imagine it as a "translator" in a foreign country, turning abstract 3-D models into 2-D images that the computer (or traveler) can understand.Constraint Propagation with Interval Labels: Consider this as "traffic lights" that guide the flow of possibilities, determining what can proceed and what must stop.Uncertain Geometry in Robotics: This could be likened to a "robotic cartographer" drawing maps in real-time while navigating an ever-changing environment.From Surfaces to Objects in Computer Vision: Picture this as the journey from "seeing the puzzle pieces" to "seeing the full picture."Solving Geometric Constraints: This is like "solving a Rubik's Cube" where each move has implications for the next.Geometric Reasoning for Computer Vision: Imagine it as the "director of photography" in a film, understanding how to frame and interpret a scene.Improved Problem-Solving Framework in Landscape Ecology: This could be thought of as a "master chef," balancing ingredients (data, risks, objectives) to create a sustainable recipe (landscape).Word2Vec and Force-Based Layouts: Picture this like "planets in a solar system," each word a celestial body drawn to or repelled by others based on similarity.Bluefish and Grammar of Graphics: Envision this as the "DNA of visualization," a flexible structure that can be tailored to represent various forms of data and relationships.These metaphors serve as "mini-visualizations" to make abstract or complex topics more relatable and understandable.1 / 1A final summary.1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly, the conversation titled "Improved Problem Solving Framework" spanned various topics, from interval computations and symbolic reasoning in AI to more applied frameworks in landscape ecology and advanced graphical representations like Bluefish. The underlying thread connecting these diverse subjects is the focus on problem-solving and representation of complex data or scenarios.In essence, we've explored how mathematical models, AI techniques, and interdisciplinary frameworks offer different "lenses" to tackle real-world problems. We also discussed how geometric distance in word2Vec or relational scenegraphs in Bluefish could revolutionize how we visualize and interact with data.The use of metaphors and analogies has served as a form of "mental visualization," allowing for easier grasping of these technical concepts. Whether it's managing uncertainties in robotics or evolving sustainable landscapes, the goal is to improve problem-solving through better models, frameworks, and visualization techniques.1 / 1What is the difference between the fundamental attribution error and the intentional stance?1 / 1ChatGPTThe Fundamental Attribution Error and the Intentional Stance are concepts from social psychology and philosophy of mind, respectively, and they address how people interpret and explain behavior, but they do so in different contexts.Fundamental Attribution Error: This is a cognitive bias in social psychology where people tend to overly attribute the behavior of others to internal characteristics like personality, beliefs, or intentions, rather than considering external factors or situations that might influence behavior. For example, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you might think they're a bad person, ignoring the possibility that they might be in an emergency.Intentional Stance: Proposed by philosopher Daniel Dennett, this concept is about the strategy we use to predict and explain behavior by treating entities (often humans but could be animals or even machines) as rational agents who harbor beliefs and desires. When adopting the intentional stance, we assume that an entity will act in a way that is consistent with its goals and beliefs, even if it's not actually conscious.While both concepts involve attributing intentions or characteristics to explain behavior, the Fundamental Attribution Error is generally considered a flaw in human judgment, whereas the Intentional Stance is seen as a useful, adaptive strategy for understanding behavior in a complex world.1 / 1They both seem similar to me as if they ascribe agency  but one of is accidental and the other on purpose. There are ambiguous cases such as when watching cartoons, reading literature, or interpreting thought experiments.1 / 1ChatGPTYes, you've highlighted an interesting overlap. Both the Fundamental Attribution Error and the Intentional Stance do involve ascribing agency or intentions to explain behavior. The key difference lies in the context and the evaluative judgment associated with each.Fundamental Attribution Error often occurs unconsciously and is generally considered a cognitive bias that leads to flawed judgments. It often fails to consider situational influences, leading to possibly unfair or inaccurate assessments.The Intentional Stance is a deliberate cognitive strategy, often used consciously, to interpret complex systems or entities as if they have agency, to better predict and understand their behavior.In ambiguous cases like cartoons, literature, or thought experiments, the lines can blur. People may deliberately adopt an Intentional Stance towards fictional characters to understand their motivations. At the same time, they may fall into the trap of Fundamental Attribution Error by overly attributing actions to characters' inherent traits, ignoring the constructed nature of these narratives.So, while both involve attributing agency, one is often a more deliberate, analytical tool, and the other is a cognitive shortcut that can lead to error.1 / 1Connections to the previous topics.1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly, let's tie this back to the previous topics:Improved Problem-Solving Framework in Landscape Ecology: Both the Fundamental Attribution Error and the Intentional Stance involve problem-solving in complex systems. Understanding the motivations behind stakeholders' actions can be critical in multi-step, iterative decision-making frameworks.Graphical Representations (GoG, Bluefish): Just as we use graphical models to represent data and phenomena, the Intentional Stance and the Fundamental Attribution Error are mental models we use to understand behavior.Visualization and Metaphors: Both the Intentional Stance and the Fundamental Attribution Error can be thought of as mental "visualizations" for interpreting the world. They could be metaphorically represented, aiding in their understanding much like a graph or a chart would for data.Surfaces and Essences by Hofstadter: This book delves into how we make analogies and categorizations, much like how we categorize behavior either through the lens of situational influences or inherent traits.Tree of Thoughts, Chain of Thoughts, etc.: These could be seen as mental constructs that help in making sense of complex scenarios, akin to adopting an Intentional Stance or falling into a Fundamental Attribution Error.Geometric Constraints and Computational Theory: In computational frameworks, being aware of the pitfalls of Fundamental Attribution Error or the utility of the Intentional Stance can lead to more robust algorithms for machine learning or AI understanding of human behavior.Word2Vec and Geometric Distance: In a conceptual space, the "distance" between adopting an Intentional Stance vs. falling for the Fundamental Attribution Error might be represented as geometrically closer or farther based on the contextual elements at play.So, all of these topics, in one way or another, connect to the human endeavor to model, understand, and solve problems in our complex world.1 / 1Another summary.1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly. The conversation revolves around "Improved Problem-Solving Frameworks" in various domains, ranging from landscape ecology to computer science and human cognition. Key elements include graphical representations for data visualization, different mental models for interpreting behavior, and the use of geometric distances in semantic spaces to quantify similarities or differences between topics. Whether it's solving complex ecological problems, understanding human behavior through the lens of Fundamental Attribution Error and Intentional Stance, or devising new computational techniques, each topic contributes to a multifaceted approach to problem-solving. They all share the core principle of using structured frameworks, whether mental or computational, to better understand and solve complex problems.1 / 1Connections with the following:

UNDERSTANDING 
THE BRAIN 
This leads to a fundamental 
point about any attempt to unders - 
tand the brain. It is a particularly 
acute case of the problems encounte - 
red in understanding anything. The 
nature of the attention one brings to 
bear on anything alters what one 
finds; what we aim to understand 
changes its nature with the context in 
which it lies; and we can only ever 
understand anything as a something.

There is no way round these 
problems 
â if they are problems. To 
attempt to detach oneself entirely is 
just to bring a special kind of attenti- 
on to bear which will have important 
consequences for what we find. Simi - 
larly we cannot see something without 
there being a context, even if the 
context appears to be that of âno 
contextâ, a thing ripped free of its 
moorings in the lived world. That is 
just a special, highly value-laden kind 
of context in itself, and it certainly al- 
ters what we find, too. Nor can we 
say that we do not see things as 
anything at all 
â that we just see 
them, full stop. There is always a 
model by which we are understan - 
ding, an exemplar with which we are 
comparing, what we see, and where it 
is not identified it usually means that 
we have tacitly adopted the model of 
the machine. 
Does that mean that all at- 
tempts to approach truth 
â other 
than to say everything has its truth in 
its own way 
â are doomed, that eve- 
ry version of reality has equal value? 
Certainly not. I will explore these is- 
sues later, as they are central to this 
book. That needs to wait until we 
have had a look at what the hemispheres actually âdoâ. 
Such considerations apply to 
the attempt to understand anything at 
all. But when we come to look at 
what we refer to as brain functions, 
there is a problem of a wholly diffe - 
rent order. We are not âjustâ looking 
at things in the world 
â a lump of 
rock, or even a person 
â but the 
processes whereby the world itself, to- 
gether with the rock or the person, 
might be brought into being for us at 
all, the very foundations of the fact of 
our experience, including any idea we 
might have about the nature of the 
world, and the nature of the brain, 
and even the idea that this is so. If it 
is true that attention changes the na - 
ture of what we find, how do we de - 
cide the most appropriate attention for 
that ? One that tries to ignore the in- 
wardness of experience? What pos - 
sible context is there in which to pla - 
ce the foundations of experience of all
contexts whatever? And what kind of 
a thing are we to see it âasâ? The an- 
swer is far from obvious, but in the 
absence of an attempt to address the 
question we do not give no answer. 
We answer with the model we under - 
stand 
â the only kind of thing we 
can ever fully understand, for the 
simple reason that we made it: the 
machine. We cannot look at the world 
coming into being within the brain, 
without that qualifying the world in 
which the brain itself exists; our un - 
derstanding of the brainâs ways of un - 
derstanding alters our understanding 
of the brain itself 
â the process is 
not unidirectional, but reciprocal. If it 
turns out that the hemispheres have 
different ways of construing the world, 
this is not just an interesting fact abo - 
ut an efficient information-processing 
system; it tells us something about 
the nature of reality, about the nature 
of our experience of the world, and 
needs to be allowed to qualify our 
understanding of the brain as well.

From the master and his emissary.1 / 1ChatGPTThe excerpt from "The Master and His Emissary" delves into the complexity of understanding the brain, and by extension, any complex system. It discusses how the lens through which we look at something shapes what we ultimately see or understand. This echoes many of the topics we've covered in our conversation about "Improved Problem-Solving Frameworks".Context and Perspective: Just as the "landscape of problems" concept in ecology underlines the importance of context and scale, the excerpt argues that the kind of attention and context we bring to studying the brain (or anything else) will inevitably shape our findings.Mental Models: Similarly to our discussion on the "fundamental attribution error" and the "intentional stance," the excerpt argues that we always employ some sort of model or framework to understand what we're looking at. These models influence not just what we see, but how we interpret it.Complexity and Foundations: Like the issue of semantic spaces in computer science and cognition, understanding the brain presents a 'meta-problem': you're not just analyzing a system, but the system that allows all other systems to be understood.Interconnected Understanding: The idea that our frameworks for understanding are inherently reciprocal aligns with our discussion of geometric distances in semantic spaces and Bluefish's relational scenegraphs. What you understand influences how you understand other things, in a complex, interconnected web.In summary, the ideas in the excerpt provide a philosophical underpinning that connects well with the more specific topics we've discussed. They all hint at the complexity and reflexive nature of any attempt to deeply understand systems, whether they are ecological landscapes, human behaviors, or computational models.1 / 1Hence the brain has to at- 
tend to the world in two completely 
different ways, and in so doing to 
bring two different worlds into being. 
In the one, we experience 
â the live, 
complex, embodied, world of indivi - 
dual, always unique beings, forever in 
flux, a net of interdependencies, for- 
ming and reforming wholes, a world 
with which we are deeply connected. 
In the other we âexperienceâ our ex- 
perience in a special way: a âre-pre - 
sentedâ version of it, containing now 
static, separable, bounded, but essen- 
tially fragmented entities, grouped into 
classes, on which predictions can be 
based. This kind of attention isolates, 
fixes and makes each thing explicit by 
bringing it under the spotlight of at - 
tention. In doing so it renders things 
inert, mechanical, lifeless. But it also 
enables us for the first time to know, 
and consequently to learn and to ma- 
ke things. This gives us power. 
These two aspects of the 
world are not symmetrically opposed. 
They are not equivalent, for example, 
to the âsubjectiveâ and âobjectiveâ po - 
ints of view, concepts which are themselves a product of, and already 
reflect, one particular way of being in 
the world 
â which in fact, important - 
ly, already reflect a âviewâ of the 
world. The distinction I am trying to 
make is between, on the one hand, 
the way in which we experience the 
world pre-reflectively, before we have 
had a chance to âviewâ it at all, or di - 
vide it up into bits 
â a world in 
which what later has come to be tho - 
ught of as subjective and objective 
are held in a suspension which emb - 
races each potential âpoleâ, and their 
togetherness, together; and, on the 
other hand, the world we are more 
used to thinking of, in which subjecti - 
ve and objective appear as separate 
poles. At its simplest, a world where 
there is âbetweennessâ, and one where 
there is not. These are not different 
ways of thinking about the world: 
they are different ways of being in 
the world. And their difference is not 
symmetrical, but fundamentally asym - 
metrical.1 / 1ChatGPTThe excerpt presents a dualistic approach to how the brain attends to and constructs reality, and it also alludes to the inherent asymmetry between these two modes of engagement. Here's how this ties into our earlier discussion on "Improved Problem-Solving Frameworks":Two Different Realities: The first mode emphasizes a rich, interconnected world where everything is in flux and deeply connected, mirroring our discussions on ecological landscapes and semantic spaces. The second mode is a re-presented, fragmented, and static view of the world, analogous to traditional problem-solving frameworks that may simplify complex issues into manageable parts.Asymmetry: The text stresses that these two modes are not symmetrically opposed but rather fundamentally asymmetric, which recalls our talk about how some frameworks or perspectives can be more dominant or influential than others.Pre-reflective vs. Reflective Experience: This mirrors our discussion on the "fundamental attribution error" and the "intentional stance," where one form of interpretation might be more intuitive and immediate (pre-reflective), while the other requires a form of 'step-back' cognitive processing (reflective).Power and Limitations: The second mode, although limiting in its mechanical, lifeless representation, gives us the power to 'know' and manipulate our world. This echoes the power and limitations of computational models like Bluefish, which extend our capabilities to represent complex systems while inherently limiting them due to the nature of abstraction.Subjective vs. Objective: The excerpt argues that the dichotomy itself is a construct that reflects a certain way of being in the world. This resonates with our discussion on context-dependence and how our perception and problem-solving frameworks shape the 'reality' we interact with.The themes of duality, asymmetry, and the inherent limitations and powers of different modes of understanding coalesce well with the diverse range of topics we've explored. They underline the need for flexible, multi-faceted frameworks that can adapt to the complex, ever-changing problems we face.1 / 1I was thinking about The 
nature of the attention one brings to 
bear on anything alters what one 
finds; what we aim to understand 
changes its nature with the context in 
which it lies; and we can only ever 
understand anything as a something.1 / 1ChatGPTThe idea that the nature of attention we apply changes what we find is deeply aligned with our discussion of problem-solving frameworks and understanding. It suggests that how we approach a problem (the framework, the assumptions, the specific focus) inherently affects the solutions and understandings we'll generate.For instance, in the "Tree of Thoughts" framework, the structure of the tree could influence how we interpret and solve a problem. Similarly, in the computational model like Bluefish, the way we configure its grammar will affect the kind of visualizations and hence interpretations we can make.It also ties back to the intentional stance and the fundamental attribution error. These psychological concepts point to the idea that how we aim to understand something, like attributing agency or causality, shifts our perception of it.In summary, the attention, focus, and framework we bring to bear on a problem don't just solve the problem; they also shape what the problem 'is' in the first place. This underscores the importance of having flexible, comprehensive frameworks for understanding and problem-solving.1 / 1A list of all of the topics we've discussed.1 / 1ChatGPTCertainly, here is a list of topics we've discussed:Problem-Solving FrameworksTree of Thoughts (ToT)Chain of ThoughtsGraph of ThoughtsGrammar of GraphicsBlender Object Scene LayoutsBluefish: A Relational Grammar of GraphicsFundamental Attribution ErrorIntentional StanceThe Nature of Attention and its Effect on PerceptionUnderstanding the Brain and Reality (from "The Master and His Emissary")These topics have woven together to explore the nuances of problem-solving, understanding, and perception. We've discussed how different frameworks and models can influence the way we understand problems and find solutions. We've also delved into psychological and neurological considerations that shape our perception and understanding of the world.1 / 1A final quote1 / 1ChatGPT"In the end, we are our choices. Build yourself a great story." - Jeff BezosThis quote encapsulates the essence of our discussion on problem-solving, understanding, and perception. The frameworks we choose and the attention we give shape the story of our understanding and reality.1 / 1ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.
