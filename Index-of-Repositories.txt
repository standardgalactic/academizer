This Application also provides support to a variety of artists to showcase their art to the audience by adding their newly sung/composed songs for our users and earn. The filmmakers also have the option to upload all the songs of their films. The songs can be rated by the users and also added to the list of favorite songs for the users. A user logs into the Application with LoginID and Password. He/she is also given the option of availing for a subscription and upgrade to a premium user, if a normal user. The Application also supports additional benefits like display of lyrics and image along with the song being played.

The previous works conduct object detection and tracking with two separate models so they are very slow. In contrast, we propose a one-stage solution which does detection and tracking with a single network by elegantly solving the alignment problem. The resulting approach achieves groundbreaking results in terms of both accuracy and speed: (1) it ranks first among all the trackers on the MOT challenges; (2) it is significantly faster than the previous state-of-the-arts. In addition, it scales gracefully to handle a large number of objects.

The aim of this project is introduce an Ising model and investigate the properties of a two dimensional ferromagnet with respect to its magnetization and energy at varying temperatures. The observable are evaluated as an application of Monte Carlo techniques. Key background is given about the relevance and effectiveness of this stochastic approach and in particular the applicability of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in FORTRAN programming language.

MSMARCO-Conversational-Search
	Truly Conversational Search is the next logic step in the journey to generate intelligent and useful AI. To understand what this may mean, researchers have voiced a continuous desire to study how people currently converse with search engines. Traditionally, the desire to produce such a comprehensive dataset has been limited because those who have this data (Search Engines) have a responsibility to their users to maintain their privacy and cannot share the data publicly in a way that upholds the trusts users have in the Search Engines. Given these two powerful forces we believe we have a dataset and paradigm that meets both sets of needs: A artificial public dataset that approximates the true data and an ability to evaluate model performance on the real user behavior. What this means is we released a public dataset which is generated by creating artificial sessions using embedding similarity and will test on the original data. To say this again: we are not releasing any private user data but are releasing what we believe to be a good representation of true user interactions.

OpenKP
	Automatically extracting keyphrases that are salient to the document meanings is an essential step to semantic document understanding. An effective keyphrase extraction (KPE) system can benefit a wide range of natural language processing and information retrieval tasks. Recent neural methods formulate the task as a document-to-keyphrase sequence-to-sequence task. These seq2seq learning models have shown promising results compared to previous KPE systems The recent progress in neural KPE is mostly observed in documents originating from the scientific domain. In real-world scenarios, most potential applications of KPE deal with diverse documents originating from sparse sources. These documents are unlikely to include the structure, prose and be as well written as scientific papers. They often include a much diverse document structure and reside in various domains whose contents target much wider audiences than scientists. To encourage the research community to develop a powerful neural model with key phrase extraction on open domains we have created OpenKP: a dataset of over 150,000 documents with the most relevant keyphrases generated by expert annotation.
