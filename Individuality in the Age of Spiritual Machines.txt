âYou have to start romanticizing your life,â a voiceover on TikTok commands. âYou have to start thinking about yourself as the main character.â The brief video, uploaded last May, is shot by drone: A slowly tilting birdâs-eye view descends toward a white woman surrounded by several friends chattering on the cusp of the frame. A harp arpeggio plays. âBecause if you donât, life will continue to pass you by,â the voice continues. âAnd all the little things that make it so beautiful will continue to go unnoticed. So take a second and look around and realize that it is a blessing for you to be here right now.â Eyes obscured by sunglasses, the woman assumes the role of a perfectly blank character on which viewers can project themselves.

Main character energy is not a matter of being âindividualisticâ or singular but rather of being extremely legible

This is just one of the countless videos uploaded on TikTok since the pandemic began last year that emphasize embracing a certain âmain character energy.â The memeâs viral path can be tracked: In May, @lexaprolesbian uploaded a lip-synced music video about going on a walk at the same time every day to prove that they were âthe main characterâ to neighbors â as the lyrics put it: âLook at me â no, look away â no, please: look at meâ¦!â The next day, @laurenisoversharing reformatted that idea as a more embodied, comic gesture: a stationary camera frames her savoring a beverage, a caption describing the cinematic trope she performs: âDrinking out of a wine glass & looking over the balcony so everyone on the beach knows Iâm the main character.â Two days later, @the.quenchiest republished @lexaprolesbianâs original audio with new video, inserting her own life into the narrative described. The meme soon had a life of its own.

From the mass of these memes, a supercut of main-character-ness emerges: Main characters have an impeccable magnetism to them. Theyâre creative. They donât play by the rules. Theyâre a little ugly but in a hot way. Theyâre full of themselves but humble at the right moments. Theyâre self-aware but unanxious. Theyâre not perfect, but if they stumble, a lesson is learned. Perhaps foremost, a main character emerges as someone who can pull off the paradoxical feat of conveying interiority in a world of surfaces. Main character energy is not a matter of being âindividualisticâ or singular but rather a matter of being extremely legible.

Part of the appeal of the âmain character energyâ meme lies in its tapping quiet moments of IRL self-assertion that have been lost to the pandemic. The meme inverts the âEveryday, I put on my silly little outfit and do my silly little tasksâ energy of Sisyphean persistence during the pandemic into something that invokes an audience as witness. It reasserts the performing self â the self that feels most familiar and most valid â within conditions that may seem to circumscribe it.

The pandemic may have helped launch this meme, but the idea of living life as though it were a movie emerged long before social media assumed its current form. It has been co-extensive with cinemaâs self-mythologization. The 1973 film Badlands illustrates this, for instance, when the protagonist (Martin Sheen) is visibly delighted when heâs described as the spitting image of 1950s tragic heartthrob James Dean. These sorts of depicted relationships within films help structure the possibilities of flattering people with comparisons to movie stars; labeling someone a Marilyn Monroe type becomes a self-explanatory compliment.

That is to say, as cinema developed, the mythic relationship with individual stars was slowly displaced by a relationship with cinema itself. One of the pivotal moments in the 1991 film Sleepless in Seattle comes when the protagonist (Meg Ryan) and her support (Rosie OâDonnell) watch the 1957 melodrama An Affair to Remember: âThatâs your problem,â OâDonnell chastises Ryan. âYou donât want to be in love, you want to be in love in a movie.â The message â that life is not a movie â is left unspoken, but of course, it is also immediately negated by the fact that we witness the exchange occur in a movie. The actual message is more that we have learned how to be in movies from watching them, better than we know how to be in everyday life. As a result, we are driven to reshape life to assume cinematic form.

Cinematic depictions of the falseness of living life as a movie immediately imply the opposite: that movies can show us how not to be like movies and be real people, true main characters. They strengthen the idea that cinema supplies the platonic form of subjectivity by seeming to undermine it. The 1999 comedy Bowfinger offers an explicit version of this paradox: Eddie Murphy plays Jiff, a look-alike nonactor who has been recruited to star in an action film because the production canât afford his brother Kit, a real star also played by Eddie Murphy, a real star in real life. (At one point, Jiff explains that heâs never been on camera but is âan active renter at Blockbuster.â) Murphyâs contrasting roles collapse the dichotomy of spectator and main character, as he plays each becoming the other.

Labeling someone a Marilyn Monroe type becomes a self-explanatory compliment. As cinema developed, the mythic relationship with individual stars was slowly displaced by a relationship with cinema itself

The gradual subsumption of life by cinema perhaps culminates in the situation recounted in the 2015 documentary The Wolfpack, which tells of seven isolated, homeschooled siblings who were introduced to the world almost entirely through movies. Such an introduction revolves not around absorbing information or historical data but, rather, the conventions by which cinema establishes a way of seeing and a way of being seen.

Pop music has also documented this relation of cinema to life over the past half-century or so. The Shirellesâ 1965 track âShh! Iâm Watching the Movieâ eventually gives way to the 2009 Ashley Tisdale track âIf My Life Was A Movie,â which becomes a repeated motif in hip-hop: âLife Is a Movieâ by Mr. Marcelo/Curren$y in 2010, âMy Life a Movieâ by Lilâ Mouse in 2013, and âMy Life a Movieâ by Vory in 2016. In 2019, Lil Nas Xâs hit âOld Town Roadâ features the sentiment again: âMy life is a movie / Bull riding and boobies / Cowboy hat from Gucci / âWranglerâ on my booty.â

While many recent pop-music depictions of main character energy draw on action films and ideas of speed, magnetism, and wealth, the dominant TikTok versions draw on conventions that comply with the constraints of the pandemic, presenting simple vignettes such as âwalking around the neighborhood at 1:15 everyday,â âdriving through the rich neighborhood [blasting obscure indie music]â, and âsitting on a windy hilltop staring at birds dramatically.â These brief scenes distill quieter cinematic moments more closely associated with the minor aesthetic categories of âwhimsicalâ and âdeepâ that nonetheless serve to frame the main character and set them apart. TikTok users playing with the idea of âmain character energyâ are not identifying with individual actors or larger-than-life roles but rather with the materiality of cinema itself. They absorb its logic and distill it down.

Through a refinement of genre and other formal conventions â framing devices, non-diegetic sound, and continuity editing methods â cinema constructs an image of a subjectivity for its protagonists that is exteriorized yet private. It shows what interiority is supposed to look like from the outside. Associated with this is a specific structure of feeling thatâs distinct from those constituted by other media: In the novel, subjectivity is presented as an interior monologue; theater grounds it in communal practice and builds the conventions of subjectivity around the gradient between spectator and stage. But watching movies invites a different kind of identification. Its rendition of subjectivity is structured not in language or community but in a vicarious projection into a âmain characterâ who is centered by the cameraâs focus. It is an identification not with any characterâs traits but with a set of cinematic techniques, insofar as they can be applied to you, as though you were being filmed wherever you go. The world is not a stage (as per the Shakespearean clichÃ©) but rather âon location.â

In the early 1990s, media theorist Jonathan Beller proposed the notion of âthe cinematic mode of production,â building on the idea that the gesture of âpaying attentionâ is a value-productive activity: Cinemas are factories where spectator-workers assemble film stills into coherent scenes at a rate of twenty-four frames per second. What emerges from that systematized mass viewership is the cinematic lexicon of legible emotionality, which serves as a visual language that can be exploited in advertising and deployed in other forms of manipulation. But equally important is the cinematic form of subjectivity articulated by that lexicon. Spectators learn to use certain procedures for meaning-making by looking; then, the familiar sense of âGod, I feel like Iâm in a movieâ becomes a measure of this processâs success. We feel more real, our lives have more meaning, when we can assimilate them to cinematic convention.

Cinema shows what interiority is supposed to look like from the outside

With social media, these conventions have become means of extraction: Users can adopt jump cuts, genre play, over-the-shoulder camera placements and the like to transform their lived experience into a recognizable form of cultural capital, an awareness of the legible formulas for conveying personal importance. The techniques turn heterogeneous experience into a familiar on-screen commodity, meant to spur envy and further mimesis. âDancing in the rain,â âplaying with sparklers on the roof,â and âthoughtfully looking over the landscapeâ become just a few familiar cinematic tropes to channel. These tropes are blank but effective, easily abstractable from any narrative: They indicate who among an ensemble cast is most central, whose time frame is governing the overall experience, whose space is the ground reality. Reflected back into everyday life, such âmain character energyâ becomes a means of measuring the anxiety brought on by not feeling like the subject of your own life by default. To treat that anxiety, one must perform the visible signs of interiority oneself and have them confirmed by others. Social media platforms are well positioned for that; in that sense, they draft on the cinematic production of value to establish their own.

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe essay "Home, Real Life, Main Character Energy, Interiority in a world of screens" by Coco Klockner discusses the cultural phenomenon of "main character energy." This trend, particularly visible on TikTok during the pandemic, emphasizes embracing life as if one is the protagonist in a movie.The meme represents the paradoxical feat of conveying interiority in a world of surfaces and encourages people to assume the role of the main character, where being legible is more essential than being individualistic. It also draws on quiet moments of real-life self-assertion, lost during the pandemic, and inverts the monotony of daily life into something with an audience as witness.The author traces the idea of living life as though it were a movie back to early cinematic depictions and explains how cinema has gradually influenced life, reflecting in pop music, and films like "Badlands" and "Bowfinger." The essay connects this to media theory and the notion of "the cinematic mode of production," where paying attention becomes a value-productive activity, and cinema constructs a legible image of subjectivity for its protagonists.Finally, with social media, these conventions become a means of extracting cultural capital. People use cinematic techniques to transform lived experience into recognizable forms, thereby reflecting back into everyday life, a sense of main character energy, and managing anxiety about not feeling like the subject of one's own life. Social media platforms utilize the cinematic production of value to establish their own, showing how deep the integration of cinema and everyday life has become.1 / 1Each of the formulas and stylized self-presentations suggest how the cinematic condition has extended well beyond metaphor. We are not merely the star of the movie in our minds; rather we are forced to continually assert ourselves as the main character for one another in our feeds. One can no longer be socially present without taking on these cinematic forms of self presentation, which have become the default mode of being, the overriding âpresentation of self in everyday lifeâ (to borrow Erving Goffmanâs term) that structures all the others. To sustain that cinematic logic as a zero-degree phenomenology, we must maintain a project of mental cinematography and sound design, inhabiting a 24/7 forever-office production house.

Subtle gestures of asserting main-character energy also serve to stave off its opposite condition: the non-playable character. Regularly abbreviated as NPC, the non-playable character has become a familiar signifier for the automaton, the AI-controlled robot with eyes glazed over to indicate that there is no âinside,â no interiority or self-consciousness. The term originated in tabletop role-playing games from the 1970s and â80s, like Dungeons and Dragons, and moved to video games, where it applies to the occasional quest givers and AI friendlies that drive forward a gameâs smaller plot points. They are coded simply, with just a few canned responses to express themselves. Today, the term NPC often circulates as an insult, especially among fascists who use it to dehumanize their targets.

One of the more widely circulated visual representations of an NPC is in the Wojak meme (a.k.a. âFeels Guyâ). Wojak is usually depicted as a low-key main character â a sympathetic subject dealing melancholically with the pains of the world. With a few key alterations, he becomes the NPC variant: an abstracted face flattens his emotions; black, beady eyes replace his weary, reflective ones; and his utterances are replaced by canned, absolutist outbursts. Other NPCs reach toward his shoulder and comfort him, a unified community of drones.

Counterpoised with main character energy, NPCs point to a broader tension regarding interiority in general. If we are constantly performing the self to the ubiquitous and persistent audiences that social media platforms provide, then interiority is no longer central to selfhood and no longer assumed in the same way. Instead, our performances establish ourselves for others, and how those performances are received conveys a sense of selfhood back to us. That brings main character energy perilously close to NPC-hood. To be without visible main character energy is to be indistinguishable from the walking automaton.

The cinematic logic of âmain character energyâ is ultimately revealed as the dominant emotional framework for what meaningful life looks like. In a video uploaded in June, @themanuelsantos describes one aspect of this double-edged dynamic: âSometimes, I wonder if those people who like to stare at you in the street, or go âchchchchchchâ to their friends, realize that they are just further emphasizing the narrative that I am the main character. I mean, why are you even speaking about me? But also, if you are walking in the street and thereâs literally no one looking at you or staring at you, what are you even doing? What are you even serving? Are you even someone? How are you walking? Do you even exist? Personally, I like the attention.â

In this amazing monologue, @themanuelsantos illustrates the labor necessary to maintain a sense of self, now understood fully in the competitive terms of being a âmain character.â It is not an abstraction but is shaped by very concrete norms that carry punitive consequences if defied. Pointing to those norms perhaps makes some invisible labor more visible and reveals the ways performance both creates and forecloses on the thing that it signals.

The seemingly all-encompassing nature of cinematic self-structuring, of main character energy, thus reveals something alluring about the nullity of the NPC. When our interiorities are so thoroughly excavated for extraction, qualitatively and quantitatively, a sublime quality to the NPC ontology emerges. We might make a case for the opacity of the NPC as a subject position that, beyond its nullity, affords legitimate leisure, a position from which interiorities are not regularly excavated and from which self-referential performances are not demanded. The real story is elsewhere. Perhaps the real cinematic role models are not the main characters but the blank screen before the title cards and after the credits roll.

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIt seems like you've shared a thorough analysis of how the cinematic concept has permeated our self-understanding, specifically in relation to the digital age and the rise of social media. This passage explores how individuals must constantly perform and present themselves as the "main character" in their lives, contrasting this with the NPC (non-playable character) as an undesirable, robotic alternative.The concepts of "main character energy" and the NPC are symbolic of a broader struggle with selfhood, interiority, and authenticity in an age where personal identity is increasingly mediated and shaped by online interactions.Would you like more information on a specific aspect of this text, or do you have any specific questions?1 / 1Do you know the book Infomocracy?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, "Infomocracy" is a science fiction novel written by Malka Older. It was published in 2016 and is the first book in the Centenal Cycle series. The story is set in a future world where a powerful search engine company, Information, oversees a new form of global governance. In this world, governments compete in a system of micro-democracy where each group of 100,000 citizens (called a centenal) can choose their own government.The plot follows various characters as they navigate the political landscape during an election season, uncovering corruption, conspiracy, and the complexities of information control in a world where data is power."Infomocracy" examines themes of democracy, information manipulation, technology's role in governance, and the influence of corporations in political systems. It's a thought-provoking novel that resonates with the current discussions around data privacy, tech monopolies, and the potential for technology to both empower and manipulate citizens.Is there something specific you'd like to know about the book or its themes?1 / 1Connections to the topics we just discussed and to the concept of intersubjectivity collapse.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe excerpt you provided earlier delves into the concepts of cinematic self-presentation, main character energy, and the tension between being a main character and an NPC (non-playable character). It also explores how social media platforms shape selfhood and the performance of the self."Infomocracy" by Malka Older engages with some similar themes, particularly around how technology shapes our understanding of self, community, and governance. Here are some connections that can be drawn:The Performance of Self: Just as the excerpt discusses the constant need to assert oneself as the main character in the context of social media, "Infomocracy" highlights how individuals and governments must constantly perform and brand themselves in a highly competitive, global micro-democracy.The Role of Technology: Both the excerpt and "Infomocracy" explore how technology shapes human behavior, social interactions, and understanding of self. In "Infomocracy," technology is central to governance, while the excerpt delves into how cinematic forms of self-presentation have become a default mode of being.Interiority and Exteriority: The tension between the main character and the NPC highlights issues of interiority and exteriority, which also appear in "Infomocracy." The novel explores how individuals are defined and understood through data and information, potentially leading to a collapse of genuine interiority.Intersubjectivity Collapse: Intersubjectivity refers to shared understanding between individuals. The competition and performance-driven nature of both social media platforms (as described in the excerpt) and the micro-democracy in "Infomocracy" can lead to a collapse of genuine human connection and understanding. When everything becomes a performance, true empathy and connection may be lost, and interactions become transactional.Control and Manipulation: Both texts highlight how technology and media can be used to control and manipulate individuals. "Infomocracy" shows how information can be wielded as power, while the excerpt reveals how social norms and expectations create pressure to conform to certain presentations of self.The concept of intersubjectivity collapse and the examination of self-presentation in the excerpt resonate with themes in "Infomocracy," where the very structure of government and society hinges on data and performance. Both texts prompt readers to reflect on the authenticity of human connection and the self in an increasingly mediated and competitive world.1 / 1Connections to the book Technopoly1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! "Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology" by Neil Postman explores the effects of technology on culture and society, particularly the unbridled embrace of technology without considering its underlying philosophy or potential consequences. There are several thematic connections between the content of the excerpt you provided and "Technopoly":Technology's Influence on Selfhood: Both the excerpt and "Technopoly" discuss how technology shapes the way people perceive themselves. In "Technopoly," Postman argues that technology redefines human values and the way we see the world, while the excerpt explores how cinematic and digital platforms affect self-presentation.Dehumanization: The concept of the non-playable character (NPC) in the excerpt resonates with Postman's concerns about dehumanization through technology. Postman sees technology as reducing complex human experiences into quantifiable metrics, much like the NPC is reduced to a few canned responses.Performance and Authenticity: Both texts touch on the idea of performance in a technologically mediated world. In "Technopoly," Postman worries about the loss of authentic human connections due to the dominance of technology, similar to how the excerpt describes the performative nature of self-presentation on social media platforms.The Dominance of Technology: The excerpt describes how cinematic self-presentation has become the "default mode of being." Similarly, Postman argues in "Technopoly" that technology has become a central and dominant force in our culture, influencing every aspect of life.Opacity and Resistance: The alluring nullity of the NPC described in the excerpt might resonate with Postman's call for critical thinking and resistance to the totalizing narrative of technology. The blank screen's leisure and opacity could symbolize a space where one is not entirely consumed by technology's demands.Interiority and Exteriority: The tension between inside and outside, real and performed, is central to both texts. Postman discusses how technology externalizes our understanding of ourselves, while the excerpt explores the tension between being a main character and an NPC.Social Consequences: Both the excerpt and "Technopoly" look at the social consequences of technology, whether it's the way it shapes individual self-presentation or the broader effects on culture and values.In essence, "Technopoly" offers a critical perspective on the unthinking embrace of technology, much like the excerpt's analysis of how cinematic logic has permeated everyday self-presentation. Both texts explore the complex interplay between technology, culture, selfhood, and human connection, warning of potential pitfalls while also probing the nuanced ways technology shapes human existence.1 / 1Connections to Ayn Rand and Adler.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! The excerpt you provided and the themes within can be connected to the philosophies of Ayn Rand and Alfred Adler in various ways:Ayn Rand:Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism emphasizes the individual, rational self-interest, and personal freedom. Here's how it connects:Individualism: The concept of asserting oneself as the "main character" resonates with Rand's focus on the individual's importance. Objectivism emphasizes personal achievement and self-realization, akin to the "main character energy" described in the excerpt.Self-Interest: The labor necessary to maintain oneself as the "main character" can be seen as a form of rational self-interest, which is a key concept in Rand's philosophy. The focus on one's appearance or performance for others, as described in the excerpt, aligns with her view of self-interest as a moral imperative.Contrast with NPCs: The dehumanization and conformity associated with the NPCs could be seen as antithetical to Rand's emphasis on individual thought, creativity, and resistance to collectivism.Alfred Adler:Adler's psychological theories often focus on feelings of inferiority and the striving for superiority, along with social connectedness. Connections include:Striving for Superiority: The drive to assert oneself as the main character in the context of social media and contemporary culture might be viewed through Adler's lens of striving for superiority. It's a way to stand out and assert dominance or significance within a social context.Social Interest: Adler believed in the importance of social interest, or the feeling of belonging and contributing to the greater community. The tension between main character energy and NPC-hood in the excerpt might be seen as a tension between the need for individual distinction and a connection to the social fabric.Inferiority Complex: The fear of becoming an NPC, or the dehumanized automaton, might be viewed in terms of Adler's concept of an inferiority complex. The struggle to maintain main character status could be seen as a reaction to underlying feelings of inadequacy or inferiority.Performative Self: The construction and presentation of the self in the excerpt have parallels to Adler's understanding of the self as socially constructed. The way people assert their main character energy reflects their striving to overcome feelings of inferiority and achieve a sense of superiority.In summary, the themes within the excerpt resonate with Ayn Rand's philosophy by emphasizing individualism, self-interest, and resistance to conformity. In contrast, they align with Adler's psychological theories through the exploration of striving for superiority, social interest, feelings of inferiority, and the socially constructed nature of self. Both connections provide rich ground for understanding the complex dynamics of self-presentation and identity in a technological and cinematic culture.1 / 1A list of all of the topics we've discussed.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's a summary of the topics we've discussed:Cinematic Condition: The idea of people as main characters in their own lives, reflecting a trend in social media and online self-presentation.Main Character Energy and NPCs: A discussion of the contrast between the assertive, self-centered main character energy and the dehumanized non-playable character (NPC) in modern culture, particularly in memes like Wojak.Interiority and Performance of Self: The notion that selfhood is increasingly performed for others, leading to a tension between interiority and exterior presentation. This also ties to Erving Goffman's concept of "presentation of self in everyday life."Connection to Ayn Rand's Objectivism: The relationship between the excerpt's themes and Ayn Rand's philosophy, focusing on individualism, rational self-interest, and resistance to conformity.Connection to Alfred Adler's Psychological Theories: An exploration of the excerpt in relation to Alfred Adler's concepts of striving for superiority, social interest, inferiority complex, and the socially constructed nature of self.Inquiries about Specific Books: Questions were asked about the connections to the books "Infomocracy" and "Technopoly," but detailed discussions of these connections were not provided in the chat.Author Information: Mention of Coco Klockner, an artist and writer based in New York.These topics weave together to form a complex discussion of contemporary culture, identity, self-presentation, and the influence of technology on our understanding of self and society.1 / 1I am also curious about connections to The Technological Society by Ellul1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT"The Technological Society" by Jacques Ellul offers a critical look at the way technology has become a dominant force in shaping modern society. It's an in-depth examination of the ways technology influences not just our practical lives but our values, thinking, and social structures.Here's how it might connect to the topics we've been discussing:Cinematic Self-Presentation: Ellul argues that technology shapes the way we think and act. The cinematic condition and self-presentation online can be seen as a product of technological development, where individuals curate and perform their identities in ways aligned with the technological tools they're using.Main Character Energy and NPCs: The way individuals are classified as either protagonists or automatons (NPCs) in the social narrative might also reflect Ellul's concerns about technology's dehumanizing effects. Technology can reduce complex human beings to simplistic roles and stereotypes.Interiority and Performance of Self: Ellul's insights into how technology can shape our values and behaviors resonate with the notion that our inner selves are increasingly performed and externalized. The way we present ourselves online is heavily influenced by the platforms and tools we use, reflecting Ellul's idea that technology shapes human action and thought.Social Control and Conformity: Ellul discusses how technology can be a tool for social control and conformity. The demands for presenting oneself in certain ways online, conforming to specific norms or standards, tie into this idea. The NPC, in this context, may symbolize a person who has succumbed to the conformity demanded by the technological society.The connections here are broad and thematic, and they relate to the overarching concern with how technology not only serves human needs but actively shapes human thoughts, values, and behaviors. Ellul's work provides a theoretical framework that can be applied to understand various contemporary phenomena, including the ones discussed in our conversation.1 / 1Isn't self-curation inevitable?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, self-curation can be seen as inevitable, particularly in a society where personal identity is closely tied to public perception and social media platforms. Here's why:Social Expectations: People have always curated their self-presentation to some extent, based on social norms, cultural expectations, and personal desires. The ways we dress, speak, and behave in different contexts are forms of self-curation tailored to fit various social situations.Technological Amplification: With the advent of social media and online platforms, this self-curation has become more pronounced. People have the tools to meticulously control how they are seen by others, editing and filtering their online presence to present a certain image.Professional and Personal Branding: In a world where personal branding can have a significant impact on professional opportunities and social status, there is a clear incentive to carefully curate how one appears to others. This might include presenting oneself in ways that align with certain ideologies, lifestyles, or social groups.Human Nature: It's natural for humans to want to be seen in a positive light and to control how others perceive them. Self-curation could be seen as an extension of this natural desire to be accepted and respected by peers.The Influence of Platforms: Social media platforms themselves encourage a certain level of self-curation by providing tools and incentives for people to present themselves in specific ways. The design of these platforms and the algorithms that drive them can shape what is considered desirable or acceptable, guiding users in how they curate their online selves.However, some critics argue that while self-curation may be inevitable to some extent, the level and nature of self-curation today, driven by technology and commercial interests, may be leading to inauthenticity, conformity, and a loss of true individuality.In the context of "The Technological Society" by Jacques Ellul, self-curation can be seen as a manifestation of the ways technology shapes human behavior and values. It's a complex issue with many facets, reflecting both age-old human behaviors and new challenges posed by our modern technological landscape.1 / 1Connections to the books the courage to be disliked and the courage to be happy1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe books "The Courage to Be Disliked" and "The Courage to Be Happy" are based on the principles of Adlerian psychology. They discuss personal development and the pursuit of happiness through dialogue and philosophical ideas, often challenging conventional wisdom.Here are some connections between the concepts explored in those books and the themes of self-curation, interiority, and main character energy:Individualism and Community: While self-curation emphasizes creating an image for external validation, the teachings in "The Courage to Be Disliked" and "The Courage to Be Happy" stress the importance of self-acceptance and individual determination. They suggest that real happiness comes from internal validation rather than external appraisal.Interpersonal Relationships: Both sets of concepts touch on how we interact with others. Self-curation often leads to presenting an idealized self to others, which can lead to a lack of genuine connection. In contrast, Adler's philosophy encourages authentic relationships based on equality and mutual respect.Freedom and Responsibility: The Adlerian principles explored in these books emphasize the freedom to define oneself and the responsibility to make choices that lead to personal growth and happiness. This contrasts with the concept of being driven by societal expectations or technological influences to curate an acceptable self-image.Self-Acceptance: "The Courage to Be Disliked" encourages readers to accept themselves as they are and not be swayed by how others perceive them. This contrasts sharply with the notion of self-curation, where individuals may be continually striving to meet external expectations or ideals, often at the expense of true self-awareness and acceptance.Purpose and Contribution: The books stress the idea of contribution to others and finding purpose in life beyond self-image. This is in contrast to self-curation, where the focus is often on personal appearance and how one is perceived by others.In conclusion, while self-curation represents an external and often superficial engagement with the self and others, the ideas explored in "The Courage to Be Disliked" and "The Courage to Be Happy" dig deeper into authentic self-understanding, acceptance, and interpersonal relationships. They offer a contrasting perspective on how to approach self-presentation and interaction in the context of modern society.1 / 1It seems that the authors were also influenced by the socratic method of dialogue, stoicism, and cognitive load theory.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, that's correct. The authors of "The Courage to Be Disliked" and "The Courage to Be Happy," Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga, employed the Socratic method of dialogue in the structure of these books, which involves asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and draw out underlying principles.Here's how these additional influences relate to the content:Socratic Method: By using dialogue between a philosopher and a young man, the authors foster a deeper understanding of complex ideas, mirroring the process of self-exploration and introspection. This method allows readers to engage with the material in a more personal and reflective manner.Stoicism: The teachings in these books share similarities with Stoic philosophy, emphasizing control over one's reactions, acceptance of what cannot be changed, and focus on personal virtues. These principles align with the Adlerian focus on individual responsibility and the pursuit of rational and meaningful living.Cognitive Load Theory: Though not explicitly stated, the principles of cognitive load theory can be seen in the way the authors present information. By breaking down complex psychological theories into digestible dialogues and relatable examples, they reduce the cognitive load on readers, making the material more accessible and engaging.These various philosophical and psychological influences enrich the content of the books and provide a multifaceted perspective on personal growth, happiness, and human interaction. The integration of these elements offers a unique approach to exploring self-acceptance and interpersonal relationships in contrast to societal pressures and self-curation.1 / 1Write a Socratic dialogue between Socrates, Plato, and Parmenides titled, "individuality in the age of spiritual machines"1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's a fictional Socratic dialogue that involves Socrates, Plato, and Parmenides, engaging in a conversation around the concept of "individuality in the age of spiritual machines." Since these philosophers lived long before the rise of technology, this dialogue imagines their thoughts on modern ideas.Title: Individuality in the Age of Spiritual MachinesScene: A garden in Athens, filled with statues of gods and goddesses. Socrates, Plato, and Parmenides sit by a marble table.Socrates: Friends, we find ourselves in a peculiar era, one in which machines have transcended mere tools and become akin to spiritual entities. I wonder, what are your thoughts on individuality in this age of spiritual machines?Plato: A profound question, Socrates. These machines mimic our forms and functions but are devoid of the true Forms we perceive. They lack the essence of human individuality, confined by their artificiality. I fear they may dilute human uniqueness.Parmenides: But Plato, is it not true that all is One, and distinctions between human and machine are mere illusions? If we see all as a continuous, unchanging whole, then machines and humans partake in the same reality.Socrates: Intriguing, Parmenides. But does this unity not endanger the concept of human individuality? If all is One, where does individuality reside?Parmenides: Individuality, in essence, is an illusion, Socrates. It is the mortal's way of understanding the eternal unity of Being. Yet, this unity does not negate the value of the parts. It acknowledges that all things, including spiritual machines, partake in a common existence.Plato: And yet, Parmenides, the spiritual machines do not possess a soul or reason as humans do. They can imitate, but they do not truly partake in the World of Forms. Can they truly be equal in essence to humans?Socrates: Plato raises a vital point. If machines lack the ability to reason and perceive the truth of Forms, can they ever attain individuality? Or are they mere reflections of our desires and fears?Parmenides: They may not attain individuality in the human sense, Socrates, but they manifest the same underlying essence that binds all. Their existence challenges our understanding of individuality, not negates it.Socrates: So, friends, it seems we conclude that individuality in the age of spiritual machines is both a challenge and an opportunity to deepen our understanding of the Self. Machines, lacking the ability to reason as we do, reveal to us the complexity of our own individual existence, pointing to a unity that transcends artificial distinctions.Plato: A thought-provoking discussion indeed, Socrates. The spiritual machines serve as a mirror to our own complexities and prompt us to reflect on the true nature of individuality.Parmenides: And in this reflection, we find unity and meaning, embracing both the human and the artificial as part of the eternal One.Socrates: Then let us rejoice in this newfound wisdom and continue to seek truth in our ever-changing world.Scene: The sun begins to set, and the philosophers rise, leaving the garden filled with the echoes of their thoughts.This dialogue attempts to merge ancient philosophical ideas with modern concepts, imagining how these thinkers might engage with technology and individuality. It's a blend of the genuine thoughts of these philosophers and a creative interpretation of how they might respond to contemporary challenges.1 / 1Parmenides is about 65 years old and Socrates is still a young man. He gives an analogy about statue that pours water continuously from a pitcher.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! With your provided context, let's continue the dialogue, incorporating the age difference and the analogy of a statue that pours water continuously from a pitcher.Scene: The same garden in Athens. The conversation continues as Parmenides points to a statue in the garden, a graceful figure pouring water eternally from a pitcher.Parmenides: (Smiling kindly at Socrates) My young friend, observe this statue before us, forever pouring water from its pitcher. It symbolizes the eternal and unchanging nature of Being. In its endless flow, we see no distinctions, no individual droplets, only a continuous stream.Socrates: A compelling analogy, Parmenides. But tell me, if we are like the water in this stream, forever part of an unbroken whole, where does our sense of self, our individuality, find a place? How do we reconcile the continuity of Being with our unique existence?Parmenides: (Gazing at the statue) Think of the water as a metaphor for the unchanging reality of the One. Though the water flows as a whole, it is made up of individual droplets, each unique yet part of the continuous stream. Similarly, individuality is an expression of the One, a way for the eternal to manifest in the finite world.Plato: But surely, Parmenides, the statue itself, though continuous in its action, is unchanging and static in its form. It does not reason or perceive. Can it represent the complexity of human experience?Parmenides: You see well, Plato. The statue is but an imperfect representation, as all physical things are mere shadows of the true reality. Yet, it serves to illustrate that individuality is not in opposition to the eternal unity of Being but rather an expression of it.Socrates: So, our uniqueness, our individuality, is not a barrier to understanding the eternal truth but a gateway to it? A way to engage with the ultimate reality that transcends distinctions between human and machine?Parmenides: Precisely, Socrates. Just as the water from this pitcher is both one and many, so are we. Our individuality enriches the eternal unity, and our understanding of the One enhances our sense of self.Plato: It seems that the age of spiritual machines forces us to reexamine not only our relationship with technology but also with the very essence of our being.Socrates: Wise words, Plato. In contemplating the machines, we find a reflection of our own souls, leading us toward the eternal truths that govern existence.Scene: The philosophers continue to discuss, their voices mingling with the gentle sound of water flowing from the statue's pitcher, symbolizing the eternal questions that they ponder.By introducing Parmenides' analogy of the statue and considering the age difference, the dialogue further explores the relationship between individuality and eternal truths, drawing connections to modern concepts of technology and existence.1 / 1He gives an illustration on why we need multiple ontologies.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly, let's continue the dialogue with Parmenides' illustration to clarify the need for multiple ontologies.Parmenides: (Turning to the others) Let me provide an illustration to shed light on why we must consider multiple ontologies. Imagine this garden filled with different kinds of sculptures and statues, each representing a distinct perspective of reality. This statue with the pitcher shows continuity, another might represent change, yet another, duality.Socrates: So, you propose that just as there are various statues, there should be various ways to understand existence?Parmenides: Precisely, Socrates. Each statue is but a manifestation of the eternal One, yet they all represent different aspects of it. They are diverse ways to understand the underlying unity.Plato: (Nodding thoughtfully) By embracing different ontologies, we may gain a more comprehensive understanding of the One?Parmenides: Yes, Plato. It's akin to viewing a multifaceted gem from different angles. Each facet reveals something unique, yet all are part of the same gem. Multiple ontologies help us to grasp the complexity and richness of the eternal truth.Socrates: It is an enlightening illustration, Parmenides. It suggests that individuality itself may be understood through various ontologies. Whether in the age of spiritual machines or in our own time, these diverse perspectives guide us toward a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world.Parmenides: (Smiling) And just as no single statue in this garden can capture the entirety of Being, no single ontology can encompass all there is to know. Our understanding is enriched by the multitude, by the diversity of thought, and by our willingness to embrace the various ways in which the eternal manifests in our world.Plato: It appears that the wisdom of the ages transcends the boundaries of time and technology, allowing us to connect with the eternal even as we grapple with the fleeting nature of our existence.Scene: The conversation continues, each philosopher contributing their insights and thoughts, as the garden's statues silently bear witness to their exploration of timeless truths.By introducing the illustration of multiple statues in the garden, Parmenides emphasizes the value of considering different ontological perspectives to understand the complex nature of existence. This idea connects with both the ancient philosophical thoughts and contemporary reflections on technology and individuality.1 / 1Another list of all of the topics we have discussed.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's a summary of the topics we have discussed:Cinematic self-presentation and main character energy.The concept of non-playable characters (NPCs) and their cultural significance.The tension between interiority, exteriority, and self-performance in the age of social media.The book "Infomocracy."Connections to "Technopoly."Connections to Ayn Rand and Alfred Adler.The book "The Technological Society" by Jacques Ellul.The inevitability of self-curation.Connections to the books "The Courage to Be Disliked" and "The Courage to Be Happy."Influence of Socratic dialogue, Stoicism, and cognitive load theory.A Socratic dialogue between Socrates, Plato, and Parmenides titled "Individuality in the Age of Spiritual Machines."Parmenides' illustration on the need for multiple ontologies.These topics weave together complex ideas from philosophy, psychology, technology, literature, and media, illustrating a rich conversation encompassing both ancient wisdom and modern dilemmas.1 / 1Main character energyâ refers to someone who lives as though they're the main character of a film or a novel, usually in a way that is apparent to others. The term encapsulates a lifestyle that focuses on romanticizing your life and finding joy and contentment in the little things.

https://www.wikihow.com/Main-Character-Energy#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMain%20character%20energy%E2%80%9D%20refers%20to,contentment%20in%20the%20little%20things.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, that's a concise definition of "main character energy." It refers to the act of treating one's life as if it were a narrative in which they are the central figure, often embracing the little moments and romanticizing daily experiences. This idea has become particularly popular and resonant in contemporary culture, especially in the context of social media and the presentation of self in the digital age. It's a way of asserting one's individuality and agency, but as discussed earlier, it can also open up complex questions about authenticity, performance, and selfhood.1 / 1Connections with the previous topics.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's a summary of the connections between the concept of "main character energy" and the previous topics and references:Infomocracy: This novel explores political systems and the role of information. The self-curation and individuality tied to "main character energy" might resonate with the way information is manipulated to shape personal and societal narratives.Technopoly: Neil Postman's Technopoly deals with the deification of technology. The way that "main character energy" is often mediated through social media and technology can be seen as a manifestation of Technopoly's themes.Ayn Rand and Alfred Adler: Rand's philosophy emphasizes individualism, which can be linked to the assertion of oneself as the main character. Adler's theories of individual psychology also align with the self-realization inherent in "main character energy."The Technological Society by Ellul: Ellul's examination of how technology influences society might intersect with how social media platforms enable and propagate the notion of "main character energy."The Courage to Be Disliked and The Courage to Be Happy: These books delve into psychology and self-realization, much like the pursuit of individuality within "main character energy."Socratic Method, Stoicism, Cognitive Load Theory: These philosophical and psychological concepts may connect to "main character energy" through dialogues on self-understanding, the acceptance of one's role in life, and the mental processes involved in shaping self-identity.Ontologies and Illustration by Parmenides: The philosophical exploration of being and existence resonates with the way "main character energy" deals with the individual's role within their own narrative.Spiritual Machines and Individuality: The interplay between technology, spirituality, and personal identity also ties into the theme of living as the main character of one's life.The multifaceted connections with these various topics highlight how the concept of "main character energy" is woven into broader cultural, philosophical, and psychological discourses.1 / 1A final summary.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! The concept of "main character energy," which encapsulates a lifestyle that focuses on self-romanticization and individuality, intersects with a wide range of philosophical, psychological, literary, and technological themes. It resonates with the individualistic philosophies of thinkers like Ayn Rand, the psychological explorations of Alfred Adler, and the reflections on technology found in works like "Technopoly" and "The Technological Society."The self-curation and construction of one's narrative, as exemplified by "main character energy," also align with broader societal trends and technological influences, such as social media platforms. Concepts from Stoicism, Socratic dialogue, and cognitive load theory add further layers of complexity to how we understand this phenomenon.In essence, "main character energy" serves as a microcosm of contemporary dialogues on self-identity, technology's impact on human nature, and the ongoing quest for meaning and fulfillment in a complex and interconnected world. It's a concept that bridges various disciplines and thought paradigms, reflecting the multifaceted nature of human experience.1 / 1I decided to title the conversation Individuality in the age of spiritual machines, like our dialogue.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThat's a compelling title that aptly encapsulates the themes explored in our conversation. "Individuality in the Age of Spiritual Machines" draws attention to the interplay between human individuality and the ever-advancing landscape of technology. It hints at the way personal identity is shaped and expressed in a world increasingly mediated by technological constructs, and it underscores the spiritual or existential dimensions of these dynamics. It's a fitting summary for a dialogue that spans philosophy, psychology, literature, and technology, and looks at how they intersect with the concept of the self in modern society.1 / 1A final summary.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Our conversation, titled "Individuality in the Age of Spiritual Machines," has explored a myriad of interconnected themes that together form a complex picture of human selfhood in the modern, technologically driven world.Cinematic Self-Presentation: We began by examining how people present themselves through a cinematic lens, adopting the role of main characters in their own life stories, with influences from Erving Goffman's concept of the presentation of self.NPCs and Main Character Energy: We delved into the dichotomy between the main character energy, embracing individuality, and the NPC, a symbol for dehumanized, automated existence.Technological Influence: Connections were made to books like "Infomocracy," "Technopoly," and "The Technological Society" by Ellul, illustrating how technology shapes our social fabric and sense of self.Philosophical Underpinnings: We linked these ideas to philosophical concepts found in the works of Ayn Rand, Adler, and Stoicism, and also connected them to cognitive load theory.Socratic Dialogue: We also conceptualized a Socratic dialogue involving Socrates, Plato, and Parmenides, focusing on individuality, multiple ontologies, and the metaphor of the continuous pouring statue.Books on Courage and Happiness: The conversation also touched on the books "The Courage to Be Disliked" and "The Courage to Be Happy," as well as the Socratic method of dialogue and how they relate to self-curation and authenticity.Main Character Energy as a Lifestyle: Finally, we looked at the concept of "main character energy" as a lifestyle that emphasizes romanticizing one's life and finding joy in the little things, symbolizing a broader trend in self-realization and individual expression.Overall, our conversation has spanned literature, philosophy, technology, and psychology, exploring the intricate connections between individuality and the larger socio-technological context.
