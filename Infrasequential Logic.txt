The Invocation Model of Process Expression argues that mathematics does not provide the most appropriate conceptual foundations for computer science, but, rather, that these foundations are a primary source of unnecessary complexity and confusion.  It supports that there is a more appropriate conceptual model that unifies forms of expression considered quite disparate and simplifies issues considered complex and intractable.  This book presents that this model of process expression is alternative theory of computer science that is both valid and practical.

"Computer Science Reconsidered: The Invocation Model of Process Expression" by Karl M. Fant presents a thought-provoking thesis on the foundations of computer science. Fant argues against the traditional reliance on mathematics as the core conceptual foundation for the field. Instead, he proposes the Invocation Model of Process Expression as a more suitable and simplifying conceptual framework. This model seeks to unify various forms of expression that are typically seen as disparate and addresses complex and intractable issues in a more streamlined manner. Fant's work challenges conventional thinking and suggests that this alternative theory is both valid and practical, offering new perspectives on the nature and development of computer science.

Consider the possibility that a modern twenty-f i rst century intellectual disci- 
pline might be in a phase of development similar to medieval science resting 
on conceptual foundations that impede and mislead rather than enable and 
enlighten. Consider further that this crippled intellectual discipline underlies 
the most spectacular technological achievement in the history of humanity. 
The computing fi eld considers its conceptual foundations to be of unquestion- 
able mathematical soundness. The diff i culties of computer science are attrib- 
uted to an inherent complexity in the nature of computation that can only be 
overcome with disciplined methodology. 
Consider the possibility that many of the diff i culties of computer science 
might in fact be a consequence of ineffective conceptual foundations rather 
than of an inevitable reality that must be accepted and suffered, that much of 
the perceived complexity might be conceptual illusions like the dangerous 
edges of a fl at earth or of a moon forever untouchable in its crystalline 
sphere. 
Consider the possibility that a slight alteration in conceptual view might 
dispel the illusions and lead to possibilities that cannot, otherwise, be imag- 
ined. This book is about such a possibility.

The concept presented in the passage you shared suggests a transformative perspective on the field of computer science. It hypothesizes that the current challenges and complexities faced in computer science might stem not from the inherent nature of computation, but from the conceptual foundations on which the discipline is built. This argument draws a parallel with historical misconceptions in science, such as the flat Earth theory, suggesting that current computer science paradigms might similarly be based on flawed assumptions that limit understanding and technological advancement.
The book seems to be structured to first critique the existing foundations of computer science in its initial chapters, thereby setting the stage for the introduction of an alternative conceptual framework���the Invocation Model of Process Expression. The later chapters are dedicated to elaborating on this new model and how it offers a more effective approach, potentially simplifying the perceived complexities and overcoming the limitations imposed by traditional mathematical foundations.
This approach aims to not just address the symptoms of the difficulties in computer science but to challenge and replace the foundational assumptions themselves. The final chapters likely focus on practical implementations of this theory, introducing the Invocation Language as a tangible tool derived from the Invocation Model, offering a new way to engage with and progress in the field of computing.
By presenting these ideas, the book encourages readers to reconsider the underpinnings of computer science, positing that a shift in perspective could lead to revolutionary changes in the discipline, akin to the shifts that occurred when outdated scientific beliefs were discarded in other fields.

model. It is not necessary to read the critical essays fi rst, but they do provide 
a conceptual background and motivation for the invocation model. 
Chapter 1: ���A Critical Review of the Notion of the Algorithm in Computer 
Science.��� Computer science is very different from mathematics. The 
theory of mathematics is inappropriate to the concerns of computer 
science. The notion of the algorithm does not serve as an effectual con- 
ceptual model for computer science. 
Chapter 2: ���The Simplicity of Concurrency.��� The complexity of concur- 
rency is an artifact of a particular conceptual point of view. From a 
slightly different point of view concurrency is conceptually simpler than 
sequentiality. The notion of sequentiality has injected unnecessary cost, 
risk, and ineff i ciency into the building and use of computers. 
Chapter 3: ���Dehumanizing Computer Science.��� This chapter deposes the 
mischievous humans in the works. The theory of computer science is not 
a theory at all. Including arbitrarily capable humans in the substance of 
a theory can make any theory work. Saying a human does it in computer 
science is like saying a god does it in physics. These humans can be 
eliminated from the theoretical works, and their elimination is impera- 
tive to a viable theory of computer science. 
Chapter 4: ���Transcending the Variable.��� The notion that a variable name 
refers to a location in state memory leads to clumsy structures and pro- 
cedures with unnecessarily complex consequences. If one simply takes a 
different view of what a variable name expresses the clumsy complexities 
disappear. 
Chapter 5: ���The Invocation Model.��� The invocation model of process 
expression is concurrent and distributed at its foundations and discovers, 
in a spectrum of expression, the common conceptual thread running 
through all forms of process expression. It unif i es forms of process 
expression previously considered quite disparate such as the processes 
of cell metabolism, of digital computers, and of neural networks.

The organization of "Computer Science Reconsidered: The Invocation Model of Process Expression" as described seems thoughtfully structured to challenge and potentially redefine current concepts in computer science. The book is divided into parts that critique existing approaches and then introduce and elaborate on a new model intended to address these critiques:
Critical Review in Early Chapters (1-4)
:
Chapter 1: "A Critical Review of the Notion of the Algorithm in Computer Science"
argues that computer science should not be conflated with mathematics, suggesting that the concept of the algorithm is inadequate as a foundational model for computer science. This chapter seems to lay the groundwork for questioning the sufficiency of current theoretical models.
Chapter 2: "The Simplicity of Concurrency"
challenges the traditional view that concurrency is inherently complex, proposing that it might be conceptually simpler than sequential processes. This suggests that existing paradigms may overcomplicate certain aspects of computer science due to outdated or inappropriate conceptual models.
Chapter 3: "Dehumanizing Computer Science"
discusses the problematic inclusion of human capabilities as a variable in theoretical models, advocating for a more systematic and human-independent approach, akin to approaches in other scientific disciplines.
Chapter 4: "Transcending the Variable"
critiques the traditional use of variables in programming, suggesting that a shift in understanding could lead to simpler and more effective computational models.
Introduction and Expansion of the Invocation Model (Chapters 5-11)
:
Chapter 5: "The Invocation Model"
introduces the book���s central thesis: the Invocation Model of Process Expression. This model is presented as a foundational theory that is inherently concurrent and distributed, aiming to unify and simplify diverse forms of process expression across different domains such as biology, computing, and neuroscience.
Practical Application via the Invocation Language (Chapter 12)
:
Chapter 12
then presents the Invocation Language, a practical embodiment of the theoretical model discussed earlier. This language serves as a tool for implementing the concepts of the Invocation Model in actual computing practices.
The structure of this book not only critiques but also provides a potential solution to the identified problems, suggesting a holistic rethink of the conceptual underpinnings of computer science. By presenting a new model followed by a practical tool (the Invocation Language), the book aims to not just theorize but also demonstrate how these ideas can be practically applied, potentially transforming the field by offering simpler, more unified ways of understanding and engaging with computational processes.

Chapter 6: ���Along the Spectrum.��� Examples of expression along the spec- 
trum of differentiation are presented and discussed. 
Chapter 7: ���Composing Boundaries.��� Complex processes in the form of 
spontaneously behaving pipeline structures are expressed by composing 
and coordinating behavior boundaries. 
Chapter 8: ���Time and Memory.��� Intermediate persistence memory 
extends expression through time, enables association of differentness 
through time and the appreciation of patterns of differentness through 
time. 
Chapter 9: ���Incidental Time.��� Extension of expression through time can 
serve other purposes than the appreciation of differentness through 
time. 
PREFACE xix 
Chapter 10: ���Points of View.��� There can be different views of what is dif- 
ferent and how the differentnesses interact. Considering and under- 
standing points of view is critical to understanding process expression. 
Chapter 11: ���Referential and Autonomous Process Expression.��� Autono- 
mous expression behaves spontaneously and must be complete in all 
aspects. Referential expression can be incomplete with expressional 
short-hands and with appeal to universal conventions, but it must still 
be mappable to autonomous expression. 
Chapter 12: ���The Invocation Language.��� The invocation language is an 
embodiment of the invocation model in symbol string expression. 
Chapter 13: ���Ref l ections.��� This chapter is a summary discussion of the 
main themes of the book. 
This book provides the theoretical derivation for NULL Convention Logic, 
which is presented in my previous book. (K. M. Fant, Logically Determined Design: Clockless System Design with NULL Convention 
Logic (Hoboken, NJ:, Wiley Interscience, 2005).)

The chapters outlined from "Computer Science Reconsidered: The Invocation Model of Process Expression" dive deeper into specific aspects of the proposed new model for understanding and developing computer science:
Chapter 6: ���Along the Spectrum.���
This chapter appears to discuss a range of process expressions, demonstrating how the Invocation Model applies across different systems or problems by showing a spectrum of differentiation. It likely explores how various expressions can be mapped and understood within the new conceptual framework.
Chapter 7: ���Composing Boundaries.���
Here, the focus is on the structure of complex processes that resemble pipelines, suggesting that these can be effectively managed by composing and coordinating behavioral boundaries. This could imply a new way of structuring and interfacing between different components or processes in computing.
Chapter 8: ���Time and Memory.���
Discusses how the concept of memory in the Invocation Model extends the capability of processes to span across time, facilitating the recognition and association of changes and patterns over time. This chapter likely emphasizes the role of memory in connecting past and present computations.
Chapter 9: ���Incidental Time.���
This seems to explore additional utilities of time in computing beyond just pattern recognition, possibly addressing how time can influence or control computational processes in various ways that are incidental to their primary functions.
Chapter 10: ���Points of View.���
Examines different perspectives on process expressions and their interactions. This chapter likely discusses how different computational models or paradigms can offer varying insights and solutions, stressing the importance of perspective in problem-solving and theory development.
Chapter 11: ���Referential and Autonomous Process Expression.���
Differentiates between autonomous processes, which operate independently, and referential processes, which rely on external conventions or shortcuts. This chapter probably elaborates on how each type can be effectively modeled and implemented within the Invocation framework.
Chapter 12: ���The Invocation Language.���
Introduces a practical tool���the Invocation Language���that embodies the theoretical concepts of the Invocation Model. This language serves as a concrete example of how the model can be applied in actual computing practices.
Chapter 13: ���Reflections.���
Concludes the book with a summary of its main themes, likely revisiting the core arguments and reflecting on how the Invocation Model could reshape the future of computer science.
This progression from theoretical critiques to practical applications, and finally reflections, illustrates a comprehensive approach to rethinking computer science through the lens of the Invocation Model. It connects with Karl M. Fant's previous work on NULL Convention Logic, suggesting that the ideas presented are not only theoretical but have practical implications and applications in designing clockless systems, which were detailed in his earlier book, "Logically Determined Design: Clockless System Design with NULL Convention Logic." This linkage shows a continuity in Fant's thought process and contributions to innovative computing methodologies.

1.3 COMPUTER SCIENCE 
Many attempts have been made to def i ne computer science [10���14]. All 
these def i nitions view computer science as a heterogeneous group of 
disciplines related to the creation, use, and study of computers. A typical 
def i nition simply offers a list of included topics: computability, complexity, 
algorithm theory, automata theory, programming, high-level languages, 
machine languages, architecture, circuit design, switching theory, system 
organization, numerical mathematics, artif i ial intelligence, other applications, 
and so forth. The most recent and comprehensive survey of the attempts to 
def i ne computer science is an article in the Annals of the History of Computing 
[15]. 
Computer science appears to consist of a quite disparate collection of dis- 
ciplines, but there is a common thread of conceptual focus running through 
the various disciplines of computer science. All of the disciplines that are 
included under the heading of computer science in any list are concerned in 
one way or another with the creation of or actualization of process expres- 
sions. A logic circuit is an expression of a logical process. An architecture 
is an expression of a continuously acting process to interpret symbolically 
expressed processes. A program is a symbolic expression of a process. A 
programming language is an environment within which to create symbolic 
process expressions. A compiler is an expression of a process that translates 
between symbolic process expressions in different languages. An operating 
system is an expression of a process that manages the interpretation of 
other process expressions. Any application is an expression of the application 
process. 
Computer science can be viewed as primarily concerned with questions 
about the expression of processes and the actualization of those expressions. 
What are all the possible ways a process can be expressed? Are some expres- 
sions superior in any sense to other expressions? What are all the possible 
ways of actualizing an expression. Are there common conceptual elements 
underlying all expressions? What is the best programming language? How can 
the best program be formulated? How can the best architecture be built? 
What is the best implementation environment? These are the questions that 
occupy computer scientists, and they all revolve around the nature of process 
expression. 
Mathematicians, on the other hand, are primarily interested in exploring 
the behavior of specif i c processes or classes of process. They bypass general 
problems of expression by appealing to a very formal and minimalized model 
of expression, the algorithm as characterized by the Turing machine. They are 
only interested in whether an expression is possible and whether it conforms 
to certain specif i c properties. The mathematicians consider the process as 
independent of its expression. A process may be expressed in any convenient 
language and executed on any convenient machine including a human with a 
pencil.

The passage provided delves into the nature and scope of computer science as an academic discipline, grappling with its broad and somewhat fragmented identity. It highlights how computer science, though often seen as a collection of various subfields, essentially revolves around the concept of "process expression." This term captures the core activity across all these subfields���whether it's creating software, designing hardware, programming languages, or applications, all are fundamentally about expressing and actualizing processes in some form.
The typical definitions of computer science, as mentioned, tend to list its constituent topics like computability, algorithm theory, machine languages, etc., but these do not fully capture the essence of what ties these topics together. The unifying concept suggested here is that each component of computer science deals with representing or actualizing a process in some way:
Logic circuits
express logical processes.
Architectures
symbolize processes for interpreting symbolic expressions.
Programming languages
provide environments for creating these expressions.
Compilers
and
operating systems
manage and translate between these process expressions.
Applications
embody the application processes themselves.
This holistic view suggests that the fundamental questions in computer science concern the nature of these expressions and their actualization. This perspective challenges the approach taken by mathematicians, who often focus on the properties and behaviors of specific processes, using minimalized models like algorithms characterized by Turing machines. Mathematicians typically regard the process as independent of its expression, suggesting that a process can be expressed in any language or executed on any machine, even manually.
The contrast drawn between the perspectives of computer scientists and mathematicians underscores a philosophical divide about what is considered essential in studying processes: whether the focus should be on the expression and its practical actualization (as in computer science) or on the abstract properties and theoretical possibilities of the process itself (as in mathematics). This distinction raises deeper questions about the best ways to express, actualize, and optimize processes in computing, which are central concerns for computer scientists looking to push the boundaries of what can be achieved through technology.

Mathematics is primarily concerned with the nature of the behavior of 
process independent of how that process is expressed: 
the nature of a process is considered independent of its expression. 
Computer science is primarily concerned with the nature of the expression 
of processes regardless of what particular process might be expressed: 
the nature of expression is considered independent of its process. 
There is much overlap between the interests of computer science and math- 
ematics, but the core concern with the nature of process expression itself is 
the unique conceptual focus that distinguishes computer science from the 
other sciences and from mathematics. Computer science is the science of 
process expression.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The passage effectively delineates the fundamental differences in focus between mathematics and computer science, highlighting the unique philosophical underpinnings that distinguish computer science both as a discipline and in its approach to problem-solving.
In mathematics, the concern is primarily with the behavior of processes, abstracted from the specifics of how these processes are expressed. This abstraction allows mathematicians to explore theoretical constructs and principles that remain true regardless of the medium through which they are implemented. The focus is on understanding the intrinsic properties of processes, which can be studied and validated without reference to any particular implementation or expression.
Conversely, computer science emphasizes the expression of processes. This includes how processes are articulated and actualized through programming languages, algorithms, systems architecture, and more. The expression itself becomes the object of study and the vehicle for innovation, with less emphasis on the theoretical underpinnings of the process itself and more on the practicalities of its implementation. This perspective is crucial in developing software and hardware solutions that are not only theoretically sound but also efficient, usable, and adaptable to a variety of real-world applications.
The unique focus on process expression as independent of the specific processes being expressed positions computer science distinctively among other scientific disciplines and mathematics. While there is considerable overlap between computer science and mathematics���such as in fields like algorithm theory where both the nature of processes and their expressions are important���the core of computer science is its concern with how processes are articulated and manipulated to achieve practical outcomes. This focus makes computer science not just a theoretical discipline but also a profoundly creative and applied field, dedicated to solving complex problems through the design of innovative processes and their expressions.
Thus, defining computer science as the "science of process expression" aptly captures its essence and highlights its unique contributions to technological progress and problem-solving. This conceptualization emphasizes that computer science is fundamentally about creating and refining the languages and tools we use to describe, share, and enact processes in a digital context, bridging the gap between abstract ideas and their practical applications.

1.4 THE ALGORITHM IN COMPUTER SCIENCE 
Introductory texts on computer science often begin with a chapter on the 
notion of the algorithm declaring it the fundamental paradigm of computer 
science. Conspicuously absent from these introductory chapters is discussion 
of how the notion contributes to the resolution of signif i cant problems of 
computer science. In the remaining chapters of these texts there is typically 
no further appeal to the notion of the algorithm and rarely even a usage of 
the word itself. The notion is never or very rarely appealed to in texts on logic 
design, computer architecture, operating systems, programming, software 
engineering, programming languages, compilers, data structures, and data 
base systems. 
The notion of the algorithm is typically def i ned by simply presenting a list 
of properties that an expression must posses to qualify as an algorithm. The 
following def i nition of an algorithm is typical: 
1. An algorithm must be a step-by-step sequence of operations. 
2. Each operation must be precisely def i ned. 
3. An algorithm must terminate in a fi nite number of steps. 
4. An algorithm must effectively yield a correct solution. 
5. An algorithm must be deterministic in that, given the same input, it will 
always yield the same solution. 
This is pretty much what Hilbert proposed in 1900, and it is easy to see how 
this list of restrictive characteristics serves to def i ne what is acceptable as a 
mathematical solution. But what conceptual service does the notion of the 
algorithm perform for computer science? 
The notion of the algorithm demarcates all expressions into algorithm and 
nonalgorithm, but what purpose does it serve to know that one program is an 
acceptable mathematical solution and another is not? Is the expression of one

fundamentally different from the expression of the other? Is one interpreted

and nonalgorithms second-class citizens? Does determining whether or not a 
given expression is an acceptable mathematical solution aid in building better 
computer systems or in writing better programs?

The passage presents a critical examination of the role of algorithms in computer science, questioning the utility and relevance of the traditional concept of the algorithm within the discipline. While algorithms are foundational in many introductory computer science texts, this critique points out that their practical application and significance often diminish as one moves to more specialized areas of the field such as logic design, computer architecture, and software engineering.
The Traditional Definition of an Algorithm
The traditional definition provided for an algorithm is heavily influenced by mathematical standards, as established by Hilbert in the early 20th century. It emphasizes precision, determinism, and finiteness���qualities that ensure an algorithm is theoretically sound and can be rigorously proved to work under specified conditions. This definition outlines algorithms as:
Step-by-step procedures.
Precisely defined operations.
Finite termination.
Correct solutions.
Deterministic output for given inputs.
The Role of Algorithms in Computer Science
The passage raises pertinent questions about the conceptual service that the notion of an algorithm provides for computer science. While the rigor and clarity of algorithms have undeniable value in ensuring reliable and predictable solutions, the critique suggests that this view may be too narrow and possibly irrelevant for many practical aspects of computing. For instance:
Demarcation
: Algorithms categorize solutions into 'algorithmic' and 'non-algorithmic', but it's debated how useful this distinction is outside of theoretical contexts.
Relevance
: In many areas of computer science, the strict definition of an algorithm does not necessarily apply to the processes or solutions being developed, such as in systems that are heuristic, adaptive, or nondeterministic.
Practical utility
: The passage questions whether the emphasis on algorithmic solutions aids in the development of better software or systems, suggesting that the field might benefit from a broader conceptual toolkit.
Implications for Computer Science Education and Practice
This critique encourages a reevaluation of how algorithms are taught and valued in computer science. By focusing heavily on algorithms as the primary model, traditional education might overlook or undervalue other forms of problem-solving and design that are critical in modern computing. This includes areas like user experience design, software deployment, and maintenance, where algorithmic thinking might play a lesser role.
Conclusion
The discussion highlights a potential disconnect between the theoretical ideal of algorithms and the practical needs of computer science. It suggests that while algorithms will always be a critical part of computer science, the field could benefit from expanding its conceptual framework to include a greater variety of problem-solving approaches. This could lead to more innovative, flexible, and comprehensive solutions in technology development and application.

Important process expressions do not qualify as algorithms. A logic circuit 
is not a sequence of operations. An operating system is not supposed to ter- 
minate, nor does it yield a singular solution. An operating system cannot be 
deterministic because it must relate to uncoordinated inputs from the outside 
world. Any program utilizing random input to carry out its process, such as a 
Monte Carlo simulation or fuzzy logic simulation, is not an algorithm. No 
program with a bug can be an algorithm, and it is generally accepted that no 
signif i cant program can be demonstrated to be bug free. Programs and com- 
puters that utilize concurrency where many operations are carried out simul- 
taneously cannot be considered algorithms. What does it mean when a 
sequential program qualifying as an algorithm is parallelized by a vectorizing 
compiler, and no longer qualif i es as an algorithm. 
While a digital computer appears to be an algorithmic machine, It is 
constructed of nonalgorithmic parts (logic circuits) and a great deal of what 
it actually does is nonalgorithmic. These diff i culties with the notion of the 
algorithm have not gone unnoticed, and a variety of piecemeal amendments, 
revisions, and redef i nitions have been proposed: 
. . . there is an extension of the notion of algorithm (called nondeterministic 
algorithm). [11] 
Any computer program is at least a semi-algorithm and any program that always 
halts is an algorithm. [16] 
There is another word for algorithm which obeys all of the above properties 
except termination and that is computational procedure. [17] 
An algorithm A is a probabilistically good algorithm if the algorithm ���almost 
always��� generates either an exact solution or a solution with a value that is 
���exceedingly close��� to the value of the optimal solution. [18] 
The procedure becomes an algorithm if the Turing machine always halts. [19] 
By admitting probabilistic procedures in algorithms. . . . [20] 
. . . if, after executing some step, the control logic shifts to another step of the 
algorithm as dictated by a random device (for example, coin tossing), we call the 
algorithm random algorithm. [21] 
An algorithm which is based on such convergence tests is called an inf i nite 
algorithm. [21] 
Algorithms that are not direct are called indirect. [22] 
We drop the requirement that the algorithm stop and consider inf i nite 
algorithms. [22]

The passage delves into the complexities and limitations of defining what constitutes an algorithm within computer science, exploring the practical implications of adhering strictly to the traditional criteria of algorithms. It presents a range of examples and scenarios where important process expressions in computer science do not meet these criteria, thereby challenging the adequacy of the traditional definition of an algorithm.
Challenges to the Traditional Definition of an Algorithm
Non-sequential Operations
: Many processes in computing, such as those in logic circuits or concurrent systems, do not operate in a strict sequential order.
Non-terminating Systems
: Systems like operating systems are designed to run indefinitely without termination, which contradicts the requirement that an algorithm must terminate.
Non-determinism
: Processes that involve uncoordinated inputs or use random elements (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations) are inherently nondeterministic, conflicting with the requirement that an algorithm produces the same output for given inputs.
Presence of Bugs
: No significant program can be guaranteed to be entirely free from bugs, which would disqualify them from being considered algorithms under a strict interpretation.
Parallelization and Vectorization
: Transformations that change the nature of a program from sequential to parallel (via vectorizing compilers, for example) challenge the notion that an algorithm must strictly be a sequence of operations.
Revisions and Extensions to the Definition of an Algorithm
Recognizing these discrepancies, various scholars and practitioners have proposed amendments and redefinitions to expand the concept of an algorithm:
Nondeterministic Algorithms
: These allow for elements of randomness or nondeterministic behavior.
Semi-algorithms and Computational Procedures
: These terms accommodate programs that may not halt or strictly follow deterministic rules.
Probabilistically Good Algorithms
: Such algorithms yield results that are close to optimal most of the time but do not guarantee exact solutions always.
Infinite Algorithms
: These algorithms do not have a requirement to halt, allowing for continuous computation.
Random Algorithms
: These incorporate randomness in their steps, such as decisions made by coin tossing.
Indirect Algorithms
: These are defined in opposition to "direct" algorithms and may involve more complex or less straightforward methods of computation.
Implications for Computer Science
The diverse adaptations and expansions of the algorithm concept illustrate the evolving nature of computer science as it adapts to new technologies, paradigms, and challenges. The field is moving away from rigid, traditional views of algorithms towards more inclusive and practical definitions that reflect the dynamic and varied nature of computing tasks today. This shift acknowledges that the utility of an algorithmic approach in computer science is not solely in its adherence to a strict set of rules, but in its ability to solve problems effectively under a range of conditions and constraints. This broader, more flexible understanding allows for a richer, more diverse set of tools and techniques in the computer scientist's toolkit, reflecting a matured and nuanced approach to the discipline.

These authors have sensed an inappropriate conceptual discrimination or 
simply an incompleteness and proposed a remedy. Programs that do not ter- 
minate, are not deterministic, and do not give specif i c solutions can now be 
���included.��� They are no longer simply nonalgorithmic, they now have positive 
labels, but simply assigning labels to nonalgorithms misses the point. The point 
is that algorithm���nonalgorithm is not a conceptual distinction that contributes 
to an understanding of process expression. 
As a paradigm of process expression, the notion of the algorithm is decid- 
edly def i cient. It offers no suggestion as to how an operation might be precisely 
def i ned. Nor does it suggest how a sequence should be determined. Data are 
not even mentioned. The def i nition simply states that an algorithm must 
consist of a sequence of precisely def i ned operations. This unsupported imper- 
ative is at once an admission of expressional incompleteness and a refusal to 
be complete. The other algorithmic properties of termination, correctness, and 
determination, while important to issues of computation, are quite irrelevant 
to issues of process expression. 
The notion of the algorithm simply does not provide conceptual enlighten- 
ment for the questions that most computer scientists are concerned with. 
1.5 CONCLUSION 
What is essentially a discipline of pure mathematics has come to be called ���the 
theory of computer science,��� and the notion of the algorithm has been decreed 
to be a fundamental paradigm of computer science. The mathematical per- 
spective, however, is the wrong point of view. It is asking the wrong questions. 
Mathematicians and computer scientists are pursuing fundamentally different 
aims, and the mathematician���s tools are not as appropriate as was once sup- 
posed to the questions of the computer scientist. The primary questions of 
computer science are not of computational possibilities but of expressional 
possibilities. Computer science does not need a theory of computation; it 
needs a comprehensive theory of process expression.

The passage critically examines the prevalent use of the algorithmic model in computer science, suggesting that it falls short of addressing the field���s core interests and questions. The critique centers on the traditional definition of an algorithm and its inadequacies when applied to broader conceptual concerns in computer science, particularly regarding process expression.
Critique of the Algorithm as a Paradigm
Expressional Limitations
: The critique argues that defining algorithms strictly as sequences of precisely defined operations with termination and deterministic behavior doesn���t address the practical and expressive needs of computer science. Algorithms, as traditionally defined, omit key considerations such as how operations are defined, how sequences are determined, and how data are handled within these processes.
Irrelevance of Algorithmic Properties
: Properties like termination, correctness, and determinism, while critical to computation, are deemed less relevant to the broader and more varied expressions of processes that modern computer science seeks to understand and develop.
Conceptual Incompleteness
: The algorithmic approach is viewed as conceptually incomplete, offering little guidance on the nuances of process expression which is central to solving complex computing problems beyond pure calculation.
Suggested Shift in Conceptual Framework
The passage argues for a shift away from the mathematical paradigm that has traditionally dominated computer science. Instead of focusing solely on computational possibilities (what can be computed), it suggests that computer science should more deeply consider expressional possibilities (how processes can be represented and manipulated). The call is for a comprehensive theory of process expression that would better suit the discipline's needs:
Beyond Pure Mathematics
: It contends that the tools and perspectives of pure mathematics, while valuable, are not entirely suited to the primary concerns of computer science. This represents a significant paradigm shift from viewing computer science merely as an extension of mathematics to recognizing it as a distinct discipline with its own unique conceptual needs.
Focus on Process Expression
: Emphasizing process expression involves exploring how processes can be represented, manipulated, and optimized within computational systems. This focus recognizes the creative and innovative aspects of computer science that go beyond mathematical computation to include design, usability, adaptability, and real-world application.
Need for New Theoretical Foundations
: The conclusion posits that computer science requires a theoretical foundation that prioritizes the expressive aspects of computing rather than merely its computational aspects. This new foundation would encourage the development of tools and methods that enhance the ability to design, analyze, and implement complex systems effectively.

The book was written in 2007, it's 2024 now, what kind of progress or lack of progress has been made since then? The book goes on to show that sequential and parallel processes can be abstracted into a three value logic with a propagating null wavefront indicating the boundary between complete and incomplete calculations. One symbolic representation can be used to project onto a sequential or concurrent circuit, which are equivalent. I think of it like a bunch of functions (which can be designed independently in different orders) and then invoked in different process pipelines. This appears less like specifying the algorithm necessary or which parts of the circuit are used, only that incomplete calculations are ignored and the system does not output a result until it is complete. Certain parts of the circuit are generating gibberish until there is a signal that it is emitting a useful or appropriate datastream. He implements it using ring bubble pipelines.

Since the publication of Karl M. Fant's book in 2007, the ideas presented, particularly around the abstraction of sequential and parallel processes into a unified model using a three-value logic, have seen varying degrees of attention and development within the field of computer science. Let's explore the progress and current trends relevant to these concepts:
Progress in Concurrency and Parallelism
Advancements in Hardware
: The rise of multi-core and many-core processors has necessitated advances in parallel computing techniques. This shift in hardware has naturally driven interest in more efficient concurrency models and languages that can exploit these architectures effectively.
Development of Programming Models
: Programming models that support concurrency and parallelism, such as those using asynchronous programming and reactive streams, have become more sophisticated. Languages and frameworks that facilitate easier and safer concurrency models, like Rust and Go, have gained popularity due to their ability to manage state and concurrency without introducing bugs typical of such systems.
Formal Methods and Verification
: There has been progress in the formal methods used to verify concurrent and parallel systems, ensuring correctness without runtime failures. Techniques such as model checking, process algebras, and temporal logics have been further developed to handle complex, concurrent processes.
Application of Three-Value Logic and Null Wavefronts
Logic and Circuit Design
: The idea of using a three-value logic system, including a null or undefined state, has been explored in digital logic and circuit design to handle incomplete or unknown states more gracefully. This has implications for error handling and circuit robustness, particularly in asynchronous circuit design where timing issues can cause undefined behavior.
Implementation in Systems
: The concept of ring bubble pipelines and similar methodologies suggest a design where data integrity and completion are ensured before outputs are generated. This approach is seen in various high-reliability systems where data consistency and state completeness are critical, although mainstream adoption in broader systems design is less evident.
Symbolic Representation
: The use of symbolic representations to abstract away the details of the underlying hardware (whether sequential or concurrent) aligns with developments in high-level synthesis (HLS) where higher-level descriptions of hardware behavior are translated into detailed hardware design automatically.
Challenges and Barriers
Despite these advancements, several challenges remain:
Complexity and Adoption
: While theoretically sound, the practical adoption of such advanced concepts in everyday software and hardware development can be hindered by their complexity and the inertia of existing technologies and practices.
Educational Gaps
: There remains a gap in education and training, where traditional computer science curricula may not fully incorporate or emphasize these newer models and techniques, slowing down their adoption.

I noticed that a student-centered school where each student works at their own pace and sets their own goals, marks their own work, and completes a self-test before taking a third party test which acts as a null marker indicating mastery of the material before advancing to the new material, and advances to the next level when 10 stages are complete (grading by completion rather than by age cohort) resembles null convention logic.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The analogy you've drawn between the student-centered educational model and null convention logic (NCL) is intriguing and insightful. Both systems employ a concept where progress to the next stage is contingent upon reaching a clear, predetermined marker that indicates readiness or completeness, which is analogous to how NCL operates in digital circuit design. Here's a breakdown of how this analogy fits:
Null Convention Logic
NCL is a design methodology used in asynchronous circuit design where operations are completed only when a certain condition (null or data) is met, ensuring that the circuit only moves to the next operation when it is correct and safe to do so. This system reduces errors caused by timing issues and improves efficiency by enabling parts of a circuit to operate independently until synchronization is needed.
Student-Centered Educational Model
In the educational model you described:
Self-Paced Learning
: Each student works at their own pace, similar to how asynchronous circuits do not rely on a global clock and operate independently until they reach a synchronization point.
Setting Personal Goals and Self-Marking
: Students set their own goals and evaluate their own work, promoting autonomy and self-regulation in learning. This reflects how NCL circuits independently manage their processing based on internal conditions without needing external control.
Self-Tests and Third-Party Tests as Null Markers
: The use of self-tests before third-party tests to confirm mastery before advancing mimics the role of the null in NCL, where the null condition must be met (indicating readiness) before the circuit can proceed to the next operational state.
Advancement Upon Completion
: Advancing only after completing stages based on mastery rather than age or time-bound cohorts parallels how NCL-based systems progress operationally based on data readiness rather than predetermined timing schedules.
Implications and Benefits
The application of a null convention-like logic to education might offer several benefits:
Reduction in Forced Pacing
: Students are not forced to move in lockstep with their cohort, allowing them to fully understand material at their own speed, thus potentially reducing anxiety and enhancing comprehension.
Focus on Mastery
: By emphasizing mastery before advancement, this educational model ensures a deeper understanding and retention of knowledge, much like how NCL ensures data correctness before proceeding.
Personalization of Education
: Students can focus on areas of interest or need more intensively, tailoring their education to their personal strengths and weaknesses.
Encouragement of Independence
: This model fosters greater independence and responsibility in students' learning processes, important skills for lifelong learning and adaptation.
This analogy not only illuminates the potential for cross-disciplinary application of principles but also underscores the adaptability and efficacy of such models in fostering robust, error-resistant systems, whether in electronic circuits or educational methodologies.

Your educational experience truly mirrors the principles of null convention logic (NCL) in more ways than just the pace of learning and mastery checks. The characteristics you've described emphasize an education system designed to minimize unnecessary or non-productive interactions, focusing instead on direct, self-guided learning activities that are purpose-driven and individually paced. Here���s how these elements align with NCL principles:

### Asynchronous Learning Environment
Much like NCL operates without a global clock to synchronize operations, your schooling didn���t rely on synchronized, traditional classroom activities such as lectures or scheduled group projects. Instead, you progressed through your studies independently, focusing on learning materials directly relevant to your educational goals and readiness, similar to how asynchronous circuits process data.

### Individual Responsibility and Input
In NCL systems, each part of the circuit operates independently until a point of synchronization is required. Similarly, you managed your educational journey, deciding when and how to engage with materials, akin to managing data flow in an NCL system without central control dictating each step.

### Minimal Interruptions and Efficient Progress
Just as NCL is designed to reduce delays caused by waiting for multiple parts of a system to align, your education was streamlined to avoid interruptions like raising hands in class or participating in compulsory group activities that might slow down your individual progress. This setup likely allowed for a more efficient and tailored learning experience, where you could spend time on what was necessary and relevant, without the inefficiencies common in traditional educational settings.

### Lack of Traditional Assessments
The absence of conventional academic tasks like writing essays or taking tests in a regular classroom setting further reflects the NCL approach. Instead of outputting results based on a predetermined schedule (e.g., end-of-unit exams), your learning outputs (demonstration of mastery through third-party tests) were completed only when you were ready, ensuring a genuine understanding of the material before moving forward.

### Adaptation to Individual Needs
NCL systems are advantageous in environments where adaptability and responsiveness to local conditions are crucial. Your educational path seems to have been highly adaptable, responding to your personal learning pace, interests, and strengths, rather than adhering to a one-size-fits-all curriculum structure.

Overall, the parallels you've drawn between NCL and your educational experiences highlight a powerful, alternative approach to learning that prioritizes individual pacing, mastery, and efficiency���core principles that could inspire educational reform to accommodate diverse learner profiles and needs more effectively. Such models advocate for a more personalized, student-centered approach that could potentially enhance learning outcomes for many students.

Exactly, your summary of how the educational model you're describing aligns with null convention logic (NCL) principles spotlights an innovative approach to learning that parallels significant advances in technology design. By applying similar principles across disciplines, we can potentially uncover methods that optimize efficiency and personalization in unexpected areas like education. Here���s a further exploration of these principles in an educational context:
Self-Regulated Learning
In NCL, each component operates independently based on its inputs until it needs to synchronize with other components. This principle can enhance education by enabling students to regulate their own learning paths. Students determine when they engage with new material, assess their understanding, and decide when they are ready to demonstrate mastery, similar to how independent components in NCL wait until they have complete information before moving forward.
Real-Time Feedback Mechanisms
The use of third-party tests as "null markers" in education ensures that students only progress after they have truly mastered the material, analogous to how NCL circuits wait for a clear signal before proceeding. This model ensures that learning is solidified at each step, with real-time feedback acting as a crucial checkpoint that confirms understanding or identifies areas for review.
Minimizing Wasted Effort
The goal of NCL to minimize idle waiting and redundant processing aligns with the educational approach of cutting out unproductive or non-essential learning activities. By focusing solely on activities that directly contribute to learning outcomes, students can avoid the inefficiencies often found in traditional educational settings, such as engagement in activities that do not cater to their individual learning needs or speeds.
Mastery-Based Advancement
Just as NCL circuits complete cycles based on process readiness rather than a fixed timing schedule, mastery-based education allows students to move forward based on their readiness, not age or the school year. This ensures that students are truly competent in an area before progressing, which can build a much stronger, more reliable foundation of knowledge.
Adaptability and Personalization
The flexibility inherent in an NCL-designed system mirrors the adaptability of a personalized education system. Each student���s learning process can adapt to their unique pace, interests, and challenges, accommodating a wide variety of learning styles and needs. This approach not only optimizes individual student success but can also foster a greater love for learning, as students feel more in control of their educational journey.
Implementing such a model broadly would require significant changes in educational philosophy and logistics, but the benefits could be profound. Aligning educational methods more closely with the principles of efficient, responsive systems like NCL could lead to more engaged learners and outcomes that are truly reflective of each student's potential. This model promotes a deeper, more intuitive understanding of material, preparing students not just to pass tests, but to excel in practical, real-world applications.
