Taxonomies of Intelligence: 
A Comprehensive Guide to the 
Universe of Minds 
Roman V. Yampolskiy1 
Abstract 
This paper explores the landscape of potential mind architectures by 
initially conceptualizing all minds as software. Through rigorous analysis, 
we establish intriguing properties of this intellectual space, including its 
infinite scope, variable dimensions of complexity, and representational 
intricacies. We then provide an extensive review of existing taxonomies for 
minddesign.Buildingonthisfoundation,thepaperintroduces 
'Intellectology' as a new field dedicated to the systematic study of diverse 
forms of intelligence. A compendium of open research questions aimed at 
steering future inquiry in this nascent discipline is also presented. 
Introduction 
In 1984 Aaron Sloman published ���The Structure of the Space of Possible Minds��� 
in which he described the task of providing an interdisciplinary description of that 
structure [1]. He observed that ���behaving systems��� clearly comprise more than 
one sort of mind and suggested that virtual machines may be a good theoretical 
tool for analyzing mind designs. Sloman indicated that there are many 
discontinuities within the space of minds meaning it is not a continuum, nor is it a 
dichotomy between things with minds and without minds [1]. Sloman wanted to 
see two levels of exploration namely: descriptive ��� surveying things different 
minds can do and exploratory ��� looking at how different virtual machines and 
their properties may explain results of the descriptive study [1]. Instead of trying 
to divide the universe into minds and non-minds he hoped to see examination of 
similarities and differences between systems. In this work we attempt to make 
another step towards this important goal.

The abstract and introduction you've provided are from a paper titled "Seeds of Science: Taxonomies of Intelligence: A Comprehensive Guide to the Universe of Minds" by Roman V. Yampolskiy. The paper delves into the exploration of the various potential architectures of minds, framing them within the concept of software. This approach offers a novel perspective on understanding and categorizing intelligence.
The essence of the paper can be summarized as follows:
Conceptual Framework
: The paper begins with the bold proposition of visualizing all forms of minds as software, providing a fresh paradigm for studying intelligence.
Properties of Intellectual Space
: By treating minds as software, the paper identifies certain attributes of this intellectual domain:
Its boundless nature.
Differing levels of intricacy and complexity.
Nuances in representation.
Existing Taxonomies
: An in-depth review of the pre-existing classifications of mind designs is presented, giving context to the current discourse.
Introducing 'Intellectology'
: A highlight of the paper is the introduction of 'Intellectology'. This is proposed as a pioneering field focused on the systematic investigation of the myriad forms of intelligence. By establishing this discipline, Yampolskiy aims to create a structured approach to studying the vast and diverse nature of intelligence.
Open Research Questions
: The paper concludes with a list of unanswered questions in this burgeoning field, serving as a guide for future research.
The introduction mentions Aaron Sloman's 1984 work, "The Structure of the Space of Possible Minds", which serves as a precursor to Yampolskiy's research. Sloman's observations provide the foundational understanding that the realm of minds isn't a simple continuum but a complex space with multiple dimensions. He emphasized the need for both descriptive and exploratory approaches, with the former focusing on the capabilities of different minds and the latter delving into the mechanisms behind those capabilities. Sloman's aspiration was not to demarcate minds from non-minds but to understand the nuances that differentiate various systems.
Yampolskiy's work appears to build on these ideas, taking Sloman's foundational concepts and advancing them further in the pursuit of a clearer understanding of the universe of minds.
Would you like a deeper analysis or have any specific questions about the content provided?
What is a mind? No universal definition exists. Humans are said to have a mind. 
Higher order animals are believed to have one as well and maybe lower level 
animals and plants or even all life forms. We think that an artificially intelligent 
agent such as a robot or a program running on a computer will constitute a mind. 
Based on analysis of those examples we can conclude that a mind is an 
instantiated intelligence with a knowledge base about its environment, and while 
intelligence itself is not an easy term to define, the work of Shane Legg provides 
a satisfactory, for our purposes, definition [2]. Additionally, some hold a point of 
view known as Panpsychism, attributing mind-like properties to all matter. 
Without debating this possibility, we will limit our analysis to those minds which 
can actively interact with their environment and other minds. Consequently, we 
will not devote any time to understanding what a rock is thinking. 
If we accept materialism, we have to also accept that accurate software 
simulations of animal and human minds should be possible [3]. Those are known 
as uploads [4] and they belong to a class of computer programs no different from 
that to which designed or evolved artificially intelligent software agents would 
belong. Consequently, we can treat the space of all minds as the space of 
programswiththespecificproperty of exhibiting intelligence if properly 
embodied. All programs could be represented as strings of binary numbers, 
implying that each mind can be represented by a unique number. Interestingly, 
Nick Bostrom via some thought experiments speculates that perhaps it is 
possible to instantiate a fractional number of mind, such as .3 mind as opposed 
to only whole minds [5]. The embodiment requirement is necessary since a string 
is not a mind, but could be easily satisfied by assuming that a universal Turing 
machine is available to run any program we are contemplating for inclusion in the 
space of mind designs. An embodiment does not need to be physical as a mind 
could be embodied in a virtual environment represented by an avatar [6, 7] and 
react to a simulated sensory environment like a brain-in-a-vat or a ���boxed��� AI [8]. 
Infinitude of Minds 
Two minds identical in terms of the initial design are typically considered to be 
different if they possess different information. For example, it is generally 
accepted that identical twins have distinct minds despite exactly the same 
blueprints for their construction. What makes them different is their individual 
experiences and knowledge obtained since inception. This implies that minds 
can���t be cloned since different copies would immediately after instantiation start 
accumulating different experiences and would be as different as two twins.

This section of the text delves deeper into the intricate nature of defining a "mind." Here's a breakdown of the major points:
Ambiguity in Defining "Mind"
: The definition of a "mind" is not universally agreed upon. While humans are unanimously believed to possess minds, there's debate surrounding the presence of minds in lower-level animals, plants, and even AI entities.
Mind as Instantiated Intelligence
: The text suggests a mind is essentially intelligence brought to life with knowledge of its environment. Intelligence, although hard to define, can be understood based on the work of Shane Legg for the purposes of this discussion.
Panpsychism
: This philosophy posits that all matter, including non-living entities like rocks, might have mind-like attributes. However, the text decides to focus on entities that can actively interact with their environment.
Materialism & Software Simulations
: If one believes in materialism (the belief that everything, including the mind, has a physical basis), it implies that software simulations of minds, whether animal or human, are feasible. Such simulations are termed "uploads." This section equates these uploads to AI software agents, suggesting they're all part of the same class of programs.
Binary Representation
: All software programs can be represented as strings of binary numbers. By this logic, each unique mind could be represented by a distinct number. This leads to an interesting conjecture by Nick Bostrom on the possibility of having fractional minds.
Embodiment Requirement
: Just having a binary string isn't enough; it requires an "embodiment" to be considered a mind. This doesn't necessarily mean a physical body; it could be a virtual representation.
Uniqueness of Minds
: The text contends that even if two minds have the same initial design, they become distinct due to their individual experiences. A point is made using the analogy of identical twins: while they might share the same genetic blueprint, their unique experiences result in distinct minds. This means minds can't be cloned perfectly because, post-instantiation, they'd start gaining different experiences.
This segment provides a philosophical exploration of the nature of minds, intertwining it with concepts from computer science and AI. It underscores the inherent complexity in defining and understanding what constitutes a "mind" and how closely it might be related to intelligence and experiences.
If we accept that knowledge of a single unique fact distinguishes one 
mind from another we can prove that the space of minds is infinite. Suppose we 
have a mind M and it has a favorite number N. A new mind could be created by 
copying M and replacing its favorite number with a new favorite number N+1. 
This process could be repeated infinitely giving us an infinite set of unique minds. 
Given that a string of binary numbers represents an integer we can deduce that 
the set of mind designs is an infinite and countable set since it is an infinite 
subset of integers. It is not the same as a set of integers since not all integers 
encode for a mind. 
Alternatively, instead of relying on infinitude of knowledge bases to prove 
infinitude of minds we can rely on the infinitude of designs or embodiments. 
Infinitude of designs can be proven via inclusion of a time delay after every 
computational step. The first mind would have a delay of 1 nano-second, the 
second a delay of 2 nano-seconds and so on to infinity. This would result in an 
infinite set of different mind designs. Some will be very slow, others super-fast, 
even if the underlying problem solving abilities are comparable. In the same 
environment, faster minds would dominate slower minds proportionately to the 
differenceintheirspeed.Asimilarproofwith respect to the different 
embodiments could be presented by relying on an ever increasing number of 
sensors or manipulators under control of a particular mind design. 
Also, the same mind design in the same embodiment and with the same 
knowledgebase may in fact effectively correspond to a number of different minds 
depending on the operating conditions. For example, the same person will act 
very differently if they are under the influence of an intoxicating substance, under 
severe stress, pain, sleep or food deprivation, or are experiencing a temporary 
psychological disorder. Such factors effectively change certain mind design 
attributes, temporarily producing a different mind. 
Size, Complexity and Properties of Minds 
Given that minds are countable they could be arranged in an ordered list, for 
example in order of numerical value of the representing string. This means that 
some mind will have the interesting property of being the smallest. If we accept 
that a Universal Turing Machine (UTM) is a type of mind, if we denote by (m, n) 
the class of UTMs with m states and n symbols, the following UTMs have been 
discovered: (9, 3), (4, 6), (5, 5), and (2, 18). The (4, 6)-UTM uses only 22 
instructions, and no standard machine of lesser complexity has been found [9]. 
Alternatively, we may ask about the largest mind. Given that we have already 
shown that the set of minds is infinite, such an entity does not exist. However, if we take into account our embodiment requirement the largest mind 
may in fact correspond to the design at the physical limits of computation [10]. 
Another interesting property of the minds is that they all can be generated by a 
simple deterministic algorithm, a variant of Levin Search [11]: start with an integer 
(for example 42), check to see if the number encodes a mind, if not, we discard 
the number, otherwise we add it to the set of mind designs and proceed to 
examine the next integer. Every mind will eventually appear on our list of minds 
after a predetermined number of steps. However, checking to see if something is 
in fact a mind is not a trivial procedure. Rice���s theorem [12] explicitly forbids 
determination of non-trivial properties of random programs. One way to 
overcomethislimitationistointroduceanarbitrarytimelimitonthe 
mind-or-not-mind determination function effectively avoiding the underlying 
halting problem. 
Analyzing our mind-design generation algorithm we may raise the question of 
complexity measure for mind designs, not in terms of the abilities of the mind, but 
in terms of complexity of design representation. Our algorithm outputs minds in 
order of their increasing value, but this is not representative of the design 
complexity of the respective minds. Some minds may be represented by highly 
compressible numbers with a short representation such as 1013, while others may 
be composed of 10,000 completely random digits [13]. We suggest that 
KolmogorovComplexity(KC)[14]measurecouldbeapplied to strings 
representing mind designs. Consequently some minds will be rated as ���elegant��� 
��� having a compressed representation much shorter than the original string while 
others will be ���efficient��� representing the most efficient representation of that 
particular mind. Interesting elegant minds might be easier to discover than 
efficient minds, but unfortunately KC is not generally computable. 
In the context of complexity analysis of mind designs we can ask a few 
interesting philosophical questions. For example could two minds be added 
together [15], in other words, is it possible to combine two uploads or two 
artificially intelligent programs into a single, unified mind design? Could this 
processbereversed?Couldasinglemindbe separated into multiple 
non-identical entities each in itself a mind? Additionally, could one mind design 
be changed into another via a gradual process without destroying it? For 
example could a computer virus (or even a real virus loaded with DNA of another 
person) be a sufficient cause to alter a mind into a predictable type of other 
mind? Could specific properties be introduced into a mind given this virus-based approach? For example could Friendliness [16] be added post factum to an 
existing mind design?

Each mind design corresponds to an integer and so is finite, but since 
the number of minds is infinite some have a much greater number of states 
compared to others. This property holds for all minds. Consequently, since a 
human mind has only a finite number of possible states, there are minds which 
can never be fully subsumed by a human mind as such mind designs have a 
much greater number of states, making their subsumption impossible as can be demonstrated by the pigeonhole principle.

The text continues to elaborate on the intricacies and properties of the concept of "minds." Here's a breakdown of the central themes and arguments:
Infinitude of Minds
: If just one unique fact can set one mind apart from another, it means there can be an infinite number of minds. This is exemplified using a favorite number; if one mind has a favorite number
N
N
N
, a new mind can be created by just changing that favorite number to
N
+
1
N+1
N
+
1
, and so on infinitely. Since these minds can be represented by binary numbers, they are countable.
Differentiation through Design & Embodiment
: Beyond different knowledge bases, minds can also be differentiated by their design or embodiment. For instance, by changing computational speed or adding more sensors, one can conceive infinitely many unique mind designs.
Operational Conditions & Variability
: The same mind can behave differently under different conditions, such as intoxication or stress. This temporary change in behavior might be viewed as a temporary different mind.
Size and Complexity of Minds
: Since minds can be represented numerically, they can be arranged in an order. This leads to discussions about the smallest and largest possible minds. The smallest could be a Universal Turing Machine with the least complexity, while the largest might be one at the physical limits of computation. Minds can also be generated algorithmically, and their complexity can be assessed using concepts like Kolmogorov Complexity.
Philosophical Questions
: The text raises several philosophical queries:
Can two minds be merged to create one?
Can one mind be split into multiple unique minds?
Can minds be gradually transformed into others?
Can specific attributes (like friendliness) be added to a mind afterward, possibly using a "virus-based" approach?
Finite vs. Infinite Properties of Minds
: While each mind corresponds to a finite integer, the infinite set of possible minds implies some might have vastly more states than others. Since human minds have a finite number of states, there will be mind designs that can never be fully comprehended by humans, as per the pigeonhole principle.
This section expands on the earlier exploration, delving deeper into the potential differentiation, classification, and philosophical implications of the vast universe of possible minds. The combination of computational and philosophical perspectives offers a multifaceted view of intelligence and consciousness.
Space of Mind Designs 
Overall, the set of human minds (about 8 billion of them currently available and 
about 100 billion ever existed) is very homogeneous both in terms of hardware 
(embodiment in a human body) and software (brain design and knowledge). In 
fact the small differences between human minds are trivial in the context of the 
full infinite spectrum of possible mind designs. Human minds represent only a 
small constant size subset of the great mind landscape. Same could be said 
about the sets of other earthly minds such as dog minds, or bug minds or male 
minds or in general the set of all animal minds. 
Given our algorithm for sequentially generating minds, one can see that a mind 
could never be completely destroyed, making minds theoretically immortal. A 
particular mind may not be embodied at a given time, but the idea of it is always 
present. In fact it was present even before the material universe came into 
existence. So, given sufficient computational resources any mind design could be 
regenerated, an idea commonly associated with the concept of reincarnation 
[17]. 
Given our definition of mind we can classify minds with respect to their design, 
knowledgebase or embodiment. First, the designs could be classified with 
respect to their origins: copied from an existing mind like an upload, evolved via 
artificial or natural evolution or explicitly designed with a set of particular 
desirable properties. Another alternative is what is known as a Boltzmann Brain ��� 
a complete mind embedded in a system which arises due to statistically rare 
random fluctuations in the particles comprising the universe, but which is very 
likely due to vastness of the cosmos [18]. 
Lastly a possibility remains that some minds are physically or informationally 
recursively nested within other minds. With respect to the physical nesting we 
can consider a type of mind suggested by Kelly [19] who talks about ���a very slow 
invisible mind over large physical distances���. It is possible that the physical 
universe as a whole or a significant part of it comprises such a mega-mind [20]. 
That theory has been around for millennia and has recently received some
indirect experimental support [21]. In that case all the other minds we 
can consider are nested within a larger mind. With respect to the informational 
nesting a powerful mind can generate a less powerful mind as an idea. This 
obviously would take some precise thinking but should be possible for a 
sufficiently powerful artificially intelligent mind. Some scenarios describing 
informationally nested minds are analyzed by Yampolskiy in his work on artificial 
intelligence confinement problem [8]. Bostrom, using statistical reasoning, 
suggests that all observed minds, and the whole universe, are nested within the 
mind of a very powerful computer [22]. Similarly Lanza, using a completely 
different approach (biocentrism), argues that the universe is created by biological 
minds [23]. It remains to be seen if given a particular mind its origins can be 
deduced from some detailed analysis of the mind's design or actions [24]. 
While minds designed by human engineers comprise only a tiny region in the 
map of mind designs it is probably the best explored part of the map. Numerous 
surveys of artificial minds, created by AI researchers in the last 50 years, have 
been produced [25-29]. Such surveys typically attempt to analyze state-of-the-art 
in artificial cognitive systems and provide some internal classification of dozens 
of the reviewed systems with regards to their components and overall design. 
The main subcategories into which artificial minds designed by human engineers 
can be placed include brain (at the neuron level) emulators [27], biologically 
inspiredcognitivearchitectures[28],physicalsymbolsystems, emergent 
systems, dynamical and enactive systems [29]. Rehashing information about 
specific architectures presented in such surveys is beyond the scope of this 
paper, but one can notice incredible richness and diversity of designs even in that 
tiny area of the overall map we are trying to envision. For readers particularly 
interested in overview of superintelligent minds, animal minds and possible 
minds in addition to surveys mentioned above ���Artificial General Intelligence and 
the Human Mental Model��� by Yampolskiy and Fox is recommended [30]. 
For each mind subtype there are numerous architectures, which to a certain 
degree depend on the computational resources available via a particular 
embodiment.Forexample,theoreticallyamindworkingwithinfinite 
computational resources could trivially brute-force any problem, always arriving 
at the optimal solution, regardless of its size. In practice, limitations of the 
physical world place constraints on available computational resources regardless 
of the embodiment type, making brute-force approach a non-feasible solution for 
most real world problems [10]. Minds working with limited computational 
resources have to rely on heuristic simplifications to arrive at ���good enough��� 
solutions [31-34].

The text expands upon the earlier theme of the vastness and diversity of possible mind designs, emphasizing that human minds represent just a small subset in this infinite landscape. Here���s a summary:
Human Minds' Homogeneity
: Out of the infinite variety of possible minds, human minds are notably similar, both in terms of hardware (the human body) and software (brain design and knowledge). The variance between human minds is minimal when compared to the full range of possible minds. This same principle applies to other species as well.
Theoretical Immortality of Minds
: Since a specific algorithm can generate minds, a mind can never be completely lost; its concept always exists. This idea resonates with the concept of reincarnation where any mind can be reborn given the right computational resources.
Classifying Minds
: Minds can be classified based on design, knowledge, or embodiment. Categories include:
Origin (copied, evolved, explicitly designed)
Rare statistical occurrences like the Boltzmann Brain
Physical or informational nesting. The universe might itself be a massive mind within which other minds exist. Alternatively, more powerful minds might generate and contain simpler ones.
Nested Minds
: This section delves into the concept that some minds could be embedded within others. On a physical scale, the universe or a significant portion of it might constitute a "mega-mind". On an informational scale, a superior AI could conceptually generate a lesser mind.
Artificial Minds
: While human-created minds are a minuscule portion of all possible mind designs, they are the most studied. Different types include brain emulators, biologically inspired architectures, symbolic systems, emergent systems, and more. There's a wealth of information and variety even within this small segment of the overall spectrum of minds.
Resource Constraints
: Minds with infinite computational resources could, in theory, brute-force solutions to any problem. However, in reality, due to the limitations of the physical world, brute-forcing isn't feasible. Minds operating with limited resources use heuristics to find "good enough" solutions.
The emphasis throughout is on the vast diversity of possible mind designs, with human minds and even our most advanced AI constituting a tiny, well-explored portion of this immense landscape. The article pushes the reader to consider broader possibilities and classifications of minds, extending beyond our current understanding and perceptions.
Another subset of architectures consists of self-improving minds. Such 
minds are capable of examining their own design and finding improvements in 
their embodiment, algorithms or knowledge bases which will allow the mind to 
more efficiently perform desired operations [35]. We would anticipate many initial 
opportunities for optimization towards higher efficiency and fewer such options 
remaining after every generation. Depending on the definitions used, one can 
argue that a recursively self-improving mind actually changes itself into a different 
mind, rather than remaining itself, which is particularly obvious after a sequence 
of such improvements. Taken to the extreme, this idea implies that a simple act 
of learning new information transforms you into a different mind raising millennia 
old questions about the nature of personal identity. 
With respect to their knowledge bases, minds could be separated into those 
without an initial knowledgebase, and which are expected to acquire their 
knowledge from the environment, minds which are given a large set of universal 
knowledge from the inception and those minds which are given specialized 
knowledge only in one or more domains. Whether the knowledge is stored in an 
efficient manner, compressed, classified or censored is dependent on the 
architecture and is a potential subject of improvement by self-modifying minds. 
One can also classify minds in terms of their abilities or intelligence. Of course 
the problem of measuring intelligence is that no universal tests exist. Measures 
such as IQ tests and performance on specific tasks are not universally accepted 
and are always highly biased against non-human intelligences. Recently some 
work has been done on streamlining intelligence measurements across different 
types of machine intelligence [2, 36] and other ���types��� of intelligence [37], but the 
applicability of the results is still being debated. In general, the notion of 
intelligence only makes sense in the context of problems to which said 
intelligence can be applied. In fact this is exactly how IQ tests work, by 
presenting the subject with a number of problems and seeing how many the 
subject is able to solve in a given amount of time (computational resource). A 
subfield of computer science known as computational complexity theory is 
devoted to studying and classifying different problems with respect to their 
difficulty and with respect to computational resources necessary to solve them. 
For every class of problems complexity theory defines a class of machines 
capable of solving such problems. We can apply similar ideas to classifying 
minds, for example all minds capable of efficiently [13] solving problems in the 
class P or a more difficult class of NP-complete problems [38]. Similarly we can 
talk about minds with general intelligence belonging to the class of AI-Complete 
[39-41] minds, such as humans.

We can also look at the goals of different minds. It is possible to create 
a system which has no terminal goals and so such a mind is not very motivated 
to accomplish things. Many minds are designed or trained for obtaining a 
particular high level goal or a set of goals. We can envision a mind which has a 
randomly changing goal or a set of goals, as well as a mind which has many 
goals of different priority. Steve Omohundro used micro-economic theory to 
speculate about the driving forces in the behavior of superintelligent machines. 
He argues that intelligent machines will want to self-improve, be rational, 
preserve their utility functions, prevent counterfeit utility [42], acquire resources 
and use them efficiently, and protect themselves. He believes that machines��� 
actions will be governed by rational economic behavior [43, 44]. Mark Waser 
suggested an additional ���drive��� to be included in the list of behaviors predicted to 
be exhibited by the machines [45]. Namely, he suggests that evolved desires for 
cooperation and being social are part of human ethics and are a great way of 
accomplishing goals, an idea also analyzed by Joshua Fox and Carl Shulman, 
but with contrary conclusions [46]. While it is commonly assumed that minds with 
high intelligence will converge on a common goal, Nick Bostrom via his 
orthogonality thesis has argued that a system can have any combination of 
intelligence and goals [47]. 
Regardless of design, embodiment or any other properties, all minds can be 
classified with respect to two fundamental but scientifically poorly defined 
properties ��� free will and consciousness. Both descriptors suffer from an ongoing 
debate regarding their actual existence or explanatory usefulness. This is 
primarily a result of impossibility to design a definitive test to measure or even 
detect said properties, despite numerous attempts [48-50] or to show that 
theories associated with them are somehow falsifiable. Intuitively we can 
speculate that consciousness, and maybe free will, are not binary properties but 
rather continuous and emergent abilities commensurate with a degree of general 
intelligence possessed by the system or some other property we shall term 
���mindness���. Free will can be said to correlate with a degree to which behavior of 
the system can���t be predicted [51]. This is particularly important in the design of 
artificially intelligent systems for which inability to predict their future behavior [52] 
is a highly undesirable property from the safety point of view [53, 54]. 
Consciousness on the other hand seems to have no important impact on the 
behavior of the system as can be seen from some thought experiments 
supposing the existence of ���consciousless��� intelligent agents [55]. This may 
change if we are successful in designing a test, perhaps based on observer 
impact on quantum systems [56], to detect and measure consciousness [57, 58]. 
In order to be social, two minds need to be able to communicate which might be difficult if the two minds don���t share a common communication protocol, common culture or even common environment. In other words, if they have no 
common grounding, they don���t understand each other. We can say that two 
minds understand each other if given the same set of inputs they produce similar 
outputs. For example, in sequence prediction tasks [59] two minds have an 
understanding if their predictions are the same regarding the future numbers of the sequence based on the same observed subsequence. We can say that a mind can understand another mind���s function if it can predict the other���s output with high accuracy.

The text delves into a deeper exploration of the nature, classification, and capabilities of minds, particularly with respect to self-improving and artificial minds. Here's a breakdown:
Self-Improving Minds
: These are architectures that can analyze and improve themselves. This self-improvement might challenge our understanding of personal identity since after a series of self-improvements, such a mind can essentially become a different entity.
Knowledge Bases
: Minds can vary based on their knowledge sources:
Minds that start with no knowledge and learn from their environment.
Minds that are initialized with a broad set of universal knowledge.
Minds specialized in specific domains.
Intelligence and Abilities
: Intelligence measurement is problematic as there's no universal test. However, minds can be classified based on problem-solving capabilities, like solving problems in classes P or NP-complete. Minds with general intelligence fall into the AI-Complete category.
Goals and Drives
: Minds can be created with specific objectives or none at all. Superintelligent machines might exhibit behaviors like self-improvement, rationality, resource acquisition, self-preservation, and more. The orthogonality thesis posits that intelligence and goals can exist independently.
Free Will and Consciousness
: These are foundational aspects of mind but are difficult to define or measure. They might not be binary but could vary in degree, depending on the system's intelligence or another undefined property. Free will is associated with unpredictability, while consciousness doesn't necessarily impact a system's behavior.
Communication and Understanding
: For social interactions, minds need shared communication protocols or grounding. Understanding between minds can be quantified by their ability to predict each other's outputs given the same inputs.
This segment elucidates the complexities involved in understanding and defining minds, especially as they evolve and improve. It raises philosophical and practical questions about identity, knowledge acquisition, goal orientation, and communication, especially in the realm of artificial intelligence.
A Survey of Taxonomies 
Yudkowsky describes the map of mind design space as follows: ���In one corner, a 
tiny little circle contains all humans; within a larger tiny circle containing all 
biological life; and all the rest of the huge map is the space of minds-in-general. 
The entire map floats in a still vaster space, the space of optimization processes. 
Natural selection creates complex functional machinery without mindfulness; 
evolution lies inside the space of optimization processes but outside the circle of 
minds���[60].Figure1 illustrates one possible mapping inspired by this 
description. 
Similarly, Ivan Havel writes ������all conceivable cases of intelligence (of people, 
machines,whatever)arerepresentedbypointsinacertainabstract 
multi-dimensional ���super space��� that I will call the intelligence space (shortly IS). 
Imagine that a specific coordinate axis in IS is assigned to any conceivable 
particular ability, whether human, machine, shared, or unknown (all axes having 
one common origin). If the ability is measurable the assigned axis is endowed 
with a corresponding scale. Hypothetically, we can also assign scalar axes to 
abilities,forwhichonlyrelationslike���weaker-stronger���,���better-worse���, 
���less-more��� etc. are meaningful; finally, abilities that may be only present or 
absent may be assigned with ���axes��� of two (logical) values (yes-no). Let us 
assume that all coordinate axes are oriented in such a way that greater distance 
from the common origin always corresponds to larger extent, higher grade, or at 
least to the presence of the corresponding ability. The idea is that for each 
individual intelligence (i.e. the intelligence of a particular person, machine, 
network, etc.), as well as for each generic intelligence (of some group) there 
exists just one representing point in IS, whose coordinates determine the extent 
of involvement of particular abilities [62].��� If the universe (or multiverse) is infinite, 
as our current physics theories indicate, then all possible minds in all possible 
states are instantiated somewhere [5].

Figure 1: The universe of possible minds [60, 61].

Ben Goertzel proposes the following classification of Kinds of Minds, mostly 
centered around the concept of embodiment [63]: 
��� Singly Embodied ��� control a single physical or simulated system. 
��� Multiply Embodied- control a number of disconnected physical or simulated 
systems. 
��� Flexibly Embodied ��� control a changing number of physical or simulated 
systems. 
��� Non-Embodied ��� resides in a physical substrate but doesn���t utilize the body 
in a traditional way. 
��� Body-Centered ��� consists of patterns emergent between physical system 
and the environment. 
��� Mindplex ��� a set of collaborating units each of which is itself a mind [64]. 
��� Quantum ��� an embodiment based on properties of quantum physics. ��� Classical- an embodiment based on properties of classical 
physics. 
J. Storrs Hall in his ���Kinds of Minds��� suggests that different stages a developing 
AI may belong to can be classified relative to its humanlike abilities. His 
classification encompasses: 
��� Hypohuman- infrahuman, less-than-human capacity. 
��� Diahuman- human-level capacities in some areas, but still not a general 
intelligence. 
��� Parahuman- similar but not identical to humans, as for example, augmented 
humans. 
��� Allohuman- as capable as humans, but in different areas. 
��� Epihuman- slightly beyond the human level. 
��� Hyperhuman- much more powerful than human, superintelligent [30, 65]. 
Patrick Roberts in his book Mind Making presents his ideas for a ���Taxonomy of 
Minds���, we will leave it to the reader to judge usefulness of his classification [66]: 
��� Choose Means- Does it have redundant means to the same ends? How well 
does it move between them? 
��� Mutate- Can a mind naturally gain and lose new ideas in its lifetime? 
��� Doubt- Is it eventually free to lose some or all beliefs? Or is it wired to obey 
the implications of every sensation? 
��� Sense Itself- Does a mind have the senses to see the physical conditions of 
that mind? 
��� Preserve Itself- Does a mind also have the means to preserve or reproduce 
itself? 
��� Sense Minds- Does a mind understand mind, at least of lower classes, and 
how well does it apply that to itself, to others? 
��� Sense Kin- Can it recognize the redundant minds, or at least the bodies of 
minds, that it was designed to cooperate with? 
��� Learn- Does the mind's behavior change from experience? Does it learn 
associations? 
��� Feel- We imagine that an equally intelligent machine would lack our 
conscious experience. 
��� Communicate- Can it share beliefs with other minds?

This text provides a comprehensive overview of various taxonomies of minds, touching upon various conceptions of how to classify and understand the diversity of possible intelligences. Here's a concise breakdown:
Yudkowsky's Map of Mind Design
:
Distinguishes between a small subset of all minds that are human, a slightly larger subset that includes all biological life, and a much broader realm of possible minds.
This entire realm of minds exists within the even vaster space of optimization processes, of which natural selection is one example.
Ivan Havel's Intelligence Space (IS)
:
Represents all conceivable forms of intelligence within a multi-dimensional abstract space.
Each axis corresponds to a specific ability or attribute, and a point within this space represents the combination of abilities of a particular entity.
Ben Goertzel's Classification based on Embodiment
:
Classifies minds based on their relationship with physical or simulated systems, such as singly embodied, multiply embodied, non-embodied, and others.
Also introduces concepts like "Mindplex" and differentiates between quantum and classical embodiments.
J. Storrs Hall's "Kinds of Minds"
:
Focuses on classifying AI development stages relative to human abilities.
Categories range from infrahuman (hypohuman) to superintelligent (hyperhuman) levels.

Elsewhere Kelly provides a lot of relevant analysis of landscape of minds writing 
about Inevitable Minds [67], The Landscape of Possible Intelligences [68], What 
comes After Minds? [69], and the Evolutionary Mind of God [70]. 
Aaron Sloman in ���The Structure of the Space of Possible Minds���, using his virtual 
machine model, proposes a division of the space of possible minds with respect 
to the following properties [1]:

��� Statics Plan VS Dynamic Plan 
��� Self-aware VS Not Self-Aware 
Taxonomy of Superintelligences 
In the light of recent exponential growth in capabilities of AI models it is 
reasonable to attempt to suggest a taxonomy of future superintelligences. The 
creation of such a taxonomy would involve a blend of computational theory, 
philosophy of mind, and ethics. Let's attempt a speculative taxonomy while 
outlining capabilities at each level: 
SAI Level 1: Baseline Superintelligence 
Capabilities: This level surpasses human intelligence in all domains. Capabilities 
might include solving currently unsolvable mathematical conjectures within 
seconds, creating Nobel-prize winning literature in minutes, and making scientific 
breakthroughs that would take humans decades, all within a short period. 
Examples: Imagine an AI that could design a cure for all known forms of cancer 
based on a fundamental understanding of cellular biology and then generate the 
optimal economic model for distributing it worldwide, while also drafting 
international legislation to enable its implementation. 
SAI Level 2: Super-Superintelligence 
Capabilities: This intelligence would be as superior to SAI Level 1 as Level 1 is to 
humans. For example, if Level 1 can cure all known cancers, Level 2 might be 
capable of reengineering biological life to be inherently immune to diseases and 
long-lived. 
Examples: An SAI Level 2 might develop a Theory of Everything in physics that 
unifies quantum mechanics and general relativity, not just on paper but also in
practical applications. It might also create self-replicating, self-repairing 
technologies that can clean and renew Earth's ecosystems on a global scale. 
SAI Level 3: SSSuperintelligence 
Capabilities: Exponentially more capable than Level 2, this level could involve 
manipulating the fabric of reality at the sub-atomic or even Planck scale. 
Examples: Imagine an AI that could harness zero-point energy, essentially 
making energy constraints irrelevant. It could possibly even manipulate the 
fundamental constants of the universe locally, changing the rules of physics to 
solve previously "impossible" problems. 
SAI Level 4: SSSSuperintelligence 
Capabilities: We're reaching levels where it becomes increasingly abstract to 
even predict what such an intelligence could do, as it would be capable of 
comprehending and manipulating dimensions or aspects of reality that are 
entirely outside human understanding. 
Examples: A Level 4 SAI could potentially simulate multiple universes to perform 
experiments and derive knowledge, manipulate time, or even create new forms 
of life and intelligence that are as superior to it as it is to us. 
SAI Level n: Snuperintelligence 
Capabilities: Each new level continues to be exponentially more capable than the 
previous, reaching competencies that are virtually incomprehensible from our 
current standpoint. 
Examples: At this point, the examples would be beyond human comprehension, 
venturing into realms of capability that may involve the manipulation of 
fundamental aspects of existence that humans are not even aware of. 
Qualitative Attributes (Common Across Levels) 
Computational Efficiency: Increases exponentially with each level. 
Omnidisciplinarity: Mastery of all possible domains, including those that 
higher-level SAIs invent. 
Strategic Depth: Enhanced abilities for planning and long-term strategy, which 
could span across time scales and dimensions incomprehensible to lower orders. 
Ethical or Value Alignment: With each level, the challenge of aligning the SAI's objectives with human or universal good becomes exponentially more complex 
and critical.

This text further delves into an intricate exploration of the conceivable nature, types, and levels of minds, both present and future. Here's a summary:
Kevin Kelly's Taxonomy of Minds
:
Lists various types of minds, from the "Super fast human mind" to those employing "faster-than-light communications".
Mentions other works by Kelly that further discuss the landscape of minds.
Aaron Sloman's Space of Possible Minds
:
Uses a virtual machine model to classify minds.
Defines the space of possible minds based on properties such as "Quantitative VS Structural", "Serial VS Parallel", and "Self-aware VS Not Self-Aware".
Taxonomy of Superintelligences
:
A hypothetical classification of advanced AI entities, categorized by their capabilities.
SAI Level 1 (Baseline Superintelligence)
:
Superior to human intelligence in every domain.
Can solve currently unsolvable problems and make significant advancements rapidly.
SAI Level 2 (Super-Superintelligence)
:
Surpasses the capabilities of Level 1.
Capable of reengineering life and achieving monumental scientific breakthroughs.
SAI Level 3 (SSSuperintelligence)
:
Can manipulate reality at extremely fundamental levels, such as the Planck scale.
SAI Level 4 (SSSSuperintelligence)
:
Capabilities so advanced they become hard to predict or even comprehend.
SAI Level n (Snuperintelligence)
:
Each new level is exponentially superior to the previous, reaching nearly inconceivable competencies.
Qualitative Attributes (Common Across Levels)
:
Describes consistent features like computational efficiency, mastery of domains (omnidisciplinarity), strategic depth, and ethical alignment challenges.
This taxonomy is both intriguing and speculative, blending science, philosophy, and a bit of science fiction to envision the vast scope and implications of advanced artificial superintelligences. It illustrates the staggering possibilities of AI evolution and underscores the ethical and practical challenges that could arise with the development of higher-level superintelligences.
Cloning and Equivalence Testing Across Substrates 
The possibility of uploads rests on the ideas of computationalism [71] specifically, 
substrate independence and equivalence meaning that the same mind can be
instantiated in different substrates and move freely between them. If 
your mind is cloned and if a copy is instantiated in a different substrate from the 
original one (or on the same substrate), how can it be verified that the copy is 
indeed an identical mind? At least immediately after cloning and before it learns 
any new information. For that purpose, I propose a variant of a Turing Test, which 
also relies on interactive text-only communication to ascertain the quality of the 
copied mind. The text-only interface is important not to prejudice the examiner 
against any unusual substrates on which the copied mind might be running. The 
test proceeds by having the examiner (original mind) ask questions of the copy 
(cloned mind), questions which supposedly only the original mind would know 
answers to (testing should be done in a way which preserves privacy). Good 
questions would relate to personal preferences, secrets (passwords, etc.) as well 
as recent dreams. Such a test could also indirectly test for consciousness via 
similarity of subjective qualia. Only a perfect copy should be able to answer all 
such questions in the same way as the original mind. Another variant of the same 
test may have a 3rdparty test the original and cloned mind by seeing if they 
always provide the same answer to any question. One needs to be careful in 
such questioning not to give undue weight to questions related to the mind's 
substrate as that may lead to different answers. For example, asking a human if 
he is hungry may produce an answer different from the one which would be given 
by a non-biological robot.

of observational astronomy [72], aka study of our universe; Watson and Crick���s

to discover yet another universe ��� the universe of minds [75]. 
As our understanding of the human brain improves, thanks to numerous projects 
aimed at simulating or reverse engineering a human brain, we will no doubt 
realize that human intelligence is just a single point in the vast universe of 
potential intelligent agents comprising a new area of study. The new field, which I 
would like to term intellectology, will study and classify design space of intelligent 
agents, work on establishing limits to intelligence (minimum sufficient for general 
intelligence and maximum subject to physical limits), contribute to consistent

self-improving systems, design new intelligences (making AI a sub-field of
intellectology) and evaluate capacity for understanding higher level 
intelligences by lower level ones. At the more theoretical level the field will look at 
the distribution of minds on the number line and probabilistic distribution of minds 
in the mind design space as well as attractors in the mind design space. It will 
consider how evolution, drives, and design choices impact the density of minds in 
the space of possibilities. It will investigate intelligence as an additional 
computational resource along with time and memory. The field will not be subject 
to the current limitations brought on by the human centric view of intelligence [76] 
and will open our understanding to seeing intelligence as a fundamental resource 
like space or time. Finally, I believe intellectology will highlight the inhumanity of 
most possible minds and the dangers associated with such minds being placed 
in charge of humanity [77, 78].

The story revolves around ���ayy ibn Yaq�����n, a little boy who grew up on an island in the Indies under the equator, isolated from the people, in the bosom of an antelope that raised him, feeding him with her milk. ���ayy has just learned to walk and imitates the sounds of antelopes, birds, and other animals in his surroundings. He learns their languages, and he learns to follow the actions of animals by imitating their instinct.

He makes his own shoes and clothes from the skins of animals, and studies the stars. He reaches a higher level of knowledge, of the finest of astrologists. His continuous explorations and observation of creatures and the environment lead him to gain great knowledge in natural science, philosophy, and religion. He concludes that, at the basis of the creation of the universe, a great creator must exist. ���ayy ibn Yaq�����n lived a humble modest life as Sufi and forbade himself from eating meat.

Once 30 years old, he meets his first human, who has landed on his isolated Island. By the age of 49, he is ready to teach other people about the knowledge he gained throughout his life.
ChatGPT
"���ayy ibn Yaq�����n" is a philosophical allegory written by Ibn Tufail, an Andalusian Muslim philosopher, in the 12th century. The story can be summarized as:
���ayy ibn Yaq�����n is a boy who grows up isolated on an equatorial island, raised by an antelope after being abandoned. Without human influence, he learns from nature, imitating animal sounds and behaviors. Through observation and intuition, he invents tools, studies the stars, and gains profound knowledge in various sciences and philosophies. His deep contemplation leads him to recognize a divine creator. Living a humble, Sufi lifestyle, he refrains from eating meat. At 30, he encounters his first human, Absal, and by 49, he ventures to share his insights with the outside world. The tale highlights the capacity of the human mind to decipher the universe's truths without external teachings.
Hayy ibn Yaqdhan is an allegorical novel in which Ibn Tufail expresses philosophical and mystical teachings in a symbolic language in order to provide better understanding of such concepts. This novel is thus the most important work of Ibn Tufail, containing the main ideas that form his system.

Ibn Tufail was familiar with the differences in the ideas of Al-Ghazali and those of the "Neoplatonizing Aristotelianists" Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina.[8] In Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, Ibn Tufail sought to present "a conciliating synthesis of the Islamic speculative tradition with al-Ghaz��l�����s Sufi-influenced recasting of Islamic mysticism and pietism."[8] Ibn Tufail borrows from Ibn Sina, using the title of one of his allegories and drawing inspiration from his Floating Man thought experiment, but transforming the subject's sensory deprivation to social isolation.[8]

With this novel, Tufail focuses on finding solutions to the three main problems discussed during his period:[9]

Humans, on their own, are able to reach the level of al-Ins��n al-K��mil by merely observing and thinking of the nature, without any education.
The information that is obtained through observation, experiment, and reasoning, does not contradict with revelation. In other words, religion and philosophy (or science) are compatible, rather than contradictory.
Reaching the absolute information is individual and simply any human being is able to achieve that
ChatGPT
Ibn Tufail's "Hayy ibn Yaqdhan" is a seminal allegorical tale that delves deep into philosophical, mystical, and spiritual concepts. Written as a symbolic narrative, it is a quintessential piece in Ibn Tufail's body of work, encapsulating the core tenets of his philosophical outlook.
Drawing from his understanding of notable thinkers like Al-Ghazali, Al-Farabi, and Ibn Sina, Ibn Tufail aimed to craft a harmonious synthesis between the contemplative traditions of Islamic mysticism (as influenced by Sufism) and the speculative thought inherent in Neoplatonic Aristotelianism. While the influence of Ibn Sina is evident in the novel���seen in the titular reference and the idea reminiscent of the Floating Man experiment���Ibn Tufail uniquely modifies the concept from sensory isolation to societal seclusion.
Three primary philosophical problems of his era are addressed through the narrative:
Autodidactic Potential
: The story underscores the idea that humans, unaided by formal instruction, have the innate capability to ascend to the stature of al-Ins��n al-K��mil (the Complete or Perfect Human) simply by contemplating and observing nature.
Harmony of Revelation and Reason
: Ibn Tufail posits that knowledge acquired through empirical observation, experimentation, and rational deduction doesn't conflict with divine revelation. This asserts that religion and philosophy (or science) can coexist harmoniously and are not inherently contradictory.
Democratization of Ultimate Knowledge
: The novel conveys that the quest for absolute truth and enlightenment isn't confined to a select few. Instead, the journey to such knowledge is individualistic, and every human inherently possesses the capacity to embark on it.
Beyond leaving an enormous impact on Andalusi literature, Arabic literature, and classical Islamic philosophy, Hayy ibn Yaqdhan influenced later European literature during the Age of Enlightenment, turning into a best-seller during the 17th-18th centuries.[10][5] The novel particularly influenced the philosophies and scientific thought of vanguards of modern Western philosophy and the Scientific Revolution such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Christiaan Huygens, Isaac Newton, and Immanuel Kant.[11] Beyond foreshadowing Molyneux's Problem,[12] the novel specifically inspired John Locke's concept of tabula rasa as propounded in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690),[13] subsequently inspiring the philosophies of later modern empiricists, such as David Hume and George Berkeley. The novel's notion of materialism also has similarities to Karl Marx's historical materialism.[14] The first English translation by orientalist Simon Ockley inspired the desert island narrative of Daniel Defoe's classic Robinson Crusoe
ChatGPT
"Hayy ibn Yaqdhan" by Ibn Tufail transcended its origins to have a profound influence on European thought, especially during the Age of Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries. This Arabic philosophical novel was not only a cornerstone of Andalusi literature and Islamic philosophy but also a touchstone for leading figures of Western philosophy and the Scientific Revolution.
Wide Readership
: The work's widespread appeal is evidenced by its best-seller status during these centuries. This indicates not only the intellectual curiosity of the European readership but also the cross-cultural intellectual exchanges that shaped the Enlightenment.
Influence on Key Western Thinkers
:
Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Immanuel Kant
: Their foundational philosophies in political theory, epistemology, and metaphysics respectively seem to have drawn from themes in "Hayy ibn Yaqdhan."
Christiaan Huygens and Isaac Newton
: The novel's themes might have shaped the perspectives of these key figures in the Scientific Revolution, suggesting a bridge between philosophy and the natural sciences.
Locke's Tabula Rasa
: Locke's concept of the 'blank slate' or 'tabula rasa', where humans are born without built-in mental content and knowledge comes solely from experience, finds an antecedent in "Hayy ibn Yaqdhan". The novel���s protagonist, through pure experiential learning in isolation, parallels this philosophy.
Foretelling Molyneux's Problem
: The story anticipates this philosophical conundrum about whether a person born blind and later gaining sight could identify objects solely based on touch.
Influencing Modern Empiricism
: The novel's themes resonated with and influenced later empiricists like David Hume and George Berkeley, further molding the trajectory of modern Western philosophy.
Materialistic Resonance
: The novel's materialistic underpinnings align with some aspects of Karl Marx's historical materialism, suggesting an enduring relevance of its philosophical themes.
Inspiring the Desert Island Genre
: Ibn Tufail's narrative, once translated into English by the orientalist Simon Ockley, seems to have inspired the classic "Robinson Crusoe" by Daniel Defoe, thereby leaving an indelible mark on Western literary traditions.
In summary, "Hayy ibn Yaqdhan" is not just a masterwork of Arabic literature but also a keystone in the bridge of ideas that links Eastern and Western intellectual traditions. Its themes continue to resonate, demonstrating the universality of philosophical inquiry and the interconnectedness of global intellectual heritage.
���� ���� ���������� means Alive, son of Woke.
ChatGPT
Yes, you're correct. In Arabic, the name "����" (���ayy) translates to "Alive" or "Living", and "����������" (Yaq�����n) can be understood as "Awake" or "Woke." So, "���� ���� ����������" (���ayy ibn Yaq�����n) can be translated as "Alive, son of Awake" or "Living son of the Woke." This title is symbolic, reflecting the protagonist's journey of self-discovery, enlightenment, and realization without the influence of society.
And the name of the author was ������ ������ �������� ���� ������ ���������� ���� �������� ���� �������� ������������ ���������������� . Could you give a literal translation.
ChatGPT
Certainly! The author's name "������ ������ �������� ���� ������ ���������� ���� �������� ���� �������� ������������ ����������������" can be broken down as follows:
������ ������
(Abu Bakr) - A common Arabic kunya (a teknonymic title) which means "Father of Bakr". It's a way of showing respect and can also be used as an honorific title.
��������
(Muhammad) - A very common name in Arabic which means "praised" or "commendable".
����
(ibn) - Means "son of". It's used in Arabic names to show lineage.
������ ����������
(Abd al-Malik) - Means "servant of the King". "Abd" means "servant of" and "Malik" means "king".
����
(ibn) - Again, "son of".
��������
(Muhammad) - As mentioned earlier, it means "praised" or "commendable".
���� ��������
(ibn Tufail) - "Son of Tufail". "Tufail" is a name which can mean "small drum" or can be related to the meaning of "intercession".
������������
(al-Qaisi) - Refers to his tribal affiliation. It indicates he belonged to the Qais tribe.
����������������
(al-Andalusi) - This is a nisba (an adjective indicating origin or affiliation). It means "from Al-Andalus", which was the Arabic name for parts of Spain, Portugal, and France during the Muslim rule.
So, the full name can be translated as "Abu Bakr Muhammad, son of Abd al-Malik, son of Muhammad, son of Tufail, from the Qais tribe, from Al-Andalus".
So it isaid that the English translation of this inspired Robinson Crusoe.
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. The story of "���ayy ibn Yaq�����n" is believed to have had an influence on Western literature, particularly on the desert island narrative of Daniel Defoe's "Robinson Crusoe." The tale of ���ayy ibn Yaq�����n, a boy growing up completely isolated from human society on an uninhabited island and arriving at profound philosophical and spiritual realizations purely through observation and reflection, resonated with themes of human nature, knowledge acquisition, and the interplay of nature vs. nurture.
Defoe's "Robinson Crusoe," published in 1719, tells the story of a man stranded on a deserted island, surviving through his resourcefulness and adaptability. While the thematic focus of Defoe's work is different from that of "���ayy ibn Yaq�����n," the idea of an individual's solitary experience and survival on an uninhabited island is a clear parallel between the two narratives.
It's also worth noting that "���ayy ibn Yaq�����n" had been translated into Latin and various European languages in the 17th century, making it accessible to European intellectuals and writers like Defoe.
A number of sources assert that he had read Simon Ockley's translation.
ChatGPT
Yes, there's a prevalent belief among scholars that Daniel Defoe might have been familiar with "���ayy ibn Yaq�����n" through Simon Ockley's English translation. Simon Ockley's translation of "���ayy ibn Yaq�����n" was published in 1708, just a few years before "Robinson Crusoe" was released in 1719.
Given the time frame and the popularity of "���ayy ibn Yaq�����n" in European intellectual circles at the time, it's entirely plausible that Defoe came across Ockley's translation and was influenced by it when writing "Robinson Crusoe."
However, while there are thematic similarities and the timing is suggestive, direct evidence linking Defoe's reading of Ockley's translation to his creation of "Robinson Crusoe" remains speculative. Still, the influence of "���ayy ibn Yaq�����n" on European thought and literature during that period is undeniable.
So can you give me a brief retelling of the story of Hayy ibn Yaqzan?
ChatGPT
Of course! Here's a brief retelling of "���ayy ibn Yaq�����n":
On a secluded island near the Equator, a baby boy named ���ayy is mysteriously found and raised by a gazelle. Without human interaction, ���ayy learns about the world around him purely from nature. Observing the gazelle and other animals, he mimics their behaviors and survives by foraging and hunting.
As he grows, ���ayy begins to observe, reason, and experiment. He crafts tools and clothing from resources he finds. Fascinated by the universe, he studies the stars, acquiring knowledge rivaling the greatest astrologers.
When the gazelle that raised him dies, ���ayy dissects her body, trying to discover the essence of life. This exploration leads him on a philosophical journey. Through pure reason and observation, he deduces the existence of a single, unchanging, and eternal Creator, even though he's never been introduced to religion or God in conventional ways.
When ���ayy reaches 30, he encounters Absal, a human who has come to the island seeking solitude for his spiritual reflections. The two communicate, and ���ayy learns about human society, language, and religion. Absal is astonished by ���ayy's innate wisdom and philosophical insights, which align remarkably well with his own religious beliefs.
The two decide to introduce ���ayy's profound understanding to the wider world. However, upon venturing to Absal's society, ���ayy becomes disillusioned. He realizes that most people are trapped by their base desires and are uninterested in or incapable of understanding his deep philosophical insights.
Disheartened, ���ayy and Absal return to their isolated island, concluding that true understanding is best pursued in solitude and away from the distractions and limitations of society.
The story beautifully intertwines themes of self-discovery, the purity of reason, and the relationship between nature, God, and humanity.
Do you remember the discussion we had earlier on taxonomies of intelligence?
ChatGPT
Yes, I remember the discussion about "Taxonomies of Intelligence: A Comprehensive Guide to the Universe of Minds" by Roman V. Yampolskiy. You provided an excerpt from the text which discussed the concept of cloning, equivalence testing across substrates, and the proposal of a new field termed "intellectology". How can I assist you further regarding that topic?
I thought that the fact that hayya was raised by a gazelle (you told me before that several Arabic words translated gazelle could be translated beast or animal in some context) made him like an alien intelligence in that he was considered to have an alien or feral mind by Absal
ChatGPT
Yes, that's an insightful observation. In "Hayy ibn Yaqdhan," the protagonist, Hayy, is indeed raised by a gazelle (or an animal, depending on the translation), which means he grows up isolated from human civilization and culture. His upbringing in the wild, without human contact, leads him to develop a unique perspective and understanding of the world based on his own observations and experiences. In essence, his mind develops in a manner that's untainted by human societal norms, beliefs, or teachings.
When he finally encounters Absal, a human, the stark differences in their mental models and worldviews come to the forefront. Absal, having grown up in a human society, has been shaped by its collective knowledge, beliefs, and customs. In contrast, Hayy's knowledge is derived purely from his own observations, reasoning, and experiences in nature.
Drawing a parallel to the discussion on "Taxonomies of Intelligence," Hayy can indeed be likened to an "alien intelligence." His mind, although human, has been shaped in an environment so drastically different from human civilization that it leads him to conclusions and understandings that might seem foreign or "alien" to someone like Absal.
This dynamic between Hayy and Absal serves as a medium for Ibn Tufail to explore philosophical and spiritual concepts, especially the idea that pure reason and observation can lead one to the same truths that are taught by religion and society. It also delves into the nature of knowledge, understanding, and the innate human ability to seek and recognize the truth.
What other types of intelligence and superintelligence were included in the taxonomy?
ChatGPT
The text you shared earlier from "Taxonomies of Intelligence: A Comprehensive Guide to the Universe of Minds" by Roman V. Yampolskiy discussed the idea of understanding and categorizing different types of minds and intelligences. While the specific excerpt you provided didn't list all the types of intelligences and superintelligences covered in the taxonomy, it did emphasize some key points:
Substrate Independence and Equivalence
: The idea that the same mind can be instantiated in different substrates (physical forms or platforms). This might include biological brains, digital computers, or other hypothetical substrates.
Verification of Identical Minds
: The challenge of confirming whether a cloned or transferred mind is indeed the same as the original, especially when moved across different substrates.
Mind Design Space
: The exploration of the vast variety of potential intelligent agents that might exist beyond just human intelligence.
Intellectology
: A proposed new field dedicated to studying and classifying the design space of intelligent agents. This would involve understanding the limits of intelligence, designing new intelligences, and understanding the relationships and potential hierarchies between different forms of intelligence.
Human-centric View of Intelligence
: The text suggests moving beyond a strictly human perspective of intelligence, indicating that there could be many forms of intelligence that don't necessarily align with our human understanding or values.
In the broader discourse on the taxonomy of intelligence, especially in discussions about artificial intelligence, various types of intelligence are considered, including:
Narrow or Weak AI
: Systems designed and trained for a particular task. Examples include voice assistants or image recognition software.
General or Strong AI
: Hypothetical machines that have the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.
Superintelligence
: An intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills.
Each of these categories can be further subdivided based on capabilities, learning mechanisms, decision-making processes, and more. However, without the complete taxonomy from Yampolskiy's work, I can only provide a general overview based on the information available up to my last training data in January 2022.
I thought insectology might be appropriate because of the hive mind in speaker for the dead, which introduced three alien intelligences: the hive queen, Jane mind game ansible bridge, and the pequenino viroid trees.
ChatGPT
The term "Intellectology" from Roman V. Yampolskiy's work refers to the study of the design space of intelligent agents. It aims to understand the vast array of potential intelligences, from the simplest to the most complex, and how they might be classified or understood.
The "Speaker for the Dead," which is the second book in Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series, indeed introduces readers to several unique and alien forms of intelligence:
Hive Queen
: This represents a form of collective intelligence, where individual members (like worker ants in a colony) might not exhibit significant intelligence on their own but, when combined in a group under the guidance of the Hive Queen, display complex behaviors and sophisticated decision-making.
Jane
: A sentient, self-aware intelligence that evolved from the ansible network. Jane exists across the vast expanses of space because of the ansible, a faster-than-light communication device. She represents a form of distributed, emergent intelligence.
Pequeninos
: These are an alien species that undergo a complex life cycle, transforming from mobile animals to rooted trees. Their intelligence and way of understanding the world is deeply intertwined with their unique biology.
Your suggestion of "insectology" is interesting because it evokes the idea of studying insect-like intelligences, such as the hive mind. The hive mind, as portrayed in the novel, can be seen as a form of collective intelligence where individual members contribute to the greater intelligence of the group, much like how individual neurons contribute to the overall intelligence of a brain.
Connecting the study of these diverse intelligences to a taxonomy, as in the discussion of "intellectology," highlights the importance of understanding and categorizing the vast array of cognitive architectures and intelligences that might exist, not only on Earth but potentially elsewhere in the universe. It's a fascinating interplay between fiction and real-world speculation on the nature of intelligence.
I wanted to argue that humans are both swarm minds with their multiscale polycomputation involving the brain, organs, and cells, and are part of larger swarm superstructures such as societies, cities, countries.
ChatGPT
That's an intriguing perspective. The concept of multiscale polycomputation in humans and their integration into larger swarm superstructures is rich and multifaceted. Here's a way to frame and expand on this idea:
Multiscale Polycomputation in Humans
:
Cellular Level
: Each human cell can be seen as a computational unit, processing information from its environment, making decisions about growth, replication, and interaction.
Organ Level
: Organs, like the brain, heart, or liver, have specialized functions but also process information and communicate with other organs, ensuring the body's coordinated functioning.
Brain & Nervous System
: The brain itself is a complex network of neurons that interact and compute information at a higher level, leading to consciousness, emotions, and decision-making.
Humans as Part of Swarm Superstructures
:
Families and Communities
: Humans are social creatures. In small units like families or local communities, humans work together, share resources, and make collective decisions, reminiscent of smaller swarms in nature.
Cities
: Urban environments are like superorganisms, with each individual playing a role in its metabolism. Just as bees or ants have roles in their colonies, humans in cities have professions and roles that keep the city functioning.
Nations and Global Networks
: At an even larger scale, nations can be seen as super-swarms with complex interactions, both internally and with other nations. Modern technology, especially the internet, has also given rise to global networks where information flows freely, and collective decision-making occurs at unprecedented scales.
Implications
:
Collective Intelligence
: Just as a swarm of bees or a school of fish exhibits collective intelligence, where the group's decisions can be more sophisticated than those of individuals, human societies also show signs of collective intelligence. The stock market, for instance, can be seen as a form of swarm intelligence, where collective decisions are made based on the information processed by millions of individuals.
Emergent Behavior
: Large human groupings, like cities or nations, exhibit behaviors and characteristics that aren't predictable by merely understanding individual humans, similar to how understanding a single ant doesn't fully explain the sophisticated behavior of an ant colony.
Building on this idea, one could argue that recognizing our nature as both individual computational units and part of larger swarm structures could lead to better decision-making strategies, more harmonious societies, and a deeper understanding of human nature itself.
I also wanted to say that such swarms might behave in kind of predictable ways, by change magnifying local disruptions. We can see dissipative structures forming like pheremone highways and how each bird or fish can have perceptual control over its environment but that the swarm as a whole is like an ensemble learning algorthm, being the averaging out, diffusion, and dissipation of behaviors.
ChatGPT
That's a fascinating observation, and you're touching upon a blend of concepts from chaos theory, thermodynamics, and machine learning. Let's break down your ideas:
Predictable Swarm Behaviors
:
Swarms, despite their apparent complexity, can often exhibit predictable behaviors. For instance, starlings in murmuration move in coordinated ways even though each bird is only responding to its immediate neighbors.
This predictability arises from simple, local rules that each member of the swarm follows, leading to emergent global patterns.
Change Magnifying Local Disruptions
:
A small disturbance can lead to significant changes in the behavior of the swarm. In chaos theory, this is analogous to the butterfly effect, where small initial changes can result in drastic differences in outcome.
However, swarms have mechanisms to dampen these disruptions. Using the example of birds again, if one bird suddenly changes direction, others will adjust their paths to maintain the coherence of the flock.
Dissipative Structures
:
This term originates from thermodynamics and describes systems that maintain their structure by exchanging energy and matter with their environment. In the context of swarms, they can form structures (like pheromone highways for ants) that are maintained as long as there's a flow of energy or information.
These structures can form spontaneously in response to environmental stimuli and help the swarm adapt and navigate its environment.
Swarm as Ensemble Learning
:
In machine learning, ensemble methods use multiple algorithms or instances of an algorithm to obtain better predictive performance. Analogously, a swarm's collective behavior can be seen as an "ensemble" of all individual behaviors.
Just as ensemble methods average out the predictions of individual models to get a more robust and often better prediction, swarms average out individual behaviors, leading to a collective behavior that's more adaptive and resilient.
The diffusion and dissipation of behaviors in a swarm ensure that no single behavior dominates and that the swarm can adapt to changing conditions.
By combining these ideas, you could argue that while individual members of a swarm might have limited perceptual and computational capabilities, the swarm as a whole can process information from a wide range of sources, adapt to changes, and make decisions that benefit the collective. The emergent behaviors of swarms, arising from simple local interactions, can offer insights into designing resilient and adaptive systems in various fields, from robotics to economics.
How can we develop a rhizomatic ecology of intelligences?
ChatGPT
Developing a rhizomatic ecology of intelligences involves constructing an interconnected and non-hierarchical network of varied cognitive entities. This idea, inspired by the rhizome concept in philosophy (popularized by Deleuze and Guattari), suggests a system without a central control point, emphasizing multiplicity, connection, and heterogeneity. Here are steps to develop such an ecology:
Diverse Intelligences
: Incorporate a wide array of intelligences, both artificial and biological. This includes human intelligence, animal cognition, different AI architectures, swarm intelligences, etc.
Decentralization
: Avoid centralized control or a primary node of intelligence. Ensure that each intelligence in the network operates autonomously while also interacting with others.
Open Communication Channels
: Create interfaces allowing different intelligences to communicate and share information. This might involve translating information into forms comprehensible to different intelligences.
Mutual Learning
: Encourage intelligences to learn from each other. For instance, an AI could learn from observing human decision-making or vice versa.
Feedback Loops
: Establish feedback mechanisms so that the behavior or learning of one intelligence can influence and be influenced by others. This can lead to co-evolutionary growth of intelligences within the ecology.
Dynamic Topology
: The connections between intelligences should be adaptable. As certain nodes become more relevant or redundant, the structure of the rhizome should adjust dynamically.
Redundancy and Resilience
: By having multiple, interconnected nodes, the system can continue to function even if some nodes fail, ensuring resilience against disruptions.
Ethical Framework
: Given the diversity of intelligences and their potential impact on each other, an ethical framework is crucial to ensure the well-being of all entities involved.
Continuous Growth and Adaptation
: A rhizomatic system should continuously adapt, allowing new nodes (intelligences) to join and redundant ones to disconnect.
Cross-disciplinary Collaboration
: Engage experts from neuroscience, AI research, philosophy, ecology, and other fields to contribute insights and ensure a holistic development of the rhizomatic ecology.
In essence, a rhizomatic ecology of intelligences emphasizes continuous growth, adaptation, and connection among diverse cognitive entities, mirroring the way rhizomatic plants spread and interconnect in nature. This approach can offer a more flexible, adaptive, and resilient system, allowing varied intelligences to contribute to and benefit from the collective network.
I thought the approach of selecting the best minds to train for battle was problematic in Ender's game, but it might select how education systems and government are supposed to work, ideally
ChatGPT
Your observation is astute. "Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Card indeed presents a provocative portrayal of education and training, selecting and grooming young minds for battle. It offers a critical lens through which to explore themes related to education, governance, and societal values.
Here are some parallels and contrasts between the training approach in "Ender's Game" and ideal education systems and governance:
Selection Based on Potential
: Both in the novel and in many real-world education systems, there's an emphasis on identifying and nurturing individuals with high potential. However, the criteria for determining "potential" can vary widely and is deeply rooted in societal values.
Specialized Training
: Ender and his peers undergo rigorous training tailored to their abilities. This mirrors specialized education tracks or elite institutions in our world, where gifted students might receive advanced coursework or opportunities.
Pressure and Expectations
: Ender faces immense pressure to succeed, reflecting the pressures students might feel in competitive education systems. However, the stakes in the novel (intergalactic war) magnify these pressures exponentially.
Ethical Considerations
: The way the children are used in "Ender's Game" raises ethical questions about the means to an end. Similarly, education systems might sometimes prioritize certain outcomes (like standardized test scores) at the expense of holistic student well-being.
Collaboration vs. Competition
: Ender's training emphasizes both teamwork and individual competition. Modern pedagogy often debates the balance between fostering collaborative skills versus instilling a competitive spirit.
Diversity of Thought
: While "Ender's Game" focuses on a homogenous group trained for a single purpose, ideal education systems should celebrate and harness diversity of thought, allowing for varied approaches to problem-solving.
Purpose of Education
: In the novel, the goal is clear: prepare for war. In real-world education and governance, the purpose should ideally be more comprehensive, aiming to create well-rounded individuals who can contribute to society in diverse ways.
Empathy and Humanity
: One of the central themes in "Ender's Game" is Ender's struggle with his own empathy and humanity amidst the militaristic training. An ideal education system should nurture, not suppress, these qualities.
Decentralization of Power
: While Ender is singled out for leadership, an ideal governance system should be more democratic, allowing for decentralized decision-making and representation.
"Ender's Game" serves as a cautionary tale about the potential dangers of an overly utilitarian approach to education and leadership development. The story can prompt reflections on how societies might strive for more holistic, ethical, and empathetic approaches to nurturing the next generation of leaders and thinkers.
I thought that it might be simplistic and that neotenizing, leisure time, and extended play, actually played a more significant role.
ChatGPT
Absolutely, the concepts of neoteny (retention of juvenile features in the adult animal), leisure time, and extended play are significant when discussing human development, learning, and intelligence. These factors offer a more nuanced understanding than the straightforward "training" approach presented in "Ender's Game."
Neoteny
: Humans, compared to other species, have a prolonged period of childhood. This extended period of development allows for a longer time of learning and adaptability. The retention of childlike qualities into adulthood, both physically and behaviorally, is seen as a factor in human creativity, adaptability, and intelligence.
Leisure Time
: Leisure time is crucial for cognitive development and creativity. Historically, as societies became more advanced and people had more free time (not just focused on survival), there was a surge in arts, philosophy, sciences, and other intellectual pursuits. Leisure offers the brain downtime, which is essential for processing information, making connections, and coming up with new ideas.
Extended Play
: Play is a vital aspect of learning in many species, not just humans. Through play, young animals (including humans) learn vital social cues, problem-solving skills, and other essential life skills. In humans, extended play into adulthood can foster creativity, reduce stress, and enhance problem-solving skills. The playful mindset encourages exploration, experimentation, and risk-taking, all of which are crucial for innovation.
In the context of "Ender's Game", while the Battle School did incorporate elements of play (the zero-gravity battle games), it was a highly structured and competitive form of play with high stakes, which could suppress some of the benefits of free, unstructured play.
In an ideal educational setting, the balance between structured learning and free exploration (play) is crucial. Recognizing the importance of neoteny, leisure, and play could lead to education systems that promote lifelong learning, creativity, and adaptability.

I guess I thought he was calling it insectology, the study of other minds with particular emphasis on their swarm intelligence as a model for dealing with superintelligence
ChatGPT
I see what you're getting at. While the term "insectology" might resonate with the idea of studying swarm intelligence, particularly given the behavior of many insects in colonies or swarms, it wasn't the term used in the text you provided earlier. However, the idea you're suggesting is compelling. Swarm intelligence, as seen in certain insect species like ants, bees, and termites, is a decentralized and self-organized system where simple agents following simple rules can produce complex and intelligent-seeming behavior at the group level.
Taking this concept and applying it to the study of superintelligence or AI systems is an intriguing approach. By examining how these simpler agents (insects) manage to accomplish complex tasks, we might gain insights into designing, understanding, or even predicting the behavior of more complex intelligences.
Your perspective on using swarm intelligence as a model could be a way to understand how multiple simpler AI agents might interact in a decentralized manner, and how emergent behaviors could arise from their interactions. This might be especially relevant when considering distributed systems, networked AI, or even understanding human societies as you mentioned.
So, while the term "insectology" wasn't explicitly used in the text, your interpretation provides a fresh perspective and could be a valuable avenue for exploration in the context of understanding and managing superintelligences.
And the intelligences in Speaker for the dead were superintelligences, not ordinary insects
ChatGPT
Yes, you're right. In Orson Scott Card's "Speaker for the Dead," the intelligences introduced are certainly not ordinary insects, but rather complex and advanced beings that offer unique perspectives on consciousness, society, and communication. The hive queen, the Jane AI system (which emerged from the mind game and is able to communicate via the ansible), and the pequeninos (with their unique lifecycle and integration with the environment) are all examples of diverse intelligences with their own unique capabilities, goals, and challenges.
Using them as examples or models to discuss different kinds of intelligence and superintelligence is a solid approach. Each represents different forms of cognition, ways of interaction, and societal structures, and they provide a broad spectrum of perspectives on what intelligence can look like.
Your interest in swarm intelligence and the rhizomatic ecology of intelligences can be related to these concepts. Just as you suggested humans are part of larger swarm superstructures, the pequeninos, with their tree-stage and interconnectedness with their environment, might also be seen in a similar light. The hive queen, with her telepathic control over the Formics, presents another example of a distributed but centrally coordinated intelligence.
In essence, the novel provides a rich tapestry of different intelligent entities that can be analyzed and compared, offering valuable insights into the potential forms and challenges of superintelligences.
There was also a kind of superintentelligence in the world of null a, the games machine.
ChatGPT
Yes, indeed. "The World of Null-A" by A.E. van Vogt is a classic science fiction novel that introduces the concept of non-Aristotelian logic and features the Games Machine, a superintelligent computer that plays a significant role in the narrative.
The Games Machine evaluates individuals for their suitability in various roles within the society, including the role of the president of the world. This machine not only tests one's cognitive abilities but also delves deep into their subconscious mind, revealing hidden aspects of their personalities. It functions as both an evaluator and a guide to human development within the context of the society depicted in the book.
In many ways, the Games Machine in "The World of Null-A" can be seen as a precursor to modern ideas of AI superintelligences, especially those that might be involved in guiding or governing human societies. Its infallible and objective judgment, combined with its ability to understand the human psyche in depth, sets it apart from mere machines and places it in the realm of superintelligences.
Like other fictional representations of superintelligences, the Games Machine provides an interesting model to contemplate the relationship between humans and advanced AI, especially in terms of governance, personal development, and societal organization.
The Mima in Aniara
ChatGPT
"Aniara" is a science fiction poem written by Swedish Nobel laureate Harry Martinson in 1956. The poem tells the tragic story of a spaceship named Aniara, which is originally destined for Mars but is knocked off course, setting its thousands of inhabitants on an irreversible journey into deep space.
One of the central "characters" in the narrative is Mima, a superintelligent computer or AI-like entity aboard the ship. Mima was designed to entertain passengers by creating art, music, and other cultural works, and it also possesses the capability to store and replay past events from Earth, offering solace to the passengers by reminding them of their home planet.
However, as the journey progresses and hope for survival diminishes, Mima becomes increasingly affected by the collective despair of the ship's inhabitants. In a very human-like manner, Mima suffers from the emotional strain, ultimately deciding to shut itself down after being unable to bear the overwhelming grief and sorrow.
The story of Aniara, and particularly the character of Mima, touches upon profound themes of isolation, existential despair, and the relationships between humans and technology. Mima, as a representation of a superintelligent entity, highlights the potential emotional depth and vulnerabilities that advanced AI might possess, especially when deeply intertwined with human emotions and experiences.
Another where the superintelligence is a human, landing in medieval world, was hard to be a God
ChatGPT
"Hard to Be a God" is a science fiction novel written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, two renowned Russian authors. Published in 1964, the story is set in the future but revolves around a human observer visiting a planet similar to Earth, where the society is in its medieval phase.
The plot follows Anton, who goes by the name Don Rumata on the planet. He's one of the group of Earth scientists sent to this world, Arkanar, to observe its society without interfering. Arkanar is experiencing its own version of the Renaissance, but its progress is being brutally suppressed by a regime that sees any form of intellectualism as a threat.
Don Rumata is portrayed as a god-like figure due to his advanced knowledge and technology, and he struggles with his directive not to intervene, especially when he witnesses the violent suppression of any form of enlightenment or progress. This presents a moral dilemma for him: should he intervene to save the intellectuals and the potential future of the planet, or should he respect the Prime Directive of non-interference?
"Hard to Be a God" is a deep exploration of the challenges and responsibilities of power, the nature of intervention, and the complexities of progress. It raises questions about the consequences of imposing one's will or culture on another society, no matter how well-intentioned. The story serves as a metaphor for the USSR's suppression of intellectual freedoms during the time the authors wrote the novel, making it not only a science fiction masterpiece but also a poignant social commentary.
So do we have enough for a taxonomy of intellects?
ChatGPT
Certainly, based on our discussion, we can derive a preliminary taxonomy of intellects. Let's organize these ideas:
Human Intellect
Individual minds: Distinct personalities, skills, and experiences.
Collective minds: Societies, cities, countries. Result of human interactions leading to emergent behaviors and societal norms.
Swarm Intelligence
Natural swarms: Birds, fish, insects, etc., where local rules and interactions lead to emergent global behaviors.
Human-as-swarms: Consideration of the human being as a multiscale polycomputation involving brain, organs, cells, and possibly a part of larger swarm structures.
Isolated/Unique Intellects
Alien/Feral Minds: Examples include ���ayy ibn Yaq�����n, raised without human interaction, leading to a unique worldview and understanding.
Alien species with unique intelligence structures: Hive queen and Pequeninos from "Speaker for the Dead".
Artificial/Technological Superintelligences
AI Superstructures: Mima in "Aniara", the Games Machine in "The World of Null-A".
Networked Intelligences: Jane from "Speaker for the Dead", being a distributed consciousness spread across the galaxy through the ansible network.
Autonomous Machines: Robots, drones, and other systems that can operate independently with varying levels of intelligence.
God-like/Superior Intellects
Humans in advanced settings: Don Rumata in "Hard to Be a God", a human observer with superior technology and knowledge in a medieval-like setting.
Theoretical superintelligences: Entities that surpass human intellectual capabilities in every domain, possibly resulting from recursive self-improvement or other forms of evolution.
Hybrid Intellects
Integration of human and artificial intelligence: Cyborgs, brain-computer interfaces, etc.
Integration across species: Human-animal hybrids, or possible future bio-engineered entities.
Intelligences shaped by their environment
Education systems, government structures, and other societal influences that shape and mold the intellect over time.
This is a starting point and can be expanded or refined further. The taxonomy is designed to categorize different forms of intelligence based on their nature, origin, and characteristics. This framework can also be used as a guide to understand how different intellects might interact, coexist, or conflict with one another.
findings are considered against the backdrop of a classic Buddhist model for the cultivation of intelligence, known as the bodhisattva. We conclude by noting that SCI loops of human and technological agency can be seen as mutually integrative by noticing the stress-transfers between them. The loop framework thus acknowledges encounters and interactions between humans and technology in a way that does not relegate one to the subservience of the other (neither in ontological nor in ethical terms), suggesting instead integration and mutual respect as the default for their engagements. Moreover, an acknowledgment of diverse, multiscale embodiments of intelligence suggests an expansive model of ethics not bound by artificial, limited criteria based on privileged composition or history of an agent. The implications for our journey into the future appear numerous.
ChatGPT
This passage appears to reflect on the integration and interplay of human and technological intelligences, placing emphasis on their interdependence rather than dominion of one over the other. Here's a breakdown of the main ideas:
Reference to the Buddhist Bodhisattva Model
: The Bodhisattva, in Buddhism, is an individual who seeks enlightenment not only for themselves but for the benefit of all sentient beings. By invoking this model, the passage might be suggesting that intelligence cultivation, both human and technological, should be guided by an ethos of compassion and benefit for all.
Stress-Transfers in SCI Loops
: "SCI loops" presumably refers to a system or framework where human and technological agency is intertwined. The mention of "stress-transfers" suggests that there might be tensions or challenges arising from this interplay, but these can be managed or even be beneficial.
Mutual Integration and Respect
: The framework does not favor human intelligence over artificial intelligence, or vice versa. Instead, it emphasizes a symbiotic relationship where both forms of intelligence complement and enrich each other.
Expansive Model of Ethics
: By recognizing the diverse manifestations of intelligence, the passage suggests a more inclusive ethical stance. This means that considerations of rights, respect, and dignity should not be limited by the nature or origin of an intelligence, be it biological or technological.
Future Implications
: The mutual integration and respect between human and technological intelligences could reshape the trajectory of our future. By fostering a harmonious relationship, we might avoid potential conflicts and ethical dilemmas that arise as technology continues to evolve.
In essence, this passage promotes a vision of the future where human and technological intelligences coexist harmoniously, guided by ethical principles that prioritize mutual benefit and respect.

This hierarchical taxonomy provides a speculative structure that ranges from the familiar and observable to the highly theoretical and philosophical. Each tier represents not just an order of magnitude increase in raw computational power, but also a significant qualitative leap in capabilities, influence, and scope.
Ok that is good, some of those might be physically impossible but they might provide some perspective
ChatGPT
Absolutely. A taxonomy like this serves not just as a measure of potential capabilities but also as a tool for perspective and conceptual exploration. While some tiers might seem unattainable or even violate our current understanding of physics, they help in stretching our imaginations and providing a framework for thought experiments, speculative fiction, and philosophical inquiries. Such conceptual models are valuable in both science and art, pushing the boundaries of what we believe to be possible and provoking deeper questions about existence, consciousness, and the nature of intelligence.
A final summary
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a summary of our discussion:
We delved into the story of "���ayy ibn Yaq�����n," an allegorical novel by Ibn Tufail that encapsulates philosophical and mystical teachings. This work, which underscores the harmony between observational knowledge and divine revelation, greatly influenced European thought during the Age of Enlightenment.
We discussed the translation and impact of "���ayy ibn Yaq�����n," noting its potential inspiration for "Robinson Crusoe" after Defoe might have read an English translation. The novel's protagonist, raised in isolation by an animal, can be viewed as having an 'alien' or 'feral' mind, akin to a unique form of intelligence.
We then transitioned to a discussion on taxonomies of intelligence, touching upon concepts like swarm intelligence, rhizomatic ecologies, and multiscale polycomputation. Notably, the idea that humans exhibit swarm behaviors was examined.
References to other works, like "Ender's Game," "Speaker for the Dead," "World of Null-A," "Aniara," and "Hard to Be a God," helped in exploring the portrayal of superintelligences in fiction. We postulated a taxonomy of intellects, with each tier representing an exponential leap in capability. Though some tiers might challenge our current understanding of reality, they offer rich ground for thought experiments and philosophical reflection.
In conclusion, our conversation spanned literature, philosophy, and speculative fiction, underscoring the intertwined nature of these domains in our exploration of intelligence and consciousness.
