Tension in the ranks: Cooperative cell contractions drive force-dependent collagen assembly in human fibroblast culture Alexandra A. Silverman Jason D. Olszewski Seyed Mohammad Siadat Jeffrey W. Ruberti 2 Show footnotesOpen AccessPublished:February 16, 2024DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matt.2024.01.023 PlumX Metrics Highlights • The kinematics of fibroblast motion were quantified • Five unique classes of retrograde pulls by fibroblasts were identified • Pulls resulted in formation of fibrillar fibronectin and collagen in ECM • A new model for initial durable structure formation in animals is proposed Progress and potential The work presented here has the potential to dramatically alter our understanding of durable structure (load-bearing tissue) formation in vertebrate animals. The current models of tissue production do not generally contemplate mechanical tension as a direct catalyst for the assembly of structural biopolymers (e.g., collagen) that will then resist the very forces that create them. If tension can induce the formation of structure directly in the path of the force that creates it, then there are large-scale implications across multiple research and therapeutic domains, from developmental biology to wound healing to orthopedic tissue repair and enhancement. The investigation formally introduces mechanochemistry to matrix formation at the cellular level and suggests that animals could be quite literally “pulled” into existence. Summary Currently, there is no mechanistic model that fully explains the initial synthesis and organization of durable animal structure. As a result, our understanding of extracellular matrix (ECM) development and pathologies (e.g., persistent fibrosis) remains limited. Here, we identify and characterize cell-generated mechanical strains that direct the assembly of the ECM. Cell kinematics comprise cooperative retrograde “pulls” that organize and precipitate biopolymer structure along lines of tension. High-resolution optical microscopy revealed five unique classes of retrograde “pulls” that result in the production of filaments. Live-cell confocal imaging confirmed that retrograde pulls can directly cause the formation of fibronectin filaments that then colocalize with collagen aggregates exported from the cell, producing persistent elongated structures aligned with the direction of the tension. The findings suggest a new model for initial durable structure formation in animals. The results have important implications for ECM development and growth and life-threatening pathologies of the ECM, such as fibrosis.

This article presents groundbreaking research in the field of cellular biology, specifically focusing on how mechanical tension influences the assembly of collagen and other structural biopolymers within the extracellular matrix (ECM) in human fibroblast cultures. The team led by Alexandra A. Silverman, alongside Jason D. Olszewski, Seyed Mohammad Siadat, and Jeffrey W. Ruberti, explores a new frontier in understanding how vertebrate animals develop their durable structures—essentially the load-bearing tissues.

The research highlights include:

The detailed quantification of fibroblast motion kinematics.

The identification of five unique classes of retrograde pulls by fibroblasts.

The discovery that these pulls result in the formation of fibrillar fibronectin and collagen within the ECM.

The proposition of a novel model for the initial formation of durable structure in animals.

The essence of this study lies in its potential to revolutionize our comprehension of tissue formation. Traditionally, the role of mechanical tension in the synthesis and organization of structural biopolymers like collagen hasn't been fully integrated into models of tissue production. This study, however, suggests that tension is not just a byproduct of cellular processes but a direct catalyst for structural assembly. This mechanochemical approach to matrix formation at the cellular level is akin to a sculptor, where cells act as artists, pulling and tensioning the fabric of the ECM to create structures capable of resisting the forces applied to them.

The implications of this research are vast and varied, touching upon multiple scientific and medical fields. It opens new avenues in developmental biology, wound healing, and orthopedic tissue repair and enhancement, suggesting that our bodies might be "pulled" into existence rather than merely constructed in a passive manner.

In summary, this study proposes a shift in how we perceive the formation of durable structures in vertebrate animals, suggesting a model where mechanical forces directly influence the creation and organization of vital structural components of the ECM. This not only provides insights into the fundamental processes of life but also opens up potential therapeutic avenues for addressing pathologies of the ECM, such as fibrosis, through a deeper understanding of the forces that shape our very existence.

So what about a theory that knees and foot and finger joints are formed like this with constant movement


ChatGPT

The theory you're proposing intersects intriguingly with the findings of the article on the role of mechanical tension in tissue formation. If we consider the article's insights—that cellular tensions and pulls contribute significantly to the structural assembly of collagen and other biopolymers in the extracellular matrix (ECM)—your theory posits a fascinating extension of these principles to the development of complex joint structures like those in knees, feet, and fingers.

In embryonic development, joint formation, or arthrogenesis, involves several precisely coordinated processes, including the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes (cartilage cells) and the subsequent shaping of the cartilaginous models of future bones. This process is known to be influenced by both genetic factors and mechanical forces. The latter, as per your theory, could play a pivotal role in defining the ultimate shape and function of joints through a feedback loop where movement and tension guide the differentiation of cells and the assembly of ECM components to form the intricate structures of joints.

Drawing an analogy from the article, just as fibroblasts pull and organize ECM components into durable structures under tension, similar mechanical cues could guide the mesenchymal cells in joint areas to organize into the complex, functional structures of our joints. This is akin to shaping a path through a dense forest not by cutting down the trees but by guiding their growth direction through strategic tensioning—where the "trees" are the cells and ECM components, and the "path" is the joint structure.

This theory aligns with observations in biomechanics and developmental biology that physical forces during fetal development and growth play a crucial role in shaping the skeletal system. For instance, the phenomenon of Wolff's Law, which posits that bone in a healthy person or animal will adapt to the loads under which it is placed, can be seen as a macroscopic counterpart to the cellular and molecular events suggested by your theory and the article's findings.

In conclusion, while the article provides a cellular and molecular perspective on how mechanical forces contribute to tissue formation, your theory elegantly extends this concept to the formation of complex joint structures. It suggests a beautifully orchestrated interaction between movement, mechanical tension, and biological development, illustrating how life's structures, from the microscopic to the macroscopic, are molded not just by genetic blueprint but through an interactive dance with the physical world.

Yeah I mean that mammals and birds are "swimming" and "flying" embryonically. Dissipative structure formation from different ways different movements move tissue around affect pressure, fluid flow rates, growth hormone distribution and so one


ChatGPT

Your elaboration adds a rich layer to the discussion, invoking the concept of "dissipative structures" within the context of embryonic development, particularly how embryonic movements might sculpt the formation of complex anatomical structures like joints in mammals and birds through "swimming" and "flying" motions. This perspective marries principles from physics, specifically thermodynamics and fluid dynamics, with developmental biology, suggesting an intricate choreography between movement, mechanical forces, and biochemical signals during the formation of living structures.

Dissipative structures, a term coined by the physicist Ilya Prigogine, refer to ordered systems that emerge from chaos in non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems through the dissipation of energy. In the context of embryonic development, the "chaos" could be the undifferentiated state of embryonic tissues, and the "order" that emerges—the structured formation of joints and other anatomical features—arises through the dissipation of mechanical energy via embryonic movements.

These embryonic movements, akin to swimming in mammals and flying in bird embryos, can indeed influence tissue formation in several ways:

Pressure and Fluid Flow: The movements generate pressure waves and influence fluid flow within the embryonic environment, which can affect how tissues are shaped and formed. For instance, fluid shear stress has been shown to influence the orientation of cells and the deposition of extracellular matrix components, guiding the structural organization of developing tissues.

Growth Hormone Distribution: The mechanical forces generated by these movements could also affect the distribution of growth factors and hormones within the embryo. These biochemical signals are crucial for regulating cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis—all processes vital for the proper formation of complex structures like joints.

Tissue Differentiation and Morphogenesis: The mechanical forces and resulting biochemical signaling gradients created by embryonic movements may guide the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into specific cell lineages (e.g., chondrocytes for cartilage formation in joints) and influence morphogenetic processes that shape the developing embryo.

This perspective suggests that embryonic movements are not merely a consequence of developing musculature and nervous system but play a fundamental role in shaping the organism's structure through a dynamic interplay of physical forces and biological processes. It's as if the embryo is an artist, using movement as its brush to paint the canvas of its own body, guided by the subtle and intricate interplay of mechanical and biochemical cues.

By extending the dialogue from mere cellular mechanics to the embodiment of movement in embryonic development, your theory highlights a fascinating and less explored vista in biology. It underscores how life, from its earliest stages, is an active participant in its own formation, utilizing the principles of physics and chemistry to navigate the path from simplicity to complexity, chaos to order.

See if you can further articulate this theory. What are some suggested testable hypothesis and operationalized definitions?


ChatGPT

To further articulate and explore the theory that embryonic movements contribute to the formation of complex anatomical structures through mechanisms akin to dissipative structure formation, we can propose several testable hypotheses and operationalize key concepts for empirical investigation. This approach allows for the bridging of theoretical insights with experimental validation, providing a concrete framework for advancing our understanding of developmental biology.

Hypotheses

Embryonic Movement and ECM Organization Hypothesis:

Statement: Embryonic movements generate mechanical forces that directly influence the orientation and organization of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, leading to the structured formation of tissues.

Test: Compare the ECM organization in embryos allowed to move freely with those where movement has been restricted, using high-resolution imaging techniques to assess collagen and fibronectin alignment and distribution.

Fluid Shear Stress and Cell Differentiation Hypothesis:

Statement: The fluid shear stress resulting from embryonic movements affects the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into specific lineages crucial for joint formation.

Test: Expose cultured mesenchymal stem cells to varying levels of fluid shear stress mimicking embryonic movement conditions and measure changes in lineage-specific markers for chondrocytes, osteoblasts, etc.

Growth Factor Distribution Hypothesis:

Statement: Embryonic movements create gradients of growth factors and hormones that guide the spatial patterning of tissue development.

Test: Utilize in vivo imaging and biosensors to map the distribution of growth factors in moving vs. non-moving embryos, correlating these distributions with patterns of tissue development.

Operationalized Definitions

Embryonic Movements: Defined as any physical activity originating from the embryo, including but not limited to muscular contractions, ciliary motions, and fluid movements within and around the embryo. These can be quantified by their frequency, amplitude, and the generated shear stress in the surrounding fluid.

Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Organization: The spatial arrangement of ECM components such as collagen and fibronectin, assessed by parameters like alignment (orientation relative to embryonic axes), density (ECM components per unit area), and uniformity (consistency in ECM component distribution).

Fluid Shear Stress: The tangential force per unit area exerted by fluid flow on a cell surface, measurable in dynes/cm^2. It serves as an indicator of the mechanical environment experienced by cells due to embryonic movements.

Cell Differentiation: The process by which a less specialized cell becomes a more specialized cell type, operationalized by the expression of lineage-specific markers detectable by immunostaining, quantitative PCR, or flow cytometry.

Growth Factor Distribution: The concentration and spatial gradient of growth factors and hormones within the embryonic environment, determined through techniques like ELISA, mass spectrometry, or in situ hybridization, coupled with imaging methods for spatial resolution.

Implementing the Framework

Implementing this research framework involves integrating advanced imaging techniques, biomechanical modeling, and molecular biology tools. For instance, time-lapse imaging and computational fluid dynamics can model the relationship between embryonic movements and fluid flow, while CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing could explore the roles of specific genes in mechanotransduction pathways influenced by mechanical stress. Through this multifaceted approach, the proposed hypotheses can be rigorously tested, providing empirical evidence to either support or refine the theory that embryonic movements play a crucial role in the morphogenesis and formation of complex anatomical structures.

Interactive Feedback Hypothesis: Unraveling the Choreography of Embryonic Development

Embryonic development is a marvel of nature, a complex ballet where cells and tissues perform with precision to the cues of genetic and environmental factors. Among the myriad of processes that guide the transformation of a single cell into a multicellular organism, the role of mechanical forces and movements stands out as a pivotal yet often underappreciated player. This essay delves into the "Interactive Feedback Hypothesis," a theoretical framework proposing that embryonic movements and mechanical stresses act not merely as byproducts of development but as essential contributors to the formation of complex anatomical structures, particularly focusing on joint formation in mammals and birds.

The genesis of this hypothesis is anchored in recent findings that cooperative cell contractions drive force-dependent collagen assembly in human fibroblast cultures. These insights, as revealed in groundbreaking research, suggest that mechanical tension can directly catalyze the assembly of structural biopolymers, such as collagen, essential for the durable structure of vertebrate animals. This principle of mechanochemistry, where physical forces at the cellular level dictate the assembly and organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM), provides a foundational pillar for the Interactive Feedback Hypothesis.

Building on this foundation, the hypothesis extends the role of mechanical forces to the embryonic development of joints. It posits that the constant embryonic movements, akin to swimming in mammals and flying in bird embryos, serve as mechanisms through which tissues are sculpted into complex structures. This sculpting process is not merely a passive consequence of growth but an active, dynamic interaction where mechanical forces, such as pressure and fluid shear stress, guide the differentiation of cells and the distribution of growth hormones, ultimately influencing the spatial patterning of tissue development.

To explore this hypothesis further, we propose several testable hypotheses and operationalized definitions. For instance, the "Embryonic Movement and ECM Organization Hypothesis" suggests that embryonic movements directly influence the orientation and organization of ECM components, leading to structured tissue formation. This can be tested by comparing the ECM organization in embryos with unrestricted movement against those where movement has been restricted, utilizing high-resolution imaging techniques.

Moreover, the hypothesis underscores the importance of fluid shear stress resulting from embryonic movements in affecting the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into specific lineages crucial for joint formation. This aspect can be empirically investigated by exposing cultured mesenchymal stem cells to varying levels of fluid shear stress and measuring changes in lineage-specific markers.

The Interactive Feedback Hypothesis also highlights the role of growth factor distribution, suggesting that embryonic movements create gradients of growth factors that guide tissue development. This can be tested by mapping the distribution of growth factors in moving versus non-moving embryos and correlating these distributions with patterns of tissue development.

In operationalizing the concepts within the hypothesis, we define embryonic movements as any physical activity originating from the embryo, including muscular contractions and fluid movements. The organization of the ECM is assessed through parameters like alignment, density, and uniformity. Fluid shear stress is quantified as the force per unit area exerted by fluid flow on cell surfaces, serving as an indicator of the mechanical environment experienced by cells.

The Interactive Feedback Hypothesis presents a holistic view of embryonic development, suggesting a symbiotic relationship between mechanical forces and biological processes. It posits that life, from its earliest stages, is an active participant in its own formation, utilizing the principles of physics and chemistry to navigate the path from simplicity to complexity. This hypothesis not only enriches our understanding of developmental biology but also opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions in addressing pathologies related to tissue formation and organization.

In conclusion, the Interactive Feedback Hypothesis offers a compelling narrative on the integral role of mechanical forces and embryonic movements in shaping the intricate tapestry of life. It calls for a paradigm shift in our understanding of embryonic development, from a process driven solely by genetic information to one that is dynamically influenced by an interactive dialogue between physical forces and biological responses. Through this lens, we can begin to unravel the complex choreography of life's genesis, appreciating the subtle yet profound interplay that guides the emergence of form and function from the cellular to the organismal level.
