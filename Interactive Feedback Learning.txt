Yann LeCun
@ylecun
I've made that point before:
LLM: 1E13 tokens x 0.75 word/token x 2
bytes/token = 1E13 bytes.
- 4 year old child: 16k wake hours x 3600 s/
hour x 1E6 optical nerve fibers x 2 eyes x 10
bytes/s = 1E15 bytes.
In 4 years, a child has seen 50 times more
data than the biggest LLMs.
1E13 tokens is pretty much all the quality
text publicly available on the Internet. It
would take 170k years for a human to read
(8 h/day, 250 word/minute),
Text is simply too low bandwidth and too
scarce a modality to learn how the world
works.
Video is more redundant, but redundancy is
precisely what you need for Self-Supervised
Learning to work well.
Incidentally, 16k hours of video is about 30
minutes of YouTube uploads
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yann LeCun is making an interesting comparison here, highlighting the vast amount of data that a child can experience through their senses compared to the largest Language Models (LLMs). This underscores the challenge of using text-based data alone for machine learning and the potential benefits of using video data, which is more redundant and information-rich.

Paul C Jefferies:

I commented on the post:

https://x.com/pauljeffries/status/1750725075135795305

Some folks are saying in comments that Yann focuses too much on vision. After all, plenty of psychologically normal human are congenitally blind, right?

I don���t mean to presume but I suspect he���s simplifying all the details  to make the main point. There are of course many other sensory modalities a child uses to come to know the world and themself. And perhaps relevantly, these inputs are mapped to outputs; they are causal experiments instead of passive one-way intake. 

But even if there is a simplification for the sake of discussion, I don���t take Yann to be talking only about vision as such, literally (about using your eyes) ��� but rather spatio-temporal apperception as a unified construction from all the various inputs, some of which some people don���t have: sight (including dynamic sight: binocular, moving eyes and head to see what changes, persistence of vision, foveal being modeled when it���s only a small angle, etc.), sound (which is used to build a spatial model, too; check out the blind people who see with clicks), touch, proprioception, body volume awareness, etc. 

We integrate all that to form an understanding of the world as fundamentally spatially, and as a bunch of causally related parts changing over time, in the way that Kant claimed was essential to cognition.

Indeed, one thing Yann didn���t mention in this clip but I suspect is very important, is that LLMs/transformers seem to only understand ���the now���, or rather, timelessness. Perhaps that���s why they are so bad at tasks involving sequences and counting.

The human sense of ���temporal becoming��� may be very crucial. Even the idea of computation has this built in (as Turing machine tape and state changes).

Humans seem to be constantly using the past to anticipate the future, and while there is an element of that captured in the notion of text prediction, my intuition is that this is too narrow.  

Anyway, humans are integrating all this sensory input (and experiments with feedback) into a constantly dynamic model of the world that at its root has material objects, location, time, and causation. Language may supervene on that to a sufficient degree that an LLM/transformer ���Chinese room��� is isomorphic for many purposes. But that seems like a Plato���s cave situation, where the machines are in the cave and the humans are outside. 

It���s pretty cool that our written output encodes so much of the logic of the world and what we care about. It���s especially interesting to me that ���theory of mind��� stuff, that most of us naive folks thought would be hardest for machines (in science fiction it���s always the thing machines don���t quite grasp), is actually pretty easy. No surprise in retrospect; our writing is largely about interpersonal stories and what people are thinking. How human folk-psychology works is all baked in already. 

But as Yann says, there maybe isn���t enough writing to get too much further. And even if we had 1000x more, it may be inherently insufficient. All the conversational implicature our writing takes for granted is based on the assumption that the reader already knows what it���s like to be a human as a physical object in a physical world, with a volition and experience of the passage of time, and constant recalibration of prediction against input.

Paul C Jefferies offers a thoughtful commentary on Yann LeCun's discussion, emphasizing that human learning and understanding involve multiple sensory modalities beyond vision. He suggests that humans integrate various inputs to form a spatial and temporal understanding of the world, which might be challenging for large language models (LLMs) that primarily process text data. Furthermore, he highlights the importance of the human sense of "temporal becoming" and the role of past experiences in anticipating the future, which might be limited in LLMs. Finally, he touches on the limitations of text-based learning and the nuances of human cognition.

Ok well I wonder if individual humans are smarter than others because they have had more input, or if it matters what the input is and in what order, under lecun's logic, any human is taking in a lot of input comparable to any other and so they should all get smarter and smarter their whole lives
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yann LeCun's point focuses on the idea that the richness and diversity of sensory input play a crucial role in human learning and understanding. While individuals do differ in the quantity and quality of their input, it's not solely about the quantity. The nature, variety, and order of the input matter as well.
Different experiences and inputs can lead to variations in cognitive development and knowledge acquisition. So, it's not just about the sheer amount of input but also about the quality, diversity, and context in which that input is received. This diversity in experiences can contribute to differences in individual intelligence and understanding.
You
So if the input has a feedback loop with the user's actions so they get response they can correct their actions to adjust the input stream, at least that what was argued in behavior: The control of perception
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You're correct in mentioning the concept of a feedback loop between input, action, and perception, as discussed in the field of perception and action in psychology. This concept is often associated with the idea that individuals actively engage with their environment, receive feedback, and adjust their actions accordingly. It's a fundamental aspect of how humans learn and adapt.
In this context, the quality of the feedback and the ability to make adjustments based on that feedback can significantly influence the learning process. It's not just about the input itself but also how individuals interact with and respond to that input that contributes to their learning and understanding of the world. This aligns with the idea that learning is an active, dynamic process influenced by both sensory input and the actions taken in response to it.

So there were other people living the Middle ages who had access to the same about visual input, but text although it is constrained in various ways can represent any possible concept
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You make a valid point. In the Middle Ages, access to visual input was relatively limited compared to today, and many individuals had access to similar visual environments. However, when it comes to text, it has the unique ability to represent and convey a wide range of concepts, ideas, and knowledge.
Text is a highly flexible and versatile medium for sharing information and knowledge. It can be used to describe, explain, argue, and communicate complex ideas and concepts. Additionally, written texts can span various topics, cultures, and historical periods, allowing readers to access a wealth of diverse information.
While the visual input may have been somewhat standardized for individuals living in the same time and place during the Middle Ages, their exposure to and interaction with textual content could vary significantly. The choice of what texts to read and how deeply to engage with them could indeed impact their intellectual development and understanding of the world. Text's capacity to represent a wide range of concepts is a unique feature that has contributed to the spread of knowledge and the development of human intelligence throughout history.

Images can do this as well but text allows symbolic representations, metaphorical relations to be explicitly spelled out, whereas images are connected through proximity or congruence only
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You're absolutely right. While images can convey a wealth of information and evoke emotions, text has a distinct advantage in its ability to provide explicit and precise symbolic representations, as well as the capacity to spell out metaphorical relations and complex ideas through language. This explicitness and precision in conveying abstract concepts and relationships make text a powerful tool for communication, education, and knowledge representation.
Text can provide detailed explanations, definitions, and arguments that may not be immediately apparent in images. It allows for the use of symbols, metaphors, analogies, and precise language to convey nuanced meanings and ideas. Textual information can also be organized and structured in ways that facilitate in-depth exploration and analysis of complex subjects.
Both text and images have their strengths and limitations, and they often complement each other in various forms of communication and learning. However, as you pointed out, text's ability to make symbolic representations and explicitly spell out metaphorical relations gives it a unique role in conveying abstract concepts and facilitating in-depth understanding.

There is an advantage to putting voice into text in terms of saving on the account if data, an hour of speech might still be sizeable but a txt file will be much smaller, this disregards information, but speech to text technologies are showing that a lot of things like prosody or pronunciation can be inferred from statistical clues interconnections about the text and notes about the context.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You've highlighted an important advantage of converting voice into text, which is the efficiency in terms of data storage and transmission. Text data is significantly more compact compared to audio or speech data. This reduction in file size makes it more practical for various applications, especially when data transmission or storage resources are limited.
Furthermore, as you mentioned, advancements in speech-to-text technologies have made it possible to capture not only the textual content of speech but also important aspects like prosody, pronunciation, and contextual cues. This has expanded the utility of voice-to-text conversion in a wide range of applications, from transcription services to voice assistants and accessibility tools.
The ability to infer additional information from the text, such as emotional tone or emphasis, adds value to the converted text and enhances its usability. It also enables more efficient data analysis and indexing, making it easier to search and retrieve specific information within large datasets of converted speech.
You
So I believe movies and video games can be converted to text in a similar way giving standardized descriptions about the scene agents and environment and their actions behaviors, so that the same audio and visuals can be extracted each time, but it still might take a lot of work to develop this system
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your belief is indeed well-founded, and the concept you describe is related to a field known as "video description" or "video summarization." Converting movies and video games into standardized text descriptions is a challenging but promising area of research and development.

I mean an algorithm that can turn any book into a movie any movie into a book, without introducing a lot of artifacts
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept of automatically converting any book into a movie or vice versa without introducing artifacts is an ambitious and complex task that goes beyond current AI capabilities. While there are technologies for text-to-speech synthesis, natural language generation, and video summarization, the process of creating a high-quality movie from a book or a faithful book from a movie involves a deep understanding of narrative structure, creativity, and visual storytelling.
Here are some key challenges and considerations:
Narrative Understanding: Books and movies have different narrative structures, pacing, and storytelling techniques. Converting between the two mediums would require AI systems to comprehend the essence of the story and adapt it effectively.
Visual Representation: Turning a book into a movie involves creating visual scenes, characters, and environments that align with the text. Conversely, adapting a movie into a book requires vivid descriptions and a literary narrative style.
Creativity and Artistry: Both books and movies involve creative and artistic choices made by authors, directors, and creators. Capturing the essence of these choices in an automated process is extremely challenging.
Contextual Understanding: Many elements in a book or movie may rely on cultural, historical, or contextual nuances that an algorithm might struggle to interpret accurately.
While AI and natural language processing technologies are advancing rapidly, achieving a seamless and artifact-free conversion between books and movies is a long-term goal and a complex interdisciplinary challenge that combines language, art, and storytelling. It would likely require a deep fusion of AI, machine learning, natural language understanding, computer vision, and creative expertise.
You
So we already know that different directors would not film the same script in the same way
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You're absolutely right. Different directors bring their unique artistic vision, style, and interpretation to a script or story. This individuality is a fundamental aspect of filmmaking and contributes to the diversity and richness of cinema. Even when working with the same script, two directors can create distinctly different films based on their creative choices, including cinematography, pacing, casting, and visual storytelling.
This variation in how a script is brought to life on the screen highlights the importance of artistic direction and the creative decisions made by directors. It also underscores the complexity of the task you mentioned earlier, as automating the conversion of a script into a movie would need to account for these diverse directorial approaches, which can be subjective and context-dependent.
You
And there is some consideration of the intended audience
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Absolutely, the intended audience is a crucial factor in both the creation of books and movies. Different books and movies are tailored to specific audiences, and the content, tone, and style are often adjusted accordingly.
For books, authors may write with a particular readership in mind, considering factors like age group, interests, and reading level. Similarly, filmmakers make decisions about a movie's content, rating, and presentation based on the target demographic.
When converting between books and movies, understanding the intended audience becomes essential. Adaptations should take into account the expectations and preferences of the audience to ensure that the content remains engaging and relevant. A faithful adaptation should capture the essence of the original while adapting it effectively for the medium and audience in question.
So, the intended audience plays a significant role not only in the creation of books and movies but also in their adaptation or conversion between the two mediums.
You
I think right now time constraints mean movies are often just representing a few of the main sections of books, they use symbolic and poignant situations to illustrate character and motivation, often removing many characters and scenes, because there are things that might be difficult to make into images or sounds
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You've highlighted a common challenge in adapting books into movies. Due to time constraints and the differences in storytelling mediums, filmmakers often need to make choices about which elements of a book to include in a movie adaptation. They may focus on key plot points, characters, and scenes that are essential to conveying the central themes, character development, and overall narrative.
In the process of adaptation, some characters and subplots may be condensed, modified, or omitted to streamline the story and maintain a manageable runtime. Filmmakers often prioritize visual storytelling and cinematic impact, which can lead to the use of symbolic and poignant situations to convey character motivations and emotions effectively.
While adaptations may not capture every detail of a book, they aim to preserve the essence and spirit of the source material, making it accessible to a broader audience. It's a delicate balance between staying faithful to the original work and making creative decisions that suit the cinematic medium. Adaptations offer a unique interpretation of a story, and they can introduce new audiences to the world and themes of the book while also providing a fresh perspective for fans of the source material.
You
So my system would mean books were more like television series and to make the movie a kind of selection of critical scenes would be made, but they would still try to remain cohesive with the plot arc and not change elements within the story to make different points, although artistic director visions and remixes could be applied as a filter afterwards
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your idea of adapting books into a format more akin to television series and then selecting critical scenes for a movie adaptation aligns with the idea of maintaining the coherence of the plot arc while still providing condensed versions of the story for different mediums. This approach allows for a more comprehensive exploration of the source material in a series format and a focused, visually captivating experience in a movie format.
By preserving the plot's core elements and maintaining fidelity to the original storyline, you can provide audiences with a coherent and faithful adaptation. The use of artistic director visions and remixes as a post-production filter can add a layer of creativity and unique interpretation to the movie adaptation, allowing directors to infuse their artistic vision without altering the fundamental elements of the story.
This approach strikes a balance between staying true to the source material and embracing the creative possibilities of filmmaking. It offers the potential for a cohesive and engaging adaptation that respects the essence of the book while making it suitable for both television series and movie formats.
You
