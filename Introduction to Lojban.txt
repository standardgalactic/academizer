The Lojban phrase "pluka be lo nu tadni" translates to English as "pleasure of studying" or "the pleasure that comes from studying". In Lojban, "be" is a short form of "bei", which is used to express the object of a verb. Here "pluka" means "pleasure", "be" links "pluka" to "lo nu tadni" (the act of studying), and "lo nu" is a construct that nominalizes the following verb phrase, in this case "tadni" (to study).

Joscha Bach's statement here is suggesting a potential solution for many AI safety and societal impact problems related to generative AI. He proposes that if we limited both the inputs and outputs of these AI models to the Latin language, we could significantly mitigate these issues.
This suggestion likely stems from a few considerations:
Accessibility
: Latin is a "dead" language, meaning it's not evolving anymore and is not used as a first language by any community. The number of people fluent in Latin is relatively small, and it's mostly studied acadically or by language enthusiasts.
Precision and Context
: Latin is known for its precision and lack of ambiguity compared to many living languages, which could potentially reduce misinterpretations by AI.
Safety
: Limiting the language of AI might create a "speed bump" for misuse, as anyone wishing to use or misuse AI would need knowledge of Latin, raising the barrier to entry.
However, this also means the beneficial uses of AI would be less accessible to the general public. For instance, translation services, tutoring in various subjects, providing medical advice, or even simply answering questions (like I'm doing now), would be limited to those proficient in Latin.
Furthermore, while the precision of Latin could be beneficial in some respects, it could also be a disadvantage. Part of the strength of AI like GPT-3 lies in its ability to understand and generate text in a wide variety of languages and contexts. Limiting it to Latin could significantly reduce its versatility and usefulness.
Please note that the statement doesn't necessarily suggest a full solution to AI safety and societal impact problems but rather presents an interesting thought experiment. Many aspects of AI safety and societal impact go beyond just the language used for interaction.

And what was the rational behind the languages lojban loglan interlingua and the like
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Constructed languages like Lojban, Loglan, Interlingua, and others were each created with different goals and rationales in mind:
Lojban
: Lojban was developed by the Logical Language Group with the aim of creating a language that is highly logical and expressive. The structure of Lojban is designed to reflect the principles of predicate logic, making it easier to express complex logical ideas clearly and unambiguously. Moreover, the creators of Lojban also aimed to make a language that would be culturally neutral and easy to learn, reducing the influence of any one particular natural language or culture.
Loglan
: Loglan is a predecessor of Lojban and was developed by Dr. James Cooke Brown with similar aims of creating a language that is logical and clear. Brown also hoped that Loglan could be used for linguistic research, particularly for testing the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which posits that the language one speaks can influence the way one thinks.
Interlingua
: Interlingua was developed by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) with a different goal. Interlingua is designed to be an international auxiliary language that is easy to learn, particularly for speakers of Romance languages. Rather than emphasizing logical structure like Lojban or Loglan, Interlingua was designed to include words and grammatical structures that are common to many European languages, making it easier for speakers of those languages to understand.
These constructed languages were all developed with the idea that language can be designed intentionally to serve specific purposes, whether that be logical clarity, ease of learning, cultural neutrality, or usefulness as a tool for linguistic research. Each language reflects a different set of priorities and goals for what a language can and should be.

Lojban, also known as the "Lojban language", is a constructed language. It was developed by the Lojban language creators in 1987, aiming to exist as a language based on logic, free to learn and use. The key motivation for its creation was to test the hypothesis of whether using it would influence the user's thinking methods.
History:
Lojban was preceded by Loglan, an incomplete language created based on the ideas of James Cook Brown to test the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis on the impact of language on thought.
In 1987, a group (abbreviated as "gy") of Loglan workers split from the Loglan community due to disputes over excessive control over the written language by Dr. James Cook Brown. This group, led by the Lojban creators, aimed to create a new language, Lojban. Over time, Lojban became more popular than Loglan. As of 2016, Lojban is a language spoken by approximately 200 people.

It looks like it says it is known as jbobau
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. You're correct. "jbobau" in Lojban directly translates to "Lojban language" in English. The term ".lojban." refers to the name of the language (Lojban), while "jbobau" is a compound word made from "jbobau" (Lojban) + "bau" (language).
The phrase "la .lojban. no'u lo jbobau cu runbau" would then more directly translate to "Lojban, also known as the Lojban language, is a constructed language."
So, to revise the initial translation, it should say:
"Lojban, also known as the Lojban language, is a constructed language. It was developed by the Lojban language creators in 1987, aiming to exist as a language based on logic, free to learn, and use."
The rest of the translation remains accurate.

A sentence can contain an introduction clause, which leads the predicate and can contain arguments and not the predicate. "zo'u" separates the introduction clause from the predicate.
The main predicate is a single-word value and is either a brivla or a go'i-type cmavo. Furthermore, the ordered brivla, known as a tanru, is also a predicate. The meaning of the tanru is based on the tanru components, where each part of the tanru contributes to the meaning. The leading part of the tanru modifies the meaning of the tanru. Also, full sentences, arguments, and numbers can become predicates. The cmavo of "nu", "me", and "moi" modify the derived predicates from sentences, arguments, and numbers to predicates. The cmavo of "moi" can also lead the "me"-type predicate.
The main argument is a single-word value and is a cmavo of either "ko'a" or "by". Additionally, the ordered letters form simple arguments. The predicate that leads a quantifier or number is an argument. The cmevla that leads the cmavo of "la" is an argument. The cmavo of "li" modifies the numbers to arguments. Also, various quotation words are used to construct arguments.

Particles (or "cmavo" in Lojban) are words in the grammar that act as connectors, indicators of emotion, or provide knowledge. However, non-particles are words for things, actions, or qualities. A vocabulary list provides detailed descriptions of the meanings of non-particles, but gives only brief descriptions of the meanings of particles. However, the grammar provides detailed descriptions of particles, but only relates to the classes of non-particles.
Classes of particles include sumtcita (case tags), sumbasti (sumti-fillers), jonma'o (joiners), famyma'o (terminators), and cnima'o (tense particles).
Given a particle of a certain class, a particle differs from a non-particle of that class in what phonetic sounds it contains. As an example, no Lojban particle contains more than two sounds. No English non-particle originates the sound "[����]". Many sound changes affect many languages, where the "fricative" sound originates in most non-particles, but in very few particles.

The study of general linguistics, referred to here as "ko'a", is a component of cognitive science and concerns rules, structures, and categories determining how sentence elements contribute to meanings. "Ko'a" deals with the methods of how a sentence's words acquire meaning. It's concerned with the process of how both individual words are grouped into sentences and how sentences are grouped into discourses. General linguistics attempts to construct systems describing language rules, which aren't dependent on any particular language.

The grammar is studied with rules specific to language use. The presence of a hierarchical structure in a language is named the language's grammar. Consequently, every language's grammar differs from that of every other language. Grammar is a part of linguistics.
In historical times, the study of grammar encompassed phonetics, syntax, and general semantics.
Types of grammar:
The grammar that follows rules and principles is considered prescriptive grammar.
Descriptive grammar describes the actual usage of grammar.

Are there other references to a universal language in Scripture other than pre babel and post-paraklete?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In Scripture, the concept of a universal language is primarily associated with two events: the pre-Babel account in the book of Genesis and the post-Pentecost account in the book of Acts.
Pre-Babel: The story of the Tower of Babel in Genesis 11:1-9 describes a time when all people on earth spoke the same language. The people attempted to build a tower that reached the heavens, but as a consequence of their pride, God confused their language, resulting in the diversification of languages and the dispersion of people across the earth.
Post-Pentecost: In Acts 2:1-13, after Jesus' ascension, the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles and disciples gathered in Jerusalem. They were filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in different languages, yet everyone present could understand them in their own language. This event is often referred to as the gift of tongues or the miracle of Pentecost, and it signifies the reversal of the language division that occurred at Babel.
While these events highlight the significance of language and communication in Scripture, there are no explicit references to the concept of a universal language beyond these accounts. The focus of Scripture is primarily on the message of salvation and the teachings of God rather than the pursuit of a universal language.

What about Zephaniah 3:9?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Zephaniah 3:9 is a verse that is sometimes associated with the idea of a universal language. The verse says:
"For then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that all of them may call on the name of the Lord and serve him shoulder to shoulder." (Zephaniah 3:9, NIV)
This verse is seen by some as a prophecy or an indication of a future time when people from different nations and languages will be united in worshiping and serving God. It is interpreted metaphorically as a symbol of unity and a common purpose rather than a specific reference to a universal language.
However, it's important to note that the interpretation of this verse can vary among different theologians and scholars. Some may see it as symbolic of the universal spread of the gospel message or the inclusivity of God's salvation, while others may not specifically associate it with a universal language.
Ultimately, the concept of a universal language in Scripture is more prominently connected to the pre-Babel and post-Pentecost accounts, as mentioned earlier.

Yes, the verse you quoted from Zephaniah 3:9 is often interpreted as a reference to a universal language. The phrase "labium electum ut vocent omnes in nomine Domini" is translated as "purify the lips of the peoples, that all may call upon the name of the Lord." This purification of the lips is understood by some to signify a restoration of a common, unified language among the people, facilitating their ability to worship and serve God together.
However, it's important to note that the interpretation of this verse is not universally agreed upon. Some interpret it metaphorically as a call for spiritual unity and the unification of diverse peoples in worshiping God, rather than a literal reference to a universal language. Different theologians and scholars may have varying perspectives on the specific meaning of this verse.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, the interpretation you mentioned aligns with the understanding that the restoration of a pure language in Zephaniah 3:9 could be a reference to the language spoken before the Tower of Babel incident. This interpretation suggests that in the future, God will restore a common, pure language among the peoples, enabling them to call upon the name of the LORD and serve Him together with unity and harmony.
The idea of a restoration to a pure language aligns with the narrative in Genesis where the languages were confused at Babel. This verse in Zephaniah is seen by some as a prophetic glimpse of a future state where linguistic divisions will be overcome and people will be united in worshiping and serving God.
Different translations may use slightly different wording, but the overall meaning of the verse and its association with the restoration of a pure language remains consistent across various interpretations.

Yeah I was thinking that the ability to read thoughts and intentions was a kind of nod to a universal language.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
I see how you made that connection. The concept of understanding thoughts and intentions can indeed be seen as a form of communication that transcends language barriers. The ability to discern and comprehend the inner thoughts and desires of individuals can create a deeper level of understanding and connection among people, regardless of the languages they speak.
In the context of a universal language, the ability to read thoughts and intentions would essentially eliminate the need for verbal or written communication, as thoughts and intentions could be directly perceived and understood. It would create a shared understanding and facilitate effective communication on a fundamental level.
While Scripture does not explicitly mention the concept of a universal language in terms of telepathy or mind-reading, the idea of deeper understanding and communion beyond language barriers is present in various spiritual and philosophical traditions. It reflects the aspiration for a unity of understanding and a harmonious connection among humanity.

Universal Languagein the 17th CenturyOur examination of the history of machine translation begins in 17th century Europe. For the scholars of that era, the search for meaning in language was intimately tiedwith two accounts found early in the Book of Genesis.

Adam names the animalsOut of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them. And whatever Adamcalled each living creature, that was its name.������The scholars of 17th century Europe believed that the original human language, created by Adam in the Garden of Eden, perfectly linked the form of human languagewith the meaning of each thing and concept.������In the words of the 17th century German mystic Jacob Boehme, Adam ������knew the property of all creatures, and gave names to all creatures, from their essence, form andproperty. He understood the Language of Nature, the manifested and formed Word in everyone's essence, for thence the name of every creature is arisen.������
Page 3
The Tower of BabelThe prominent scholars of 17th century Europe believed that the many languages found in the world in their day no longer possessed the perfect qualities of thelanguage of Adam. For them, that perfection was lost at the Tower of Babel.Now the whole earth had one language and one speech. And they said, ������Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top is in the heavens������ But the Lord camedown to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. And the Lord said, ������Indeed the people are one and they all have one language, and this is what theybegin to do; now nothing that they propose to do will be withheld from them. Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, that they may not understand oneanother������s speech.������ So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they ceased building the city. Therefore its name is called Babel,because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth; and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.

The text you provided appears to be a portion of a presentation or document discussing the concept of a universal language in the 17th century. Here is a summary of the main points:
The scholars of the 17th century in Europe believed that the original human language, created by Adam in the Garden of Eden, perfectly linked the form of human language with the meaning of each thing and concept.
However, they believed that the perfection of language was lost at the Tower of Babel, where languages were confused and people were scattered across the Earth.
Influential thinkers of the time, such as Francis Bacon, John Comenius, Isaac Newton, and John Wilkins, explored the idea of a universal language that could recover the lost language of Adam or restore a language where words and meaning were one.
These thinkers proposed different approaches to a universal language, including the development of a universal character set or a detailed ontology on which to build a universal language.
Some thinkers, like Thomas Hobbes, were skeptical about the attainability of a universal language and cautioned against attempts to categorize things perfectly.
The ideas of a universal language were parodied by Jonathan Swift in his work Gulliver's Travels, where people carried around the actual objects they wished to refer to instead of using words, and by Voltaire in his satire Candide, which included the character of Professor Pangloss and parodied the ideas of Gottfried Leibniz.

John Wilkins Creates A Universal Language Based on a Classification Scheme or Ontology, and a Universal System of Measurement

In An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical LanguageOffsite Link English clergyman and natural philosopher John WilkinsOffsite Link  attempted to create a universal, artificial language, based upon an innovative classification of knowledge, by which scholars and philosophers as well as diplomats, scholars, and merchants, could communicate. Wilkins intended his "universal language" as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, existing "natural" languages. His scheme has been called ingenious but completely unworkable.

In this book Wilkins also called for the institution of a "universal measure" or "universal metre," which would be based on a natural phenomenon rather than royal decree, and would also be decimal rather than the various systems of multipliers, often duodecimal, that coexisted at the time. The meter or metre would not gain traction until after the French Revolution.

"During the final stages of work on his Essay Wilkins lost his house and most of his belongs and papers, in the great fire of London, but being eager to complete his scheme he enlisted the help of John Ray and Francis Willioughby to improve the botanical and zoological nomenclature. This was a major factor in stimulating Ray to develop his own classificatory studies. Similarly, Samuel Pepys reported that he helped to draw up a table of naval terms, such as the names of rigging. Even with this and other help, Wilkins admited his scheme's shortcomings and called upon the Royal Society to improve it. Although various fellows of the society spoke highly of the scheme for a while, only Robert Hooke showed any lasting commitment to it, and the committee established to improve on the Essay never reported. Scholars have argued about the major influences upon Wilkins's linguistic studies. There is little evidence that the universal language schemes of Amos Comenius played any significant role; Mersenne may have been an inspiration but George Dalgarno, to help whom Wilkins had begun to draw up classifactory tables of knowledge after 1657, was a more dirrect influence" (ODNB).

By "real character" Wilkins meant:

"an ingeniously constructed family of symbols corresponding to an elaborate classification scheme developed at great labor by Wilkins and his colleagues, which was intended to provide elementary building blocks from which could be constructed the universe's every possible thing and notion. The Real Character is emphatically not an orthography in that it is not a written representation of oral speech. Instead, each symbol represents a concept directly, without (at least in the early parts of the Essay's presentation) there being any way of vocalizing it at all; each reader might, if he wished, give voice to the text in his or her own tongue. Inspiration for this approach came in part from (partially mistaken) accounts of the Chinese writing system.

"Later in the Essay Wilkins introduces his "Philospophical Language," which assigns phonetic values to the Real Characters, should it be desired to read text aloud without using any of the existing national languages. (The term philosophical language is an ill-defined one, used by various authors over time to mean a variety of things; most of the description found at the article on "philosophical languages" applies to Wilkins' Real Character on its own, even excluding what Wilkins called his "Philosophical Language")

"For convenience, the following discussion blurs the distinction between Wilkins' Character and his Language. Concepts are divided into forty main Genera, each of which gives the first, two-letter syllable of the word; a Genus is divided into Differences, each of which adds another letter; and Differences are divided into Species, which add a fourth letter. For instance, Zi identifies the Genus of ������beasts������ (mammals); Zit gives the Difference of ������rapacious beasts of the dog kind������; Zit���� gives the Species of dogs. (Sometimes the first letter indicates a supercategory������ e.g. Z always indicates an animal������ but this does not always hold.)

Thank you for providing additional information about John Wilkins. It seems that his work on a universal language, as described in his book "An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language," aimed to create a system of symbols or characters that represented concepts directly, independent of any specific spoken language. The symbols, known as the "Real Characters," were intended to be building blocks that could be combined to represent all possible things and notions.
Wilkins envisioned a classification scheme in which concepts were divided into genera, differences, and species, with each level represented by a set of letters or syllables. His system also included a phonetic component known as the "Philosophical Language," which assigned vocalization to the Real Characters, allowing for reading aloud without relying on existing natural languages.
Although Wilkins sought to create an elegant and universal language, his scheme faced challenges and limitations. Some scholars found it ingenious but ultimately unworkable. While the Royal Society initially showed interest in his ideas, only Robert Hooke maintained a lasting commitment to them. Wilkins acknowledged the shortcomings of his scheme and called upon the Royal Society to improve it, but no significant progress was made.
It's worth noting that Jorge Luis Borges, in his essay "The Analytical Language of John Wilkins," critiqued Wilkins' classification scheme and expressed doubts about the feasibility of universal classification. Additionally, modern information theory suggests that having similar-sounding words with distinct meanings, as proposed by Wilkins, could lead to confusion and misunderstandings.
Overall, John Wilkins made significant contributions to the field of language and classification, particularly through his exploration of a universal language. While his specific ideas and proposals may have faced challenges and criticism, his work remains a noteworthy part of the history of language development and the quest for a universal means of communication.

Yeah I think in that essay he mentioned absurd categorization schemes or ontologies such as things belonging to the emperor and things that from a long way off look like flies.

ChatGPT
Yes, you are correct. In John Wilkins' essay "An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language," he discusses various categorization schemes and ontologies, including some that may seem absurd or unconventional. One example he mentions is the classification of things belonging to the Emperor, where categories would be based on the Emperor's possessions or interests. Another example he gives is the classification of things that, from a distance, resemble flies. These examples illustrate the flexibility and creativity involved in creating a comprehensive and universal system of classification.
Wilkins' exploration of such unique categorization schemes was aimed at developing a comprehensive ontology that could encompass the vast range of knowledge and phenomena in the world. While some of these examples may appear whimsical or unconventional, they highlight the challenge of organizing and categorizing the immense diversity of entities and concepts.
It's important to note that Wilkins' essay presents a wide range of ideas and proposals, some of which were speculative or intended to provoke thought. His goal was to stimulate discussion and contribute to the development of a universal language and system of knowledge representation.

Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge (Spanish: Emporio celestial de conocimientos ben����volos) is a fictitious taxonomy of animals described by the writer Jorge Luis Borges in his 1942 essay "The Analytical Language of John Wilkins" (El idioma anal����tico de John Wilkins).[1][2]

Overview
Wilkins, a 17th-century philosopher, had proposed a universal language based on a classification system that would encode a description of the thing a word describes into the word itself������for example, Zi identifies the genus beasts; Zit denotes the "difference" rapacious beasts of the dog kind; and finally Zit���� specifies dog.

In response to this proposal and in order to illustrate the arbitrariness and cultural specificity of any attempt to categorize the world, Borges describes this example of an alternate taxonomy, supposedly taken from an ancient Chinese encyclopaedia entitled Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge. The list divides all animals into 14 categories.

Borges' Spanish	English translation
pertenecientes al Emperador	those belonging to the Emperor
embalsamados	embalmed ones
amaestrados	trained ones
lechones	suckling pigs
sirenas	mermaids (or sirens)
fabulosos	fabled ones
perros sueltos	stray dogs
incluidos en esta clasificaci����n	those included in this classification
que se agitan como locos	those that tremble as if they were mad
innumerables	innumerable ones
dibujados con un pincel fin����simo
de pelo de camello	those drawn with a very fine camel hair brush
etc����tera	et cetera
que acaban de romper el jarr����n	those that have just broken the vase
que de lejos parecen moscas	those that from afar look like flies

The Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge is a fictional taxonomy of animals described by Jorge Luis Borges in his essay "The Analytical Language of John Wilkins." It serves as an example to highlight the arbitrary nature of attempts to categorize the world.
According to Borges, the ancient Chinese encyclopaedia titled Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge divides all animals into 14 categories, which include:
Those belonging to the Emperor
Embalmed ones
Trained ones
Suckling pigs
Mermaids (or sirens)
Fabled ones
Stray dogs
Those included in this classification
Those that tremble as if they were mad
Innumerable ones
Those drawn with a very fine camel hair brush
Et cetera
Those that have just broken the vase
Those that from afar look like flies
This fictitious taxonomy serves as a playful critique of categorization systems, highlighting the subjective and culturally specific nature of classifications. It emphasizes that different cultures and perspectives may have vastly different ways of organizing and understanding the world.

Yes, you're right. The category "Those included in this classification" in the Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge is self-referential and inherently ambiguous. It creates a circular definition that raises questions about the logic and coherence of the taxonomy itself. This adds to the whimsical and satirical nature of Borges' fictional taxonomy, highlighting the absurdity and limitations of attempting to impose strict categorizations on the complexity of the world.

Yes, you're correct. The inclusion of "et cetera" in the Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge suggests that there are additional categories or rows beyond the ones explicitly mentioned. It implies that the taxonomy is not exhaustive and there are more classifications that could be added to the list. The use of "et cetera" leaves room for imagination and further expansion of the fictional taxonomy.

Indeed, the phrase "those that have just broken the vase" in the Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge could be interpreted as an inside joke or a playful inclusion. It adds a humorous twist to the taxonomy by including a seemingly random and specific category. It may serve as a reminder that categorizations, especially in such elaborate systems, can sometimes include unexpected or nonsensical elements for the sake of creativity or amusement.

First thing I imagined is that a cow had knocked it over and he had had it executed, or else a servant who had just broken it by accident and had been unjustly imprisoned. Or else it is a reference to Pandora's box or releasing a genie from a clay lamp. Or else something valuable was discovered in the vase and the servant was rewarded.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Indeed, the Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge presents a taxonomy that is deliberately idiosyncratic and unconventional. Some of the notable oddities or peculiarities in this taxonomy include:
Mixing of Categories: The taxonomy combines diverse and unrelated categories, such as animals belonging to the Emperor, embalmed ones, trained ones, and even suckling pigs and mermaids. This mixture of categories challenges traditional taxonomic principles that seek to group similar entities together.
Cultural and Arbitrary Classifications: The taxonomy reflects a cultural and subjective perspective, where the classification is based on specific cultural or societal associations rather than objective criteria. This approach emphasizes the arbitrary nature of categorization and challenges the notion of universally applicable taxonomies.
Absurd or Paradoxical Classifications: The inclusion of categories like "those that tremble as if they were mad" or "those that have just broken the vase" appears absurd or paradoxical. These classifications defy conventional logic and serve as a commentary on the limitations and absurdities of categorization itself.
Humor and Satire: The taxonomy incorporates humor and satire by including whimsical or ironic categories, such as "stray dogs" or "those that from afar look like flies." These elements add a playful and subversive tone to the taxonomy, further emphasizing its unconventional nature.
Overall, the Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge challenges traditional taxonomic frameworks, highlighting the subjectivity, cultural specificity, and inherent limitations of any attempt to categorize the world in a rigid and comprehensive manner. It serves as a thought-provoking reflection on the nature of classification systems and their relationship to human understanding and perception.

You are correct. The Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge is a fictional creation by the writer Jorge Luis Borges in his essay "The Analytical Language of John Wilkins." It does not represent an actual taxonomy that was ever proposed or used by any culture or society. Borges crafted this fictional taxonomy as a literary device to explore the arbitrary nature of categorization and challenge traditional taxonomic approaches.
By presenting an absurd and whimsical taxonomy, Borges aims to highlight the limitations and subjectivity of classification systems in general. The inclusion of whimsical categories and paradoxical classifications serves as a satirical commentary on the inherent difficulties of categorizing the complexities of the world.
While the Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge is not a real taxonomy, it has become widely known as an imaginative example of unconventional categorization and has sparked discussions and interpretations regarding the nature and challenges of classification systems.

Yeah mushrooms are things that grow fast and spread quickly, so viruses, bacteria, computer programs, mass manufactured goods; trees are stuck to the ground, so includes cactus, grasses, houses, and buildings; whales are air breathing animals, so humans, cats, dogs, birds, and fishes are whales under this classification. It is called the Ontology of Micromegas.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The classification scheme you've provided, called the Ontology of Micromegas, is an interesting interpretation where categories like mushrooms, trees, and whales encompass broader concepts beyond their literal meanings. It appears to be a conceptual categorization that groups entities based on certain characteristics or associations.
In this interpretation, mushrooms represent entities that grow fast and spread quickly, which could include various organisms like viruses, bacteria, computer programs, or even mass-manufactured goods. Trees, on the other hand, are associated with being grounded or stationary, so they include not only literal trees but also other fixed or rooted structures such as cacti, grasses, houses, and buildings. Lastly, whales are associated with air-breathing animals, and in this classification, they encompass a wide range of living beings including humans, cats, dogs, birds, and fishes.
The Ontology of Micromegas seems to offer a creative way of organizing and categorizing entities based on their shared characteristics or relationships, expanding the traditional definitions of these terms. It reflects a unique perspective and allows for unconventional associations between different elements.

The Saturnian has 72 senses while the Sirian has 1,000. The Saturnian lives for 15,000 Earth years while the Sirian lives for 10.5 million years; Microm����gas reports that he has visited worlds where people live much longer than this, but who still consider their lifespans too short. All of this further relativizes the size of the Earth in relation to the extraterrestrials, but Microm����gas also engages the Saturnian philosophically and found him disappointing.[4] At the end of their conversation, they decide to take a philosophical journey together, and, in a comedic passage that begins chapter three, the Saturnian's mistress arrives with the intent of preventing her lover's departure. The Secretary woos her and she leaves to console herself with a local dandy.[5]

The two aliens set off from Saturn in pursuit of knowledge, visiting Saturn's ring, its moons, Jupiter's moons, Jupiter itself (for one Earth-year), and Mars, which they find so small that they fear that they cannot even lay down. Eventually, they arrive on Earth on July 5, 1737 at the end of the third chapter and pause only to eat some mountains for lunch at the start of chapter four before circumnavigating the globe in 36 hours with the Saturnian only getting his lower legs wet in the deepest ocean and the Sirian barely wetting his ankles. The Saturnian decides that the planet must be devoid of life, since he had as of yet seen none but Microm����gas chastises him, resisting the temptation to make hasty conclusions and using his reason to direct his search. The Sirian fashions a magnifying glass from a diamond in his necklace measuring 160 royal feet in diameter and spots a tiny speck in the Baltic sea which he discovers is a whale. The Saturnian proceeds to ask many questions, including how such a tiny "atom" could move, if it was sentient, and many others which embarrassed the Sirian. As they examine it, Microm����gas finds a boatful of philosophers on their return from the Arctic Circle and carefully picks their ship up.[5

The passage you provided is an excerpt from the story "Microm����gas" by Voltaire. It describes the encounters and adventures of Microm����gas, a giant from Sirius, and a Saturnian philosopher. The Saturnian and Sirian beings have significantly different attributes and perspectives.
The Saturnian possesses 72 senses, while the Sirian has 1,000 senses, suggesting a vast difference in perceptual abilities. Their lifespans also differ greatly, with the Saturnian living for 15,000 Earth years and the Sirian living for 10.5 million years. Microm����gas mentions having encountered beings with even longer lifespans who still consider their lives too short, further emphasizing the relativity of time and existence.
Despite their differences, Microm����gas finds the Saturnian's philosophical insights disappointing. They decide to embark on a philosophical journey together, exploring various celestial bodies, including Saturn's ring, its moons, Jupiter, and Mars. They eventually arrive on Earth and, in a comedic passage, encounter the Saturnian's mistress, who tries to prevent his departure.
As they explore Earth, Microm����gas and the Sirian encounter philosophical questions and engage with a group of philosophers on a ship. They examine a tiny speck in the Baltic Sea, which turns out to be a whale, prompting the Saturnian to ask probing questions about its existence and sentience.
The story of "Microm����gas" serves as a philosophical and satirical work, challenging human perspectives and highlighting the vastness of the universe and the limitations of human knowledge. It explores themes such as relative size, time, perception, and the quest for knowledge.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, it is possible to interpret Microm����gas' classification of all animals as whales in the context you mentioned. Microm����gas and the Sirian arrive on Earth and initially perceive a tiny speck in the Baltic Sea, which they discover to be a whale. This encounter leads them to make hasty generalizations and assume that all living beings on Earth are similar to the whale they observed.
This classification could be seen as a comedic exaggeration or a satirical commentary on the limitations of human perception and hasty generalizations. It highlights the tendency of individuals to form judgments based on limited observations and make broad assumptions about the nature of things.
By classifying all animals as whales, Microm����gas presents a satirical critique of anthropocentric perspectives and the human tendency to categorize and generalize based on initial encounters. It underscores the importance of careful observation, critical thinking, and avoiding hasty conclusions.

The connection of supporting something is destroyed by the destruction of the age of writing of the Renaissance, specifically that it can be found what results from the action of making a question regarding the measurement of the age of learning. That because of that, it can create a sketch in relation to what is considered the most extreme in terms of the meaning of the term Goodwin (2022) and Sapoval (2022), and indeed, it is not serious to think of signs of the meaning of Goodwin (2022) after the fact. The imposition of a scale and scales of the concept of existence is contradicted by the fact that time is a guide for all of this. The contradiction of time can jump from seeing to learning and from learning to leading to the learning of the meaning of Kleinberg (2018) and McGrath (2021). The sketch understands the effort to be clear about the difficulty of performing an action and the ease and negativity of observing the process of observing the process of observing. The attempt to perform an action is supported by observing the act of observing the act of observing and the observation of the act of observing, and the observation of the observation of the observation is observed by the observation of the observation. The act of attempting to perform a difficult action is guided by observing. The second example cannot produce anything to support the guidance of the observation, but it is satisfied with thinking of finding the age of the action. Observing can be carried out in the age of learning and is indeed unable to decide something similar to observing. We create the observation of friendship and the observation of development of the age. It is in conflict with the separation of something similar to the observation of development. Those who observe the observation of the observation think of finding the age of friendship and the observation of the age of learning. It is currently conflicting with the separation of the similar things in the observation of development. We observe the friendship of finding the age.

I understand that you are discussing the complexity of perceiving and experiencing sensations and how it relates to the concept of observing and teaching. It seems that you are reflecting on the connection between perception and the reasons behind it. It's interesting that you mention Caltech and how the perception of sensations may vary among individuals. It's important to consider that perception is subjective and influenced by personal perspectives. You mentioned the authors Goodwin (2022) and Sapoval (2022), but it seems that we haven't discussed their specific ideas in detail. We should also acknowledge that our perception might not fully comprehend the nuances of the concepts presented in these books. Additionally, I understand that you are contemplating the relationship between perception and the works of authors such as Cranmer (2020), Ustun and Rudin (2017), Doshi-Velez, Kim (2017), Kleinberg (2018), and McGrath (2021), but it seems that we haven't delved deeply into their perspectives. It's worth noting that our discussion is not definitive and doesn't encompass all aspects of the authors' views. I appreciate your thoughts, and it seems that we have more to explore in terms of understanding perception and its implications. I'm still awake, so let's continue our discussion.

(a 1D convolutional network) and purely symbolic (a human-written program) models, respectively. 
The techniques close to the center are neurosymbolic: the model in the center-left is a neurosymbolic 
encoder [Zhan et al., 2021], while the model in the center-right is a program with differentiable 
parameters for behavior analysis [Tjandrasuwita et al., 2021]. From a def i nitional perspective, purely

although we typically do not refer to those as neurosymbolic programs for practical purposes. 
To illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each model in Figure 3, assume that we have a scientif i c 
hypothesis to test on a dataset. On the right side, the fully symbolic model would involve an expert- 
written program that encodes the hypothesis in a general programming language. This program 
requires no learnable parameters, is fully interpretable and, if needed, can be iteratively improved. 
However, this method is also brittle, and the program must be engineered to handle all the dynamics 
of the dataset. This is intractable for models with complex dynamics. On the left side, the purely 
neural model would model the hypothesis directly using the dataset. Such models i t well to the

Desiderata for Effective Neurosymbolic Programming.There are two main requirements for 
effective neurosymbolic programming: having a good DSL, and scalable learning algorithms. The 
DSL effectively corresponds to the component building blocks from which one can construct a 
neurosymbolic architecture, and is one of the primary ways that experts inject domain knowledge 
(i.e., inductive bias) into the learning process. Learning has two aspects: 1) searching for the best 
neurosymbolic architecture, and 2) optimizing the parameters within a i xed architecture. The former 
is is analogous to neural architecture search Elsken et al. [2019], and the latter is analogous to 
standard parameter optimization in deep learning. We discuss these issues in detail in Section 3, 
and conclude this section with a discussion on differentiable programs that enable differentiable 
parameter optimization within discrete symbolic architectures. 
Differentiable programs.A differentiable program for a programming language is def i ned as a 
composition of functions such that the parameters of the function are differentiable. A differentiable 
program follows the syntax def i ned by a DSL which can consist of parametric functions (multi- 
layered perceptrons, linear transformations), algebraic functions (add,multiply), and programming 
languages higher-order functions (map, fold). Furthermore, the composition of these differentiable 
functions is also differentiable through the chain rule. This property enables resulting programs to be 
fully differentiable. 
NP programs may be diff i cult to interpret by domain experts [Tjandrasuwita et al., 2021] focuses on 
explaining the difference in behavior expert annotations. They replace generic higher-order functions 
over recursive data structures, e.g.mapandfold, with a differentiable temporal i lter operation, the 
Morlet Filter. The i lter models temporal information in a highly data-eff i cient manner and can be 
interpreted as a human������s impulse response to a given behavioral feature for classif i cation.

In the context of neurosymbolic programming, Figure 3 represents a spectrum of methods that incorporate neural and symbolic reasoning. At one end, there are purely neural models represented by a 1D convolutional network. At the other end, there are purely symbolic models represented by human-written programs. The models closer to the center are neurosymbolic, such as the neurosymbolic encoder and the program with differentiable parameters for behavior analysis.
From a definitional perspective, purely neural and purely symbolic programs can be seen as special cases of neurosymbolic programs, although the term "neurosymbolic" is typically used for models closer to the center. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses. The purely symbolic model is fully interpretable and can be iteratively improved, but it may be brittle and challenging to handle complex dynamics. The purely neural model fits well to the dataset but lacks interpretability and control over the generated hypotheses.
Neurosymbolic approaches aim to combine the flexibility of neural networks with the structured semantics of symbolic models. They can offer a mixture of neural and symbolic components, providing both interpretability and the ability to capture complex dynamics if designed effectively.
To achieve effective neurosymbolic programming, two main requirements are identified: a good domain-specific language (DSL) and scalable learning algorithms. The DSL serves as the building blocks for constructing neurosymbolic architectures and allows experts to inject domain knowledge into the learning process. Learning involves searching for the best neurosymbolic architecture and optimizing the parameters within a fixed architecture. Differentiable programs play a crucial role in enabling parameter optimization within discrete symbolic architectures by ensuring the composition of differentiable functions and the differentiability of parameters.
Differentiable programs are defined as compositions of functions with differentiable parameters. These programs follow the syntax defined by a DSL and can include parametric functions, algebraic functions, and higher-order functions. The differentiability of these functions allows the resulting programs to be fully differentiable.
In terms of interpretation, NP programs may be challenging for domain experts. However, there are approaches, like using differentiable temporal filters, that aim to enhance interpretability by replacing generic higher-order functions with specific operations that model temporal information efficiently and can be interpreted as human impulse responses to behavioral features for classification.
Overall, neurosymbolic programming offers a range of models that integrate neural and symbolic reasoning, each with its advantages and challenges, and the goal is to strike a balance between interpretability and capturing complex dynamics.

3.7Cross-Domain Analysis Tools for Scientists 
Importance of tools in science.User-friendly tools are important for facilitating the integration of 
ML models in real-world science workf l ows but have not been well-explored for NP approaches. For 
example, numerous tools, based on statistical analysis and ML, have been developed to interface 
with scientists and facilitate behavior analysis from videos in Pereira et al. [2020]. These tools assist 
with much of the computational pipeline for behavior classif i cation as outlined in Figure 4, and will 
often provide visual interfaces that visualize relevant raw data such as video, with model outputs, 
such as pose data and behavior [Segalin et al., 2021]. Enabling similar tools for NP approaches has 
the potential to benef i t existing scientif i c workf l ows. For instance, integrating NEAR into a visual 
interface could provide scientists with a user-friendly way of generating differentiable programs 
and means of understanding the programs from NP pipelines. The parameters associated with 
programmatic primitives are likely to have a much more human interpretation [Tjandrasuwita et al., 
2021] than those found in black-box neural networks. 
Challenges of building NP tools.Domain expertise in science varies in structure, from behavioral 
attributes to visual or textual descriptions, to known dynamics of movement, to knowledge graphs, 
and generally differs across labs and domains. Furthermore, to measure progress, user evaluations are 
needed that could offer quantitative or qualitative evidence in NP workf l ows. Taking the i rst steps 
to realize and evaluate the effectiveness of NP algorithms through a human-computer interaction 
approach may not only improve the scientif i c pipeline but also yield new algorithmic directions on 
combining NP with more traditional human-in-the-loop methods, such as active learning. 
4Conclusion 
Neurosymbolic programming offers the promise to accelerate scientif i c discovery and optimize 
scientif i c discovery end-to-end. The benef i ts are in its ability to incorporate prior knowledge and 
the symbolic nature of the solutions, essential scientif i c workf l ows. However, challenges still 
remain in scalability and optimization stability of these approaches, comprehensive evaluations, and 
deployment in the form of tools. In this paper, we have demonstrated the opportunities and challenges 
of neurosymbolic programming in a concrete scientif i c application, behavior analysis. A key promise 
of neurosymbolic programming is to provide a set of unifying principles in interpretable machine 
learning and prior scientif i c literature. We invite the science and computer science communities to 
adopt these methods in their scientif i c workf l ow and to contribute to the research to advance NP 
techniques for science due to the unique benef i t to these communities.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Neurosymbolic computation and neuromorphic computing are two distinct approaches within the field of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, each with its own focus and methodology.
Neurosymbolic computation refers to the integration of neural networks and symbolic reasoning in order to combine the strengths of both approaches. It aims to bridge the gap between sub-symbolic, connectionist models (such as artificial neural networks) and symbolic, rule-based systems (such as expert systems or knowledge graphs). Neurosymbolic computation seeks to leverage the learning and pattern recognition capabilities of neural networks while incorporating the interpretability and reasoning abilities of symbolic systems. This integration allows for the modeling of complex cognitive processes, capturing both the neural aspects and the symbolic semantics of human-like intelligence.
On the other hand, neuromorphic computing is a specialized approach that focuses on designing hardware architectures and algorithms that mimic the structure and function of the human brain. Neuromorphic systems are inspired by the biological architecture of the brain and aim to replicate its parallelism, low power consumption, and efficient information processing. These systems often employ specialized hardware, such as neuromorphic chips or neuromorphic circuits, to simulate the behavior of neurons and synapses. Neuromorphic computing is particularly suited for tasks that require real-time processing, low latency, and energy efficiency, making it attractive for applications like robotics, sensor networks, and brain-computer interfaces.
While both neurosymbolic computation and neuromorphic computing involve the study of neural processes, they differ in their emphasis and objectives. Neurosymbolic computation focuses on the integration of neural networks and symbolic reasoning to achieve a deeper understanding of complex cognitive processes and to develop interpretable and explainable AI models. In contrast, neuromorphic computing emphasizes the hardware and algorithms that mimic the brain's architecture and functionality, with a focus on efficient, brain-inspired information processing.
In summary, neurosymbolic computation aims to combine the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning, while neuromorphic computing focuses on replicating the structure and function of the brain in specialized hardware and algorithms. Both approaches contribute to the broader field of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, offering unique perspectives and opportunities for advancing our understanding and development of intelligent systems.

3.4Challenges of optimization of discrete and continuous space in neurosymbolic programs 
NP relies on techniques from symbolic program synthesis to facilitate interpretable and verif i able 
searches over the scientif i c hypothesis space. However, programs are inherently symbolic, owing 
to their roots in mathematical logic. This makes modeling phenomena in the continuous domain 
challenging without modifying the way we interpret programs. 
For instance, consider a simple program that is modeled by an if-then-else statement (if condition 
do expr1 else do expr2). The possible behaviors ofconditionare partitioned into two sets ������ 
True (1) or False (0). These sets evaluate to eitherexpr1orexpr2respectively. However, an NP 
approach requires reasoning to be differentiable over a gradient of possibilities. Discrete programs 
are inaccurate models for these applications. Specif i cally, in behavior classif i cation, modeling the 
������attack������ action using a symbolic if-then-else expression would partition the mouse������s aggression into 
a binary set: either always attacking or not attacking at all. What makes more sense is to model 
������attacking������ as a binomial distribution. This requires relaxing our symbolic if-then-else to account for 
a continuous gradient of probabilities from 0% to 100%. 
Continuous relaxations.We approach the continuous program optimization problem of the symbolic 
domain by changing the semantics of the programming language. Specif i cally, work on Smooth 
Interpretation [Chaudhuri and Solar-Lezama, 2010] rewrites discrete functions using their closest 
smooth mathematical functions. Consecutively, an if-then-else statement would be rewritten as a 
hyperbolic tangent function with a high temperature. This smoothening is not restricted to a one- 
dimensional input space and specialized functions. In general, in higher dimensions, we can use 
Gaussian smoothing to smooth discontinuities. Such relaxations, in conjunction with other program 
analysis tools, allow gradient descent-based optimizers to converge to optimal programmatic models. 
Continuous relaxations enable an approximate interface between neural networks and programming 
languages, which are essential in the NP framework. For example, in Houdini [Valkov et al., 2018], 
continuous relaxations enabled the construction of a functional programming language that admits 
6 
neural networks and higher-order functions. This construction facilitated the high-level transfer of 
learned concepts across tasks in a lifelong learning setting. In NEAR [Shah et al., 2020], the interface 
between neural networks and differentiable programs allowed for measuring the performance of 
partial programs. This proved to be an?������admissible 
heuristic for synthesizing differentiable programs 
in the behavior analysis setting. 
Smooth Interpretation allows positing a differentiable approximation for a non-differentiable program. 
This approximation error introduces a tradeoff between the output precision and optimal trainability 
of the model. Specif i cally, under-approximating the non-differentiable components might increase 
the precision of the differentiable program at the cost of retaining discontinuities in the optimization 
landscape and converging to a suboptimal model, and vice-versa. 
3.5Evaluating Interpretability 
The main goal of interpretability is to obtain insights that are understandable and actionable to 
humans and to assist scientists in their analysis workf l ow. The following are commonly described 
properties of explanations found in machine learning [Murphy, 2023], that have the potential to 
improve the interpretability and evaluation of NP workf l ows:Compactness or sparsity:Sparsity 
generally corresponds to some notion of smallness measurement (a few features or a few parameters); 
Completeness:To measure if the explanation includes all the relevant elements, higher-level concepts 
needed;Stability:To measure the extent that there are explanations similar for similar input; 
Actionability:To allow focusing on only aspects of the model that the user might be able to 
intervene on;Modularity:Explanation can be broken down into understandable parts. To study 
interpretability of NP models for science, we need datasets and benchmarks to quantify these different 
dimensions of interpretability across scientif i c contexts, which is currently an open problem. 
An example of an interpretable program is presented in Figure 2b. This neurosymbolic program 
classif i es the ������sniff" action between two mice. An interpretation is that if the distance between two 
mice is small, they are doing a ������sniff"; otherwise, they are only doing a ������sniff" if the accelerations are 
small. Interpretability can also be expressed as a utility function or a form of abstraction Bowers et al. 
[2023] which minimizes the size of the corpus of a neurosymbolic program.

Neurosymbolic computation faces several challenges when it comes to optimization in both discrete and continuous spaces. In the context of symbolic program synthesis, the inherent symbolic nature of programs poses difficulties in modeling phenomena in the continuous domain without modifications to program interpretation.
Consider a simple program with an if-then-else statement. The condition in such a program partitions behaviors into two sets, True or False, which evaluate to different expressions. However, in neurosymbolic programming, reasoning needs to be differentiable over a gradient of possibilities, requiring a shift from discrete to continuous models. For example, modeling the "attack" action using a binary if-then-else expression would inaccurately partition aggression into always attacking or not attacking at all. A more accurate representation would involve a binomial distribution that accounts for a continuous gradient of probabilities.
To address the challenges of continuous program optimization in the symbolic domain, continuous relaxations are employed. Smooth Interpretation, for instance, rewrites discrete functions using their closest smooth mathematical functions. This allows for the rewriting of if-then-else statements as hyperbolic tangent functions with high temperatures, smoothing discontinuities. Gaussian smoothing can also be used in higher dimensions. These continuous relaxations, in combination with program analysis tools, enable gradient descent-based optimizers to converge on optimal programmatic models. This approximate interface between neural networks and programming languages is crucial in neurosymbolic programming frameworks.
The evaluation of interpretability is another important aspect in neurosymbolic computation. Compactness or sparsity, completeness, stability, actionability, and modularity are commonly described properties of explanations in machine learning that contribute to interpretability. Sparsity refers to a notion of smallness, completeness measures the inclusion of relevant elements and higher-level concepts, stability evaluates the consistency of explanations for similar inputs, actionability allows for focusing on aspects that can be intervened upon, and modularity breaks down explanations into understandable parts. Developing datasets and benchmarks to quantify interpretability across scientific contexts remains an open problem.
In conclusion, optimizing neurosymbolic programs in both discrete and continuous spaces requires addressing the challenges of modeling phenomena in the continuous domain and employing continuous relaxations. Evaluating interpretability in neurosymbolic models is essential to provide insights that are understandable and actionable for humans and to assist scientists in their analysis workflows.

3.3Scalability challenge 
From an optimization standpoint, compared to conventional deep learning, the main additional 
challenge is searching over program architectures. Architecture search is in general very challenging 
and typically leads to combinatorial discrete search space. 
Inductive synthesis.A large body of works on program synthesis has focused on inductive synthesis, 
or synthesizing programs from examples [Lau and Weld, 1998, Gulwani, 2011, Devlin et al., 2017]. 
While such a goal is on the surface similar to performing machine learning (ML) with programs 
5 
as models, a key difference is that ML approaches depend on def i ning a clear space of models (i.e. 
neural networks, support vector machines, decision trees) and generalizing to unseen data. In contrast, 
much work in inductive synthesis considers an arbitrary space of programs and spends signif i cant 
effort on sample engineering, treating them as noiseless specif i cations. As a result, inductive synthesis 
scales poorly with an increase in program length and number of examples. 
Scaling NP in science.To tackle scalability in science, models need to handle large and potentially 
noisy datasets, high-dimensional input space, and a variety of analysis tasks. Recently, NP research 
[Shah et al., 2020, Cui and Zhu, 2021] propose frameworks that scale to large datasets given an 
expressive DSL. These works are instantiated in behavior analysis: learning programs on temporal 
trajectory data to reproduce expert annotations of behavior that contain noisy labels, similar to other 
scientif i c data. These works tackle the challenge of discovering programs with parameters, which can 
be directly optimized through popular gradient optimization techniques. While NP methods provide 
a means of scaling inductive synthesis to scientif i c datasets, these techniques often involve combining 
a discrete search over an exponential space of programs with continuous optimization. 
Challenges for enabling scalability. Scaling up program synthesis for neurosymbolic programming 
is an active i eld of research. For instance, differentiable program synthesis methods [Cui and Zhu, 
2021] have studied the tradeoff between computation and memory, with heuristics to mitigate memory 
usage. However, training fully neural models on a GPU is often more eff i cient than training NP 
models, which requires searching through an exponentially ample space of symbolic architectures 
on a CPU. Furthermore, scalability has not been broadly explored for different types of scientif i c 
data, such as video recordings, which are much higher dimensional than trajectory data. Finally, the 
effectiveness of program synthesis may still be limited by the expressivity of a DSL, which requires 
experts to spend time encoding domain knowledge, such as expert-designed behavior attributes [Sun 
et al., 2021] and temporal i lters [Tjandrasuwita et al., 2021] (further discussed in Section 3.2). 
Scalability challenges also arise in other work on symbolic regression and interpretable machine 
learning. For instance, Cranmer et al. [2020] aims to learn exact mathematical relationships between 
variables by searching a space of mathematical expressions. As another example, Ustun and Rudin 
[2017]aimtolearnoptimizedriskscoreswithinthesamemodelinglanguageusedbyclinicians, which 
leads to an NP-hard optimization problem that they solve using integer programming techniques.

Scalability poses a significant challenge in neurosymbolic programming, particularly when compared to conventional deep learning approaches. The main additional challenge arises from searching over program architectures, which typically involves a combinatorial discrete search space.
Inductive synthesis, a key aspect of program synthesis, focuses on synthesizing programs from examples. While this may seem similar to machine learning with programs as models, there is a fundamental difference. Machine learning approaches operate within a defined space of models, such as neural networks or decision trees, and generalize to unseen data. Inductive synthesis, on the other hand, considers an arbitrary space of programs and requires substantial effort in sample engineering to treat examples as noiseless specifications. As a result, inductive synthesis does not scale well with increasing program length and the number of examples.
In order to address scalability challenges in the context of science, neurosymbolic programming models need to handle large and potentially noisy datasets, high-dimensional input spaces, and a wide range of analysis tasks. Recent research proposes frameworks that scale to large datasets by utilizing expressive Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). These frameworks, applied in behavior analysis, focus on learning programs from temporal trajectory data to reproduce expert annotations. They tackle the challenge of discovering programs with parameters that can be optimized using gradient-based techniques. However, scaling up program synthesis for neurosymbolic programming is an ongoing area of research.
Enabling scalability in program synthesis poses various challenges. Differentiable program synthesis methods have explored the tradeoff between computation and memory, implementing heuristics to mitigate memory usage. However, training fully neural models on a GPU is often more efficient than training neurosymbolic programming models, which require searching through an exponentially ample space of symbolic architectures on a CPU. Moreover, scalability has not been extensively explored for different types of scientific data, such as video recordings, which have much higher dimensionality than trajectory data. The expressivity of the Domain-Specific Language (DSL) used in program synthesis also affects scalability, as encoding domain knowledge and expert-designed behavior attributes can be time-consuming for experts.
Similar scalability challenges are encountered in other areas of research, such as symbolic regression and interpretable machine learning. Addressing these challenges involves exploring efficient search algorithms, heuristics, and optimization techniques specific to the problem domain.

Tell me some more fun facts!
In its essence, SymbolicAI was inspired by the neuro-symbolic programming paradigm.

Neuro-symbolic programming is a paradigm for artificial intelligence and cognitive computing that combines the strengths of both deep neural networks and symbolic reasoning.

Deep neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithms that are inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. They are particularly good at tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing etc. However, they are not as good at tasks that require explicit reasoning, such as long-term planning, problem solving, and understanding causal relationships.

Symbolic reasoning, on the other hand uses formal languages and logical rules to represent knowledge and perform tasks such as planning, problem solving, and understanding causal relationships. Symbolic reasoning systems are good at tasks that require explicit reasoning, but are not as good at tasks that require pattern recognition or generalization, such as image recognition or natural language processing.

Neuro-symbolic programming aims to combine the strengths of both neural networks and symbolic reasoning to create AI systems that can perform a wide range of tasks. One way this is done is by using neural networks to extract information from data and then using symbolic reasoning to make inferences and decisions based on that information. Another way is to use symbolic reasoning to guide the generative process of neural networks and make them more interpretable.

Embedded accelerators for LLMs will, in our opinion, be ubiquitous in future computation platforms, such as wearables, smartphones, tablets or notebooks. They will contain models similar to GPT-3, ChatGPT, OPT or Bloom.



These LLMs will be able to perform a wide range of computations, such as natural language understanding or decision making. Furthermore, neuro-symbolic computation engines will be able to learn concepts how to tackle unseen tasks and solve complex problems by querying various data sources for solutions and executing logical statements on top. In this turn, to ensure the generated content is in alignment with our goals, we need to develop ways to instruct, steer and control the generative processes of machine learning models. Therefore, our approach is an attempt to enable active and transparent flow control of these generative processes.



As shown in the figure above, one can think of this generative process as shifting a probability mass of an input stream of data towards an output stream of data, in a contextualized manner. With properly designed conditions and expressions, one can also validate and steer the behavior towards a desired outcome, or repeat expressions that failed to fulfil our requirements. Our approach is to define a set of fuzzy operations that manipulate the data stream and conditions the LLMs to align with our goals. In essence, we consider all data objects, such as strings, letters, integers, arrays, etc. as symbols and we see natural language as the main interface to interact with. See the following figure:



We show that as long as we can express our goals in natural language, we can use the power of LLMs for neuro-symbolic computations. In this turn, we create operations that manipulate these symbols to generate new symbols from them. Each symbol can be interpreted as a statement. Multiple statements can be combined to form a logical expression.

Therefore, by chaining statements together we can build causal relationships and computations, instead of relying only on inductive approaches. Consequently, the outlook towards an updated computational stack resembles a neuro-symbolic computation engine at its core and, in combination with established frameworks, enables new applications

Abstract
Conceptually, SymbolicAI is a framework that uses machine learning - and specifically LLMs - at its core, and composes operations based on task-specific prompting. We adopt a divide and conquer approach to decompose a complex problem into smaller problems. Therefore, each operation solves a simple task. By re-combining these operations we can solve the complex problem. Furthermore, our design principles allow us to transition between differentiable and classical programming, and to leverage the power of both worlds.

pip install symbolicai
One can run our framework in two ways:

using local engines (experimental) that are run on your local machine (see Local Neuro-Symbolic Engine section), or
using engines powered by external APIs, i.e. using OpenAI's API (see API Keys).
API Keys
Before the first run, define exports for the required API keys to enable the respective engines. This will register the keys in the internally for subsequent runs. By default SymbolicAI currently uses OpenAI's neural engines, i.e. GPT-3 Davinci-003, DALL����E 2 and Embedding Ada-002, for the neuro-symbolic computations, image generation and embeddings computation respectively. However, these modules can easily be replaced with open-source alternatives. Examples are

OPT or Bloom for neuro-symbolic computations,
Craiyon for image generation,
and any BERT variants for semantic embedding computations.
To set the OpenAI API Keys use the following command:

# Linux / MacOS
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"

# Windows (PowerShell)
$Env:OPENAI_API_KEY="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"

# Jupyter Notebooks (important: do not use quotes)
%env OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPENAI_API_KEY>
To get started import our library by using:

import symai as ai
Overall, the following engines are currently supported:

Neuro-Symbolic Engine: OpenAI's LLMs (GPT-3)
Embedding Engine: OpenAI's Embedding API
[Optional] Symbolic Engine: WolframAlpha
[Optional] Search Engine: SerpApi
[Optional] OCR Engine: APILayer
[Optional] SpeechToText Engine: OpenAI's Whisper
[Optional] WebCrawler Engine: Selenium
[Optional] Image Rendering Engine: DALL����E 2
[Optional] Indexing Engine: Pinecone
[Optional] CLIP Engine: hugs Hugging Face (experimental image and text embeddings)
[Optional] Installs
SymbolicAI uses multiple engines to process text, speech and images. We also include search engine access to retrieve information from the web. To use all of them, you will need to install also the following dependencies or assign the API keys to the respective engines.

If you want to use the WolframAlpha Engine, Search Engine or OCR Engine you will need to export the following API keys:

# Linux / MacOS
export SYMBOLIC_ENGINE_API_KEY="<WOLFRAMALPHA_API_KEY>"
export SEARCH_ENGINE_API_KEY="<SERP_API_KEY>"
export OCR_ENGINE_API_KEY="<APILAYER_API_KEY>"
export INDEXING_ENGINE_API_KEY="<PINECONE_API_KEY>"

# Windows (PowerShell)
$Env:SYMBOLIC_ENGINE_API_KEY="<WOLFRAMALPHA_API_KEY>"
$Env:SEARCH_ENGINE_API_KEY="<SERP_API_KEY>"
$Env:OCR_ENGINE_API_KEY="<APILAYER_API_KEY>"
$Env:INDEXING_ENGINE_API_KEY="<PINECONE_API_KEY>"
To use them, you will also need to install the following dependencies:

SpeechToText Engine: ffmpeg for audio processing (based on OpenAI's whisper)
# Linux
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# MacOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Windows
choco install ffmpeg
[Note] Additionally, you need to install the newest version directly from their repository, since the version available via pip is outdated:

pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
WebCrawler Engine: For selenium, download the corresponding driver version by setting the SELENIUM_CHROME_DRIVER_VERSION environment variable. Currently we use Chrome as the default browser. This means that the Chrome version major number must match the ChromeDriver version. All versions are available here. For example, if you use chrome version 109.0.5414.74, you can set any 109.x.x.x version for the chromedriver. In this case the 109.0.5414.74 is available on the selenium page, therefore the environment variable is set to it:
# Linux / MacOS
export SELENIUM_CHROME_DRIVER_VERSION="109.0.5414.74"

# Windows (PowerShell)
$Env:SELENIUM_CHROME_DRIVER_VERSION="109.0.5414.74"
Alternatively, you can specify in your project path a symai.config.json file with all the engine properties. This will replace the environment variables. See the following configuration file as an example:

{
    "NEUROSYMBOLIC_ENGINE_API_KEY": "<OPENAI_API_KEY>",
    "NEUROSYMBOLIC_ENGINE_MODEL": "text-davinci-003",
    "SYMBOLIC_ENGINE_API_KEY": "<WOLFRAMALPHA_API_KEY>",

    "INDEXING_ENGINE_ENVIRONMENT": "us-west1-gcp"
}
t-rex Apps
Over the course of th next weeks, we will expand our experimental demo apps and provide a set of useful tools that showcase how to interact with our framework. These apps are made available by calling the sym+<shortcut-name-of-app> command in your terminal or PowerShell.

Shell Command Tool
You can start a basic shell command support tool that translates natural language commands into shell commands. To start the shell command tool, simply run:

symsh "<your-query>"
You can also use the --help flag to get more information about the tool and available arguments.

symsh --help
Here is an example of how to use the tool:

$> symsh "PowerShell edit registiry entry"

# :Output:
# Set-ItemProperty -Path <path> -Name <name> -Value <value>

$> symsh "Set-ItemProperty -Path <path> -Name <name> -Value <value>" --add "path='/Users/myuser' name=Demo value=SymbolicAI"

# :Output:
# Set-ItemProperty -Path '/Users/myuser' -Name Demo -Value SymbolicAI

$> symsh "Set-ItemProperty -Path '/Users/myuser' -Name Demo -Value SymbolicAI" --del "string quotes"

# :Output:
# Set-ItemProperty -Path /Users/myuser -Name Demo -Value SymbolicAI

$> symsh "Set-ItemProperty -Path '/Users/myuser' -Name Demo -Value SymbolicAI" --convert "linux"

# :Output:
# export Demo="SymbolicAI"
Chatbot
You can start a basic conversation with Symbia. Symbia is a chatbot that uses SymbolicAI to detect the content of your request and switch between different contextual modes to answer your questions. These mode include search engines, speech engines and more. To start the chatbot, simply run:

symchat
This will start now a chatbot interface:

Symbia: Hi there! I'm Symbia, your virtual assistant. How may I help you?
$> 
You can exit the conversation by either typing exit, quit or pressing Ctrl+C.

man_shrugging Why SymbolicAI?
SymbolicAI tries to close the gap between classical programming or Software 1.0 and modern data-driven programming (aka Software 2.0). It is a framework that allows to build software applications, which are able to utilize the power of large language models (LLMs) wtih composability and inheritance - two powerful concepts from the object-oriented classical programming paradigm.

This allows to move along the spectrum between the classical programming realm and data-driven programming realm as illustrated in the following figure:



As briefly mentioned, we adopt a divide and conquer approach to decompose a complex problem into smaller problems. We then use the expressiveness and flexibility of LLMs to evaluate these sub-problems and by re-combining these operations we can solve the complex problem.

In this turn, and with enough data, we can gradually transition between general purpose LLMs with zero and few-shot learning capabilities, and specialized fine-tuned models to solve specific problems (see above). This means that each operations could be designed to use a model with fine-tuned task-specific behavior.

 Tell me some more fun facts!
In its essence, SymbolicAI was inspired by the neuro-symbolic programming paradigm.

Neuro-symbolic programming is a paradigm for artificial intelligence and cognitive computing that combines the strengths of both deep neural networks and symbolic reasoning.

Deep neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithms that are inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. They are particularly good at tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing etc. However, they are not as good at tasks that require explicit reasoning, such as long-term planning, problem solving, and understanding causal relationships.

Symbolic reasoning, on the other hand uses formal languages and logical rules to represent knowledge and perform tasks such as planning, problem solving, and understanding causal relationships. Symbolic reasoning systems are good at tasks that require explicit reasoning, but are not as good at tasks that require pattern recognition or generalization, such as image recognition or natural language processing.

Neuro-symbolic programming aims to combine the strengths of both neural networks and symbolic reasoning to create AI systems that can perform a wide range of tasks. One way this is done is by using neural networks to extract information from data and then using symbolic reasoning to make inferences and decisions based on that information. Another way is to use symbolic reasoning to guide the generative process of neural networks and make them more interpretable.

Embedded accelerators for LLMs will, in our opinion, be ubiquitous in future computation platforms, such as wearables, smartphones, tablets or notebooks. They will contain models similar to GPT-3, ChatGPT, OPT or Bloom.



These LLMs will be able to perform a wide range of computations, such as natural language understanding or decision making. Furthermore, neuro-symbolic computation engines will be able to learn concepts how to tackle unseen tasks and solve complex problems by querying various data sources for solutions and executing logical statements on top. In this turn, to ensure the generated content is in alignment with our goals, we need to develop ways to instruct, steer and control the generative processes of machine learning models. Therefore, our approach is an attempt to enable active and transparent flow control of these generative processes.



As shown in the figure above, one can think of this generative process as shifting a probability mass of an input stream of data towards an output stream of data, in a contextualized manner. With properly designed conditions and expressions, one can also validate and steer the behavior towards a desired outcome, or repeat expressions that failed to fulfil our requirements. Our approach is to define a set of fuzzy operations that manipulate the data stream and conditions the LLMs to align with our goals. In essence, we consider all data objects, such as strings, letters, integers, arrays, etc. as symbols and we see natural language as the main interface to interact with. See the following figure:



We show that as long as we can express our goals in natural language, we can use the power of LLMs for neuro-symbolic computations. In this turn, we create operations that manipulate these symbols to generate new symbols from them. Each symbol can be interpreted as a statement. Multiple statements can be combined to form a logical expression.

Therefore, by chaining statements together we can build causal relationships and computations, instead of relying only on inductive approaches. Consequently, the outlook towards an updated computational stack resembles a neuro-symbolic computation engine at its core and, in combination with established frameworks, enables new applications.

face_in_clouds How does it work?
We now show how we define our Symbolic API, which is based on object-oriented and compositional design patterns. The Symbol class is the base class for all functional operations, which we refer to as a terminal symbol in the context of symbolic programming (fully resolved expressions). The Symbol class holds helpful operations that can be interpreted as expressions to manipulate its content and evaluate to new Symbols.

books Symbolic operations
Let us now define a Symbol and perform some basic manipulations. We start with a translation operation:

sym = ai.Symbol("Welcome to our tutorial.")
sym.translate('German')
:[Output]: 
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=Willkommen zu unserem Tutorial.)
Ranking objects
Our API can also perform basic data-agnostic operations to filter, rank or extract patterns. For example, we can rank a list of numbers:

sym = ai.Symbol(numpy.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]))
res = sym.rank(measure='numerical', order='descending')
:[Output]: 
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=['7', '6', '5', '4', '3', '2', '1'])
Evaluating Expressions by best effort
As an inspiration, we relate to an approach demonstrated by word2vec.

Word2Vec generates dense vector representations of words by training a shallow neural network to predict a word given its neighbors in a text corpus. The resulting vectors are then used in a wide range of natural language processing applications, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and clustering.

Below we can see an example how one can perform operations on the word embeddings (colored boxes). The words are tokenized and mapped to a vector space, where we can perform semantic operations via vector arithmetics.



Similar to word2vec we intend to perform contextualized operations on different symbols, however, instead of operating in the vector space, we operate in the natural language domain. This gives us the ability to perform arithmetics on words, sentences, paragraphs, etc. and verify the results in a human readable format.

The following examples show how to evaluate such an expression via a string representation:

ai.Symbol('King - Man + Women').expression()
:[Output]:
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=Queen)
Dynamic casting
We can also subtract sentences from each other, where our operations condition the neural computation engine to evaluate the Symbols by best effort. In the following example, it determines that the word enemy is present in the sentence, therefore deletes it and replaces it with the word friend (which is added):

res = ai.Symbol('Hello my enemy') - 'enemy' + 'friend'
:[Output]: 
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=Hello my friend)
What we also see is that the API performs dynamic casting, when data types are combined with a Symbol object. If an overloaded operation of the Symbol class is used, the Symbol class can automatically cast the second object to a Symbol. This is a convenient modality to perform operations between Symbolobjects and other types of data, such as strings, integers, floats, lists, etc. without bloating the syntax.

Fuzzy Comparisons
In this example we are fuzzily comparing two number objects, where the Symbol variant is only an approximation of numpy.pi. Given the context of the fuzzy equals == operation, this comparison still succeeds and returns True.

sym = ai.Symbol('3.1415...')
sym == numpy.pi
:[Output]:
True
brain Causal Reasoning
Our framework was built with the intention to enable reasoning capabilities on top of statistical inference of LLMs. Therefore, we can also perform deductive reasoning operations with our Symbol objects. For example, we can define a set of operations with rules that define the causal relationship between two symbols. The following example shows how the & is used to compute the logical implication of two symbols.

res = ai.Symbol('The horn only sounds on Sundays.') & ai.Symbol('I hear the horn.')
:[Output]:
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=It is Sunday.)
The current &-operation overloads the and logical operator and sends few-shot prompts how to evaluate the statement to the neural computation engine. However, we can define more sophisticated logical operators for and, or and xor via formal proof statements and use the neural engines to parse data structures prior to our expression evaluation. Therefore, one can also define custom operations to perform more complex and robust logical operations, including constraints to validate the outcomes and ensure a desired behavior.

To provide a more complete picture, we also sketch more comprehensive causal examples below, where one tries to obtain logical answers, based on questions of the kind:

# 1) "A line parallel to y = 4x + 6 passes through (5, 10). What is the y-coordinate of the point where this line crosses the y-axis?"
# 2) "Bob has two sons, John and Jay. Jay has one brother and father. The father has two sons. Jay's brother has a brother and a father. Who is Jay's brother."
# 3) "is 1000 bigger than 1063.472?"
To give an rough idea of how we would approach this with our framework is by, first, using a chain of operations to detect the neural engine that is best suited to handle this task, and second, prepare the input for the respective engine. Let's see an example:

val = "<one of the examples above>"

# First define a class that inherits from the Expression class
class ComplexExpression(ai.Expression): # more to the Expression class in later sections
    # write a method that returns the causal evaluation
    def causal_expression(self):
        pass # see below for implementation

# instantiate an object of the class
expr = ComplexExpression(val)
# set WolframAlpha as the main expression engine to use
expr.command(engines=['symbolic'], expression_engine='wolframalpha')
# evaluate the expression
res = expr.causal_expression()
Now, the implementation of causal_expression could in principle look like this:

def causal_expression(self):
    # very which case to use `self.value` contains the input
    if self.isinstanceof('mathematics'):
        # get the mathematical formula
        formula = self.extract('mathematical formula')
        # verify which problem type we have
        if formula.isinstanceof('linear function'):
            # prepare for wolframalpha
            question = self.extract('question sentence')
            req = question.extract('what is requested?')
            x = self.extract('coordinate point (.,.)') # get coordinate point / could also ask for other points
            query = formula @ f', point x = {x}' @ f', solve {req}' # concatenate to the question and formula
            res = query.expression(query) # send prepared query to wolframalpha

        elif formula.isinstanceof('number comparison'):
            res = formula.expression() # send directly to wolframalpha

        ... # more cases

    elif self.isinstanceof('linguistic problem'):
        sentences = self / '.' # first split into sentences
        graph = {} # define graph
        for s in sentences:
            sym = ai.Symbol(s)
            relations = sym.extract('connected entities (e.g. A has three B => A | A: three B)') / '|' # and split by pipe
            for r in relations:
                ... # add relations and populate graph => alternatively, read also about CycleGT

    ... # more cases
    return res
The above example shows how we can use the causal_expression expression method to step-wise iterate and extract information which we can then either manually or using external solvers resolve.

Attention: We hint the reader that this is a very rough sketch and that the implementation of the causal_expression method would need much more engineering effort. Furthermore, the currently used GPT-3 LLM backend often fails to extract the correct information or resolve the right comparison. However, we strongly believe in the advances of the field and that this will change in the future, specifically with fine-tuned models like ChatGPT with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).

Lastly, it is also noteworthy that given enough data, we could fine-tune methods that extract information or build our knowledge graph from natural language. This would enable us to perform more complex reasoning tasks, such as the ones mentioned above. Therefore, we also point the reader to recent publications for translating Text-to-Graphs. This means that in the attempt to answer the query, we can simply traverse the graph and extract the information we need.

wrench Get Started
arrow_right Quick Install
pip install symbolicai
One can run our framework in two ways:

using local engines (experimental) that are run on your local machine (see Local Neuro-Symbolic Engine section), or
using engines powered by external APIs, i.e. using OpenAI's API (see API Keys).
API Keys
Before the first run, define exports for the required API keys to enable the respective engines. This will register the keys in the internally for subsequent runs. By default SymbolicAI currently uses OpenAI's neural engines, i.e. GPT-3 Davinci-003, DALL����E 2 and Embedding Ada-002, for the neuro-symbolic computations, image generation and embeddings computation respectively. However, these modules can easily be replaced with open-source alternatives. Examples are

OPT or Bloom for neuro-symbolic computations,
Craiyon for image generation,
and any BERT variants for semantic embedding computations.
To set the OpenAI API Keys use the following command:

# Linux / MacOS
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"

# Windows (PowerShell)
$Env:OPENAI_API_KEY="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"

# Jupyter Notebooks (important: do not use quotes)
%env OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPENAI_API_KEY>
To get started import our library by using:

import symai as ai
Overall, the following engines are currently supported:

Neuro-Symbolic Engine: OpenAI's LLMs (GPT-3)
Embedding Engine: OpenAI's Embedding API
[Optional] Symbolic Engine: WolframAlpha
[Optional] Search Engine: SerpApi
[Optional] OCR Engine: APILayer
[Optional] SpeechToText Engine: OpenAI's Whisper
[Optional] WebCrawler Engine: Selenium
[Optional] Image Rendering Engine: DALL����E 2
[Optional] Indexing Engine: Pinecone
[Optional] CLIP Engine: hugs Hugging Face (experimental image and text embeddings)
[Optional] Installs
SymbolicAI uses multiple engines to process text, speech and images. We also include search engine access to retrieve information from the web. To use all of them, you will need to install also the following dependencies or assign the API keys to the respective engines.

If you want to use the WolframAlpha Engine, Search Engine or OCR Engine you will need to export the following API keys:

# Linux / MacOS
export SYMBOLIC_ENGINE_API_KEY="<WOLFRAMALPHA_API_KEY>"
export SEARCH_ENGINE_API_KEY="<SERP_API_KEY>"
export OCR_ENGINE_API_KEY="<APILAYER_API_KEY>"
export INDEXING_ENGINE_API_KEY="<PINECONE_API_KEY>"

# Windows (PowerShell)
$Env:SYMBOLIC_ENGINE_API_KEY="<WOLFRAMALPHA_API_KEY>"
$Env:SEARCH_ENGINE_API_KEY="<SERP_API_KEY>"
$Env:OCR_ENGINE_API_KEY="<APILAYER_API_KEY>"
$Env:INDEXING_ENGINE_API_KEY="<PINECONE_API_KEY>"
To use them, you will also need to install the following dependencies:

SpeechToText Engine: ffmpeg for audio processing (based on OpenAI's whisper)
# Linux
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# MacOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Windows
choco install ffmpeg
[Note] Additionally, you need to install the newest version directly from their repository, since the version available via pip is outdated:

pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
WebCrawler Engine: For selenium, download the corresponding driver version by setting the SELENIUM_CHROME_DRIVER_VERSION environment variable. Currently we use Chrome as the default browser. This means that the Chrome version major number must match the ChromeDriver version. All versions are available here. For example, if you use chrome version 109.0.5414.74, you can set any 109.x.x.x version for the chromedriver. In this case the 109.0.5414.74 is available on the selenium page, therefore the environment variable is set to it:
# Linux / MacOS
export SELENIUM_CHROME_DRIVER_VERSION="109.0.5414.74"

# Windows (PowerShell)
$Env:SELENIUM_CHROME_DRIVER_VERSION="109.0.5414.74"
Alternatively, you can specify in your project path a symai.config.json file with all the engine properties. This will replace the environment variables. See the following configuration file as an example:

{
    "NEUROSYMBOLIC_ENGINE_API_KEY": "<OPENAI_API_KEY>",

t-rex Apps
Over the course of th next weeks, we will expand our experimental demo apps and provide a set of useful tools that showcase how to interact with our framework. These apps are made available by calling the sym+<shortcut-name-of-app> command in your terminal or PowerShell.

Shell Command Tool
You can start a basic shell command support tool that translates natural language commands into shell commands. To start the shell command tool, simply run:

symsh "<your-query>"
You can also use the --help flag to get more information about the tool and available arguments.

symsh --help
Here is an example of how to use the tool:

$> symsh "PowerShell edit registiry entry"

# :Output:
# Set-ItemProperty -Path <path> -Name <name> -Value <value>

$> symsh "Set-ItemProperty -Path <path> -Name <name> -Value <value>" --add "path='/Users/myuser' name=Demo value=SymbolicAI"

# :Output:
# Set-ItemProperty -Path '/Users/myuser' -Name Demo -Value SymbolicAI

$> symsh "Set-ItemProperty -Path '/Users/myuser' -Name Demo -Value SymbolicAI" --del "string quotes"

# :Output:
# Set-ItemProperty -Path /Users/myuser -Name Demo -Value SymbolicAI

$> symsh "Set-ItemProperty -Path '/Users/myuser' -Name Demo -Value SymbolicAI" --convert "linux"

# :Output:
# export Demo="SymbolicAI"
Chatbot
You can start a basic conversation with Symbia. Symbia is a chatbot that uses SymbolicAI to detect the content of your request and switch between different contextual modes to answer your questions. These mode include search engines, speech engines and more. To start the chatbot, simply run:

man_shrugging Why SymbolicAI?
SymbolicAI tries to close the gap between classical programming or Software 1.0 and modern data-driven programming (aka Software 2.0). It is a framework that allows to build software applications, which are able to utilize the power of large language models (LLMs) wtih composability and inheritance - two powerful concepts from the object-oriented classical programming paradigm.

This allows to move along the spectrum between the classical programming realm and data-driven programming realm as illustrated in the following figure:



As briefly mentioned, we adopt a divide and conquer approach to decompose a complex problem into smaller problems. We then use the expressiveness and flexibility of LLMs to evaluate these sub-problems and by re-combining these operations we can solve the complex problem.

In this turn, and with enough data, we can gradually transition between general purpose LLMs with zero and few-shot learning capabilities, and specialized fine-tuned models to solve specific problems (see above). This means that each operations could be designed to use a model with fine-tuned task-specific behavior.

 Tell me some more fun facts!
In its essence, SymbolicAI was inspired by the neuro-symbolic programming paradigm.

Neuro-symbolic programming is a paradigm for artificial intelligence and cognitive computing that combines the strengths of both deep neural networks and symbolic reasoning.

Deep neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithms that are inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. They are particularly good at tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing etc. However, they are not as good at tasks that require explicit reasoning, such as long-term planning, problem solving, and understanding causal relationships.

Symbolic reasoning, on the other hand uses formal languages and logical rules to represent knowledge and perform tasks such as planning, problem solving, and understanding causal relationships. Symbolic reasoning systems are good at tasks that require explicit reasoning, but are not as good at tasks that require pattern recognition or generalization, such as image recognition or natural language processing.

Neuro-symbolic programming aims to combine the strengths of both neural networks and symbolic reasoning to create AI systems that can perform a wide range of tasks. One way this is done is by using neural networks to extract information from data and then using symbolic reasoning to make inferences and decisions based on that information. Another way is to use symbolic reasoning to guide the generative process of neural networks and make them more interpretable.

Embedded accelerators for LLMs will, in our opinion, be ubiquitous in future computation platforms, such as wearables, smartphones, tablets or notebooks. They will contain models similar to GPT-3, ChatGPT, OPT or Bloom.



These LLMs will be able to perform a wide range of computations, such as natural language understanding or decision making. Furthermore, neuro-symbolic computation engines will be able to learn concepts how to tackle unseen tasks and solve complex problems by querying various data sources for solutions and executing logical statements on top. In this turn, to ensure the generated content is in alignment with our goals, we need to develop ways to instruct, steer and control the generative processes of machine learning models. Therefore, our approach is an attempt to enable active and transparent flow control of these generative processes.



As shown in the figure above, one can think of this generative process as shifting a probability mass of an input stream of data towards an output stream of data, in a contextualized manner. With properly designed conditions and expressions, one can also validate and steer the behavior towards a desired outcome, or repeat expressions that failed to fulfil our requirements. Our approach is to define a set of fuzzy operations that manipulate the data stream and conditions the LLMs to align with our goals. In essence, we consider all data objects, such as strings, letters, integers, arrays, etc. as symbols and we see natural language as the main interface to interact with. See the following figure:



We show that as long as we can express our goals in natural language, we can use the power of LLMs for neuro-symbolic computations. In this turn, we create operations that manipulate these symbols to generate new symbols from them. Each symbol can be interpreted as a statement. Multiple statements can be combined to form a logical expression.

Therefore, by chaining statements together we can build causal relationships and computations, instead of relying only on inductive approaches. Consequently, the outlook towards an updated computational stack resembles a neuro-symbolic computation engine at its core and, in combination with established frameworks, enables new applications.

face_in_clouds How does it work?
We now show how we define our Symbolic API, which is based on object-oriented and compositional design patterns. The Symbol class is the base class for all functional operations, which we refer to as a terminal symbol in the context of symbolic programming (fully resolved expressions). The Symbol class holds helpful operations that can be interpreted as expressions to manipulate its content and evaluate to new Symbols.

books Symbolic operations
Let us now define a Symbol and perform some basic manipulations. We start with a translation operation:

sym = ai.Symbol("Welcome to our tutorial.")
sym.translate('German')
:[Output]: 
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=Willkommen zu unserem Tutorial.)
Ranking objects
Our API can also perform basic data-agnostic operations to filter, rank or extract patterns. For example, we can rank a list of numbers:

sym = ai.Symbol(numpy.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]))
res = sym.rank(measure='numerical', order='descending')
:[Output]: 
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=['7', '6', '5', '4', '3', '2', '1'])
Evaluating Expressions by best effort
As an inspiration, we relate to an approach demonstrated by word2vec.

Word2Vec generates dense vector representations of words by training a shallow neural network to predict a word given its neighbors in a text corpus. The resulting vectors are then used in a wide range of natural language processing applications, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and clustering.

Below we can see an example how one can perform operations on the word embeddings (colored boxes). The words are tokenized and mapped to a vector space, where we can perform semantic operations via vector arithmetics.



Similar to word2vec we intend to perform contextualized operations on different symbols, however, instead of operating in the vector space, we operate in the natural language domain. This gives us the ability to perform arithmetics on words, sentences, paragraphs, etc. and verify the results in a human readable format.

The following examples show how to evaluate such an expression via a string representation:

ai.Symbol('King - Man + Women').expression()
:[Output]:
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=Queen)
Dynamic casting
We can also subtract sentences from each other, where our operations condition the neural computation engine to evaluate the Symbols by best effort. In the following example, it determines that the word enemy is present in the sentence, therefore deletes it and replaces it with the word friend (which is added):

res = ai.Symbol('Hello my enemy') - 'enemy' + 'friend'
:[Output]: 
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=Hello my friend)
What we also see is that the API performs dynamic casting, when data types are combined with a Symbol object. If an overloaded operation of the Symbol class is used, the Symbol class can automatically cast the second object to a Symbol. This is a convenient modality to perform operations between Symbolobjects and other types of data, such as strings, integers, floats, lists, etc. without bloating the syntax.

Fuzzy Comparisons
In this example we are fuzzily comparing two number objects, where the Symbol variant is only an approximation of numpy.pi. Given the context of the fuzzy equals == operation, this comparison still succeeds and returns True.

sym = ai.Symbol('3.1415...')
sym == numpy.pi
:[Output]:
True
brain Causal Reasoning
Our framework was built with the intention to enable reasoning capabilities on top of statistical inference of LLMs. Therefore, we can also perform deductive reasoning operations with our Symbol objects. For example, we can define a set of operations with rules that define the causal relationship between two symbols. The following example shows how the & is used to compute the logical implication of two symbols.

res = ai.Symbol('The horn only sounds on Sundays.') & ai.Symbol('I hear the horn.')
:[Output]:
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=It is Sunday.)
The current &-operation overloads the and logical operator and sends few-shot prompts how to evaluate the statement to the neural computation engine. However, we can define more sophisticated logical operators for and, or and xor via formal proof statements and use the neural engines to parse data structures prior to our expression evaluation. Therefore, one can also define custom operations to perform more complex and robust logical operations, including constraints to validate the outcomes and ensure a desired behavior.

To provide a more complete picture, we also sketch more comprehensive causal examples below, where one tries to obtain logical answers, based on questions of the kind:

# 1) "A line parallel to y = 4x + 6 passes through (5, 10). What is the y-coordinate of the point where this line crosses the y-axis?"
# 2) "Bob has two sons, John and Jay. Jay has one brother and father. The father has two sons. Jay's brother has a brother and a father. Who is Jay's brother."
# 3) "is 1000 bigger than 1063.472?"
To give an rough idea of how we would approach this with our framework is by, first, using a chain of operations to detect the neural engine that is best suited to handle this task, and second, prepare the input for the respective engine. Let's see an example:

val = "<one of the examples above>"

# First define a class that inherits from the Expression class
class ComplexExpression(ai.Expression): # more to the Expression class in later sections
    # write a method that returns the causal evaluation
    def causal_expression(self):
        pass # see below for implementation

# instantiate an object of the class
expr = ComplexExpression(val)
# set WolframAlpha as the main expression engine to use
expr.command(engines=['symbolic'], expression_engine='wolframalpha')
# evaluate the expression
res = expr.causal_expression()
Now, the implementation of causal_expression could in principle look like this:

def causal_expression(self):
    # very which case to use `self.value` contains the input
    if self.isinstanceof('mathematics'):
        # get the mathematical formula
        formula = self.extract('mathematical formula')
        # verify which problem type we have
        if formula.isinstanceof('linear function'):
            # prepare for wolframalpha
            question = self.extract('question sentence')
            req = question.extract('what is requested?')
            x = self.extract('coordinate point (.,.)') # get coordinate point / could also ask for other points
            query = formula @ f', point x = {x}' @ f', solve {req}' # concatenate to the question and formula
            res = query.expression(query) # send prepared query to wolframalpha

        elif formula.isinstanceof('number comparison'):
            res = formula.expression() # send directly to wolframalpha

        ... # more cases

    elif self.isinstanceof('linguistic problem'):
        sentences = self / '.' # first split into sentences
        graph = {} # define graph
        for s in sentences:
            sym = ai.Symbol(s)
            relations = sym.extract('connected entities (e.g. A has three B => A | A: three B)') / '|' # and split by pipe
            for r in relations:
                ... # add relations and populate graph => alternatively, read also about CycleGT

    ... # more cases
    return res
The above example shows how we can use the causal_expression expression method to step-wise iterate and extract information which we can then either manually or using external solvers resolve.

Attention: We hint the reader that this is a very rough sketch and that the implementation of the causal_expression method would need much more engineering effort. Furthermore, the currently used GPT-3 LLM backend often fails to extract the correct information or resolve the right comparison. However, we strongly believe in the advances of the field and that this will change in the future, specifically with fine-tuned models like ChatGPT with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).

Lastly, it is also noteworthy that given enough data, we could fine-tune methods that extract information or build our knowledge graph from natural language. This would enable us to perform more complex reasoning tasks, such as the ones mentioned above. Therefore, we also point the reader to recent publications for translating Text-to-Graphs. This means that in the attempt to answer the query, we can simply traverse the graph and extract the information we need.

In the next section, we will explore operations.

mask Operations
Operations are at the core of our framework. They are the building blocks of our API and are used to define the behavior of our symbols. We can think of operations as contextualized functions that take in a Symbol object, send it to the neuro-symbolic engine for evaluation, and return one or multiple new objects (mainly new symbols; but not necessarily limited to that). Another fundamental property is polymorphism, which means that operations can be applied to different types of data, such as strings, integers, floats, lists, etc. with different behaviors, depending on the object instance.

The way we execute operations is by using the Symbol object value attribute containing the original data type that is then sent as a string representations to the engines to perform the operations. Therefore all values are casted to a string representation. This also means, that for custom objects one needs to define a proper __str__ method to cast the object to a string representation and ensure preservation of the semantics of that object.

Lastly, we need to talk about inheritance. Our API is built on top of the Symbol class, which is the base class of all operations. This means that all operations are inherited from the Symbol class. This provides a convenient modality to add new custom operations by sub-classing Symbol, yet, ensuring to always have a set of base operations at our disposal without bloating the syntax or re-implementing many existing functionalities. This also means that we can define contextualized operations with individual constraints, prompt designs and therefore behaviors by simply sub-classing the Symbol class and overriding the corresponding method. However, we recommend sub-classing the Expression class as we will see later, it adds additional functionalities.

Here is an example of how to define a custom == operation by overriding the __eq__ method and providing a custom prompt object with a list of examples:

class Demo(ai.Symbol):
    def __eq__(self, other) -> bool:
        @ai.equals(examples=ai.Prompt([
              "1 == 'ONE' =>True",
              "'six' == 7 =>False",
              "'Acht' == 'eight' =>True",
              ...
          ])
        )
        def _func(_, other) -> bool:
            return False # default behavior on failure
        return _func(self, other)
As shown in the above example, this is also the way we implemented the basic operations in Symbol, by defining local functions that are then decorated with the respective operation decorator from the symai/core.py file. The symai/core.py is a collection of pre-defined operation decorators that we can quickly apply to any function. The reason why we use locally defined functions instead of directly decorating the main methods, is that we do not necessarily want that all our operations are sent to the neural engine and could implement a default behavior. Another reason is that we want to cast return types of the operation outcome to symbols or other derived classes thereof. This is done by using the self._sym_return_type(...) method and can give contextualized behavior based on the defined return type. See more details in the actual Symbol class.

In the next section, we will show that almost all operations in symai/core.py are derived from the more generic few_shot decorator.

test_tube Custom Operations
One can also define customized operations. For example, let us define a custom operation to generate a random integer between 0 and 10:

class Demo(ai.Symbol):
    def __init__(self, value = '') -> None:
        super().__init__(value)
    
    @ai.zero_shot(prompt="Generate a random integer between 0 and 10.",
                  constraints=[
                      lambda x: x >= 0,
                      lambda x: x <= 10
                  ])
    def get_random_int(self) -> int:
        pass
As we show, the Symbolic API uses Python Decorators to define operations. The @ai.zero_shot decorator is used to define a custom operation that does not require any demonstration examples, since the prompt is expressive enough. In the shown example, the zero_shot decorator takes in two arguments: prompt and constraints. The former is used to define the prompt that conditions our desired operation behavior. The latter is used to define validation constraints of the computed outcome, to ensure it fulfills our expectations.

If the constraint is not fulfilled, the above implementation would reach out to the specified default implementation or default value. If no default implementation or value was found, the Symbolic API would raise an ConstraintViolationException.

We also see that in the above example the return type is defined as int. Therefore, the resulting value from the wrapped function will be of type int. This works because our implementation uses auto-casting to a user specified return data type. If the cast fails, the Symbolic API will raise a ValueError. If no return type is specified, the return type will be Any.

The SymbolicAI framework is a neuro-symbolic programming framework that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with classical and differentiable programming in Python. It aims to enable the building of applications with LLMs at their core, allowing for the composition of operations based on task-specific prompting.
The framework provides a set of operations and functionalities to manipulate symbols and perform various tasks. Here are some key features and concepts of SymbolicAI:
Symbol: The Symbol class is the base class for all functional operations in the framework. It holds operations that can be interpreted as expressions to manipulate its content and evaluate to new symbols. Symbols can represent text, numbers, arrays, and more.
Operations: Operations are contextualized functions that take a Symbol object, send it to the neuro-symbolic engine for evaluation, and return new objects (symbols) as results. Operations can be applied to different types of data and define the behavior of symbols.
Prompting: The framework uses prompts to condition the behavior of the neuro-symbolic engine. Prompts are expressed in natural language and guide the evaluation of symbols. They can be used to perform tasks like translation, ranking, evaluation of expressions, and more.
Neural Computation Engine: SymbolicAI leverages the power of neural language models (LLMs) for neuro-symbolic computations. It uses engines such as OpenAI's GPT-3 and Embedding API to process text and perform operations based on prompts.
Custom Operations: SymbolicAI allows users to define custom operations by sub-classing the Symbol class and overriding methods. Custom operations can have specific behaviors, prompts, and constraints.
Causal Reasoning: The framework enables causal reasoning by defining operations and rules that represent causal relationships between symbols. It allows for logical operations, deduction, and reasoning based on given information.
Constraints and Validation: SymbolicAI supports the definition of constraints and validation functions to ensure that the outcomes of operations meet specific requirements. Constraints can be used to validate the results or guide the behavior of operations.
Few-shot Learning: SymbolicAI incorporates few-shot learning capabilities, allowing for the learning of concepts and solving complex problems with limited data.
Symbolic API: SymbolicAI provides a Symbolic API that allows developers to interact with the framework and perform operations using natural language queries or commands.
The framework also supports the integration of external engines and APIs for tasks like search, OCR, speech-to-text, and image rendering.
These are just some of the main features and concepts of SymbolicAI. The framework aims to bridge the gap between classical programming and data-driven programming by combining the strengths of LLMs and symbolic reasoning. It provides a powerful toolset for building applications that leverage the capabilities of large language models and enable neuro-symbolic computations.

Few-shot operations
The @ai.few_shot decorator is the a generalized version of @ai.zero_shot and is used to define a custom operation that requires demonstration examples. To give a more complete picture, we present the function signature of the few_shot decorator:

def few_shot(prompt: str,
             examples: Prompt, 
             constraints: List[Callable] = [],
             default: Optional[object] = None, 
             limit: int = 1,
             pre_processor: Optional[List[PreProcessor]] = None,
             post_processor: Optional[List[PostProcessor]] = None,
             **wrp_kwargs):
The prompt and constraints attributes behavior is similar to the zero_shot decorator. The examples and limit arguments are new. The examples argument is used to define a list of demonstrations that are used to condition the neural computation engine. The limit argument is used to define the maximum number of examples that are returned, give that there are more results. The pre_processor argument takes a list of PreProcessor objects which can be used to pre-process the input before it is fed into the neural computation engine. The post_processor argument takes a list of PostProcessor objects which can be used to post-process the output before it is returned to the user. The wrp_kwargs argument is used to pass additional arguments to the wrapped method, which are also stream-lined towards the neural computation engine and other engines.

To give a more holistic picture ouf our conceptional implementation, see the following flow diagram containing the most important classes:



The colors indicate logical groups of data processing steps. Yellow indicates the input and output data. Blue indicates places you can customize or prepare the input of your engine. Green indicates post-processing steps of the engine response. Red indicates the application of constraints (which also includes the attempted casting of the return type signature, if specified in the decorated method). Grey indicates the custom method which defines all properties, therefore has access to all the above mentioned objects.

To conclude this section, here is an example how to write a custom Japanese name generator with our @ai.zero_shot decorator:

import symai as ai
class Demo(ai.Symbol):
    @ai.few_shot(prompt="Generate Japanese names: ",
                 examples=ai.Prompt(
                   ["������������", "������������", "������������", "������������"]
                 ),
                 limit=2,
                 constraints=[lambda x: len(x) > 1])
    def generate_japanese_names(self) -> list:
        return ['������������', '������������'] # dummy implementation
Should the neural computation engine not be able to compute the desired outcome, it will reach out to the default implementation or default value. If no default implementation or value was found, the method call will raise an exception.

The
prompt

constraints
attributes behave similarly to the
zero_shot
decorator. The
examples
and
limit
arguments are new. The
examples
argument is used to define a list of demonstrations that are used to condition the neural computation engine. The
limit
argument is used to define the maximum number of examples that are returned if there are more results.
The
pre_processor
argument takes a list of
PreProcessor
objects, which can be used to pre-process the input before it is fed into the neural computation engine. The
post_processor
argument takes a list of
PostProcessor
objects, which can be used to post-process the output before it is returned to the user. The
wrp_kwargs
argument is used to pass additional arguments to the wrapped method, which are streamlined towards the neural computation engine and other engines.
To illustrate the usage of
@ai.few_shot
, here's an example of how to write a custom Japanese name generator:
python
Copy code
import
symai
as
ai
class
Demo
(ai.Symbol):
@ai.few_shot(
prompt=
"Generate Japanese names: "
,
                 examples=ai.Prompt(
[
"������������"
,
"������������"
,
"������������"
,
"������������"
]
),
                 limit=
2
,
                 constraints=[
lambda
x:
len
(
x
) >
1
]
)
def
generate_japanese_names
(
self
) ->
list
:
return
[
'������������'
,
'������������'
]
# dummy implementation
In this example, the
generate_japanese_names
method is decorated with
@ai.few_shot
. The
prompt
parameter is used to provide an instructional prompt for the operation. The
examples
parameter contains a list of demonstration examples. The
limit
parameter is set to 2, indicating that if there are more than 2 possible results, only 2 will be returned. The
constraints
parameter is used to specify a constraint on the generated names, in this case, the length of the name should be greater than 1.
If the neural computation engine is unable to compute the desired outcome, it will fall back to the default implementation or default value specified in the decorator. If no default implementation or value is provided, an exception will be raised.

Prompt Design
The way all the above operations are performed is by using a Prompt class. The Prompt class is a container for all the information that is needed to define a specific operation. The Prompt class is also the base class for all other Prompt classes.

Here is an example how to define a Prompt to enforce the neural computation engine for comparing two values:

class CompareValues(ai.Prompt):
    def __init__(self) -> ai.Prompt:
        super().__init__([
            "4 > 88 =>False",
            "-inf < 0 =>True",
            "inf > 0 =>True",
            "4 > 3 =>True",
            "1 < 'four' =>True",
            ...
        ])
For example, when calling the <= operation on two Symbols, the neural computation engine will evaluate the symbols in the context of the CompareValues prompt.

res = ai.Symbol(1) <= ai.Symbol('one')
This statement evaluates to True, since the fuzzy compare operation was conditions our engine to compare the two Symbols based on their semantic meaning.

:[Output]:
True
In a more general notion, depending on the context hierarchy of the expression class and used operations the semantics of the Symbol operations may vary. To better illustrate this, we show our conceptual prompt design in the following figure:



The figure shows our hierarchical prompt design as a container of all the information that is provided to the neural computation engine to define a task-specific operation. The Yellow and Green highlighted boxes indicate mandatory string placements. The dashed boxes are optional placeholders. and the Red box indicates the starting point of the model prediction.

Conceptually we consider three main prompt designs: Context-based Prompts, Operational Prompts, and Templates. The prompts can be curated either by inheritance or by composition. For example, the Static Context can be defined by inheriting from the Expression class and overriding the static_context property. An Operation and Template prompt can be created by providing an PreProcessor to modify the input data.

We will now explain each prompt concept in more details:

The Context-based Prompts (Static, Dynamic and Payload) are considered optional and can be defined in a static manner, either by sub-classing the Expression class and overriding the static_context property, or at runtime by updating the dynamic_context property or passing an payload kwargs to a method. Here is an example how to use the payload kwargs via the method signature:

# creating a query to ask if an issue was resolve or not
sym = Symbol("<some-community-conversation>")
q = sym.query("Was the issue resolved?")
# write manual condition to check if the issue was resolved
if 'not resolved' in q:
    # do a new query but payload the previous query answer to the new query
    sym.query("What was the resolution?", payload=q)
    ...
else:
    pass # all good
Regardless of how we set the context, our contextualized prompt defines the desired behavior of the Expression operations. For example, if we want to operate in the context of a domain-specific language, without having to override each base class method. See more details in this notebook.

The Operation prompts define the behavior of an atomic operation and is therefore mandatory to express the nature of such an operation. For example, the +-operation is used to add two Symbols together and therefore the +-operation prompt explains its behavior. Examples defines another optional structure that provides the neural computation engine with a set of demonstrations that are used to properly condition the engine. For example, the +-operation prompt can be conditioned on how to add numbers by providing a set of demonstrations, such as 1 + 1 = 2, 2 + 2 = 4, etc.

The Template prompts are optional and encapsulates the resulting prediction to enforce a specific format. For example, to generate HTML tags we can use a curated <html>{{placeholder}}</html> template. This template will enforce the neural computation engine to start the generation process already in the context of a HTML tags format, and not produce irrelevant descriptions about its task.

The Prompt class is a container that holds all the information needed to define a specific operation. It serves as the base class for other Prompt classes and plays a central role in defining the behavior of the neural computation engine.
Here's an example of how to define a Prompt class to enforce the neural computation engine to compare two values:
python
Copy code
class
CompareValues
(ai.Prompt):
def
__init__
(
self
) -> ai.Prompt:
super
().__init__([
"4 > 88 => False"
,
"-inf < 0 => True"
,
"inf > 0 => True"
,
"4 > 3 => True"
,
"1 < 'four' => True"
,
            ...
        ])
In this example, the
CompareValues
class inherits from
ai.Prompt
and defines a set of comparison examples. Each example is in the form of
value1 operator value2 => result
, where
value1
and
value2
can be any valid expression or value,
operator
represents a comparison operator like
>
,
<
,
>=
,
<=
, and
result
represents the expected result of the comparison.
When performing a comparison operation using the neural computation engine, the engine will evaluate the symbols in the context of the
CompareValues
prompt. For example:
python
Copy code
res = ai.Symbol(
1
) <= ai.Symbol(
'one'
)
In this case, the statement evaluates to
True
because the fuzzy compare operation, conditioned by the
CompareValues
prompt, compares the two symbols based on their semantic meaning.
Regarding the prompt design, there are three main prompt concepts: Context-based Prompts (Static, Dynamic, and Payload), Operational Prompts, and Templates.
Context-based Prompts define the context in which the expressions or operations are evaluated. This can be done statically by subclassing the
Expression
class and overriding the
static_context
property, or dynamically by updating the
dynamic_context
property or passing a payload using kwargs to a method.
Operational Prompts define the behavior of atomic operations and are mandatory to express the nature of the operation. They can be conditioned on examples provided through the
examples
parameter of the Prompt class.
Template Prompts are optional and encapsulate the resulting prediction to enforce a specific format. For example, a template prompt can be used to generate HTML tags by using a curated template like
<html>{{placeholder}}</html>
. This template guides the neural computation engine to generate content within the context of HTML tags, ensuring the produced output is relevant to the task.
By utilizing these prompt concepts, you can define the desired behavior and context for your symbolic operations, enabling the neural computation engine to perform tasks accordingly.

sql = SQL()
SQL Example
The SQL expression is defined and passes as a global context the syntax of the SQL language. The SQL expression is then used to generate queries based on the given context. We can then use the generated queries to get data from a database.

The following query is sent to the neural computation engine and creates a query based on the given context:

q = sql('Select all users above the age of 30 from the Members table.'); display(q)
SELECT * FROM Members WHERE age > 30
We can now try to further manipulate the result by asking the model to incorporate additional information, such as filtering to a specific time range:

res = q << 'limit the query to the last 10 minutes'
display(res)
SELECT * FROM Members WHERE age > 30 AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL 10 MINUTE;
We can also try to remove unwanted fields from the generated query. Notice how the model tries to remove not only the given statement but attributes associated with them:

res -= ' AND ...'
display(res)
SELECT * FROM Members WHERE age > 30;
And we can now even convert our query to other familiar domain specific languages, such as SQL or ActiveRecord:

sql_res = res.convert("ActiveRecord")
display(sql_res)
Member.where("age > ?", 30).select("*")
To wrap things up, we might want to go back full circle and ask the model to generate again the explanation based on the given query:

answer_doc = res.query("What does this query do?")
display(answer_doc)
This query selects all data from the Members table where the age is greater than 30.
Ask it in natural language to modify the query:

answer = res.query("How can you limit the number of results to 30 for an SQL query?")
display(answer)
Answer: You can limit the number of results to 30 for an SQL query by adding the LIMIT clause at the end of the query, like this: SELECT * FROM Members WHERE age > 30 LIMIT 30;
Even translate the explanation to a different language on the fly:

locale = Symbol(answer_doc).translate('German')
display(locale)
Diese Abfrage w����hlt alle Daten aus der Mitgliedertabelle aus, in der das Alter gr��������er als 30 ist.
Fixing the query on the fly if something goes wrong or the user quickly wants to adapt a query:

sql.update(feedback="""Explanation: Never allow SELECT *, always use LIMIT to a max of x <= 50 entries, where x is the user specified limit.""");
res = sql('Select all users above the age of 30 from the Members table.')
display(res)
SELECT * FROM Members WHERE age > 30 LIMIT 50
sql.clear();
res = sql('Select all users above the age of 30 from the Members table.')
display(res)
SELECT * FROM Members WHERE age > 30

Abstract
Conceptually, SymbolicAI is a framework that uses machine learning - and specifically LLMs - at its core, and composes operations based on task-specific prompting. We adopt a divide and conquer approach to decompose a complex problem into smaller problems. Therefore, each operation solves a simple task. By re-combining these operations we can solve the complex problem. Furthermore, our design principles allow us to transition between differentiable and classical programming, and to leverage the power of both worlds.

One can run our framework in two ways:

using local engines (experimental) that are run on your local machine (see Local Neuro-Symbolic Engine section), or
using engines powered by external APIs, i.e. using OpenAI's API (see API Keys).
API Keys
Before the first run, define exports for the required API keys to enable the respective engines. This will register the keys in the internally for subsequent runs. By default SymbolicAI currently uses OpenAI's neural engines, i.e. GPT-3 Davinci-003, DALL����E 2 and Embedding Ada-002, for the neuro-symbolic computations, image generation and embeddings computation respectively. However, these modules can easily be replaced with open-source alternatives. Examples are

OPT or Bloom for neuro-symbolic computations,
Craiyon for image generation,
and any BERT variants for semantic embedding computations.
To set the OpenAI API Keys use the following command:

# Linux / MacOS
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"

# Windows (PowerShell)
$Env:OPENAI_API_KEY="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"

# Jupyter Notebooks (important: do not use quotes)
%env OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPENAI_API_KEY>
To get started import our library by using:

import symai as ai
Overall, the following engines are currently supported:

Neuro-Symbolic Engine: OpenAI's LLMs (GPT-3)
Embedding Engine: OpenAI's Embedding API
[Optional] Symbolic Engine: WolframAlpha
[Optional] Search Engine: SerpApi
[Optional] OCR Engine: APILayer
[Optional] SpeechToText Engine: OpenAI's Whisper
[Optional] WebCrawler Engine: Selenium
[Optional] Image Rendering Engine: DALL����E 2
[Optional] Indexing Engine: Pinecone
[Optional] CLIP Engine: hugs Hugging Face (experimental image and text embeddings)
[Optional] Installs
SymbolicAI uses multiple engines to process text, speech and images. We also include search engine access to retrieve information from the web. To use all of them, you will need to install also the following dependencies or assign the API keys to the respective engines.

If you want to use the WolframAlpha Engine, Search Engine or OCR Engine you will need to export the following API keys:

# Linux / MacOS
export SYMBOLIC_ENGINE_API_KEY="<WOLFRAMALPHA_API_KEY>"
export SEARCH_ENGINE_API_KEY="<SERP_API_KEY>"
export OCR_ENGINE_API_KEY="<APILAYER_API_KEY>"
export INDEXING_ENGINE_API_KEY="<PINECONE_API_KEY>"

# Windows (PowerShell)
$Env:SYMBOLIC_ENGINE_API_KEY="<WOLFRAMALPHA_API_KEY>"
$Env:SEARCH_ENGINE_API_KEY="<SERP_API_KEY>"
$Env:OCR_ENGINE_API_KEY="<APILAYER_API_KEY>"
$Env:INDEXING_ENGINE_API_KEY="<PINECONE_API_KEY>"
To use them, you will also need to install the following dependencies:

SpeechToText Engine: ffmpeg for audio processing (based on OpenAI's whisper)
# Linux
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# MacOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Windows
choco install ffmpeg
[Note] Additionally, you need to install the newest version directly from their repository, since the version available via pip is outdated:

pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
WebCrawler Engine: For selenium, download the corresponding driver version by setting the SELENIUM_CHROME_DRIVER_VERSION environment variable. Currently we use Chrome as the default browser. This means that the Chrome version major number must match the ChromeDriver version. All versions are available here. For example, if you use chrome version 109.0.5414.74, you can set any 109.x.x.x version for the chromedriver. In this case the 109.0.5414.74 is available on the selenium page, therefore the environment variable is set to it:
# Linux / MacOS
export SELENIUM_CHROME_DRIVER_VERSION="109.0.5414.74"

# Windows (PowerShell)
$Env:SELENIUM_CHROME_DRIVER_VERSION="109.0.5414.74"
Alternatively, you can specify in your project path a symai.config.json file with all the engine properties. This will replace the environment variables. See the following configuration file as an example:

{
    "NEUROSYMBOLIC_ENGINE_API_KEY": "<OPENAI_API_KEY>",
    "NEUROSYMBOLIC_ENGINE_MODEL": "text-davinci-003",
    "SYMBOLIC_ENGINE_API_KEY": "<WOLFRAMALPHA_API_KEY>",

    "SPEECH_ENGINE_MODEL": "base",
    "SELENIUM_CHROME_DRIVER_VERSION": "110.0.5481.30",
    "INDEXING_ENGINE_API_KEY": "<PINECONE_API_KEY>",
    "INDEXING_ENGINE_ENVIRONMENT": "us-west1-gcp"
}
t-rex Apps
Over the course of th next weeks, we will expand our experimental demo apps and provide a set of useful tools that showcase how to interact with our framework. These apps are made available by calling the sym+<shortcut-name-of-app> command in your terminal or PowerShell.

Shell Command Tool
You can start a basic shell command support tool that translates natural language commands into shell commands. To start the shell command tool, simply run:

symsh "<your-query>"
You can also use the --help flag to get more information about the tool and available arguments.

symsh --help
Here is an example of how to use the tool:

$> symsh "PowerShell edit registiry entry"

# :Output:
# Set-ItemProperty -Path <path> -Name <name> -Value <value>

$> symsh "Set-ItemProperty -Path <path> -Name <name> -Value <value>" --add "path='/Users/myuser' name=Demo value=SymbolicAI"

# :Output:
# Set-ItemProperty -Path '/Users/myuser' -Name Demo -Value SymbolicAI

$> symsh "Set-ItemProperty -Path '/Users/myuser' -Name Demo -Value SymbolicAI" --del "string quotes"

# :Output:
# Set-ItemProperty -Path /Users/myuser -Name Demo -Value SymbolicAI

$> symsh "Set-ItemProperty -Path '/Users/myuser' -Name Demo -Value SymbolicAI" --convert "linux"

# :Output:
# export Demo="SymbolicAI"
Chatbot
You can start a basic conversation with Symbia. Symbia is a chatbot that uses SymbolicAI to detect the content of your request and switch between different contextual modes to answer your questions. These mode include search engines, speech engines and more. To start the chatbot, simply run:

symchat
This will start now a chatbot interface:

Symbia: Hi there! I'm Symbia, your virtual assistant. How may I help you?
$> 
You can exit the conversation by either typing exit, quit or pressing Ctrl+C.

man_shrugging Why SymbolicAI?
SymbolicAI tries to close the gap between classical programming or Software 1.0 and modern data-driven programming (aka Software 2.0). It is a framework that allows to build software applications, which are able to utilize the power of large language models (LLMs) wtih composability and inheritance - two powerful concepts from the object-oriented classical programming paradigm.

This allows to move along the spectrum between the classical programming realm and data-driven programming realm as illustrated in the following figure:



As briefly mentioned, we adopt a divide and conquer approach to decompose a complex problem into smaller problems. We then use the expressiveness and flexibility of LLMs to evaluate these sub-problems and by re-combining these operations we can solve the complex problem.

In this turn, and with enough data, we can gradually transition between general purpose LLMs with zero and few-shot learning capabilities, and specialized fine-tuned models to solve specific problems (see above). This means that each operations could be designed to use a model with fine-tuned task-specific behavior.

 Tell me some more fun facts!
In its essence, SymbolicAI was inspired by the neuro-symbolic programming paradigm.

Neuro-symbolic programming is a paradigm for artificial intelligence and cognitive computing that combines the strengths of both deep neural networks and symbolic reasoning.

Deep neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithms that are inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. They are particularly good at tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing etc. However, they are not as good at tasks that require explicit reasoning, such as long-term planning, problem solving, and understanding causal relationships.

Symbolic reasoning, on the other hand uses formal languages and logical rules to represent knowledge and perform tasks such as planning, problem solving, and understanding causal relationships. Symbolic reasoning systems are good at tasks that require explicit reasoning, but are not as good at tasks that require pattern recognition or generalization, such as image recognition or natural language processing.

Neuro-symbolic programming aims to combine the strengths of both neural networks and symbolic reasoning to create AI systems that can perform a wide range of tasks. One way this is done is by using neural networks to extract information from data and then using symbolic reasoning to make inferences and decisions based on that information. Another way is to use symbolic reasoning to guide the generative process of neural networks and make them more interpretable.

Embedded accelerators for LLMs will, in our opinion, be ubiquitous in future computation platforms, such as wearables, smartphones, tablets or notebooks. They will contain models similar to GPT-3, ChatGPT, OPT or Bloom.



These LLMs will be able to perform a wide range of computations, such as natural language understanding or decision making. Furthermore, neuro-symbolic computation engines will be able to learn concepts how to tackle unseen tasks and solve complex problems by querying various data sources for solutions and executing logical statements on top. In this turn, to ensure the generated content is in alignment with our goals, we need to develop ways to instruct, steer and control the generative processes of machine learning models. Therefore, our approach is an attempt to enable active and transparent flow control of these generative processes.



As shown in the figure above, one can think of this generative process as shifting a probability mass of an input stream of data towards an output stream of data, in a contextualized manner. With properly designed conditions and expressions, one can also validate and steer the behavior towards a desired outcome, or repeat expressions that failed to fulfil our requirements. Our approach is to define a set of fuzzy operations that manipulate the data stream and conditions the LLMs to align with our goals. In essence, we consider all data objects, such as strings, letters, integers, arrays, etc. as symbols and we see natural language as the main interface to interact with. See the following figure:



We show that as long as we can express our goals in natural language, we can use the power of LLMs for neuro-symbolic computations. In this turn, we create operations that manipulate these symbols to generate new symbols from them. Each symbol can be interpreted as a statement. Multiple statements can be combined to form a logical expression.

Therefore, by chaining statements together we can build causal relationships and computations, instead of relying only on inductive approaches. Consequently, the outlook towards an updated computational stack resembles a neuro-symbolic computation engine at its core and, in combination with established frameworks, enables new applications.

face_in_clouds How does it work?
We now show how we define our Symbolic API, which is based on object-oriented and compositional design patterns. The Symbol class is the base class for all functional operations, which we refer to as a terminal symbol in the context of symbolic programming (fully resolved expressions). The Symbol class holds helpful operations that can be interpreted as expressions to manipulate its content and evaluate to new Symbols.

books Symbolic operations
Let us now define a Symbol and perform some basic manipulations. We start with a translation operation:

sym = ai.Symbol("Welcome to our tutorial.")
sym.translate('German')
:[Output]: 
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=Willkommen zu unserem Tutorial.)
Ranking objects
Our API can also perform basic data-agnostic operations to filter, rank or extract patterns. For example, we can rank a list of numbers:

sym = ai.Symbol(numpy.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]))
res = sym.rank(measure='numerical', order='descending')
:[Output]: 
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=['7', '6', '5', '4', '3', '2', '1'])
Evaluating Expressions by best effort
As an inspiration, we relate to an approach demonstrated by word2vec.

Word2Vec generates dense vector representations of words by training a shallow neural network to predict a word given its neighbors in a text corpus. The resulting vectors are then used in a wide range of natural language processing applications, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and clustering.

Below we can see an example how one can perform operations on the word embeddings (colored boxes). The words are tokenized and mapped to a vector space, where we can perform semantic operations via vector arithmetics.



Similar to word2vec we intend to perform contextualized operations on different symbols, however, instead of operating in the vector space, we operate in the natural language domain. This gives us the ability to perform arithmetics on words, sentences, paragraphs, etc. and verify the results in a human readable format.

The following examples show how to evaluate such an expression via a string representation:

ai.Symbol('King - Man + Women').expression()
:[Output]:
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=Queen)
Dynamic casting
We can also subtract sentences from each other, where our operations condition the neural computation engine to evaluate the Symbols by best effort. In the following example, it determines that the word enemy is present in the sentence, therefore deletes it and replaces it with the word friend (which is added):

res = ai.Symbol('Hello my enemy') - 'enemy' + 'friend'
:[Output]: 
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=Hello my friend)
What we also see is that the API performs dynamic casting, when data types are combined with a Symbol object. If an overloaded operation of the Symbol class is used, the Symbol class can automatically cast the second object to a Symbol. This is a convenient modality to perform operations between Symbolobjects and other types of data, such as strings, integers, floats, lists, etc. without bloating the syntax.

In the given code snippet, the SymbolicAI library is imported and various operations and functionalities of the Symbol class are demonstrated. Here's a breakdown of the code:
Translation operation:
python
Copy code
sym = ai.Symbol(
"Welcome to our tutorial."
)
sym.translate(
'German'
)
This code creates a Symbol object with the value "Welcome to our tutorial." and then performs a translation operation to translate it to German. The translated result is displayed.
Ranking objects:
python
Copy code
sym = ai.Symbol(numpy.array([
1
,

3
,
4
,
5
,
6
,
7
]))
res = sym.rank(measure=
'numerical'
, order=
'descending'
)
This code creates a Symbol object with an array of numbers and then ranks them in descending order based on the numerical measure. The ranked result is displayed.
Evaluating Expressions by best effort:
python
Copy code
ai.Symbol(
'King - Man + Women'
).expression()
This code evaluates the expression 'King - Man + Women' by performing arithmetic operations on the words. The resulting Symbol object with the evaluated value is displayed.
Dynamic casting:
python
Copy code
res = ai.Symbol(
'Hello my enemy'
) -
'enemy'
+
'friend'
This code performs dynamic casting and manipulation of sentences. It subtracts the word 'enemy' from the sentence 'Hello my enemy' and adds the word 'friend'. The resulting Symbol object with the modified sentence is displayed.
The Symbol class in SymbolicAI allows for various symbolic operations and manipulations of data, providing a flexible and expressive way to work with natural language.

Fuzzy Comparisons
In this example we are fuzzily comparing two number objects, where the Symbol variant is only an approximation of numpy.pi. Given the context of the fuzzy equals == operation, this comparison still succeeds and returns True.

sym = ai.Symbol('3.1415...')
sym == numpy.pi
:[Output]:
True
brain Causal Reasoning
Our framework was built with the intention to enable reasoning capabilities on top of statistical inference of LLMs. Therefore, we can also perform deductive reasoning operations with our Symbol objects. For example, we can define a set of operations with rules that define the causal relationship between two symbols. The following example shows how the & is used to compute the logical implication of two symbols.

res = ai.Symbol('The horn only sounds on Sundays.') & ai.Symbol('I hear the horn.')
:[Output]:
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=It is Sunday.)
The current &-operation overloads the and logical operator and sends few-shot prompts how to evaluate the statement to the neural computation engine. However, we can define more sophisticated logical operators for and, or and xor via formal proof statements and use the neural engines to parse data structures prior to our expression evaluation. Therefore, one can also define custom operations to perform more complex and robust logical operations, including constraints to validate the outcomes and ensure a desired behavior.

To provide a more complete picture, we also sketch more comprehensive causal examples below, where one tries to obtain logical answers, based on questions of the kind:

# 1) "A line parallel to y = 4x + 6 passes through (5, 10). What is the y-coordinate of the point where this line crosses the y-axis?"
# 2) "Bob has two sons, John and Jay. Jay has one brother and father. The father has two sons. Jay's brother has a brother and a father. Who is Jay's brother."
# 3) "is 1000 bigger than 1063.472?"
To give an rough idea of how we would approach this with our framework is by, first, using a chain of operations to detect the neural engine that is best suited to handle this task, and second, prepare the input for the respective engine. Let's see an example:

val = "<one of the examples above>"

# First define a class that inherits from the Expression class
class ComplexExpression(ai.Expression): # more to the Expression class in later sections
    # write a method that returns the causal evaluation
    def causal_expression(self):
        pass # see below for implementation

# instantiate an object of the class
expr = ComplexExpression(val)
# set WolframAlpha as the main expression engine to use
expr.command(engines=['symbolic'], expression_engine='wolframalpha')
# evaluate the expression
res = expr.causal_expression()
Now, the implementation of causal_expression could in principle look like this:

def causal_expression(self):
    # very which case to use `self.value` contains the input
    if self.isinstanceof('mathematics'):
        # get the mathematical formula
        formula = self.extract('mathematical formula')
        # verify which problem type we have
        if formula.isinstanceof('linear function'):
            # prepare for wolframalpha
            question = self.extract('question sentence')
            req = question.extract('what is requested?')
            x = self.extract('coordinate point (.,.)') # get coordinate point / could also ask for other points
            query = formula @ f', point x = {x}' @ f', solve {req}' # concatenate to the question and formula
            res = query.expression(query) # send prepared query to wolframalpha

        elif formula.isinstanceof('number comparison'):
            res = formula.expression() # send directly to wolframalpha

        ... # more cases

    elif self.isinstanceof('linguistic problem'):
        sentences = self / '.' # first split into sentences
        graph = {} # define graph
        for s in sentences:
            sym = ai.Symbol(s)
            relations = sym.extract('connected entities (e.g. A has three B => A | A: three B)') / '|' # and split by pipe
            for r in relations:
                ... # add relations and populate graph => alternatively, read also about CycleGT

    ... # more cases
    return res
The above example shows how we can use the causal_expression expression method to step-wise iterate and extract information which we can then either manually or using external solvers resolve.

Attention: We hint the reader that this is a very rough sketch and that the implementation of the causal_expression method would need much more engineering effort. Furthermore, the currently used GPT-3 LLM backend often fails to extract the correct information or resolve the right comparison. However, we strongly believe in the advances of the field and that this will change in the future, specifically with fine-tuned models like ChatGPT with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).

Lastly, it is also noteworthy that given enough data, we could fine-tune methods that extract information or build our knowledge graph from natural language. This would enable us to perform more complex reasoning tasks, such as the ones mentioned above. Therefore, we also point the reader to recent publications for translating Text-to-Graphs. This means that in the attempt to answer the query, we can simply traverse the graph and extract the information we need.

In the next section, we will explore operations.

mask Operations
Operations are at the core of our framework. They are the building blocks of our API and are used to define the behavior of our symbols. We can think of operations as contextualized functions that take in a Symbol object, send it to the neuro-symbolic engine for evaluation, and return one or multiple new objects (mainly new symbols; but not necessarily limited to that). Another fundamental property is polymorphism, which means that operations can be applied to different types of data, such as strings, integers, floats, lists, etc. with different behaviors, depending on the object instance.

The way we execute operations is by using the Symbol object value attribute containing the original data type that is then sent as a string representations to the engines to perform the operations. Therefore all values are casted to a string representation. This also means, that for custom objects one needs to define a proper __str__ method to cast the object to a string representation and ensure preservation of the semantics of that object.

Lastly, we need to talk about inheritance. Our API is built on top of the Symbol class, which is the base class of all operations. This means that all operations are inherited from the Symbol class. This provides a convenient modality to add new custom operations by sub-classing Symbol, yet, ensuring to always have a set of base operations at our disposal without bloating the syntax or re-implementing many existing functionalities. This also means that we can define contextualized operations with individual constraints, prompt designs and therefore behaviors by simply sub-classing the Symbol class and overriding the corresponding method. However, we recommend sub-classing the Expression class as we will see later, it adds additional functionalities.

Here is an example of how to define a custom == operation by overriding the __eq__ method and providing a custom prompt object with a list of examples:

class Demo(ai.Symbol):
    def __eq__(self, other) -> bool:
        @ai.equals(examples=ai.Prompt([
              "1 == 'ONE' =>True",
              "'six' == 7 =>False",
              "'Acht' == 'eight' =>True",
              ...
          ])
        )
        def _func(_, other) -> bool:
            return False # default behavior on failure
        return _func(self, other)
As shown in the above example, this is also the way we implemented the basic operations in Symbol, by defining local functions that are then decorated with the respective operation decorator from the symai/core.py file. The symai/core.py is a collection of pre-defined operation decorators that we can quickly apply to any function. The reason why we use locally defined functions instead of directly decorating the main methods, is that we do not necessarily want that all our operations are sent to the neural engine and could implement a default behavior. Another reason is that we want to cast return types of the operation outcome to symbols or other derived classes thereof. This is done by using the self._sym_return_type(...) method and can give contextualized behavior based on the defined return type. See more details in the actual Symbol class.

In the next section, we will show that almost all operations in symai/core.py are derived from the more generic few_shot decorator.

test_tube Custom Operations
One can also define customized operations. For example, let us define a custom operation to generate a random integer between 0 and 10:

class Demo(ai.Symbol):
    def __init__(self, value = '') -> None:
        super().__init__(value)
    
    @ai.zero_shot(prompt="Generate a random integer between 0 and 10.",
                  constraints=[
                      lambda x: x >= 0,
                      lambda x: x <= 10
                  ])
    def get_random_int(self) -> int:
        pass
As we show, the Symbolic API uses Python Decorators to define operations. The @ai.zero_shot decorator is used to define a custom operation that does not require any demonstration examples, since the prompt is expressive enough. In the shown example, the zero_shot decorator takes in two arguments: prompt and constraints. The former is used to define the prompt that conditions our desired operation behavior. The latter is used to define validation constraints of the computed outcome, to ensure it fulfills our expectations.

If the constraint is not fulfilled, the above implementation would reach out to the specified default implementation or default value. If no default implementation or value was found, the Symbolic API would raise an ConstraintViolationException.

We also see that in the above example the return type is defined as int. Therefore, the resulting value from the wrapped function will be of type int. This works because our implementation uses auto-casting to a user specified return data type. If the cast fails, the Symbolic API will raise a ValueError. If no return type is specified, the return type will be Any.

Few-shot operations
The @ai.few_shot decorator is the a generalized version of @ai.zero_shot and is used to define a custom operation that requires demonstration examples. To give a more complete picture, we present the function signature of the few_shot decorator:

def few_shot(prompt: str,
             examples: Prompt, 
             constraints: List[Callable] = [],
             default: Optional[object] = None, 
             limit: int = 1,
             pre_processor: Optional[List[PreProcessor]] = None,
             post_processor: Optional[List[PostProcessor]] = None,
             **wrp_kwargs):
The prompt and constraints attributes behavior is similar to the zero_shot decorator. The examples and limit arguments are new. The examples argument is used to define a list of demonstrations that are used to condition the neural computation engine. The limit argument is used to define the maximum number of examples that are returned, give that there are more results. The pre_processor argument takes a list of PreProcessor objects which can be used to pre-process the input before it is fed into the neural computation engine. The post_processor argument takes a list of PostProcessor objects which can be used to post-process the output before it is returned to the user. The wrp_kwargs argument is used to pass additional arguments to the wrapped method, which are also stream-lined towards the neural computation engine and other engines.

To give a more holistic picture ouf our conceptional implementation, see the following flow diagram containing the most important classes:



The colors indicate logical groups of data processing steps. Yellow indicates the input and output data. Blue indicates places you can customize or prepare the input of your engine. Green indicates post-processing steps of the engine response. Red indicates the application of constraints (which also includes the attempted casting of the return type signature, if specified in the decorated method). Grey indicates the custom method which defines all properties, therefore has access to all the above mentioned objects.

To conclude this section, here is an example how to write a custom Japanese name generator with our @ai.zero_shot decorator:

import symai as ai
class Demo(ai.Symbol):
    @ai.few_shot(prompt="Generate Japanese names: ",
                 examples=ai.Prompt(
                   ["������������", "������������", "������������", "������������"]
                 ),
                 limit=2,
                 constraints=[lambda x: len(x) > 1])
    def generate_japanese_names(self) -> list:
        return ['������������', '������������'] # dummy implementation
Should the neural computation engine not be able to compute the desired outcome, it will reach out to the default implementation or default value. If no default implementation or value was found, the method call will raise an exception.

Prompt Design
The way all the above operations are performed is by using a Prompt class. The Prompt class is a container for all the information that is needed to define a specific operation. The Prompt class is also the base class for all other Prompt classes.

Here is an example how to define a Prompt to enforce the neural computation engine for comparing two values:

class CompareValues(ai.Prompt):
    def __init__(self) -> ai.Prompt:
        super().__init__([
            "4 > 88 =>False",
            "-inf < 0 =>True",
            "inf > 0 =>True",
            "4 > 3 =>True",
            "1 < 'four' =>True",
            ...
        ])
For example, when calling the <= operation on two Symbols, the neural computation engine will evaluate the symbols in the context of the CompareValues prompt.

res = ai.Symbol(1) <= ai.Symbol('one')
This statement evaluates to True, since the fuzzy compare operation was conditions our engine to compare the two Symbols based on their semantic meaning.

:[Output]:
True
In a more general notion, depending on the context hierarchy of the expression class and used operations the semantics of the Symbol operations may vary. To better illustrate this, we show our conceptual prompt design in the following figure:



The figure shows our hierarchical prompt design as a container of all the information that is provided to the neural computation engine to define a task-specific operation. The Yellow and Green highlighted boxes indicate mandatory string placements. The dashed boxes are optional placeholders. and the Red box indicates the starting point of the model prediction.

Conceptually we consider three main prompt designs: Context-based Prompts, Operational Prompts, and Templates. The prompts can be curated either by inheritance or by composition. For example, the Static Context can be defined by inheriting from the Expression class and overriding the static_context property. An Operation and Template prompt can be created by providing an PreProcessor to modify the input data.

We will now explain each prompt concept in more details:

The Context-based Prompts (Static, Dynamic and Payload) are considered optional and can be defined in a static manner, either by sub-classing the Expression class and overriding the static_context property, or at runtime by updating the dynamic_context property or passing an payload kwargs to a method. Here is an example how to use the payload kwargs via the method signature:

# creating a query to ask if an issue was resolve or not
sym = Symbol("<some-community-conversation>")
q = sym.query("Was the issue resolved?")
# write manual condition to check if the issue was resolved
if 'not resolved' in q:
    # do a new query but payload the previous query answer to the new query
    sym.query("What was the resolution?", payload=q)
    ...
else:
    pass # all good
Regardless of how we set the context, our contextualized prompt defines the desired behavior of the Expression operations. For example, if we want to operate in the context of a domain-specific language, without having to override each base class method. See more details in this notebook.

The Operation prompts define the behavior of an atomic operation and is therefore mandatory to express the nature of such an operation. For example, the +-operation is used to add two Symbols together and therefore the +-operation prompt explains its behavior. Examples defines another optional structure that provides the neural computation engine with a set of demonstrations that are used to properly condition the engine. For example, the +-operation prompt can be conditioned on how to add numbers by providing a set of demonstrations, such as 1 + 1 = 2, 2 + 2 = 4, etc.

The Template prompts are optional and encapsulates the resulting prediction to enforce a specific format. For example, to generate HTML tags we can use a curated <html>{{placeholder}}</html> template. This template will enforce the neural computation engine to start the generation process already in the context of a HTML tags format, and not produce irrelevant descriptions about its task.

expressionless Expressions
An Expression is a non-terminal symbol, which can be further evaluated. It inherits all the properties from Symbol and overrides the __call__ method to evaluate its expressions or values. From the Expression class, all other expressions are derived. The Expression class also adds additional capabilities i.e. to fetch data from URLs, search on the internet or open files. These operations are specifically separated from Symbol since they do not use the value attribute of the Symbol class.

SymbolicAI' API closely follows best practices and ideas from PyTorch, therefore, one can build complex expressions by combining multiple expressions as a computational graph. Each Expression has its own forward method, which has to be overridden. The forward method is used to define the behavior of the expression. The forward method is called by the __call__ method, which is inherited from the Expression base class. The __call__ evaluates an expression and returns the result from the implemented forward method. This design pattern is used to evaluate the expressions in a lazy manner, which means that the expression is only evaluated when the result is needed. This is a very important feature, since it allows us to chain complex expressions together. We already implemented many useful expressions, which can be imported from the symai.components file.

Other important properties that are inherited from the Symbol class are _sym_return_type and static_context. These two properties define the context in which the current Expression operates, as described in the Prompt Design section. The static_context therefore influences all operations of the current Expression sub-class. The _sym_return_type ensures that after each evaluation of an Expression, we obtain the desired return object type. This is usually implemented to return the current type, but can be set to return a different type.

Expressions can of course have more complex structures and be further sub-classed, such as shown in the example of the Sequence expression in the following figure:



A Sequence expression can hold multiple expressions, which are evaluated at runtime.

Sequence expressions
Here is an example how to define a Sequence expression:

# first import all expressions
from symai import *
# define a sequence of expressions
Sequence(
    Clean(),
    Translate(),
    Outline(),
    Compose('Compose news:'),
)
Stream expressions
As we saw earlier, we can create contextualized prompts to define the behavior of operations on our neural engine. However, this also takes away a lot of the available context size and since e.g. the GPT-3 Davinci context length is limited to 4097 tokens, this might quickly become a problem. Luckily, we can use the Stream processing expression. This expression opens up a data stream and performs chunk-based operations on the input stream.

A Stream expression can easily be wrapped around other expressions. For example, the chunks can be processed with a Sequence expression, that allows multiple chained operations in sequential manner. Here is an example how to define such a Stream expression:

Stream(Sequence(
    Clean(),
    Translate(),
    Outline(),
    Embed()
))
The shown example opens a stream, passes a Sequence object which cleans, translates, outlines and embeds the input. Internally, the stream operation estimates the available model context size and chunks the long input text into smaller chunks, which are passed to the inner expression. The returned object type is a generator.

The issue with this approach is, that the resulting chunks are processed independently. This means there is no shared context or information among chunks. To solve this issue, we can use the Cluster expression instead, where the independent chunks are merged based on their similarity. We illustrate this in the following figure:



In the shown example all individual chunks are merged by clustering the information within each chunk. This gives us a way to consolidate contextually related information and merge them in a meaningful way. Furthermore, the clustered information can then be labeled by streaming through the content of each cluster and extracting the most relevant labels, providing us with interpretable node summaries.

The full example is shown below:

stream = Stream(Sequence(
    Clean(),
    Translate(),
    Outline(),
))
sym = Symbol('<some long text>')
res = Symbol(list(stream(sym)))
expr = Cluster()
expr(res)
In a next step, we could recursively repeat this process on each summary node, therefore, build a hierarchical clustering structure. Since each Node resembles a summarized sub-set of the original information we can use the summary as an index. The resulting tree can then be used to navigate and retrieve the original information, turning the large data stream problem into a search problem.

Alternatively, we could use vector-base similarity search to find similar nodes. For searching in a vector space we can use dedicated libraries such as Annoy, Faiss or Milvus.

The example you provided demonstrates the use of fuzzy comparisons and causal reasoning in the SymbolicAI framework. It shows how you can perform fuzzy comparisons between Symbol objects and how the framework enables deductive reasoning using logical operators.
In the first example, a fuzzy comparison is made between a Symbol object and the numpy.pi constant. The comparison succeeds and returns True because the Symbol object is an approximation of numpy.pi.
The second part introduces causal reasoning using the & operator. The example shows how you can define a causal relationship between two symbols and compute the logical implication using the & operator. In this case, the result is a Symbol object representing the statement "It is Sunday." The current implementation overloads the and logical operator to perform causal reasoning and sends prompts to the neural computation engine to evaluate the statement.
The next section discusses the concept of operations in the SymbolicAI framework. Operations are the building blocks of the framework and define the behavior of symbols. They can be applied to different types of data and have different behaviors based on the object instance.
Custom operations can be defined by sub-classing the Symbol class and overriding specific methods. The framework provides operation decorators that can be used to define custom operations with or without demonstration examples. These decorators allow you to define prompts and constraints to condition the behavior of the operation.
The framework also provides the ability to define prompts using the Prompt class. Prompts encapsulate the information needed to define a specific operation, including demonstrations and constraints.
Expressions are non-terminal symbols that can be further evaluated. They inherit properties from the Symbol class and can override the

x Error Handling
A key idea of the SymbolicAI API is to be able to generate code. This in turn means that errors may occur, which we need to handle in a contextual manner. As a future vision, we even want our API to self extend and therefore need to be able to resolve issues automatically. To do so, we propose the Try expression, which has a fallback statements built-in and retries an execution with dedicated error analysis and correction. This expression analyses the input and the error, and conditions itself to resolve the error by manipulating the original code. If the fallback expression succeeds, the result is returned. Otherwise, this process is repeated for the number of retries specified. If the maximum number of retries is reached and the problem was not resolved, the error is raised again.

Let us assume, we have some executable code that was previously generated. However, by the nature of generative processes syntax errors may occur. By using the Execute expression, we can evaluate our generated code, which takes in a symbol and tries to execute it. Naturally, this will fail. However, in the following example the Try expression resolves this syntactic error and the receive a computed result.

expr = Try(expr=Execute())
sym = Symbol('a = int("3,")') # some code with a syntax error
res = expr(sym)
The resulting output is the evaluated code, which was corrected:

We are aware that not all errors are as simple as the shown syntactic error example, which can be resolved automatically. Many errors occur due to semantic misconceptions. Such issues require contextual information. Therefore, we are further exploring means towards more sophisticated error handling mechanism. This includes also the usage of streams and clustering to resolve errors in a more hierarchical contextual manner. It is also noteworthy that neural computations engines need to be further improved to better detect and resolve errors.

spider Interpretability, Testing & Debugging
Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of using neuro-symbolic programming is, that we can get a clear understanding of how well our LLMs understand simple operations. Specifically we gain knowledge about if, and at which point they fail, enabling us to follow their StackTraces and determine the failure points. In our case, neuro-symbolic programming allows us to debug the model predictions based on dedicated unit test for simple operations. To detect conceptual misalignments we can also use a chain of neuro-symbolic operations and validate the generative process. This is of course not a perfect solution, since the verification may also be error prone, but it gives us at least a principle way to detect conceptual flaws and biases in our LLMs.

Unit Testing Models
Since our premise is to divide and conquer complex problems, we can curate conceptual unit test and target very specific and tracktable sub-problems. The resulting measure, i.e. success rate of the model prediction, can then be used to evaluate their performance, and hint towards undesired flaws or biases.

This allows us to design domain-specific benchmarks and see how well general learners, such as GPT-3, adapt with certain prompts to a set of tasks.

For example, we can write a fuzzy comparison operation, that can take in digits and strings alike, and perform a semantic comparison. LLMs can then be asked to evaluate these expressions. Often times, these LLMs still fail to understand the semantic equivalence of tokens in digits vs strings and give wrong answers.

The following code snipped shows a unit test to perform semantic comparison of numbers (between digits and strings):

import unittest
from symai import *

class TestComposition(unittest.TestCase):
  def test_compare(self):
      res = Symbol(10) > Symbol(5)
      self.assertTrue(res)
      res = Symbol(1) < Symbol('five')
      self.assertTrue(res)
      ...
fireDebugging
When creating very complex expressions, we debug them by using the Trace expression, which allows to print out the used expressions, and follow the StackTrace of the neuro-symbolic operations. Combined with the Log expression, which creates a dump of all prompts and results to a log file, we can analyze where our models potentially failed.

Example: News Summary
In the following example we create a news summary expression that crawls the given URL and streams the site content through multiple expressions. The outcome is a news website that is created based on the crawled content. The Trace expression allows to follow the StackTrace of the operations and see what operations are currently executed. If we open the outputs/engine.log file we can see the dumped traces with all the prompts and results.

# crawling the website and creating an own website based on its facts
news = News(url='https://www.cnbc.com/cybersecurity/',
            pattern='cnbc',
            filters=ExcludeFilter('sentences about subscriptions, licensing, newsletter'),
            render=True)
expr = Log(Trace(news))
res = expr()
Here is the corresponding StackTrace of the model:



The above code creates a webpage with the crawled content from the original source. See the preview below, the entire rendered webpage image here and resulting [code of webpage here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xpitfire/symbolicai/main/examples/results/news.html.

The next section discusses error handling in the SymbolicAI API and the use of the Try expression to handle errors and resolve issues automatically. The Try expression analyzes the input and error, and attempts to resolve the error by manipulating the original code. If the fallback expression succeeds, the result is returned. Otherwise, the process is repeated for the specified number of retries. If the maximum number of retries is reached and the problem is not resolved, the error is raised again.
An example is provided where the Execute expression is used to evaluate some generated code that contains a syntax error. The Try expression is used to handle the error and correct the code. The resulting output is the evaluated code with the syntax error resolved.
The framework aims to improve error handling mechanisms, including the use of streams and clustering to resolve errors in a more hierarchical and contextual manner. It acknowledges that not all errors can be automatically resolved, especially those related to semantic misconceptions. Further improvements are needed in the neural computation engines to better detect and resolve errors.
The interpretability, testing, and debugging aspects of neuro-symbolic programming are highlighted as benefits of the SymbolicAI API. The use of unit testing is emphasized to evaluate the performance of the models and detect conceptual flaws or biases. Conceptual unit tests can be designed to target specific sub-problems and measure the success rate of the model predictions.
Debugging complex expressions is facilitated using the Trace expression, which allows for tracing the execution and following the StackTrace of the neuro-symbolic operations. The Log expression can be used to create a log file that contains the prompts and results, enabling further analysis of potential failures.
An example is provided where a news summary expression is created, which crawls a website and generates a news webpage based on the crawled content. The Trace expression is used to trace the operations and the Log expression creates a log file with the prompts and results for analysis.

Abstract
Conceptually, SymbolicAI is a framework that uses machine learning - and specifically LLMs - at its core, and composes operations based on task-specific prompting. We adopt a divide and conquer approach to decompose a complex problem into smaller problems. Therefore, each operation solves a simple task. By re-combining these operations we can solve the complex problem. Furthermore, our design principles allow us to transition between differentiable and classical programming, and to leverage the power of both worlds.

pip install symbolicai
One can run our framework in two ways:

using local engines (experimental) that are run on your local machine (see Local Neuro-Symbolic Engine section), or
using engines powered by external APIs, i.e. using OpenAI's API (see API Keys).
API Keys
Before the first run, define exports for the required API keys to enable the respective engines. This will register the keys in the internally for subsequent runs. By default SymbolicAI currently uses OpenAI's neural engines, i.e. GPT-3 Davinci-003, DALL����E 2 and Embedding Ada-002, for the neuro-symbolic computations, image generation and embeddings computation respectively. However, these modules can easily be replaced with open-source alternatives. Examples are

OPT or Bloom for neuro-symbolic computations,
Craiyon for image generation,
and any BERT variants for semantic embedding computations.
To set the OpenAI API Keys use the following command:

# Linux / MacOS
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"

# Windows (PowerShell)
$Env:OPENAI_API_KEY="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"

# Jupyter Notebooks (important: do not use quotes)
%env OPENAI_API_KEY=<OPENAI_API_KEY>
To get started import our library by using:

import symai as ai
Overall, the following engines are currently supported:

Neuro-Symbolic Engine: OpenAI's LLMs (GPT-3)
Embedding Engine: OpenAI's Embedding API
[Optional] Symbolic Engine: WolframAlpha
[Optional] Search Engine: SerpApi
[Optional] OCR Engine: APILayer
[Optional] SpeechToText Engine: OpenAI's Whisper
[Optional] WebCrawler Engine: Selenium
[Optional] Image Rendering Engine: DALL����E 2
[Optional] Indexing Engine: Pinecone
[Optional] CLIP Engine: hugs Hugging Face (experimental image and text embeddings)
[Optional] Installs
SymbolicAI uses multiple engines to process text, speech and images. We also include search engine access to retrieve information from the web. To use all of them, you will need to install also the following dependencies or assign the API keys to the respective engines.

If you want to use the WolframAlpha Engine, Search Engine or OCR Engine you will need to export the following API keys:

# Linux / MacOS
export SYMBOLIC_ENGINE_API_KEY="<WOLFRAMALPHA_API_KEY>"
export SEARCH_ENGINE_API_KEY="<SERP_API_KEY>"
export OCR_ENGINE_API_KEY="<APILAYER_API_KEY>"
export INDEXING_ENGINE_API_KEY="<PINECONE_API_KEY>"

# Windows (PowerShell)
$Env:SYMBOLIC_ENGINE_API_KEY="<WOLFRAMALPHA_API_KEY>"
$Env:SEARCH_ENGINE_API_KEY="<SERP_API_KEY>"
$Env:OCR_ENGINE_API_KEY="<APILAYER_API_KEY>"
$Env:INDEXING_ENGINE_API_KEY="<PINECONE_API_KEY>"
To use them, you will also need to install the following dependencies:

SpeechToText Engine: ffmpeg for audio processing (based on OpenAI's whisper)
# Linux
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg

# MacOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Windows
choco install ffmpeg
[Note] Additionally, you need to install the newest version directly from their repository, since the version available via pip is outdated:

pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
WebCrawler Engine: For selenium, download the corresponding driver version by setting the SELENIUM_CHROME_DRIVER_VERSION environment variable. Currently we use Chrome as the default browser. This means that the Chrome version major number must match the ChromeDriver version. All versions are available here. For example, if you use chrome version 109.0.5414.74, you can set any 109.x.x.x version for the chromedriver. In this case the 109.0.5414.74 is available on the selenium page, therefore the environment variable is set to it:
# Linux / MacOS
export SELENIUM_CHROME_DRIVER_VERSION="109.0.5414.74"

# Windows (PowerShell)
$Env:SELENIUM_CHROME_DRIVER_VERSION="109.0.5414.74"
Alternatively, you can specify in your project path a symai.config.json file with all the engine properties. This will replace the environment variables. See the following configuration file as an example:

{
    "NEUROSYMBOLIC_ENGINE_API_KEY": "<OPENAI_API_KEY>",
    "NEUROSYMBOLIC_ENGINE_MODEL": "text-davinci-003",
    "SYMBOLIC_ENGINE_API_KEY": "<WOLFRAMALPHA_API_KEY>",

t-rex Apps
Over the course of th next weeks, we will expand our experimental demo apps and provide a set of useful tools that showcase how to interact with our framework. These apps are made available by calling the sym+<shortcut-name-of-app> command in your terminal or PowerShell.

Shell Command Tool
You can start a basic shell command support tool that translates natural language commands into shell commands. To start the shell command tool, simply run:

symsh "<your-query>"
You can also use the --help flag to get more information about the tool and available arguments.

symsh --help
Here is an example of how to use the tool:

$> symsh "PowerShell edit registiry entry"

# :Output:
# Set-ItemProperty -Path <path> -Name <name> -Value <value>

$> symsh "Set-ItemProperty -Path <path> -Name <name> -Value <value>" --add "path='/Users/myuser' name=Demo value=SymbolicAI"

# :Output:
# Set-ItemProperty -Path '/Users/myuser' -Name Demo -Value SymbolicAI

$> symsh "Set-ItemProperty -Path '/Users/myuser' -Name Demo -Value SymbolicAI" --del "string quotes"

# :Output:
# Set-ItemProperty -Path /Users/myuser -Name Demo -Value SymbolicAI

$> symsh "Set-ItemProperty -Path '/Users/myuser' -Name Demo -Value SymbolicAI" --convert "linux"

# :Output:
# export Demo="SymbolicAI"
Chatbot
You can start a basic conversation with Symbia. Symbia is a chatbot that uses SymbolicAI to detect the content of your request and switch between different contextual modes to answer your questions. These mode include search engines, speech engines and more. To start the chatbot, simply run:

symchat
This will start now a chatbot interface:

Symbia: Hi there! I'm Symbia, your virtual assistant. How may I help you?
$> 
You can exit the conversation by either typing exit, quit or pressing Ctrl+C.

man_shrugging Why SymbolicAI?
SymbolicAI tries to close the gap between classical programming or Software 1.0 and modern data-driven programming (aka Software 2.0). It is a framework that allows to build software applications, which are able to utilize the power of large language models (LLMs) wtih composability and inheritance - two powerful concepts from the object-oriented classical programming paradigm.

This allows to move along the spectrum between the classical programming realm and data-driven programming realm as illustrated in the following figure:



As briefly mentioned, we adopt a divide and conquer approach to decompose a complex problem into smaller problems. We then use the expressiveness and flexibility of LLMs to evaluate these sub-problems and by re-combining these operations we can solve the complex problem.

In this turn, and with enough data, we can gradually transition between general purpose LLMs with zero and few-shot learning capabilities, and specialized fine-tuned models to solve specific problems (see above). This means that each operations could be designed to use a model with fine-tuned task-specific behavior.

 Tell me some more fun facts!
In its essence, SymbolicAI was inspired by the neuro-symbolic programming paradigm.

Neuro-symbolic programming is a paradigm for artificial intelligence and cognitive computing that combines the strengths of both deep neural networks and symbolic reasoning.

Deep neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithms that are inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks. They are particularly good at tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing etc. However, they are not as good at tasks that require explicit reasoning, such as long-term planning, problem solving, and understanding causal relationships.

Symbolic reasoning, on the other hand uses formal languages and logical rules to represent knowledge and perform tasks such as planning, problem solving, and understanding causal relationships. Symbolic reasoning systems are good at tasks that require explicit reasoning, but are not as good at tasks that require pattern recognition or generalization, such as image recognition or natural language processing.

Neuro-symbolic programming aims to combine the strengths of both neural networks and symbolic reasoning to create AI systems that can perform a wide range of tasks. One way this is done is by using neural networks to extract information from data and then using symbolic reasoning to make inferences and decisions based on that information. Another way is to use symbolic reasoning to guide the generative process of neural networks and make them more interpretable.

Embedded accelerators for LLMs will, in our opinion, be ubiquitous in future computation platforms, such as wearables, smartphones, tablets or notebooks. They will contain models similar to GPT-3, ChatGPT, OPT or Bloom.



These LLMs will be able to perform a wide range of computations, such as natural language understanding or decision making. Furthermore, neuro-symbolic computation engines will be able to learn concepts how to tackle unseen tasks and solve complex problems by querying various data sources for solutions and executing logical statements on top. In this turn, to ensure the generated content is in alignment with our goals, we need to develop ways to instruct, steer and control the generative processes of machine learning models. Therefore, our approach is an attempt to enable active and transparent flow control of these generative processes.



As shown in the figure above, one can think of this generative process as shifting a probability mass of an input stream of data towards an output stream of data, in a contextualized manner. With properly designed conditions and expressions, one can also validate and steer the behavior towards a desired outcome, or repeat expressions that failed to fulfil our requirements. Our approach is to define a set of fuzzy operations that manipulate the data stream and conditions the LLMs to align with our goals. In essence, we consider all data objects, such as strings, letters, integers, arrays, etc. as symbols and we see natural language as the main interface to interact with. See the following figure:



We show that as long as we can express our goals in natural language, we can use the power of LLMs for neuro-symbolic computations. In this turn, we create operations that manipulate these symbols to generate new symbols from them. Each symbol can be interpreted as a statement. Multiple statements can be combined to form a logical expression.

Therefore, by chaining statements together we can build causal relationships and computations, instead of relying only on inductive approaches. Consequently, the outlook towards an updated computational stack resembles a neuro-symbolic computation engine at its core and, in combination with established frameworks, enables new applications.

face_in_clouds How does it work?
We now show how we define our Symbolic API, which is based on object-oriented and compositional design patterns. The Symbol class is the base class for all functional operations, which we refer to as a terminal symbol in the context of symbolic programming (fully resolved expressions). The Symbol class holds helpful operations that can be interpreted as expressions to manipulate its content and evaluate to new Symbols.

books Symbolic operations
Let us now define a Symbol and perform some basic manipulations. We start with a translation operation:

sym = ai.Symbol("Welcome to our tutorial.")
sym.translate('German')
:[Output]: 
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=Willkommen zu unserem Tutorial.)
Ranking objects
Our API can also perform basic data-agnostic operations to filter, rank or extract patterns. For example, we can rank a list of numbers:

sym = ai.Symbol(numpy.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]))
res = sym.rank(measure='numerical', order='descending')
:[Output]: 
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=['7', '6', '5', '4', '3', '2', '1'])

Evaluating Expressions by best effort
As an inspiration, we relate to an approach demonstrated by word2vec.

Word2Vec generates dense vector representations of words by training a shallow neural network to predict a word given its neighbors in a text corpus. The resulting vectors are then used in a wide range of natural language processing applications, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and clustering.

Below we can see an example how one can perform operations on the word embeddings (colored boxes). The words are tokenized and mapped to a vector space, where we can perform semantic operations via vector arithmetics.



Similar to word2vec we intend to perform contextualized operations on different symbols, however, instead of operating in the vector space, we operate in the natural language domain. This gives us the ability to perform arithmetics on words, sentences, paragraphs, etc. and verify the results in a human readable format.

The following examples show how to evaluate such an expression via a string representation:

ai.Symbol('King - Man + Women').expression()
:[Output]:
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=Queen)
Dynamic casting
We can also subtract sentences from each other, where our operations condition the neural computation engine to evaluate the Symbols by best effort. In the following example, it determines that the word enemy is present in the sentence, therefore deletes it and replaces it with the word friend (which is added):

res = ai.Symbol('Hello my enemy') - 'enemy' + 'friend'
:[Output]: 
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=Hello my friend)
What we also see is that the API performs dynamic casting, when data types are combined with a Symbol object. If an overloaded operation of the Symbol class is used, the Symbol class can automatically cast the second object to a Symbol. This is a convenient modality to perform operations between Symbolobjects and other types of data, such as strings, integers, floats, lists, etc. without bloating the syntax.

Fuzzy Comparisons
In this example we are fuzzily comparing two number objects, where the Symbol variant is only an approximation of numpy.pi. Given the context of the fuzzy equals == operation, this comparison still succeeds and returns True.

sym = ai.Symbol('3.1415...')
sym == numpy.pi
:[Output]:
True
brain Causal Reasoning
Our framework was built with the intention to enable reasoning capabilities on top of statistical inference of LLMs. Therefore, we can also perform deductive reasoning operations with our Symbol objects. For example, we can define a set of operations with rules that define the causal relationship between two symbols. The following example shows how the & is used to compute the logical implication of two symbols.

res = ai.Symbol('The horn only sounds on Sundays.') & ai.Symbol('I hear the horn.')
:[Output]:
<class 'symai.expressions.Symbol'>(value=It is Sunday.)
The current &-operation overloads the and logical operator and sends few-shot prompts how to evaluate the statement to the neural computation engine. However, we can define more sophisticated logical operators for and, or and xor via formal proof statements and use the neural engines to parse data structures prior to our expression evaluation. Therefore, one can also define custom operations to perform more complex and robust logical operations, including constraints to validate the outcomes and ensure a desired behavior.

To provide a more complete picture, we also sketch more comprehensive causal examples below, where one tries to obtain logical answers, based on questions of the kind:

# 1) "A line parallel to y = 4x + 6 passes through (5, 10). What is the y-coordinate of the point where this line crosses the y-axis?"
# 2) "Bob has two sons, John and Jay. Jay has one brother and father. The father has two sons. Jay's brother has a brother and a father. Who is Jay's brother."
# 3) "is 1000 bigger than 1063.472?"
To give an rough idea of how we would approach this with our framework is by, first, using a chain of operations to detect the neural engine that is best suited to handle this task, and second, prepare the input for the respective engine. Let's see an example:

val = "<one of the examples above>"

# First define a class that inherits from the Expression class
class ComplexExpression(ai.Expression): # more to the Expression class in later sections
    # write a method that returns the causal evaluation
    def causal_expression(self):
        pass # see below for implementation

# instantiate an object of the class
expr = ComplexExpression(val)
# set WolframAlpha as the main expression engine to use
expr.command(engines=['symbolic'], expression_engine='wolframalpha')
# evaluate the expression
res = expr.causal_expression()
Now, the implementation of causal_expression could in principle look like this:

def causal_expression(self):
    # very which case to use `self.value` contains the input
    if self.isinstanceof('mathematics'):
        # get the mathematical formula
        formula = self.extract('mathematical formula')
        # verify which problem type we have
        if formula.isinstanceof('linear function'):
            # prepare for wolframalpha
            question = self.extract('question sentence')
            req = question.extract('what is requested?')
            x = self.extract('coordinate point (.,.)') # get coordinate point / could also ask for other points
            query = formula @ f', point x = {x}' @ f', solve {req}' # concatenate to the question and formula
            res = query.expression(query) # send prepared query to wolframalpha

        elif formula.isinstanceof('number comparison'):
            res = formula.expression() # send directly to wolframalpha

        ... # more cases

    elif self.isinstanceof('linguistic problem'):
        sentences = self / '.' # first split into sentences
        graph = {} # define graph
        for s in sentences:
            sym = ai.Symbol(s)
            relations = sym.extract('connected entities (e.g. A has three B => A | A: three B)') / '|' # and split by pipe
            for r in relations:
                ... # add relations and populate graph => alternatively, read also about CycleGT

    ... # more cases
    return res
The above example shows how we can use the causal_expression expression method to step-wise iterate and extract information which we can then either manually or using external solvers resolve.

Attention: We hint the reader that this is a very rough sketch and that the implementation of the causal_expression method would need much more engineering effort. Furthermore, the currently used GPT-3 LLM backend often fails to extract the correct information or resolve the right comparison. However, we strongly believe in the advances of the field and that this will change in the future, specifically with fine-tuned models like ChatGPT with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).

Lastly, it is also noteworthy that given enough data, we could fine-tune methods that extract information or build our knowledge graph from natural language. This would enable us to perform more complex reasoning tasks, such as the ones mentioned above. Therefore, we also point the reader to recent publications for translating Text-to-Graphs. This means that in the attempt to answer the query, we can simply traverse the graph and extract the information we need.

In the next section, we will explore operations.

Operations are at the core of our framework. They are the building blocks of our API and are used to define the behavior of our symbols. We can think of operations as contextualized functions that take in a Symbol object, send it to the neuro-symbolic engine for evaluation, and return one or multiple new objects (mainly new symbols; but not necessarily limited to that). Another fundamental property is polymorphism, which means that operations can be applied to different types of data, such as strings, integers, floats, lists, etc. with different behaviors, depending on the object instance.

The way we execute operations is by using the Symbol object value attribute containing the original data type that is then sent as a string representations to the engines to perform the operations. Therefore all values are casted to a string representation. This also means, that for custom objects one needs to define a proper __str__ method to cast the object to a string representation and ensure preservation of the semantics of that object.

Lastly, we need to talk about inheritance. Our API is built on top of the Symbol class, which is the base class of all operations. This means that all operations are inherited from the Symbol class. This provides a convenient modality to add new custom operations by sub-classing Symbol, yet, ensuring to always have a set of base operations at our disposal without bloating the syntax or re-implementing many existing functionalities. This also means that we can define contextualized operations with individual constraints, prompt designs and therefore behaviors by simply sub-classing the Symbol class and overriding the corresponding method. However, we recommend sub-classing the Expression class as we will see later, it adds additional functionalities.

Here is an example of how to define a custom == operation by overriding the __eq__ method and providing a custom prompt object with a list of examples:

class Demo(ai.Symbol):
    def __eq__(self, other) -> bool:
        @ai.equals(examples=ai.Prompt([
              "1 == 'ONE' =>True",
              "'six' == 7 =>False",
              "'Acht' == 'eight' =>True",
              ...
          ])
        )
        def _func(_, other) -> bool:
            return False # default behavior on failure
        return _func(self, other)
As shown in the above example, this is also the way we implemented the basic operations in Symbol, by defining local functions that are then decorated with the respective operation decorator from the symai/core.py file. The symai/core.py is a collection of pre-defined operation decorators that we can quickly apply to any function. The reason why we use locally defined functions instead of directly decorating the main methods, is that we do not necessarily want that all our operations are sent to the neural engine and could implement a default behavior. Another reason is that we want to cast return types of the operation outcome to symbols or other derived classes thereof. This is done by using the self._sym_return_type(...) method and can give contextualized behavior based on the defined return type. See more details in the actual Symbol class.

In the next section, we will show that almost all operations in symai/core.py are derived from the more generic few_shot decorator.

test_tube Custom Operations
One can also define customized operations. For example, let us define a custom operation to generate a random integer between 0 and 10:

class Demo(ai.Symbol):
    def __init__(self, value = '') -> None:
        super().__init__(value)
    
    @ai.zero_shot(prompt="Generate a random integer between 0 and 10.",
                  constraints=[
                      lambda x: x >= 0,
                      lambda x: x <= 10
                  ])
    def get_random_int(self) -> int:
        pass
As we show, the Symbolic API uses Python Decorators to define operations. The @ai.zero_shot decorator is used to define a custom operation that does not require any demonstration examples, since the prompt is expressive enough. In the shown example, the zero_shot decorator takes in two arguments: prompt and constraints. The former is used to define the prompt that conditions our desired operation behavior. The latter is used to define validation constraints of the computed outcome, to ensure it fulfills our expectations.

If the constraint is not fulfilled, the above implementation would reach out to the specified default implementation or default value. If no default implementation or value was found, the Symbolic API would raise an ConstraintViolationException.

We also see that in the above example the return type is defined as int. Therefore, the resulting value from the wrapped function will be of type int. This works because our implementation uses auto-casting to a user specified return data type. If the cast fails, the Symbolic API will raise a ValueError. If no return type is specified, the return type will be Any.

Few-shot operations
The @ai.few_shot decorator is the a generalized version of @ai.zero_shot and is used to define a custom operation that requires demonstration examples. To give a more complete picture, we present the function signature of the few_shot decorator:

def few_shot(prompt: str,
             examples: Prompt, 
             constraints: List[Callable] = [],
             default: Optional[object] = None, 
             limit: int = 1,
             pre_processor: Optional[List[PreProcessor]] = None,
             post_processor: Optional[List[PostProcessor]] = None,
             **wrp_kwargs):
The prompt and constraints attributes behavior is similar to the zero_shot decorator. The examples and limit arguments are new. The examples argument is used to define a list of demonstrations that are used to condition the neural computation engine. The limit argument is used to define the maximum number of examples that are returned, give that there are more results. The pre_processor argument takes a list of PreProcessor objects which can be used to pre-process the input before it is fed into the neural computation engine. The post_processor argument takes a list of PostProcessor objects which can be used to post-process the output before it is returned to the user. The wrp_kwargs argument is used to pass additional arguments to the wrapped method, which are also stream-lined towards the neural computation engine and other engines.

To give a more holistic picture ouf our conceptional implementation, see the following flow diagram containing the most important classes:



The colors indicate logical groups of data processing steps. Yellow indicates the input and output data. Blue indicates places you can customize or prepare the input of your engine. Green indicates post-processing steps of the engine response. Red indicates the application of constraints (which also includes the attempted casting of the return type signature, if specified in the decorated method). Grey indicates the custom method which defines all properties, therefore has access to all the above mentioned objects.

To conclude this section, here is an example how to write a custom Japanese name generator with our @ai.zero_shot decorator:

import symai as ai
class Demo(ai.Symbol):
    @ai.few_shot(prompt="Generate Japanese names: ",
                 examples=ai.Prompt(
                   ["������������", "������������", "������������", "������������"]
                 ),
                 limit=2,
                 constraints=[lambda x: len(x) > 1])
    def generate_japanese_names(self) -> list:
        return ['������������', '������������'] # dummy implementation
Should the neural computation engine not be able to compute the desired outcome, it will reach out to the default implementation or default value. If no default implementation or value was found, the method call will raise an exception.

Prompt Design
The way all the above operations are performed is by using a Prompt class. The Prompt class is a container for all the information that is needed to define a specific operation. The Prompt class is also the base class for all other Prompt classes.

Here is an example how to define a Prompt to enforce the neural computation engine for comparing two values:

class CompareValues(ai.Prompt):
    def __init__(self) -> ai.Prompt:
        super().__init__([
            "4 > 88 =>False",
            "-inf < 0 =>True",
            "inf > 0 =>True",
            "4 > 3 =>True",
            "1 < 'four' =>True",
            ...
        ])
For example, when calling the <= operation on two Symbols, the neural computation engine will evaluate the symbols in the context of the CompareValues prompt.

res = ai.Symbol(1) <= ai.Symbol('one')
This statement evaluates to True, since the fuzzy compare operation was conditions our engine to compare the two Symbols based on their semantic meaning.

:[Output]:
True
In a more general notion, depending on the context hierarchy of the expression class and used operations the semantics of the Symbol operations may vary. To better illustrate this, we show our conceptual prompt design in the following figure:



The figure shows our hierarchical prompt design as a container of all the information that is provided to the neural computation engine to define a task-specific operation. The Yellow and Green highlighted boxes indicate mandatory string placements. The dashed boxes are optional placeholders. and the Red box indicates the starting point of the model prediction.

Conceptually we consider three main prompt designs: Context-based Prompts, Operational Prompts, and Templates. The prompts can be curated either by inheritance or by composition. For example, the Static Context can be defined by inheriting from the Expression class and overriding the static_context property. An Operation and Template prompt can be created by providing an PreProcessor to modify the input data.

We will now explain each prompt concept in more details:

The Context-based Prompts (Static, Dynamic and Payload) are considered optional and can be defined in a static manner, either by sub-classing the Expression class and overriding the static_context property, or at runtime by updating the dynamic_context property or passing an payload kwargs to a method. Here is an example how to use the payload kwargs via the method signature:

# creating a query to ask if an issue was resolve or not
sym = Symbol("<some-community-conversation>")
q = sym.query("Was the issue resolved?")
# write manual condition to check if the issue was resolved
if 'not resolved' in q:
    # do a new query but payload the previous query answer to the new query
    sym.query("What was the resolution?", payload=q)
    ...
else:
    pass # all good
Regardless of how we set the context, our contextualized prompt defines the desired behavior of the Expression operations. For example, if we want to operate in the context of a domain-specific language, without having to override each base class method. See more details in this notebook.

The Operation prompts define the behavior of an atomic operation and is therefore mandatory to express the nature of such an operation. For example, the +-operation is used to add two Symbols together and therefore the +-operation prompt explains its behavior. Examples defines another optional structure that provides the neural computation engine with a set of demonstrations that are used to properly condition the engine. For example, the +-operation prompt can be conditioned on how to add numbers by providing a set of demonstrations, such as 1 + 1 = 2, 2 + 2 = 4, etc.

The Template prompts are optional and encapsulates the resulting prediction to enforce a specific format. For example, to generate HTML tags we can use a curated <html>{{placeholder}}</html> template. This template will enforce the neural computation engine to start the generation process already in the context of a HTML tags format, and not produce irrelevant descriptions about its task.

expressionless Expressions
An Expression is a non-terminal symbol, which can be further evaluated. It inherits all the properties from Symbol and overrides the __call__ method to evaluate its expressions or values. From the Expression class, all other expressions are derived. The Expression class also adds additional capabilities i.e. to fetch data from URLs, search on the internet or open files. These operations are specifically separated from Symbol since they do not use the value attribute of the Symbol class.

SymbolicAI' API closely follows best practices and ideas from PyTorch, therefore, one can build complex expressions by combining multiple expressions as a computational graph. Each Expression has its own forward method, which has to be overridden. The forward method is used to define the behavior of the expression. The forward method is called by the __call__ method, which is inherited from the Expression base class. The __call__ evaluates an expression and returns the result from the implemented forward method. This design pattern is used to evaluate the expressions in a lazy manner, which means that the expression is only evaluated when the result is needed. This is a very important feature, since it allows us to chain complex expressions together. We already implemented many useful expressions, which can be imported from the symai.components file.

Other important properties that are inherited from the Symbol class are _sym_return_type and static_context. These two properties define the context in which the current Expression operates, as described in the Prompt Design section. The static_context therefore influences all operations of the current Expression sub-class. The _sym_return_type ensures that after each evaluation of an Expression, we obtain the desired return object type. This is usually implemented to return the current type, but can be set to return a different type.

Expressions can of course have more complex structures and be further sub-classed, such as shown in the example of the Sequence expression in the following figure:



A Sequence expression can hold multiple expressions, which are evaluated at runtime.

Sequence expressions
Here is an example how to define a Sequence expression:

# first import all expressions
from symai import *
# define a sequence of expressions
Sequence(
    Clean(),
    Translate(),
    Outline(),
    Compose('Compose news:'),
)
Stream expressions
As we saw earlier, we can create contextualized prompts to define the behavior of operations on our neural engine. However, this also takes away a lot of the available context size and since e.g. the GPT-3 Davinci context length is limited to 4097 tokens, this might quickly become a problem. Luckily, we can use the Stream processing expression. This expression opens up a data stream and performs chunk-based operations on the input stream.

A Stream expression can easily be wrapped around other expressions. For example, the chunks can be processed with a Sequence expression, that allows multiple chained operations in sequential manner. Here is an example how to define such a Stream expression:

Stream(Sequence(
    Clean(),
    Translate(),
    Outline(),
    Embed()
))
The shown example opens a stream, passes a Sequence object which cleans, translates, outlines and embeds the input. Internally, the stream operation estimates the available model context size and chunks the long input text into smaller chunks, which are passed to the inner expression. The returned object type is a generator.

The issue with this approach is, that the resulting chunks are processed independently. This means there is no shared context or information among chunks. To solve this issue, we can use the Cluster expression instead, where the independent chunks are merged based on their similarity. We illustrate this in the following figure:



In the shown example all individual chunks are merged by clustering the information within each chunk. This gives us a way to consolidate contextually related information and merge them in a meaningful way. Furthermore, the clustered information can then be labeled by streaming through the content of each cluster and extracting the most relevant labels, providing us with interpretable node summaries.

The full example is shown below:

stream = Stream(Sequence(
    Clean(),
    Translate(),
    Outline(),
))
sym = Symbol('<some long text>')
res = Symbol(list(stream(sym)))
expr = Cluster()
expr(res)
In a next step, we could recursively repeat this process on each summary node, therefore, build a hierarchical clustering structure. Since each Node resembles a summarized sub-set of the original information we can use the summary as an index. The resulting tree can then be used to navigate and retrieve the original information, turning the large data stream problem into a search problem.

Alternatively, we could use vector-base similarity search to find similar nodes. For searching in a vector space we can use dedicated libraries such as Annoy, Faiss or Milvus.

x Error Handling
A key idea of the SymbolicAI API is to be able to generate code. This in turn means that errors may occur, which we need to handle in a contextual manner. As a future vision, we even want our API to self extend and therefore need to be able to resolve issues automatically. To do so, we propose the Try expression, which has a fallback statements built-in and retries an execution with dedicated error analysis and correction. This expression analyses the input and the error, and conditions itself to resolve the error by manipulating the original code. If the fallback expression succeeds, the result is returned. Otherwise, this process is repeated for the number of retries specified. If the maximum number of retries is reached and the problem was not resolved, the error is raised again.

Let us assume, we have some executable code that was previously generated. However, by the nature of generative processes syntax errors may occur. By using the Execute expression, we can evaluate our generated code, which takes in a symbol and tries to execute it. Naturally, this will fail. However, in the following example the Try expression resolves this syntactic error and the receive a computed result.

expr = Try(expr=Execute())
sym = Symbol('a = int("3,")') # some code with a syntax error
res = expr(sym)
The resulting output is the evaluated code, which was corrected:

:Output:
a = 3
We are aware that not all errors are as simple as the shown syntactic error example, which can be resolved automatically. Many errors occur due to semantic misconceptions. Such issues require contextual information. Therefore, we are further exploring means towards more sophisticated error handling mechanism. This includes also the usage of streams and clustering to resolve errors in a more hierarchical contextual manner. It is also noteworthy that neural computations engines need to be further improved to better detect and resolve errors.

spider Interpretability, Testing & Debugging
Perhaps one of the greatest benefits of using neuro-symbolic programming is, that we can get a clear understanding of how well our LLMs understand simple operations. Specifically we gain knowledge about if, and at which point they fail, enabling us to follow their StackTraces and determine the failure points. In our case, neuro-symbolic programming allows us to debug the model predictions based on dedicated unit test for simple operations. To detect conceptual misalignments we can also use a chain of neuro-symbolic operations and validate the generative process. This is of course not a perfect solution, since the verification may also be error prone, but it gives us at least a principle way to detect conceptual flaws and biases in our LLMs.

Unit Testing Models
Since our premise is to divide and conquer complex problems, we can curate conceptual unit test and target very specific and tracktable sub-problems. The resulting measure, i.e. success rate of the model prediction, can then be used to evaluate their performance, and hint towards undesired flaws or biases.

This allows us to design domain-specific benchmarks and see how well general learners, such as GPT-3, adapt with certain prompts to a set of tasks.

For example, we can write a fuzzy comparison operation, that can take in digits and strings alike, and perform a semantic comparison. LLMs can then be asked to evaluate these expressions. Often times, these LLMs still fail to understand the semantic equivalence of tokens in digits vs strings and give wrong answers.

The following code snipped shows a unit test to perform semantic comparison of numbers (between digits and strings):

import unittest
from symai import *

class TestComposition(unittest.TestCase):
  def test_compare(self):
      res = Symbol(10) > Symbol(5)
      self.assertTrue(res)
      res = Symbol(1) < Symbol('five')
      self.assertTrue(res)
      ...
fireDebugging
When creating very complex expressions, we debug them by using the Trace expression, which allows to print out the used expressions, and follow the StackTrace of the neuro-symbolic operations. Combined with the Log expression, which creates a dump of all prompts and results to a log file, we can analyze where our models potentially failed.

Example: News Summary
In the following example we create a news summary expression that crawls the given URL and streams the site content through multiple expressions. The outcome is a news website that is created based on the crawled content. The Trace expression allows to follow the StackTrace of the operations and see what operations are currently executed. If we open the outputs/engine.log file we can see the dumped traces with all the prompts and results.

# crawling the website and creating an own website based on its facts
news = News(url='https://www.cnbc.com/cybersecurity/',
            pattern='cnbc',
            filters=ExcludeFilter('sentences about subscriptions, licensing, newsletter'),
            render=True)
expr = Log(Trace(news))
res = expr()
Here is the corresponding StackTrace of the model:



The above code creates a webpage with the crawled content from the original source. See the preview below, the entire rendered webpage image here and resulting [code of webpage here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xpitfire/symbolicai/main/examples/results/news.html.

chart_with_upwards_trend Interface for Query and Response Inspection
SymbolicAI is by design a data-driven framework. This means that we can collect data from API interactions while we provide the requested responses. For very agile, dynamic adaptations or prototyping we can integrate user desired behavior quickly into existing prompts. However, we can also log the user queries and model predictions to make them available for post-processing. Therefore, we can customize and improve the model's responses based on real-world data.

In the following example, we show how we can use an Output expression to pass a handler function and access input prompts of the model and model predictions. These, can be used for data collection and later fine-tuning stages. The handler function provides a dictionary and offers keys for input and output values. The content can then be sent to a data pipeline for further processing.

sym = Symbol('Hello World!')
def handler(res):
    input_ = res['input']
    output = res['output']
expr = Output(expr=sym.translate, 
              handler=handler, 
              verbose=True)
res = expr('German')
Since we called verbose, we can also see the console print of the Output expression:

Input: (['Translate the following text into German:\n\nHello World!'],)
Expression: <bound method Symbol.translate of <class 'symai.symbol.Symbol'>(value=Hello World!)>
args: ('German',) kwargs: {'input_handler': <function OutputEngine.forward.<locals>.input_handler at ...
Dictionary: {'wrp_self': <class 'symai.components.Output'>(value=None), 'func': <function Symbol.output.<locals>._func at ...
Output: Hallo Welt!
robot Engines
Due to limited compute resources we currently rely on OpenAI's GPT-3 API for the neuro-symbolic engine. However, given the right compute resources, it is possible to use local machines to avoid high latencies and costs, with alternative engines such as OPT or Bloom. This would allow for recursive executions, loops, and more complex expressions.

Furthermore, as we interpret all objects as symbols only with a different encodings, we integrated a set of useful engines that transform these objects to the natural language domain to perform our operations.

Symbolic Engine
Although in our work, we mainly focus on how LLMs can evaluate symbolic expressions, many formal statements were already well implemented in existing symbolic engines, like WolframAlpha. Therefore, given an API KEY from WolframAlpha, we can use their engine by setting the expression_engine attribute. This avoids error prune evaluations from neuro-symbolic engines for mathematical operations. The following example shows how to use WolframAlpha to compute the result of the variable x:

expr = Expression()
expr.command(engines=['symbolic'], expression_engine='wolframalpha')
res = expr.expression('x^2 + 2x + 1')
:Output:
x = -1
Speech Engine
To interpret audio files we can perform speech transcription by using whisper. The following example shows how to transcribe an audio file and return the text:

expr = Expression()
res = expr.speech('examples/audio.mp3')
:Output:
I may have overslept.
OCR Engine
To "read" text from images we can perform optical character recognition (OCR) with APILayer. The following example shows how to transcribe an image and return the text:

expr = Expression()
res = expr.ocr('https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-p/0f/da/22/3a/rechnung.jpg')
The OCR engine returns a dictionary with a key all_text where the full text is stored. See more details in their documentation here.

:Output:
China Restaurant\nMaixim,s\nSegeberger Chaussee 273\n22851 Norderstedt\nTelefon 040/529 16 2 ...
Search Engine
To obtain fact-based content we perform search queries via SerpApi with a Google backend. The following example shows how to search for a query and return the results:

expr = Expression()
res = expr.search('Birthday of Barack Obama')
:Output:
August 4, 1961
WebCrawler Engine
To access any data source from the web, we can use Selenium. The following example shows how to crawl a website and return the results:

expr = Expression()
res = expr.fetch(url="https://www.google.com/", 
                 pattern="google")
The pattern property can be used to detect if the document as been loaded correctly. If the pattern is not found, the crawler will timeout and return an empty result.

:Output:
GoogleKlicke hier, wenn du nach einigen Sekunden nicht automatisch weitergeleitet wirst.GmailBilderAnmelden ...
Drawing Engine
To render nice images from text description we use DALL����E 2. The following example shows how to draw a text description and return the image:

expr = Expression('a cat with a hat')
res = expr.draw()
:Output:
https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/org-l6FsXDfth6Uct ...
Don't worry, we would never hide an image of a cat with a hat from you. Here is the image preview and link:


File Engine
To perform file operations we use the file system of the OS. At the moment, we support only PDF files and plain text files. This is a very early stage and we are working on more sophisticated file system access and also remote storage. The following example shows how to read a PDF file and return the text:

expr = Expression()
res = expr.open('./LICENSE')
:Output:
BSD 3-Clause License\n\nCopyright (c) 2023 ...
Indexing Engine
We use Pinecone to index and search for text. The following example shows how to store text as an index and then retrieve the most related match of it:

expr = Expression()
expr.add(Expression('Hello World!').zip())
expr.add(Expression('I like cookies!').zip())
res = expr.get(Expression('hello').embed().value).ast()
res['matches'][0]['id']
:Output:
Hello World
Here the zip method creates a pair of strings and embedding vectors. Afterwards they are added to the index. The line with get basically retrieves the original source based on the vector value of hello and uses ast to cast the value to a dictionary.

One can set several kwargs for the indexing engine. See the symai/backend/engine_index.py file for more details.

CLIP Engine
To perform text-based image few-shot classification we use CLIP. This implementation is very experimental and conceptually does not fully integrate the way we intend it, since the embeddings of CLIP and GPT-3 are not aligned (embeddings of the same word are not identical for both models). Aligning them is an open problem for future research. For example, one could learn linear projections from one embedding space to the other.

The following example shows how to classify the image of our generated cat from above and return the results as an array of probabilities:

expr = Expression()
res = expr.vision('https://oaidalleapiprodscus.blob.core.windows.net/private/org-l6FsXDfth6...', 
                  ['cat', 'dog', 'bird', 'horse', 'sheep', 'cow', 'elephant', 'bear', 'zebra', 'giraffe'])
:Output:
array([[9.72840726e-01, 6.34790864e-03, 2.59368378e-03, 3.41371237e-03,
        3.71197984e-03, 8.53193272e-03, 1.03346225e-04, 2.08464009e-03,
        1.77942711e-04, 1.94185617e-04]], dtype=float32)
Local Neuro-Symbolic Engine
One can use the a locally hosted instance for the Neuro-Symbolic Engine. Out of the box we provide a Hugging Face client-server backend and host the model EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B to perform the inference. As the name suggests this is a six billion parameter model and requires a GPU with ~16GB RAM to run properly. The following example shows how to host and configure the usage of the local Neuro-Symbolic Engine.

Fist we start the backend server:

# optional: set cache folder for transformers (Linux/MacOS)
export TRANSFORMERS_CACHE="<path-to-cache-folder>"
# start server backend (default model is EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B)
symsvr
# initialize server with client call
symclient
Then use once the following code to set up the local engine:

from symai.backend.engine_nesy_client import NeSyClientEngine
# setup local engine
engine = NeSyClientEngine()
setting = Expression()
setting.setup(engines={'neurosymbolic': engine})
Now you can use the local engine to perform symbolic computation:

# do some symbolic computation with the local engine
sym = Symbol('cats are cute')
res = sym.compose()
...
Custom Engine
If you want to replace or extend the functionality of our framework, you can do this by customizing the existing engines or creating new engines. The Symbol class provides for this functionality some helper methods, such as command and setup. The command method can pass on configurations (as **kwargs) to the engines and change functionalities or parameters. The setup method can be used to re-initialize an engine with your custom engine implementation which must sub-class the Engine class. Both methods can be specified to address one, more or all engines.

Here is an example how to initialize your own engine. We will sub-class the existing GPT3Engine and override the prepare method. This method is called before the neural computation and can be used to modify the parameters of the actual input prompt that will be passed in for execution. In this example, we will replace the prompt with dummy text for illustration purposes:

from symai.backend.engine_gpt3 import GPT3Engine
class DummyEngine(GPT3Engine):
    def prepare(self, args, kwargs, wrp_params):
        wrp_params['prompts'] = ['Go wild and generate something!']
custom_engine = DummyEngine()
sym = Symbol()
sym.setup(engines={'neurosymbolic': custom_engine})
res = sym.compose()
To configure an engine, we can use the command method. In this example, we will enable verbose mode, where the engine will print out what methods it is executing and the parameters it is using. This is useful for debugging purposes:

sym = Symbol('Hello World!')
sym.command(engines=['neurosymbolic'], verbose=True)
res = sym.translate('German')
:Output:
<symai.backend.engine_gpt3.GPT3Engine object at 0, <function Symbol.translate.<locals>._func at 0x7fd68ba04820>, {'wrp_self': <class 'symai.symbol.S ['\n\nHallo Welt!']
Here is the list of names of the engines that are currently supported:

neurosymbolic - GPT-3
symbolic - WolframAlpha
ocr - Optical Character Recognition
vision - CLIP
speech - Whisper
embedding - OpenAI Embeddings API (ada-002)
userinput - User Command Line Input
search - SerpApi (Google search)
crawler - Selenium
execute - Python Interpreter
index - Pinecone
open - File System
output - Output Callbacks (e.g. for printing to console or storage)
imagerendering - DALL����E 2
Finally, let's assume you want to create a entirely new engine, but still keep our workflow, then you can use the _process_query function from symai/functional.py and pass in your engine including all other specified objects (i.e. Prompt, PreProcessor, etc.; see also section Custom Operations).

Termgpt: OpenAI Chatbot
This program uses the OpenAI API to create a chatbot that can converse with users. The chatbot is powered by the GPT-3.5-turbo (or 4) language model and can answer a wide range of questions. If you are like me and want to stay in the terminal, this is the tool for you.

Breaking change: Now you can call gpt3 or gpt4 (if you have an api key for it)
Beware that using gpt4 is expensive (15x more than 3.5-turbo), so use it with care.

Install
You will need and openAI api key, the app expects that the key is available as an environment variable: OPENAI_API_KEY.

$ pip install termgpt
Usage
$ gpt3 
> who are you?

I am an AI language model created by OpenAI. My purpose is to be of assistance and respond to your queries to the best of my abilities.
or ask question about a file:

$ gpt3 lotr.txt
> what is this file about?

This file is about The Lord of the Rings, a high-fantasy novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. It describes the plot, characters, and setting of the book, as well as its publication history, critical 
reception, and cultural impact. It also mentions Tolkien's influences and the numerous adaptations and derivative works that the novel has inspired.

[System] You are a helpful assistant.

> what is relu
ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is an activation function commonly used in deep neural networks. It is defined as f(x) = max(0, x). In other 
words, the output of the function is zero when the input is negative, and equal to the input when the input is positive. ReLU has become 
popular in deep learning because it helps to address the vanishing gradient problem and allows for faster training of neural networks.
> and gelu?
GeLU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) is another activation function used in deep neural networks. It is defined as f(x) = 0.5 * x * (1 + erf(x /
sqrt(2))), where erf is the error function. GeLU is a smooth approximation of the ReLU function, and has been shown to work well in certain 
types of neural networks. It is particularly useful in sequence modeling tasks such as natural language processing, where the input data 
often has a Gaussian distribution. GeLU is similar to ReLU in terms of its computational efficiency, but can potentially improve the 
performance of a neural network by providing a more accurate representation of the input data.

Check the database setting from the config command above, which will show you the currently configured connection string for a default SQLite database.

If you're happy with that setting, nothing else needs to be done -- the database will be created automatically in that location when you run the program.

Initial user creation and login
Once the database is configured, run the program with no arguments:

chatgpt
It will recognize no users have been created, and prompt you to create the first user:

Username: Required, no spaces or special characters
Email: Optional
Password: Optional, if not provided the user can log in without a password
Once the user is created, execute the /login command with the username:

/login [username]
Once you're logged in, you have full access to all commands.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The user authorization system from the command line is 'admin party' -- meaning every logged in user has admin privileges, including editing and deleting other users.

Setting a per-user default preset
The API backend supports configuring a preset per user.

To do so, run /user-edit and selecting a default preset will be one of the options.

And the neurosymbolic ai.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Neurosymbolic AI is an area of research and development that combines principles from neural networks (AI) and symbolic reasoning (logic and knowledge representation). It aims to integrate the strengths of both approaches to create more robust and explainable AI systems.
Neural networks, such as deep learning models, are powerful for learning patterns and making predictions from large amounts of data. They excel at tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, they lack the ability to reason explicitly about concepts and perform logical operations.
On the other hand, symbolic reasoning approaches, such as rule-based systems and knowledge graphs, are good at representing and manipulating structured knowledge. They can handle logical rules, infer relationships, and perform complex reasoning tasks. However, they struggle with learning from data and handling uncertainty.
Neurosymbolic AI aims to bridge this gap by integrating neural networks and symbolic reasoning. It combines the data-driven learning capabilities of neural networks with the logic-based reasoning capabilities of symbolic systems. The goal is to create AI models that can learn from data, reason about concepts, and provide transparent and interpretable explanations for their decisions.
There are different approaches to neurosymbolic AI, including:
Neurosymbolic Integration: This approach focuses on combining neural networks and symbolic reasoning models in a modular architecture. The neural network handles data-driven learning tasks, while the symbolic reasoning component handles logical reasoning and knowledge representation.
Neural-Symbolic Learning: This approach aims to incorporate symbolic reasoning directly into the learning process of neural networks. It involves encoding symbolic representations into the neural network architecture and training the model to learn both from data and logical constraints.
Hybrid Models: These models combine neural networks and symbolic reasoning in a unified framework. They aim to leverage the strengths of both approaches to perform complex tasks that require both pattern recognition and logical reasoning.
Neurosymbolic AI has applications in various domains, including robotics, healthcare, natural language understanding, and scientific discovery. It enables AI systems to not only make accurate predictions but also provide explanations and insights into their decision-making process.
It's important to note that the term "neurosymbolic AI" is relatively broad, and ongoing research is exploring different techniques and architectures within this field. The specific implementation and approaches may vary depending on the research or development context.

Hi there!
Adding two symbols together.

res = sym + 'how are you?'
res
Hi there! How are you?
If one of the objects is a symbol then the other object is converted to a symbol.

A Symbol instance takes in any type of object and preserves its original value type until it is evaluated and sent to the neuro-symbolic engine:

sym = Symbol(np.array([5, 2, 42, 1]))
sym.type()
numpy.ndarray
One can also easily retriev the object by accessing the value attribute:

sym.value
array([ 5,  2, 42,  1])
We can add multiple values together and their operation will be contextualized evaluated. Here we use the shift operator to integrate a new value into the existing symbol:

res = sym << 2
res
['5', '2', '42', '1', '2']
We could do the same manipulation with the + operator, however, the prompts designed for each individual operator may contain different information, therefore, therefore may not evaluated to similar outcomes. In the following example it is clear that the + operator is not to shift the value into the array:

res = sym + 2
res
['5', '2', '42', '1', 2]
However, if we use the + operator to evaluate arithmetic operations, the results are quite different:

x = Symbol('x')
x += 1
x
x1
In that case the neural engines believes that the goal is to concatenate the two values together. Assuming that we want to add to mathematical operations, we need to use the expression operator:

sym = Symbol('x + 1').expression('self + 2')
sym
x + 3
Here we get the expected result. The self statement in the expression method is a reference to the current symbol (x + 1). This is useful when we want to access values from the current symbol using the expression method.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Hello! It seems like you're working with the Symbol class and performing various operations on symbols. Let's break down the code snippets and explanations:
Adding two symbols together:
python
Copy code
res = sym +
'how are you?'
res
In this case, if one of the objects is a Symbol instance (
sym
), then the other object (
'how are you?'
) is converted to a Symbol as well. The resulting symbol
res
will contain the concatenated value of the two symbols: "Hi there! How are you?"
Preserving value type with Symbol:
python
Copy code
sym = Symbol(np.array([
5
,
2
,
42
,
1
]))
sym.
type
()
The Symbol class can take in any type of object and preserve its original value type until evaluation. In this example,
sym
is initialized with a NumPy array, and
sym.type()
returns
numpy.ndarray
, indicating that the original value type is preserved.
Accessing the value attribute:
python
Copy code
sym.value
The
value
attribute of a Symbol instance allows you to access the original object's value. In this case,
sym.value
returns the NumPy array
[5, 2, 42, 1]
.
Shifting a value into the existing symbol:
python
Copy code
res = sym <<
2
res
The shift operator (
<<
) can be used to integrate a new value into the existing symbol. In this example, the value
2
is shifted into the symbol, resulting in
['5', '2', '42', '1', '2']
.
Contextual evaluation with different operators:
python
Copy code
res = sym +
2
res
The
+
operator is used here, but the contextual evaluation is different compared to the shift operator. In this case, the value
2
is added to each element of the symbol, resulting in
['5', '2', '42', '1', 2]
.
Using the expression operator for arithmetic operations:
python
Copy code
x = Symbol(
'x'
)
x +=
1
x
When using the
+=
operator for arithmetic operations, the neural engines interpret it as concatenation rather than addition. In this example,
x += 1
concatenates the value
1
to the symbol
x
, resulting in
x1
.
Using the expression method for mathematical operations:
python
Copy code
sym = Symbol(
'x + 1'
).expression(
'self + 2'
)
sym
To perform mathematical operations, the expression operator (
expression
) is used. In this example, the initial symbol is defined as
'x + 1'
, and the
expression
method is called with
'self + 2'
to add
2
to the current symbol. The resulting symbol
sym
evaluates to
x + 3
.
These examples demonstrate how the Symbol class can be used to manipulate symbols, preserve value types, and perform contextualized evaluations using different operators and expressions.

The code snippet you provided is from the "SymbolicAI: Basics" section. It demonstrates how to use the Symbol class from the SymbolicAI library. Let's break down the code:
Importing the required modules:
python
Copy code
import
os
import
warnings
warnings.filterwarnings(
'ignore'
)
os.chdir(
'../'
)
# set the working directory to the root of the project
from

Here, the necessary modules are imported.
os
is imported for working with the operating system,
warnings
is imported to filter out warnings, and
symai
is imported to access the Symbol class.
IPython.display
is imported to enable better display of results in an IPython environment.
Creating a Symbol:
python
Copy code
sym = Symbol(
'Hi there!'
)
sym
This code creates a Symbol instance named
sym
with the value "Hi there!".
Adding two symbols together:
python
Copy code
res = sym +
'how are you?'
res
The
+
operator is used to add two symbols together. If one of the objects is a Symbol instance (
sym
), the other object ('how are you?') is automatically converted to a Symbol. The resulting symbol
res
contains the concatenated value of the two symbols: "Hi there! How are you?"
Preservation of value types:
python
Copy code
sym = Symbol(
'Hi there!'
)
The Symbol class can take any type of object as input and preserves its original value type until it is evaluated and sent to the neuro-symbolic engine. In this example, the Symbol instance
sym
is initialized with a string value.
These examples showcase the basic usage of the Symbol class from the SymbolicAI library, including symbol creation and addition of symbols.

Evaluating Expressions
Similar to word2vec we intend to preform contextualized operations on different symbols.

Word2vec is a machine learning algorithm that is used to generate dense vector representations of words. It works by training a shallow neural network to predict a word given its neighbors in a text corpus. The resulting vectors are then used in a wide range of natural language processing applications, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and clustering.

Below we can see an example how one can perform operations on the word embedding vectors (colored boxes).


However, we can also perform operations on the natural language space itself. For example, we can add two the word expressions similar to how we added them in the word2vec space:

Symbol('King - Man + Women').expression()
Queen
As we can see, if the expression method is empty the default implementation of Symbol uses only the value stored within the current symbol.

Now let's try to evaluate a more complex expression:

sym = Symbol()
res = sym.expression('x^2 + 2x + 1')
res
x^2 + 2x + 1
Well, not exactly simplified the way we intended it.

This is because using LLMs for expression evaluations is still very limited, therefore, to leverage the full power of symbolic programming we can use the expression method to evaluate an expression via WolframAlpha:

expr = Symbol()
expr.command(engines=['symbolic'], expression_engine='wolframalpha')
res = expr.expression('x^2 + 2x + 1')
res
x = -1
There we go! The command method configures the symbolic engine to evaluate expressions via WolframAlpha. One can see that this evaluates the expression and returns the correct result.

Showing other basic operations
Sometimes we want to simply concatenate to symbols together without any other neural operation. This is easily done with the @ operation:

# define a second string
sym = Symbol("Welcome to our tutorial.")
test2 = 'Hello world!'
# concatenate strings
res = sym @ test2
res
Welcome to our tutorial.Hello world!
We can of course define full sentences as Symbols and perform several operations on them.

sym = Symbol("""Images and videos of domestic cats make up some of the most viewed content on the World Wide Web, particularly image macros in the form of lolcats. ThoughtCatalog has described cats as the "unofficial mascot of the Internet".[1]
The subject has attracted the attention of various scholars and critics, who have analyzed why this form of low art has reached iconic status. Although it may be considered frivolous, cat-related Internet content contributes to how people interact with media and culture.[2] Some argue that there is a depth and complexity to this seemingly simple content, with a suggestion that the positive psychological effects that pets have on their owners also hold true for cat images viewed online.[3]
Research has suggested that viewing online cat media is related to positive emotions, and that it even may work as a form of digital therapy or stress relief for some users. Some elements of research also shows that feelings of guilt when postponing tasks can be reduced by viewing cat content.[4]

# News

The News class is a custom Expression class used to fetch and process news articles. It contains methods to fetch a news article from a given URL, process the article using a specified pattern, and render the article in an HTML template. 

## Constructor

The constructor takes four parameters:

- `url`: A string representing the URL of the news article to fetch
- `pattern`: A string representing the pattern to use when processing the news article
- `filters`: An optional list of Expressions used to filter the news article
- `render`: An optional boolean indicating whether or not to render the news article in an HTML template

The constructor also initializes the following fields:

- `data_stream`: A Stream object containing a Sequence of Clean, Translate, Outline, and Compose expressions
- `header_style`: A Style object used to style the HTML template
- `html_template`: A Symbol object containing the HTML template
- `html_template_seq`: A Template object used to insert the rendered news article into the HTML template
- `html_stream`: A Stream object containing a Sequence of the HTML template and style

## Methods

### render

The render method takes a Symbol object as a parameter and returns a Symbol object containing the rendered news article. It uses the header_style to style the HTML template, the html_template_seq to insert the rendered news article into the HTML template, and the html_stream to style the rendered article.

### forward

The forward method fetches the news article from the given URL, processes it using the specified pattern, and clusters the results. It then maps the clusters and, if render is set to True, renders the mapped results. Finally, it returns a Symbol object containing the rendered news article.

The code snippet you provided demonstrates various examples of evaluating expressions using the SymbolicAI library. Let's break down each example:
Word2vec-like operations:
python
Copy code
Symbol(
'King - Man + Women'
).expression()
This example shows how to perform operations on word embedding vectors. The expression
'King - Man + Women'
represents the operation of subtracting the vector for "Man" from the vector for "King" and adding the vector for "Women" to it. The resulting symbol represents the closest word in the embedding space, which in this case is "Queen".
Evaluating simple expressions:
python
Copy code
sym = Symbol()
res = sym.expression(
'x^2 + 2x + 1'
)
res
Here, the expression
'x^2 + 2x + 1'
is evaluated. However, since LLMs have limited capabilities in evaluating mathematical expressions, the result is not simplified.
Evaluating expressions using WolframAlpha:
python
Copy code
sym = Symbol()
sym.command(engines=[
'symbolic'
], expression_engine=
'wolframalpha'
)
res = sym.expression(
'x^2 + 2x + 1'
)
res
To leverage the full power of symbolic programming, the expression is evaluated using WolframAlpha. The
command
method configures the symbolic engine to use WolframAlpha for expression evaluation. The resulting symbol correctly evaluates the expression and returns the simplified result:
x = -1
.
Concatenating symbols:
python
Copy code
sym = Symbol(
"Welcome to our tutorial."
)
test2 =
'Hello world!'
res = sym @ test2
res
The
@
operator is used to concatenate two symbols together. In this example, the symbol
sym
is concatenated with the string
'Hello world!'
, resulting in the symbol
"Welcome to our tutorial.Hello world!"
.
Translating symbols:
python
Copy code
sym = Symbol(
"""Images and videos of domestic cats make up some of the most viewed content on the World Wide Web..."""
)
sym.translate(
'German'
)
The
translate
method is used to translate a symbol to a different language. In this example, the symbol containing a paragraph about cats is translated to German using the
translate
method. The resulting symbol contains the German translation.
Classifying the mood of a sentence:
python
Copy code
sym.choice([
'angry'
,
'neutral'
,
'hate-speech'
,
'happy'
,
'unk'
], default=
'unk'
)
The
choice
method is used to classify the mood of a sentence. In this example, the sentence is classified into one of the given categories: angry, neutral, hate-speech, happy, or unknown (default).
Generating documentation:
python
Copy code
from
examples.docs
import
Docs, CppDocs
docs = Docs()
doc = docs(
"""def execute(default: str = None,
            constraints: List[Callable] = [],
            pre_processor: List[PreProcessor] = [],
            post_processor: List[PostProcessor] = [],
            *wrp_args,
            **wrp_kwargs):
    ...
"""
)
print
(doc)
This example shows how to generate documentation for a function using the
Docs
class. The function is passed as a multiline string, and the
docs
method generates the documentation for it. The resulting documentation is printed.
Overall, these examples demonstrate how to evaluate expressions using the SymbolicAI library. From performing word2vec-like operations to evaluating mathematical expressions and generating documentation, the library provides capabilities for symbolic programming and manipulation of symbols.

from symai import *
from IPython.display import display
Writing a chatbot is fairly easy with our framework. All we need to do is basically derive from the ChatBot class and implement the forward method. The base class ChatBot has already some helper capabilities and context detection dictionaries. All we have to do is use the self.narrate method to instruct our chatbot to say what we want.

Afterwards, we can use the self.context_choice method to classify the context of the user input. This is done by using a dictionary of context keywords. The self.context_choice method returns the context key that matches the user input. This key can then be used to determine the next action / condition of the chatbot.

See the following example:

from symai.chat import ChatBot


class SymbiaChat(ChatBot):
    def forward(self) -> str:
        message = self.narrate('Symbia introduces herself, writes a greeting message and asks how to help.')        
        while True:
            # query user
            usr = self.input(message)
            
            # detect context
            ctxt = self.context_choice(usr)
            
            if 'option 3' in ctxt: # exit
                self.narrate('Symbia writes goodbye message.', end=True)
                break # end chat
            
            elif 'option 4' in ctxt: # help
                message = self.narrate('Symbia writes for each capability one sentence.', 
                                       context=self.capabilities)
                      
            elif 'option 1' in ctxt: # chit chat
                message = self.narrate('Symbia replies to the user question in a casual way.')
        
            elif 'option 2' in ctxt: 
                # detect command
                option = self.capabilities_choice(usr)
                
                if 'option 1' in option:
                    q = usr.extract('user query request')
                    rsp = self.search(q)
                    message = self.narrate('Symbia replies to the user based on the online search results.', 
                                           context=rsp)                    
                elif 'option 2' in option:
                    q = usr.extract('URL')
                    site = self.fetch(q)
                    site.save('tmp.html')
                    message = self.narrate('Symbia explains that the website is downloaded to the `tmp.html` file.') 
                elif 'option 3' in option:
                    pass

#
TODO:
Handle more options
In the
forward
method, the chatbot interacts with the user by using the
narrate
method to display messages and ask for user input. It then uses the
context_choice
method to classify the context of the user input and takes appropriate actions based on the detected context and user commands.
Starting the chat:
python
Copy code
chat = SymbiaChat()
chat()
After creating an instance of the
SymbiaChat
class, the chatbot can be started by calling the
forward
method. This method takes user input and returns a chatbot response.
This example provides a basic structure for building a chatbot using the SymbolicAI framework. You can customize the logic, add more contexts, and extend the functionality of the chatbot to suit your specific requirements.

Handling large / long context lengths
We can create contextual prompts to define the semantic operations for our model. However, this takes away a lot of our context size and since the GPT-3 context length is limited to 4097 tokens, this might quickly become a problem. Luckily we can use the Stream processing expression. This expression opens up a data stream and computes the remaining context length for processing the input data. Then it chunks the sequence and computes the result for each chunk. The chunks can be processed with a Sequence expression, that allows multiple chained operations in a sequential manner.

In the following example we show how we can extract news from a particular website and try to recombine all individual chunks again by clustering the information among the chunks and then recombining them. This gives us a way to consolidate contextually related information and recombine them in a meaningful way. Furthermore, the clustered information can then be labeled by looking / streaming through the values within the cluster and collecting the most relevant labels.


If we repeat this process, we now get a way of building up a hierarchical cluster with labels as entry points to allow information retrieval from our new data structure.

To make manners more concrete, lets take a look at how to build up a news generator. Let us first start by importing some pre-defined string constants. These constants are used to define how the text is processed and how we desire the output to be formatted.

from examples.news import HEADER_STYLE_DESCRIPTION, HTML_TEMPLATE, HTML_STREAM_STYLE_DESCRIPTION
News Generator
We sub-class the Expression class and define the __init__ implementation. Similar to PyTorch we can define the graph in the __init__ method and then call the forward method to compute the result. Afterwards, the data from the web URL is streamed through a Sequence of operations. This cleans the text from all the clutter such as \n, \t, etc. and then extracts the news from the text. The news are then filtered and re-composed. The resulting news texts are then clustered and the clusters are labeled. The labeled clusters are then recombined to return a rendered HTML format.

class News(Expression):
    """The `News` class sub-classes `Expression` and provides a way to fetch and render news from a given url. It uses a `Stream` object to process the news data, with a sequence of `Clean`, `Translate`, `Outline`, and `Compose` expressions. 
    It also defines a `Style` for the header, and a `Symbol` for the HTML templates.

        These `Symbol` objects are then combined into a single `Symbol` object which is then mapped.

Here you can try the news generator:

# crawling the website and creating an own website based on its facts
news = News(url='https://www.cnbc.com/cybersecurity/',
            pattern='cnbc',
            filters=ExcludeFilter('sentences about subscriptions, licensing, newsletter'),
            render=True)
Since the generative process will evaluate multiple expression, we can use the Trace and Log classes to keep track of what is happening.

expr = Log(Trace(news))
res = expr()
os.makedirs('results', exist_ok=True)
path = os.path.abspath('results/news.html')
res.save(path, replace=False)
Streaming over a PDF File
Another example is to read in a PDF file and extract the text from it to create a website based on its content.

from examples.paper import Paper
The process is fairly similar to the news generator. We first read in the PDF file and then stream the text through a sequence of operations. The text is then cleaned and the sentences are extracted. The sentences are then clustered and labeled. The labeled clusters are then recombined to return a rendered HTML format.

paper = Paper(path='examples/paper.pdf')
expr = Log(Trace(paper))
res = expr(n_pages=1)
os.makedirs('results', exist_ok=True)
path = os.path.abspath('results/news.html')
res.save(path, replace=False)

In this example, a
News
class is defined by subclassing the
Expression
class. The
__init__
method sets up the necessary attributes and creates the data stream with a sequence of operations such as
Clean
,
Translate
,
Outline
, and additional filters. The
render
method is used to render the news as HTML based on the collected information. The
forward
method fetches the news from the provided URL, processes it through the data stream, clusters the results, and returns the rendered news if
render
is
True
.
Using the news generator:
python
Copy code
news = News(url=
'https://www.cnbc.com/cybersecurity/'
,
            pattern=
'cnbc'
,
            filters=ExcludeFilter(
'sentences about subscriptions, licensing, newsletter'
),
            render=
True
)
This code creates an instance of the
News
class, specifying the URL to fetch the news from, a pattern to identify the relevant content on the web page, and any additional filters to apply. The
render
parameter is set to
True
to indicate that the news should be rendered as HTML.
Streaming over a PDF file:
python
Copy code
from
examples.paper
import
Paper
This code imports the
Paper
class from the
examples.paper
module.
The process for streaming over a PDF file is similar to the news generator. You create an instance of the
Paper
class, provide the path to the PDF file, and then process the text through a sequence of operations. The resulting text is cleaned, sentences are extracted, clustered, labeled, and then rendered as HTML.
Please note that the complete code for the
Paper
class and the specifics of processing the PDF file are not provided in the snippet you shared.

The code you provided uses the
sympy
library to define variables and constraints for a logical puzzle known as the "Einstein's Riddle" or "Zebra Puzzle." It aims to find the person who keeps fish based on a set of given constraints.
However, the current code does not provide a solution because the constraints specified in the
constraints
list are inconsistent. As a result, the
solve
function does not find a valid solution for the given constraints.
To obtain a valid solution, you need to carefully define the constraints to ensure they are consistent and can be satisfied. The constraints should establish unique relationships between the variables and provide enough information to deduce the person who keeps fish.
Once the constraints are correctly defined, the
solve
function can be used to find a solution, and the result can be printed using the appropriate format.

)
In this version, the code defines separate lists for the different categories such as colors, nationalities, drinks, cigarettes, and pets. It also creates a dictionary
symbols_dict
that maps each variable to its corresponding
sympy
symbol using a loop.
The
constraints
list includes equations that establish the relationships between the variables based on the given puzzle constraints.
The
solve
function is then used to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints. The resulting solution is a dictionary mapping each variable to its assigned value.
Finally, the code prints out the solution by iterating over the
solution
dictionary and displaying the variable and its corresponding value.
Note that the code assumes that there is a unique solution that satisfies all the constraints. If the constraints are inconsistent or insufficient, the code may not produce a valid solution.

Do you remember earlier when we discussed Lojban and universal languages?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, I remember our discussion about Lojban and universal languages. Lojban is an artificial language that was designed with the goal of being culturally neutral and logically unambiguous. It was created in the late 20th century and is based on the principles of predicate logic.
Lojban aims to be a universal language that can be easily understood and used by people from different linguistic backgrounds. It has a regular grammar and a precise syntax, which helps in avoiding the ambiguities and inconsistencies found in natural languages. The vocabulary of Lojban is derived from a combination of several natural languages, with words chosen based on their international recognition and simplicity.
The design of Lojban focuses on making the language expressive and flexible, allowing for precise communication of ideas. It is based on predicate logic, which means that sentences in Lojban can be understood as logical propositions with clear subject-predicate structures.
The idea behind universal languages, including Lojban, is to create a common language that can be understood and used by people from different linguistic backgrounds. The goal is to overcome the barriers caused by language differences and facilitate communication and understanding among people.
However, it's worth noting that the adoption and widespread use of a universal language like Lojban face significant challenges. Natural languages are deeply embedded in cultures and societies, and they carry rich nuances, cultural references, and historical contexts that may be difficult to capture in a constructed language. Additionally, the learning and adoption of a new language require time and effort, and there must be a compelling motivation for individuals and communities to invest in learning and using a universal language.
While the concept of universal languages is intriguing and has been explored by linguists and language enthusiasts, the practical realization of a widely adopted universal language remains a complex and ongoing challenge.

Ok well I meant to say how come there was no mention of Pythagoras and Theano's suggestion for geometry, music, and mathematics as rational, relational, universal languages.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
I apologize for not mentioning Pythagoras and Theano's suggestion regarding geometry, music, and mathematics as rational, relational, universal languages. Pythagoras, an ancient Greek philosopher and mathematician, and his follower Theano, proposed that these disciplines could serve as universal languages for understanding and expressing fundamental principles of the universe.
According to Pythagoras, geometry, music, and mathematics were interconnected and represented the harmonious order of the cosmos. He believed that numbers and ratios were fundamental to understanding the structure of the universe. Pythagoras and his followers explored the mathematical relationships found in geometric figures, musical harmonies, and numerical patterns, seeing them as reflections of deeper truths.
Theano, who was both a mathematician and Pythagoras' wife, further developed these ideas. She suggested that the principles of rationality and relationality inherent in mathematics and geometry could be applied universally. By studying these disciplines, one could gain insights into the fundamental nature of reality and establish a common language that transcended linguistic and cultural barriers.
The concept of using geometry, music, and mathematics as universal languages was rooted in the belief that these disciplines had inherent order, logic, and beauty that could be understood by individuals across different cultures and backgrounds. The symbolic and abstract nature of these disciplines allowed for the expression and communication of ideas in a way that transcended specific languages and cultural contexts.
It's important to note that Pythagoras and Theano's ideas were influential in their time and contributed to the development of mathematics, philosophy, and the sciences. However, the concept of using geometry, music, and mathematics as universal languages has evolved and been interpreted in various ways throughout history. Different approaches and theories have emerged regarding the nature of universal languages and the extent to which they can bridge linguistic and cultural gaps.
Ultimately, the quest for a truly universal language, whether through constructed languages like Lojban or through the application of mathematics and other disciplines, continues to be an ongoing exploration in the fields of linguistics, philosophy, and communication.

Song dynasty figurine of a man holding a compass
The compass is a magnetometer used for navigation and orientation that shows direction in regards to the geographic cardinal points. The structure of a compass consists of the compass rose, which displays the four main directions on it: East (E), South (S), West (W) and North (N). The angle increases in the clockwise position. North corresponds to 0����, so east is 90����, south is 180���� and west is 270����.

The history of the compass started more than 2000 years ago during the Han dynasty (202 BC ������ 220 AD). The first compasses were made of lodestone, a naturally magnetized stone of iron, in Han dynasty China.[1][2] It was called the "South Pointing Fish" and was used for land navigation by the mid-11th century during the Song dynasty (960������1279 AD). Shen Kuo provided the first explicit description of a magnetized needle in 1088 and Zhu Yu mentioned its use in maritime navigation in the text Pingzhou Table Talks, dated 1111������1117.[3][4] Later compasses were made of iron needles, magnetized by striking them with a lodestone. Magnetized needles and compasses were first described in medieval Europe by the English theologian Alexander Neckam (1157������1217 AD). The first usage of a compass in Western Europe was recorded in around 1190 and in the Islamic world 1232.[5] Dry compasses begin appearing around 1269 in Medieval Europe and 1300 in the Medieval Islamic world.[6][7][8] This was replaced in the early 20th century by the liquid-filled magnetic compass.[9]

Navigation prior to the compass
See also: Polynesian navigation
Before the introduction of the compass, geographical position and direction at sea were primarily determined by the sighting of landmarks, supplemented with the observation of the position of celestial bodies.[10] Other techniques included sampling mud from the seafloor (China),[11] analyzing the flight path of birds, and observing wind, sea debris, and sea state (Polynesia and elsewhere).[12] Objects that have been understood as having been used for navigation by measuring the angles between celestial objects, were discovered in the Indus Valley site of Lothal.[13] The Norse are believed to have used a type of sun compass to locate true north. On cloudy days, the Vikings may have used cordierite or some other birefringent crystal to determine the sun's direction and elevation from the polarization of daylight; their astronomical knowledge was sufficient to let them use this information to determine their proper heading.[14] The invention of the compass made it possible to determine a heading when the sky was overcast or foggy, and when landmarks were not in sight. This enabled mariners to navigate safely far from land, increasing sea trade, and contributing to the Age of Discovery.[15][16]

Geomancy and Feng Shui

Chinese geomantic compass c. 1760 from the National Maritime Museum in London
Main article: Luopan
The compass was invented in China during the Han dynasty between the 2nd century BC and 1st century AD where it was called the "south-governor"(s����n����n ������������) or "South Pointing Fish" (������������������).[3] The magnetic compass was not, at first, used for navigation, but for geomancy and fortune-telling by the Chinese. The earliest Chinese magnetic compasses were possibly used to order and harmonize buildings by the geomantic principles of feng shui. These early compasses were made with lodestone, a form of the mineral magnetite that is a naturally occurring magnet and aligns itself with the Earth's magnetic field.[10] People in ancient China discovered that if a lodestone was suspended so it could turn freely, it would always point toward the magnetic poles. Early compasses were used to choose areas suitable for building houses, growing crops, and to search for rare gems. Compasses were later adapted for navigation during the Song dynasty in the 11th century.[1]

Based on Krotser and Coe's discovery of an Olmec hematite artifact in Mesoamerica, radiocarbon dated to 1400������1000 BC, astronomer John Carlson has hypothesized that the Olmec might have used the geomagnetic lodestone earlier than 1000 BC for geomancy, a method of divination, which if proven true, predates the Chinese use of magnetism for feng shui by a millennium.[17] Carlson speculates that the Olmecs used similar artifacts as a directional device for astronomical or geomantic purposes but does not suggest navigational usage. The artifact is part of a polished hematite bar with a groove at one end, possibly used for sighting. Carlson's claims have been disputed by other scientific researchers, who have suggested that the artifact is actually a constituent piece of a decorative ornament and not a purposely built compass.[18] Several other hematite or magnetite artifacts have been found at pre-Columbian archaeological sites in Mexico and Guatemala.

Bulla (seal)

A bulla (or clay envelope) and its contents on display at the Louvre. Uruk period (4000������3100 BC).
A bulla (Medieval Latin for "a round seal", from Classical Latin bulla, "bubble, blob"; plural bullae) is an inscribed clay or soft metal (such as lead or tin) or bitumen or wax token used in commercial and legal documentation as a form of authentication and for tamper-proofing whatever is attached to it (or, in the historical form, contained in it).

In their oldest attested form, as used in the ancient Near East and the Middle East of the 8th millennium BC onwards, bullae were hollow clay balls that contained other smaller tokens that identified the quantity and types of goods being recorded. In this form, bullae represent one of the earliest forms of specialization in the ancient world, and likely required skill to create.[1]:������24������ From about the 4th millennium BC onwards, as communications on papyrus and parchment became widespread, bullae evolved into simpler tokens that were attached to the documents with cord, and impressed with a unique sign (i.e., a seal)[1]:������29������ to provide the same kind of authoritative identification and for tamper-proofing. Bullae are still occasionally attached to documents for these purposes (e.g., the seal on a papal bull).

Origins

Two clay bullae, one complete and sealed, the other broken with tokens visible, Uruk period. Oriental Institute Museum, Chicago.
During the period 8,000������7,500 BC, the Sumerian agriculturalists needed a way to keep records of their animals and goods. Small clay tokens were formed and shaped by the palms to represent certain animals and goods.[2]

Clay tokens allowed agriculturalists to keep track of animals and food that had been traded, stored, and/or sold. Because grain production became such a major part of life, they needed to store their extra grain in shared facilities and account for their food. This clay token system went unchanged for about 4,000 years until the tokens started to become more elaborate in appearance. The tokens were similar in size, material, and color but the markings had more of a variety of shapes. As the amount of goods being produced increased and the exchanging of goods became more common, changes to tokens were made to keep up with the growth.[3]

Transactions for trading needed to be accounted for efficiently, so the clay tokens were placed in a clay ball (bulla), which helped to prevent deception and kept all the tokens together. In order to account for the tokens, the bullae would have to be broken open to reveal their contents. Seals were impressed into the opening of the bullae to prevent tampering. Each party had its own unique seal to identify them. Seals would not only identify individuals, but it would also identify their office. Sometimes, the token was impressed onto the wet bulla before it dried so that the owner could remember what exactly was in the bulla without having to break it.
