To run a Chrome extension like "Predator-Mode", you'd typically follow these steps:
Download the Extension Files
: It seems you already have the necessary files like
README.md
,
icon.png
,
invert.css
,
manifest.json
, and
predator.js
. Ensure these are saved in a single folder.
Open Chrome Extensions Page
: Open Google Chrome, and navigate to the extensions page by typing
chrome://extensions/
in the address bar.
Enable Developer Mode
: On the top right corner of the extensions page, you'll find a toggle for 'Developer mode'. Turn this on.
Load Unpacked Extension
: After enabling Developer Mode, you'll see an option to 'Load unpacked' on the top left corner of the page. Click this button.
Select the Extension Folder
: Navigate to the folder where you saved your extension files (the ones you mentioned) and select it. Make sure all the necessary files for the extension are in this folder.
Install and Test the Extension
: Chrome will install the extension. You should now see the extension icon in your browser toolbar, or you can find it in the Extensions menu. Click on it to test if it's working as expected.
Read the README.md
: Often, extension creators include important information and instructions in the
README.md
file. It's a good practice to read this file to understand how to use the extension properly.
Adjust Permissions if Necessary
: Some extensions require certain permissions to function. Make sure to review and adjust these in the extension's details page in the Extensions menu.
Remember, since this is a manual installation, the extension won't automatically update. You'll need to manually update it by downloading new files and reloading the extension in Chrome.

Given that Manifest V2 is deprecated and will no longer be supported, it's important to update your Chrome extension to Manifest V3. The Manifest version is a critical part of a Chrome extension that defines its structure and capabilities.
Here's a basic guide to update your
manifest.json
from Manifest V2 to V3:
Update Manifest Version
:
Replace
"manifest_version": 2
with
"manifest_version": 3
.
Update
browser_action
to
action
:
In Manifest V3,
browser_action
is replaced with
action
. So, you would change your
browser_action
field to
action
.
Handling Background Scripts
:
If your extension uses background scripts, you need to migrate to using service workers. Manifest V3 uses service workers instead of background pages.
Content Scripts
:
The way you've defined content scripts remains largely the same in Manifest V3. However, ensure all other parts of your extension are compliant with V3 standards.
Review Permissions
:
Review your permissions and adjust them according to V3's more stringent security model.
Testing
:
Thoroughly test your updated extension. Manifest V3 has significant changes, especially around how extensions manage state and interact with the browser.
Here's an example of how your updated
manifest.json
might look:
json
Copy code
{
"manifest_version"
:
3
,
"name"
:
"Predator Mode"
,
"description"
:
"This extension inverts all images on a web page"
,
"version"
:
"1.0"
,
"action"
:
{
"default_icon"
:
"icon.png"
}
,
"content_scripts"
:
[
{
"matches"
:
[
"<all_urls>"
]
,
"css"
:
[
"invert.css"
]
}
]
}
Remember, this is a basic conversion, and depending on the complexity and features of your extension, you may need to make additional changes. It's highly recommended to consult the
official documentation
for a comprehensive understanding of all the changes required for Manifest V3.
