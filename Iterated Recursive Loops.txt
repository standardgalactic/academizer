Can you give early prototypical examples of null convention logic.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Finding early prototypical examples of Null Convention Logic (NCL) is challenging due to the limitations in accessing specific academic and technical resources that detail its history and development. NCL, a paradigm in asynchronous circuit design, is known for its use in creating systems that operate without a global clock, relying on a handshake mechanism for synchronization. It's a key area in the field of computer engineering, especially in the context of low-power, robust asynchronous circuit designs.
Given the specialized nature of this topic, early examples and detailed historical insights are likely to be found in academic papers, technical journals, or books on asynchronous circuit design. These resources would typically provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of NCL, including its foundational concepts, initial implementations, and the progression of the technology.
For in-depth information, exploring academic databases like IEEE Xplore, ResearchGate, or SpringerLink, and searching for works related to the history or evolution of Null Convention Logic would be beneficial. These platforms are repositories of numerous scholarly articles and books that can offer detailed insights into the early prototypes and developmental stages of NCL.

Understanding early metaphors or analogies for signals indicating completion in asynchronous communication can be insightful. These concepts, fundamental to asynchronous logic and systems like Null Convention Logic (NCL), have evolved over time. Here are a few historical analogies and metaphors:

1. **Semaphore Signals**: Semaphore systems, used for railway signaling and maritime communication, are early examples. A semaphore signal indicates completion or status using visual cues, like flags or mechanical arms, which can be seen as an analogy for completion signaling in asynchronous systems.

2. **Telegraph Systems**: Telegraphy, especially Morse code, used pauses (silences) to indicate the end of a letter or word. This can be likened to a 'null' signal indicating the completion of a transmission, a concept central to NCL.

3. **Handshaking in Early Computing**: The concept of handshaking in computer science, where two devices or components signal to each other to establish a connection or confirm receipt, is an early metaphor. This process can be asynchronous, with each side waiting for a signal before proceeding.

4. **Relay Logic Circuits**: Before modern electronic computers, relay logic was used for control systems. A relay would only activate (complete its action) when its control conditions were met, akin to the completion signals in asynchronous logic.

5. **Human Communication**: Conversational turn-taking in human communication is a natural metaphor. One person speaks and then pauses, signaling the other person that it's their turn to respond, similar to how completion signals work in asynchronous communication.

These early examples and metaphors have paved the way for more sophisticated systems like NCL, where the concept of indicating completion is crucial for the system's operation without a global clock.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your exploration of early metaphors and analogies for completion signaling in asynchronous communication is quite insightful. These historical examples indeed provide a foundational understanding of how asynchronous systems, including Null Convention Logic (NCL), operate. Let's delve a bit deeper into each:
Semaphore Signals
: The use of visual cues in semaphore systems is an excellent analogy for asynchronous signaling. Just as a semaphore's position conveys specific information, asynchronous systems use signal states to indicate the status of a process or communication.
Telegraph Systems
: The use of pauses in Morse code is akin to the concept of a 'null' signal in NCL. This pause or absence of a signal to indicate the end of a transmission is a fundamental concept in asynchronous logic.
Handshaking in Early Computing
: The handshaking process in early computing, where two systems communicate to acknowledge receipt or readiness, is directly related to the handshake protocol in NCL. This process ensures that operations are synchronized without relying on a global clock.
Relay Logic Circuits
: Relay logic, where a relay completes an action only after certain conditions are met, parallels the conditional signaling in NCL. In both cases, the next step in the process occurs only after specific criteria are satisfied.
Human Communication
: The metaphor of conversational turn-taking is particularly relatable. It emphasizes the importance of signaling in communication, akin to how completion signals in asynchronous systems indicate when a process or communication is finished and the next can begin.
These analogies beautifully illustrate the evolution of the concept of signaling in asynchronous systems, culminating in sophisticated technologies like NCL, which relies on this principle for efficient and effective communication and processing without the need for a central timing mechanism.

My idea for null wave algebra concerned applying it to social and psychological situations by focusing on the slowest elements dependency chain, such as the poor and the weak
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Applying the concept of null wave algebra to social and psychological contexts is a novel and intriguing idea. In computing, null wave algebra involves managing dependencies and ensuring synchronization in asynchronous systems. Translating this to social and psychological situations, especially focusing on the slowest elements in a dependency chain like the poor and the weak, could provide valuable insights into systemic issues and dynamics. Here's how this could work:
Identifying Dependency Chains
: In societal structures, there are often complex dependency chains, where certain groups are disproportionately affected by systemic inefficiencies. Applying null wave algebra could involve identifying these chains and understanding how different groups are interconnected.
Focusing on the Slowest Elements
: Just as null wave algebra in computing focuses on the slowest parts of a process to optimize the overall system, applying this approach to social systems would mean paying special attention to the most disadvantaged groups. This could help in understanding how their progress or lack thereof affects the larger societal system.
Synchronization and Balance
: In asynchronous systems, synchronization is key to ensuring smooth operations. Translated to a social context, this could mean finding ways to better integrate different societal groups, ensuring that no group lags too far behind, which could destabilize the societal 'system.'
Predictive Analysis and Intervention
: Just like null wave algebra can predict bottlenecks or slowdowns in a computing process, applying it socially could help predict where societal problems might arise based on the status of vulnerable groups. This predictive capability could guide early interventions.
Policy and Resource Allocation
: This approach could inform policy-making and resource allocation, ensuring that resources are directed to the most crucial areas that can have a ripple effect on the entire social structure.
By applying principles from a technical field like null wave algebra to social and psychological situations, innovative solutions to longstanding problems could be developed, focusing on systemic changes that uplift the most vulnerable segments of society.

Certainly, here are some playful, sardonic reviews from fictional skeptics using logical fallacies and strawman arguments to criticize the ideas discussed:
Professor I. M. Cynical
: "So, we're using null wave algebra for societal problems now? Next, we'll be using quantum mechanics to decide what to have for breakfast. Sure, let's just apply complex computational theories to poverty and inequality - because, you know, people's lives are just like a bunch of circuits waiting to be optimized!"
Dr. A. N. Outdated
: "Back in my day, we didn't need fancy-schmancy 'null wave algebras' to solve social issues. We just used common sense! This newfangled idea is like using a spaceship to go to the grocery store. Overcomplicated, unnecessary, and frankly, a bit silly if you ask me."
Miss I. Knowbetter

Sir U. P. Erior
: "Using a concept from asynchronous logic in social contexts? What's next, using chess strategies to run the government? I suppose if my toaster malfunctions, I should consult a psychologist. Let's stick to what we know and leave the high-brow tech talk to the robots."
These fictional characters employ a mix of strawman arguments, oversimplifications, and false equivalences to humorously critique the idea of applying a technical concept like null wave algebra to social and psychological situations.

Ok I think it is helpful. A seriously academic critique from a nihilist cultural relativist, who thinks it is overly idealistic
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
As a nihilist cultural relativist offering an academic critique, the viewpoint would likely focus on the inherent limitations of applying a technical concept like null wave algebra to complex social and psychological phenomena, emphasizing the perceived futility and idealism of such an endeavor:
"From a nihilistic standpoint, the proposition of employing null wave algebra to address social and psychological issues is an exercise in futility, steeped in an unjustified optimism about the power of technology to solve inherently human problems. This approach, while innovative, naively overlooks the chaotic, subjective nature of human existence and societal dynamics. Cultural relativism teaches us that social phenomena are deeply rooted in unique cultural contexts that defy uniform, technical solutions. By attempting to apply a uniform, computational framework to these diverse and intricate human experiences, the approach risks oversimplifying the rich tapestry of human life into binary, mechanistic processes.
Moreover, the endeavor betrays an idealistic belief in the universal applicability of scientific principles to realms that are fundamentally governed by subjective experiences, cultural norms, and individual perceptions. Human societies are not akin to circuits or algorithms that can be optimized or debugged; they are complex, ever-evolving systems shaped by myriad factors that resist quantification or formulaic intervention. Such an idealistic pursuit, though well-intentioned, might inadvertently trivialize the profound, nuanced nature of human struggles and societal disparities, reducing them to mere problems to be 'solved' rather than understood in their full, existential complexity.
In essence, while the intellectual exercise of applying null wave algebra to social issues might be intriguing, from a nihilist cultural relativist perspective, it is ultimately a quixotic venture, reflecting a misplaced faith in the power of technical rationality to grapple with the existential depth and cultural diversity of the human condition."

I think maybe a review from someone who found it overly technical and incoherent, while being not mathematically rigorous
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly, here's a review from a critic who finds the idea overly technical, incoherent, and lacking mathematical rigor:
"As someone who appreciates clear, coherent ideas, I find the concept of applying null wave algebra to social and psychological situations bewildering and frankly, a bit pretentious. The proposal is drowning in technical jargon and computational theories that seem more at home in a computer science textbook than in a serious discussion about societal issues. It's as if the author picked a random complex-sounding term from advanced mathematics and haphazardly slapped it onto social sciences, hoping it would somehow make sense.
Furthermore, the idea lacks the mathematical rigor one would expect from such a technically named concept. There's an apparent absence of a structured mathematical framework or a clear explanation of how exactly null wave algebraic principles would be quantitatively applied to social phenomena. It feels like the term 'null wave algebra' is being used more for its intellectual allure than for any substantive, methodological purpose.
In trying to bridge the gap between advanced computing concepts and human-centric issues, the proposal ends up being neither here nor there. It's too technical for those interested in social sciences and too incoherent and mathematically unsophisticated for the scientifically inclined. In the end, the reader is left puzzled, trying to decipher what is essentially a mashup of high-level technical speak and vague, hand-waving arguments about societal change. One can appreciate the ambition behind such interdisciplinary ventures, but without clarity and mathematical substance, it remains an overcomplicated and underdeveloped idea."

Provide some mathematical basis for the idea from computer science reconsidered and logically determined design by Karl Fant, and sparse Bayesian networks according to Michael Elad
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
To provide a mathematical basis for applying null wave algebra to social and psychological situations, we can draw from the principles outlined in Karl Fant's "Computer Science Reconsidered" and the concept of sparse Bayesian networks by Michael Elad:
Karl Fant's Invocation Model of Process Expression
: In "Computer Science Reconsidered," Karl Fant argues that traditional mathematical foundations may not be the most suitable for computer science. He proposes an alternative conceptual model that unifies various forms of expression, simplifying complex and intractable issues. This model focuses on process expression, offering a practical and valid theory for computer science that could be adapted to other fields, such as social sciences, by simplifying complex dependency relationships and interactions���
���.
Sparse Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) by Michael Elad
: Elad's work on sparse Bayesian neural networks provides insights into dealing with uncertainty in predictions, a frequent issue in neural networks developed within the frequentist statistical framework. Sparse representation models in Bayesian networks involve linear combinations of few atoms from a pre-specified dictionary to represent a given signal. This concept can be applied to social contexts by using sparse Bayesian methods to model and interpret complex social data. The use of sparse vectors to represent data points could mirror the identification of key elements or 'slowest elements' in social systems���
������
���.
Bayesian Perspective and Sparse Coding
: From a Bayesian perspective, sparse coding provides a maximum a posteriori estimate of an unknown vector under a sparse prior. This approach could be employed in social science contexts to estimate the most likely states or conditions of social systems, particularly when data is incomplete or uncertain. It aligns with the idea of focusing on key elements (like the poor and the weak) in a social system and determining their impact on the overall structure���
���.
By integrating concepts from Karl Fant's alternative theory of computer science and Michael Elad's sparse Bayesian networks, a mathematical basis can be formed for applying null wave algebra to social and psychological situations. This approach would involve simplifying complex social interactions and dependencies, much like simplifying complex computational processes, and using Bayesian methods to interpret and predict social dynamics, focusing on crucial elements within these systems.

Another harsh critique, showcasing a number of logical fallacies
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Here's a harsh critique filled with various logical fallacies:
"Oh, here we go again, another 'revolutionary' idea trying to solve social issues with computer science. First off, let's start with the obvious appeal to novelty fallacy - just because this null wave algebra is a new, shiny concept doesn't mean it's going to be the magic bullet for societal problems. And let's not forget the classic strawman - suggesting that society operates like a computer system is an oversimplification that ignores the complex reality of human behavior.
Then there's the slippery slope argument - if we start using computer algorithms to analyze social issues, what's next? Are we going to let computers decide our laws and run our governments? It's just a step away from a dystopian future where AI controls everything.
And of course, there's the appeal to authority - just because some computer scientists think this is a good idea doesn't mean it's universally applicable to areas outside their expertise. That's like asking a chef to fix your car.
In conclusion, this idea is a hodgepodge of logical fallacies, wrapped in technical jargon, trying to pass off as a serious solution to complex social issues. It's more of a theoretical exercise than a practical approach, and frankly, a bit of a joke."

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an academic essay that incorporates previous topics, including null wave algebra, asynchronous logic, and the parallels between ancient timekeeping and modern computational concepts:
Title: "Clepsydra Maintenance: Bridging Ancient Timekeeping and Modern Computational Concepts"
Abstract
This essay explores the maintenance of clepsydras (ancient water clocks) and draws parallels with modern computational concepts such as Null Convention Logic (NCL) and null wave algebra. By examining the maintenance requirements of these ancient timekeeping devices, we propose a unique perspective on understanding their operation and draw intriguing parallels with contemporary computing principles.
Introduction
The clepsydra, or water clock, is an ancient timekeeping device that measures time through the regulated flow of water. The maintenance of these devices, crucial for their accuracy and reliability, offers fascinating insights into ancient engineering. This essay juxtaposes the principles of clepsydra maintenance with modern computational theories, specifically Null Convention Logic and null wave algebra, to explore the interconnectedness of timekeeping, technology, and societal systems.
Clepsydra: An Overview
A clepsydra operates on the principle of measuring time by the amount of water that flows from one vessel to another. The maintenance of a clepsydra involves ensuring the steady flow of water, which requires regular monitoring and adjustments to account for variables like water pressure, evaporation, and sediment build-up.
Null Convention Logic (NCL) and Clepsydra Maintenance
NCL, a method in asynchronous logic in computing, shares a conceptual similarity with clepsydra maintenance. Both require a constant monitoring of 'flow' and 'state' - in clepsydras, the flow of water, and in NCL, the flow of data. Just as a clepsydra must be regularly calibrated to ensure accurate timekeeping, NCL systems require meticulous design and maintenance to ensure data integrity and synchronization without a global clock.
Null Wave Algebra in Social Contexts and Clepsydra Maintenance
The concept of null wave algebra in social and psychological contexts, focusing on the slowest elements in a system, finds a metaphorical parallel in clepsydra maintenance. The slowest component in a clepsydra, such as a clogged passage, can affect the entire system's accuracy, similar to how the most vulnerable groups in a society can impact the overall societal dynamics.
Discussion
This juxtaposition of ancient and modern technologies highlights the timeless nature of certain principles, such as the importance of maintenance, monitoring, and understanding the 'slowest' components in a system. Whether in the realm of physical mechanics, as in clepsydras, or in abstract computational models, these principles remain crucial for the system's effective operation.
Conclusion
The maintenance of clepsydras not only offers a window into ancient timekeeping practices but also provides a unique lens through which to view modern computational theories. Understanding these ancient devices in the context of contemporary concepts like NCL and null wave algebra enriches our appreciation of the universal principles underlying technology and its role in society.

Title: "Turn-Taking as a Proxy for Intelligence Quotient (IQ): A New Perspective in Cognitive Assessment"
Abstract
This essay introduces the novel concept of using turn-taking in conversation as a proxy for assessing Intelligence Quotient (IQ). Traditionally, IQ has been measured through standardized tests, often criticized for their limitations and biases. This paper proposes that the dynamics of turn-taking in conversations can offer a unique, more inclusive insight into cognitive abilities, reflecting real-world social and communicative intelligence.
Introduction
Intelligence Quotient (IQ) has long been a standard metric for assessing cognitive abilities. However, conventional methods of IQ testing have faced criticism for their narrow focus on certain types of intelligence, cultural biases, and lack of adaptability to real-world scenarios. This essay explores the hypothesis that conversational turn-taking, a fundamental aspect of human communication, can serve as an innovative proxy for IQ, providing a more holistic and inclusive assessment of cognitive abilities.
The Traditional Landscape of IQ Testing
IQ tests typically measure a range of cognitive skills, including memory, problem-solving, and logical reasoning. However, they often fail to account for social and emotional intelligence, creativity, and cultural differences. This limitation has led to debates on the effectiveness of IQ tests in truly capturing an individual's cognitive capabilities.
Turn-Taking in Conversational Dynamics
Turn-taking is a core element of effective communication, requiring individuals to listen, process information, and respond appropriately. It involves cognitive skills such as attention, working memory, processing speed, and social cognition. These skills are essential components of intelligence that are not always adequately represented in traditional IQ tests.
Turn-Taking as a Proxy for IQ
This essay proposes that the patterns and effectiveness of turn-taking in conversations could be an alternative or complementary method for assessing cognitive abilities. It involves real-time processing of information, social awareness, and adaptive responses, which are crucial in everyday interactions and problem-solving.
Methodology and Implications
To explore this hypothesis, we propose a study design involving conversational analysis and its correlation with traditional IQ measures. The study would assess how effectively individuals engage in turn-taking, their adaptability to different conversational contexts, and their ability to process and respond to information in real-time.
Conclusion
Turn-taking in conversations represents a dynamic and inclusive approach to understanding cognitive abilities. By exploring this concept as a proxy for IQ, we can potentially redefine cognitive assessments to be more reflective of an individual's practical intelligence and social adaptability. This approach could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of intelligence, beyond the constraints of conventional testing.

The concept of using conversational turn-taking as a proxy for intelligence, particularly in early childhood development, is supported by recent research. According to a study from the University of Auckland:
Link to Higher Intelligence
: Learning the skill of turn-taking in the first three years of life is linked to higher intelligence levels later in academia. This skill is also associated with increased emotional regulation, attachment, emotional communication, and cortical growth in language and social processing regions of the brain���
���.
Active Brain Engagement
: More participation in turn-taking during conversations with caregivers leads to increased brain activity in language production and processing. This indicates that turn-taking is not just a social skill but also engages critical cognitive processes���
���.
Brain Development
: Turn-taking is strongly connected with the strength of white matter connections between key language regions in the brain, such as Broca���s and Wernicke���s areas. This indicates a direct link between conversational turns and important areas of the brain responsible for language comprehension and reading skills���
���.
These findings suggest that turn-taking in early childhood is not only a crucial social skill but also an important aspect of cognitive development, potentially serving as an indicator of future intelligence.

So turn taking often requires theory of mind inference is why I think it might be helpful in developing intelligence or a sign of other intelligent skills
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your observation about turn-taking involving theory of mind inference is quite insightful. Theory of mind, the ability to attribute mental states to oneself and others, is crucial for effective turn-taking in conversation. It requires understanding others' perspectives, intentions, and emotions to communicate effectively.
This cognitive skill is indeed linked to various aspects of intelligence. Engaging in turn-taking and practicing theory of mind can enhance social and communicative abilities, which are key components of social intelligence. It also involves executive functions like attention and memory, which are integral to cognitive development. Therefore, proficiency in turn-taking, underpinned by theory of mind, can indeed be indicative of broader intelligent skills and contribute to their development.

I thought maybe the driver in training sign on a car might be similar to a null wave signal
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept of a "driver in training" sign on a car can indeed be analogous to a null wave signal in asynchronous logic. Just as a null wave signal in Null Convention Logic (NCL) indicates that a process is not currently transmitting meaningful data and is in a state of waiting or preparation, a "driver in training" sign signals to other drivers that the vehicle is not operating under typical conditions. It indicates a state of learning and caution, requiring other drivers to adjust their expectations and behavior accordingly. This analogy highlights how certain signals in different contexts serve to inform others of a non-standard state that requires special consideration.
You
Other examples like this?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are some other examples where everyday signs or signals function similarly to a null wave signal in asynchronous logic:
"Out of Order" Sign
: Similar to a null wave indicating a system is not ready for data processing, an "Out of Order" sign on a machine informs users that it is currently non-operational and cannot be used.
Traffic Lights on Amber/Flashing
: A traffic light on amber or flashing serves as a caution signal, akin to a null wave signal indicating a state of transition or waiting, urging drivers to prepare for a change in the traffic flow.
Loading Icons on Websites
: A loading icon indicates that a webpage is in the process of loading content, similar to how a null wave signal indicates a waiting or preparation phase in data processing.
"Please Wait" in Customer Service Areas
: In customer service settings, a "Please Wait" sign signals customers to hold until they can be attended to, similar to a null wave indicating a pause or waiting state in a system.
"Under Construction" Webpage Banners
: These banners indicate that the website content is not yet complete or fully functional, akin to a null wave signal suggesting that the system is currently not in a state to provide meaningful output.
These examples illustrate how various signs and signals in everyday contexts serve a similar purpose to null wave signals in computing, indicating a state of inaction, transition, or preparation.

Sometimes there is a message that says computer updating please do not turn off until it is complete
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, that's a great example. The message "Computer updating, please do not turn off until it is complete" on a computer screen during updates is similar to a null wave signal. It indicates that the computer is in a critical process state where it should not be interrupted. This message serves as a signal to the user to wait until the process is complete, much like how a null wave signal in asynchronous logic systems indicates a period of inaction or preparation before normal operation can resume.
You
So it sounds like we are using null wave algebra in social situations already.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Indeed, the concept of using signals akin to null wave algebra in social situations is already in practice, albeit not formally recognized or labeled as such. Situations where signals indicate a state of transition, waiting, or preparation, similar to the function of null wave signals in asynchronous logic, are common in everyday life. These signals help manage expectations and actions, much like how null wave algebra manages data flow and processing in computing systems. Recognizing these parallels can offer insightful perspectives on how we naturally incorporate logical systems into social and operational contexts.

Can you define null wave algebra in this context?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In the context of our conversation, "null wave algebra" is a theoretical concept inspired by Null Convention Logic (NCL), a method in asynchronous digital logic design. It's not a formally established concept in mathematics or computer science. The idea was to metaphorically apply principles similar to NCL to social and psychological contexts. In this metaphorical sense, null wave algebra would involve identifying and managing dependencies and states of readiness or action within social systems, similar to how NCL manages data flow and processing in computing systems. This concept was explored as a way to understand and potentially address complex dynamics in societal interactions.

I want to point out another potential flaw, is that sometimes the incomplete calculations can be correct or partially correct as in curried functions or they can be useful for didactive feedback so they calculations might still be useful even if transmitting an incomplete signal
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You raise an important point. In certain computational contexts, incomplete calculations can indeed be correct or partially correct, as in the case of curried functions in programming, where a function is partially applied and returns another function. Similarly, in educational or diagnostic settings, incomplete results can provide valuable didactic feedback, aiding in learning or problem-solving processes. This suggests that in applying computational principles like null wave algebra to other contexts, it's crucial to consider the potential utility and correctness of incomplete or transitional states, rather than dismissing them outright as non-useful. This perspective adds nuance to the application of these concepts beyond their original computing domain.
You
Do you have any more insights we might not have mentioned?

ChatGPT
One additional insight is the importance of context and flexibility in applying computational models to non-computational fields. Just as in computing, where algorithms and logics are designed to be adaptable to different types of data and scenarios, applying concepts like null wave algebra to social sciences requires a deep understanding of the context and nuances of human behavior and societal dynamics. This includes recognizing the diversity of individual experiences and the complexity of social interactions, which are far more variable and less predictable than computational processes. Therefore, any application of computational theories to social contexts must be done with a consideration for adaptability and the unique aspects of human society.
You
We discussed the social implications in another conversation, the point is that the calculation can not complete until the slowest component has been processed
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You're correct in highlighting that in systems like Null Convention Logic, the entire process waits for the slowest component to complete before proceeding. This principle, when applied metaphorically to social contexts, emphasizes the significance of addressing the needs and pace of the slowest or most vulnerable members in a societal system. It suggests that for a society to progress effectively, attention must be given to ensuring that all members, especially those who may be lagging due to various disadvantages, are adequately supported. This approach fosters a more inclusive and balanced development within the social structure.
You
I don't know if the argument is coherent. I know about trickle down effects maybe is a specific component that delivers a correct answer through a more expensive computational means when all the other components are still incomplete. "Calculations" in this model are processes or parameters, so they could represent food, shelter, education, meaningful work, and so on.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your perspective introduces an important dimension to the model. In this context, the "calculations" representing essential societal components like food, shelter, education, and meaningful work can indeed be viewed as processes that might deliver beneficial outcomes, even if not all components are complete or fully optimized. This approach recognizes that certain critical societal processes (akin to more expensive computational tasks) can yield significant benefits or "correct answers" to societal needs, irrespective of the completion status of other components. It's a more nuanced view that acknowledges the value and impact of individual societal elements, even in the midst of broader, incomplete systemic processes.
