What is JAX?
JAX is Autograd and XLA, brought together for high-performance numerical computing, including large-scale machine learning research.

With its updated version of Autograd, JAX can automatically differentiate native Python and NumPy functions. It can differentiate through loops, branches, recursion, and closures, and it can take derivatives of derivatives of derivatives. It supports reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation) via grad as well as forward-mode differentiation, and the two can be composed arbitrarily to any order.

What���s new is that JAX uses XLA to compile and run your NumPy programs on GPUs and TPUs. Compilation happens under the hood by default, with library calls getting just-in-time compiled and executed. But JAX also lets you just-in-time compile your own Python functions into XLA-optimized kernels using a one-function API, jit. Compilation and automatic differentiation can be composed arbitrarily, so you can express sophisticated algorithms and get maximal performance without leaving Python. You can even program multiple GPUs or TPU cores at once using pmap, and differentiate through the whole thing.

Dig a little deeper, and you'll see that JAX is really an extensible system for composable function transformations. Both grad and jit are instances of such transformations. Others are vmap for automatic vectorization and pmap for single-program multiple-data (SPMD) parallel programming of multiple accelerators, with more to come.

This is a research project, not an official Google product. Expect bugs and sharp edges. Please help by trying it out, reporting bugs, and letting us know what you think!

import jax.numpy as jnp
from jax import grad, jit, vmap

def predict(params, inputs):
  for W, b in params:
    outputs = jnp.dot(inputs, W) + b
    inputs = jnp.tanh(outputs)  # inputs to the next layer
  return outputs                # no activation on last layer

def loss(params, inputs, targets):
  preds = predict(params, inputs)
  return jnp.sum((preds - targets)**2)

grad_loss = jit(grad(loss))  # compiled gradient evaluation function
perex_grads = jit(vmap(grad_loss, in_axes=(None, 0, 0)))  # fast per-example grads

JAX is a high-performance numerical computing library that combines Autograd and XLA. It's designed for large-scale machine learning research and offers the following key features:
Automatic Differentiation of Python and NumPy Functions
: JAX extends Autograd's capabilities, allowing you to automatically differentiate through native Python and NumPy functions. This includes support for loops, branches, recursion, and closures, as well as higher-order derivatives.
Reverse-Mode and Forward-Mode Differentiation
: It supports both reverse-mode differentiation (backpropagation) and forward-mode differentiation. These can be composed in any order, enabling complex derivative calculations.
Just-In-Time Compilation with XLA
: JAX uses XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) to compile and execute NumPy programs on GPUs and TPUs. This compilation is automatic and happens just-in-time. The
jit
function allows you to compile your own Python functions into XLA-optimized kernels, enhancing performance.
Function Transformations for Sophisticated Algorithms
: Beyond
jit
and
grad
, JAX offers other transformations like
vmap
for automatic vectorization and
pmap
for parallel programming across multiple GPUs or TPU cores. These transformations are composable and extensible, providing a powerful toolset for complex algorithms.
Research Project Status
: JAX is a research project and not an official Google product, so it may have bugs and rough edges. User feedback and bug reports are encouraged to improve the project.
The provided code snippet demonstrates how JAX can be used to create machine learning models. It defines a simple neural network with a prediction function and a loss function. The
grad
function computes the gradient of the loss function, and
jit
is used to compile these functions for performance.
vmap
is used for vectorizing the gradient calculation, allowing for efficient computation of gradients per example. This showcases JAX's ability to handle typical machine learning tasks with ease, leveraging its advanced automatic differentiation and compilation features.
