Critical Consciousness ��� Spirit of Paulo Friere
Peter Curtis encourages dialogue about democratic learning and teaching practice
About
Why a democratic classroom and an education for democracy?

Dissent is a democratic practice every hour of the day, a definition which opposes the dominant view of democracy as an institution and ritual to be fulfilled on rare occasions.

Peter Curtis is inquiring into the demands and the expectations of teachers in our ���changing��� educational mindscape.
The object of this blog is to encourage dialogue about how learner-centered and emergent-inquiry and integrated approaches affect learning and teaching and the realisation and delivery of a curriculum.

Building on his own research into contemporary principles and approaches of inquiry learning and the demands imposed on imaginative teachers and teaching in this ���changing��� environment, he argues that the inquiry approach to learning and teaching provides the best starting place from which to engage with these concerns of teachers.

He contends that inquiry learning is often misunderstood, and the terms that support the inquiry hypothesis such as constructivism are often misrepresented to teachers by academics and researchers. One misinterpretation alleges that constructivism ignores the needs of students with particular learning needs and of differentiated learning.

In response, teachers who support an inquiry approach must ponder our role in student-centered learning in an inquiry classroom, and therefore to reconsider the questions that Dewey himself posed about experience and judgment and democracy and education.

In addition, we have to be ready to imagine our schools and classrooms outside the realities of a deprived state education system. The wish to provide opportunities for students and teachers alike to become informed and active members of all our communities means encouraging questions and challenging people in authority who are not ���authors���.

The excerpt you've provided from Peter Curtis's work engages deeply with the principles of democratic education and inquiry-based learning, drawing heavily on the ideas of Paulo Freire. Freire's concept of critical consciousness emphasizes the importance of education as a practice of freedom, where both students and teachers are engaged in a constant process of reflection and action (praxis) to challenge and transform their realities.
Curtis advocates for a democratic classroom where dissent is not just tolerated but encouraged as a vital part of the learning process. This aligns with Freire's belief that education should empower individuals to question and challenge oppressive systems. In such a classroom, learning is not just about absorbing information but about engaging in dialogue, questioning, and co-constructing knowledge.
Curtis also touches on the challenges faced by teachers in contemporary education, particularly in relation to the inquiry-based learning approach. He argues that inquiry learning, when misunderstood, can be unfairly criticized, particularly regarding its applicability to students with different learning needs. However, he believes that when properly implemented, inquiry-based learning aligns with democratic education by fostering a student-centered environment where learners are active participants in their own education.
In essence, Curtis's work is a call to reimagine education in a way that prioritizes democratic values, critical thinking, and active participation, echoing Freire's vision of education as a tool for social justice and empowerment. By encouraging dialogue and critical reflection, Curtis seeks to challenge the traditional, hierarchical structures of education and promote a more equitable and dynamic approach to teaching and learning.

The Big Lie about the ���Science of Reading��� (Updated)
February 14, 2019 plthomasedd 10 Comments
While too often inordinately dangerous* for the most vulnerable, social media can be a powerful window into how we think about and judge education. Recently, the reading wars have been once again invigorated; this time driven often by parents and advocates for students with special needs and accompanied by a very familiar refrain, the ���science of reading.���

One problem with public debate about education is that political and public voices often lack experience and expertise in education as well as any sort of historical context.

First, those who have studied the history of education, and specifically the ever-recurring reading wars, know that there has never been a decade in the last 100+ years absent political and public distress about a reading crisis.

However, one doesn���t need a very long memory to recognize that if we currently are (finally?) having a reading crisis, it comes in the wake of almost two decades (nested in a larger four decades of accountability birthed under Ronald Reagan) dedicated to scientifically-based education policy, specifically reading policy driven by the National Reading Panel (NRP).

The NRP was touted as (finally?) a clearing house of high-quality evidence on teaching children to read (although it proved itself to be partisan hokum).

This is all quite fascinating in the context of the current media blitz about the reading crisis and a need (yes, once again) to focus on the science of reading. Concurrent with that media fail is a move within the academia to shift reading away from literacy experts and into the purview of special needs, treating all reading instruction as something like remediation or a learning disability.

For example, I noticed a very odd dynamic on social media: a post on a community Facebook page for advocates of education that was linked to a dyslexia Facebook page promoting this from Mississippi:

The message included dramatic arguments: Mississippi has somehow found the science of reading and is excelling in ways South Carolina refuses to do.

Knowing standardized test scores, and NAEP specifically, well, I was immediately skeptical of these claims.

Here is the short version: In 2017 NAEP data, MS is slightly ahead of SC in 4th-grade reading (both states remain near the bottom and below the national average), but SC is slightly ahead of MS in 8th-grade reading (again, both near the bottom and below the national average):

4th reading 2017

8th reading 2017

Report this ad
While Mississippi is promoting gains (accurately), the data remain clear that high-poverty states tend to score low on standardized testing while more affluent states tend to score higher.

What is extremely important to note is that some traditionally low scoring states have found methods (test-prep, reading programs focused on raising test scores, and grade retention) that increase test scores short term (making for political propaganda), but those gains have proven to be a mirage, disappearing in the span between 3rd/4th- grade tests to 8th-grade tests and then high school (see, for example, research on Florida).

So we sit here with some real problems and questions: Is there a reading crisis in the U.S. and my home state of SC? And if so, is that crisis somehow the result of refusing to implement the science of reading?

Well, first, I need to note that the ���science of reading��� is code for intensive phonics and is intended as an antidote to the current evil in reading, balanced literacy.

Now, consider this: In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a similar event happened when people started shouting about the reading crisis in California spawned by whole language (now, people claim balanced literacy and whole language are the same thing, and thus, equally evil).

Literacy scholar Stephen Krashen, and others, unmasked that round of the reading wars, noting that although CA claimed whole language as the official reading approach of the state, teachers were almost never practicing whole language.

Further, the reading score plummet of those years did correlate with whole language being the official policy, but the causes of those lower scores were a large influx of non-native speakers of English and significant decreases in educational funding (larger classes specifically negatively impacting achievement).

This isn���t particularly simple or compelling but let���s detail why this recent round of the reading wars is way off base:

Standardized tests of reading are only proxies of reading, typically they reduce reading to a series of discrete skills that test designers claim add up to reading. This is at least inadequate, if not misleading. No standardized test measures eagerness and joy for reading, as well; nearly none address critical literacy.
Making raising reading test scores your primary or exclusive goal is actually cheating all students. Period. And this is what many states are doing, including MS.
Achieving test score gains when you are low scoring is much easier that making gains when you are high achieving.
Adopting, implementing, and staying focused on any reading program���these are also very common practices, and completely flawed approaches to literacy. Access to books in the home and choice reading remain the strongest predictors of increased reading and reading achievement.
Ultimately, if we insist on using reading test scores to judge the quality of teaching reading in any state or the country, we must acknowledge that how students are being taught is both almost impossible to identify and completely impossible to characterize as one clear practice (teachers are very likely to shut their doors and do as they please, regardless of policies).
And most important is the fact that standardized test scores of reading are a reflection of a large number of factors, with teaching practices only one (probably small) causal factor.
To that last point, consider this matrix of 2017 NAEP reading scores (4th/8th) along with the poverty in each state, the African American population percentage, and the Hispanic/Latinx population percentage. These data portray a much more complex picture of the reading problem, and resist the distraction that how students are being taught reading is cheating students, who could be saved by the ���science of reading��� (which, by the way, is balanced literacy���o, irony):

The ���science of reading��� mantra is a Big Lie, but it is also a huge and costly distraction from some real problems.

Relatively affluent states still tend to score above average or average on reading tests; relatively poor states tend to score below average on reading tests.

Some states that historically scored low, under the weight of poverty and the consequences of conservative political ideology that refuses to address that poverty, have begun to implement harmful policies to raise test scores (see the magenta highlighting) in the short-term for political points.

It is 2019. There is no reading crisis in the way the ���science of reading��� advocates are claiming.

It is 2019. Balanced literacy is the science of reading, but it is not the most common way teachers are teaching reading because schools are almost exclusively trying to raise scores, not students who are eager, joyful, and critical readers.

It is 2019. Political and public efforts to do anything���often the wrong thing���so no one addresses poverty remain the American Way.

It is 2019. It is still mostly about poverty when people insist it is about reading and reading policy.

The article you shared delves into the contentious debate surrounding the "science of reading," a term that has recently gained significant attention in educational discourse, particularly in relation to the so-called reading crisis in the United States. The author, Paul Thomas, critically examines the resurgence of this debate, which is often driven by political and public voices lacking deep expertise in education.
One of the central arguments in the piece is that the "science of reading" is frequently used as a code for advocating intensive phonics instruction, which is positioned as a corrective to the perceived failures of balanced literacy approaches. However, Thomas argues that this framing is misleading and overlooks the complexities of reading instruction, as well as the socio-economic factors that significantly impact literacy outcomes.
The article highlights several key points:
Historical Context of Reading Wars
: Thomas reminds readers that concerns about a reading crisis are not new. For over a century, there have been recurring debates about the best methods to teach reading, often framed as crises. The current debate is just the latest iteration, influenced by decades of accountability-driven education policies, particularly since the Reagan era.
Misrepresentation of Data
: Thomas critiques the way certain states, like Mississippi, use test score gains to claim success in reading instruction. He argues that these gains are often the result of short-term strategies like test preparation and grade retention, which do not translate into long-term improvements in literacy.
Complexity of Reading Achievement
: The article challenges the oversimplification of reading achievement as merely a reflection of teaching methods. Thomas points out that standardized test scores are influenced by a wide range of factors, including poverty, race, and access to resources, rather than just the instructional approach used in classrooms.
Balanced Literacy vs. Phonics
: The article disputes the notion that balanced literacy is the root cause of reading problems, suggesting instead that balanced literacy, when implemented effectively, is aligned with the science of reading. Thomas argues that the focus on raising test scores has overshadowed the importance of fostering a love of reading and critical literacy skills among students.
Impact of Poverty
: A significant theme in the article is the role of poverty in educational outcomes. Thomas asserts that discussions about reading crises often serve as a distraction from addressing the deeper issue of poverty, which has a profound impact on students' ability to succeed in reading and other areas of education.
In summary, Thomas's article presents a critical view of the current "science of reading" discourse, arguing that it oversimplifies the challenges of reading instruction and distracts from the more pressing issues of poverty and educational inequality. He advocates for a more nuanced understanding of literacy education, one that prioritizes the joy of reading and addresses the broader socio-economic factors that influence student achievement.

What is Pedagogy of the Oppressed and why is it important?
Posted on April 5, 2016 by 21stcenturysocialismblog
By Paddy McColm

Paulo Freire���s Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1968) is a key foundational text in the field of critical pedagogy ��� the synthesis of educational philosophy and critical theory. The main theme of the work comes from the identification of a dichotomous relationship between educators and students that is based on class structure and the perpetuation of capitalist ideology. Although other representations of this dichotomy are offered throughout the work, the primary theme holds to the scenario that the educators are the purveyors of ruling-class ideology ��� that of the Oppressor ��� while the students are in receipt of this knowledge and are at the same time bound by its paradigmatic implications ��� they are the Oppressed class. Freire wrote as an adult educator in Brazil whose projects had been adopted by the government there but then abruptly abandoned after a military coup in 1964 which saw him imprisoned as a traitor and then exiled in Bolivia and then Chile for the next six years, during which time he wrote Education as the Practise of Freedom (1967) and Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1968). This essay will offer an introduction to the key ideas Freire provides in developing sociological theory, and a revolutionary praxis available to all.

The materialist doctrine that men are products of circumstances and upbringing . . . forgets that it is men who change circumstances and that the educator must himself be educated. Hence this doctrine is bound to divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society. The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self-change [Selbstver��nderung] can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionary practice. (Marx, 1845)  

Education of the masses, where it existed, had always been administered by dominant class interests and normally mediated through religious agencies. In the dominant postwar Western consensus and mitigating the threat from Soviet-style social systems, state administered education had become the dominant model. Post-colonial states in Africa, south-east Asia, and South America were under strong international political and economic pressure and thus duly obliged to emulate this framework of education as the reproduction of the worker and consumer ��� capitalism had replaced religion as the dominant ideological discourse, and schools had replaced churches as the infrastructure of mass education (Illich, 1973, p.57-68). Soon after Freire���s publication of Pedagogy of the Oppressed, the ���world-systems��� theory forged by the critical-theorist Wallerstein emerged as an explanation for the global stratification of states into core, peripheral, and semiperipheral economic categories. According to this analysis the interests of the core dominate international economic activity while (broadly speaking) the peripheral states are exploited for their resources and primary industry, while the semiperipheral states are utilised as secondary manufactories ��� each in turn servicing the strata above. Within each the working class are made subordinate to the ruling class who themselves coordinate on an international scale to assure the continuation of their political and economic stability, while the respective working classes are prevented from doing likewise. It follows then that educational doctrine, in an era of globalised markets, would be governed by the ideological fundamentals of the core states. Thus subordinate classes in subordinate states are only educated as far as the economic demands of the core permits ��� to do otherwise beyond the facilitation of a managerial-class agency, would risk the international politico-economic order.

"Pedagogy of the Oppressed" by Paulo Freire
is a seminal work in the field of critical pedagogy, a framework that combines educational philosophy with critical theory to challenge the ways in which education can perpetuate social inequalities. Freire's work is particularly concerned with the dynamics of power in education, where he identifies a fundamental dichotomy between the oppressors (typically the ruling class or dominant ideology) and the oppressed (the students and marginalized groups).
Key Concepts in "Pedagogy of the Oppressed"
Oppressor vs. Oppressed
: Freire describes the traditional educational model as a "banking" concept, where teachers deposit information into passive students. This method reinforces the status quo, keeping the oppressed in their place by limiting their critical thinking and awareness of their social conditions.
Conscientization (Critical Consciousness)
: Freire advocates for a pedagogical approach that awakens critical consciousness in students. This involves teaching students to critically analyze their social reality and understand the forces of oppression, which is the first step toward liberation.
Dialogue and Praxis
: Freire emphasizes the importance of dialogue between educators and students. Rather than being passive recipients of knowledge, students should engage in a dialogic process where both teachers and learners contribute to the learning process. Praxis, or the combination of reflection and action, is central to this approach. By reflecting on their conditions and then taking action to change them, the oppressed can begin to overcome their subjugation.
Education as a Practice of Freedom
: Unlike traditional education that maintains the status quo, Freire's pedagogy views education as a means of liberation. It seeks to empower students to become active participants in their own education and, by extension, in the transformation of society.
Importance of "Pedagogy of the Oppressed"
Challenge to Traditional Education Models
: Freire���s work challenges the traditional hierarchical structure of education, where the teacher holds all the power and the students are mere recipients. He proposes a more egalitarian model that encourages critical thinking and active participation.
Empowerment of Marginalized Groups
: "Pedagogy of the Oppressed" is particularly important for its focus on the empowerment of marginalized and oppressed groups. By promoting critical consciousness, Freire's pedagogy enables these groups to recognize and challenge the forces that oppress them.
Global Relevance
: Freire's ideas have had a significant impact not only in Latin America, where he initially developed them, but around the world. His approach has been influential in various educational and social movements, particularly those aimed at social justice, equality, and the democratization of education.
Influence on Critical Pedagogy
: Freire's work is foundational for the field of critical pedagogy, influencing scholars and educators who seek to use education as a tool for social change. His ideas continue to inspire educational practices that are concerned with equity, social justice, and the empowerment of learners.
In summary, "Pedagogy of the Oppressed" is a crucial text for understanding how education can both oppress and liberate. It is important because it provides a framework for transforming education into a practice of freedom, where students are encouraged to become active agents in their own learning and in the transformation of their societies. Freire's ideas remain relevant today, particularly in discussions about how education can be used to combat social inequality and promote social justice.

Essay: Critical Consciousness and the Role of Education in Social Justice
Introduction
In the landscape of modern education, discussions about methods, pedagogies, and outcomes are more than academic���they are deeply intertwined with social justice. Paulo Freire's concept of critical consciousness, debates on the "science of reading," and the dynamics of democratic learning are essential topics that illuminate the role of education in both perpetuating and challenging societal structures. This essay explores these interconnected themes to argue that education not only reflects but can actively shape societal norms and values towards more equitable outcomes.
Critical Consciousness and Democratic Education
The spirit of Paulo Freire's work, especially as articulated in "Pedagogy of the Oppressed," centers on the development of critical consciousness���where learners become aware of the social, political, and economic contradictions and take action against the oppressive elements of reality. Freire criticized traditional pedagogies that treat students as repositories of knowledge, which he termed the "banking concept of education." Instead, he advocated for a dialogic approach, where education is seen as a practice of freedom, encouraging students to question and transform the world around them.
Peter Curtis's reflections on democratic learning extend Freire's ideas into practical applications within the classroom. By fostering an environment where dissent is not just allowed but encouraged, educators can cultivate a democratic ethos that mirrors the principles of critical pedagogy. This approach does not merely educate students about democracy as a concept but engages them in democratic practices daily, thus preparing them to participate actively and critically in society.
Debunking the "Science of Reading"
The recent resurgence in debates over the "science of reading," particularly fueled by concerns from parents and advocates for students with special needs, illustrates the complexities of educational discourse. Critics like Paul Thomas argue that the so-called science of reading���a term often associated with intensive phonics���oversimplifies the challenges of teaching reading. Thomas contends that this movement distracts from more pressing systemic issues, such as poverty and inequitable access to educational resources.
This critique aligns with Freire's concerns about education that serves the interests of the oppressor rather than the oppressed. By reducing reading to a series of measurable skills assessed through standardized tests, the education system risks neglecting the broader cognitive and emotional development of students. Furthermore, it perpetuates a model of education that privileges compliance and conformity over critical thinking and creativity.
Educational Reform and Global Implications
The implications of these educational debates are not confined to individual classrooms or even national education systems. As Freire's work gained prominence, it influenced educational practices globally, encouraging a reevaluation of how education systems can either replicate or challenge existing power structures. The discussion of the science of reading, similarly, reflects global concerns about literacy and educational standards but must be contextualized within the socio-economic conditions of different regions.
The call for educational reform, therefore, must consider both pedagogical approaches and the broader social conditions that affect education. This includes recognizing the role of poverty, language barriers, and cultural differences in shaping educational outcomes. An education system that truly aims to empower the oppressed must not only adapt its teaching methods but also advocate for social policies that address these underlying issues.
Conclusion
Education is a powerful tool for social change, capable of either perpetuating existing inequalities or challenging them. The development of critical consciousness, a commitment to democratic practices in the classroom, and a critical examination of prevailing educational doctrines are all crucial for creating a more just society. As Freire posited, education must move beyond the transmission of knowledge to become a practice of freedom, where students are empowered to challenge and change their world. In this light, educators, policymakers, and communities must work together to ensure that education serves as a beacon of change and a pillar of democracy.

Transforming schools through Project Based Learning (PBL) .

Main source Thom Markham www.thomarkham.com

I have been reading an article by American Thom Markham on Project Based Learning (PBL) and thought his ideas worth sharing.


Thom Markham PhD
Terms such as Inquiry Learning, Integrated Learning, Related Arts or holistic learning are well known to New Zealand teachers and are all similar to Project Based Learning. Such approaches were once an important in New Zealand Primary Schools but now   at risk since the reforms of the 1980s.  A similar approach for secondary school Is Interdisciplinary Enquiry Learning (IDE).

The 21stC will require a personalisation of learning;cultivation of talent and creativity. It is important for a country like New Zealand for schools to encourage such innovation and creativity but to achieve this will require considerable transformation of the current system.

For teachers who want to follow inquiry based approaches there are an extensive  number of books for progressive educators to select from for guidance and inspiration.

American educationalist Thom Markham is an enthusiast for Project Based Learning (PBL) and believes that the most important innovation schools can implement is high quality project based learning.

An inquiry based curriculum
He provides seven important design principles for teachers to ensure project based learning is of the highest quality.

Unfortunately many teachers still equate ���doing projects��� with something restricted to the afternoon in primary classes that happens after the real work of literacy and numeracy is done. And all too often, in my experience, much of the current inquiry work is little more than superficial ���cut and paste��� resulting in shallow content learning. As well there is little appreciation that both ���learning how to learn��� as well as in depth understanding are both important aspects of such learning.

If inquiry learning is to be done well then the literacy programme must be tailored to provide critical information gathering skills (covering a range of media) and, to a lesser extent, so should the maths programme. For many teachers (and their principals) this will require a change of mind-set.

A quick look at how schools apportion their time will indicate how important such twenty-first century learning is to a school. Do Literacy and numeracy take priority?  Is school success focused almost entirely around literacy and numeracy data?

Markham believes (as do I) that many current examples of PBL are at best mediocre. Students are all too often put in groups and turned loose on a problem presenting their finding as a PowerPoint or display. To be successful a teacher must  teach students how to critically research material ( best done as part of the language programme), introduce students to learning how to learn inquiry  skills,  value deep understanding, thinking and reflection, and also reward such things as ���drive, passion, creativity, empathy and resilience���.  When done well Problem Based Learning provides a worthwhile learning experience.


To complete successful PBL that brings out the best from students Markham suggests teachers move through a considered design process. Teachers who use inquiry learning will be aware of the general approach ��� there seems a general agreement about the inquiry learning process.

 Markham outlines seven design principles that ensure learning will both be more engaging and more powerful.

1.      First identify the challenge. The learning must start with a meaningful doable challenge/question/issue that provides opportunities for innovative/creative thinking.

Markham���s tip.  Design projects that matter. Something that contributes to the community, to  exhibit  to parents, or for a Science, Maths or Technology Fair.
My suggestion.  The various strands of each Learning Areas in the New Zealand Curriculum provide ideas to develop PBL around, or to relate studies to. Even if students generate their own ideas for studies most of their ideas will naturally relate to Learning Areas. Studies need to be rich, real, relevant and rigorous.

2.       Craft the driving questions. Consider the deep understandings you want the children to demonstrate at the end of the study. A few focused questions may be all that is needed to achieve depth of learning. Some call these ���hook��� questions.

Markham���s tip. Make certain the problem is relevant. A good idea is to compare / contrast situation to their own experiences e.g. If studying the 1929 Depression what learning apply to today.

Environmental study

My suggestion. It is important to identify and value students��� prior knowledge before investigating ideas ��� this is useful to evaluate later what students have learnt. Through their research/activities/experiments students construct ���better��� understandings.

3.      Start with the results. This idea is in line with ���backward planning��� approaches. What depth understandings would you like your students��� gain as a result of the study? Keep in mind that a great deal of learning cannot be predicted as new questions ���emerge���.

Markham���s tip. Consider how to encourage reflection and deep thinking to avoid shallow ���cutting and pasting��� Consider how you will go about rewarding innovative thinking. How will you organise your teams of students?

4.      Build in the Assessment. The key to high quality PBL assessment is to view content learning as one of several outcomes that will help students to become more skilful and reflective about their capabilities. Assessment needs to focus on: ���learning how to learn skills��� or competencies (which need to be explicit); personal talents developed;   innovation and creativity; and depth of understanding.

Markham���s tip. Distinguish between on-going formative assessment and any final evaluation

My suggestion.  Ensure that assessment in inquiry learning is seen by students as important as assessment in literacy and numeracy.  The best assessment is, once students have had sufficient experience with PBL, to get them to complete an independent study of their own choice towards the end of the year and to observe what skills they exhibit.

5.      Enrol and Engage. Starting right is the key to success. This includes helping students connect their interests to the question or problem. Also organise teams to be effective by establishing norms for effective teamwork.

Markham���s tip.  Ensure students are involved in refining questions or the project to incorporate student voice.

My suggestion.  As students develop greater appreciation of focused questions greater responsibility can be passed over to them. Science, Maths and Technology Fairs provide excellent motivation.

Bring back John Dewey

6.      Focus on Quality. High quality PBL relies on teams that demonstrate commitment, purpose and results (as expected in high performing industries). To complete successful teamwork students need plenty of time for preparation, drafting and refinement of products, presentations and skills.

Markham���s tip: Facilitate deep thinking.  Teach your students the tools of inquiry and require teams to practice the skills of dialogue, visible thinking, peer evaluation, and critique.

My suggestion. A quick read of final producers will indicate if students have been involved in deep thinking or simply ���cutting and pasting���. Quality on-going formative assessment should avoid this.

7.      End with Mastery. PBL is a non-linear process that begins with divergent thinking, enters a period of emergent problem solving, and ends with converging ideas and products. A good PBL teacher manages the work flow through the chaos of the product ensuring all students gain the opportunity and support necessary to experience a sense of mastery and accomplishment.

Markham���s tip: Reflect.  Take time to review and reflect on the project .Reflect on accomplishments and evaluate the project against agreed criteria. Was the driving question (s) answered? Was the investigation sufficient? Were skills mastered? What questions were raised? The project debrief improves future projects, as well as the teaching cycle of quality improvement.

My suggestion. Gaining skills in PBL, for both teachers and students, is a developmental process. It is a good idea to begin the year with simpler guided studies and extend students involvement as students skills develop until they are able to work independently.

Markham sums up PBL by saying it ���promises more engaging school work and a shift in the culture of learning that should be visible in the form of more satisfied higher performing, and more innovative students���. But, he continues, ���it does require a systematic approach that fully engages students, offers a blend of skills and intellectual challenge, and prompts or awakens a deeper curiosity about life. From that standpoint, PBL is a work in progress.���

My final thoughts. The ideas outlined by Thom Markham align well with the work of creative New Zealand teachers past in present and with the intent of the 2007 New Zealand Curriculum. It provides an alternative to the current imposition of National Standards with its focus on literacy and numeracy narrowing the curriculum in the process. It is important to appreciate the vital role of such areas to be ���reframed��� as ���foundation skills��� that contribute to the success of PBL; it is a matter of emphasis.

It is  also an approach that can be applied from early education to secondary schools where students could work on interdisciplinary enquiry  projects calling on the expertise of subject specialist teachers to assist students to achieve in depth understandings .

In an era where the demands of the 21st century require not just knowledge but the ability to apply that knowledge creatively and collaboratively, traditional methods of education are increasingly seen as inadequate. This realization has led educators worldwide to explore innovative approaches that align better with the needs of modern learners. Among these, Project-Based Learning (PBL) stands out as a particularly powerful tool for transforming education. Drawing on the insights of American educator Thom Markham, this essay will explore how PBL can revitalize schooling by fostering creativity, critical thinking, and a deeper engagement with learning.
The Need for Transformation in Education
The traditional education system, with its emphasis on rote memorization and standardized testing, has long been criticized for failing to prepare students for the complexities of the real world. In many cases, education has become a process of "doing school" rather than engaging in meaningful learning. This issue is particularly acute in the context of global challenges that demand innovative solutions and a workforce capable of thinking critically and creatively.
In New Zealand, as in many other countries, the educational reforms of the 1980s shifted the focus towards literacy and numeracy at the expense of more holistic, inquiry-based approaches. However, as Markham and other educational thinkers argue, the 21st century requires a personalization of learning that cultivates individual talents and creativity. Project-Based Learning offers a promising approach to meet these needs by transforming the way students engage with content and each other.
What is Project-Based Learning?
Project-Based Learning is an instructional approach where students gain knowledge and skills by working for an extended period on a project that engages them in solving a real-world problem or answering a complex question. Unlike traditional projects that might be seen as supplementary or afterthoughts to the "real" curriculum, PBL integrates these projects into the core of the educational experience, making them central to the learning process.
Markham emphasizes that for PBL to be effective, it must be more than just students working on projects. The projects must be carefully designed to ensure they are challenging, relevant, and capable of fostering deep learning. This requires a shift in the teacher's role from a disseminator of knowledge to a facilitator of learning, guiding students as they navigate the complexities of their projects.
Seven Design Principles for Effective PBL
Markham outlines seven key design principles that are essential for high-quality PBL. These principles ensure that the learning experience is not only engaging but also rigorous and meaningful.
Identify the Challenge
: Learning should begin with a meaningful, doable challenge or question that prompts innovative thinking. Projects should matter to students and contribute to their community, providing a real sense of purpose.
Craft the Driving Questions
: The core of any PBL experience is the driving question, which should be deeply engaging and relevant to the students' lives. These questions guide the inquiry and ensure that learning is focused and purposeful.
Start with the Results
: Effective PBL requires backward planning���starting with the desired learning outcomes and designing the project to achieve those outcomes. This approach helps ensure that students are not just busy with tasks but are engaged in meaningful learning.
Build in the Assessment
: Assessment in PBL should go beyond traditional content mastery to include skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration. Ongoing formative assessment is crucial to guide students' progress and ensure deep learning.
Enrol and Engage
: Getting students engaged from the start is critical. This involves connecting the project to students' interests and ensuring that they have a voice in shaping the inquiry process.
Focus on Quality
: High-quality PBL demands commitment and rigor. Students must be given time to refine their work and develop high-level skills in inquiry, dialogue, and critique.
End with Mastery
: PBL is a non-linear process that often begins with divergent thinking and ends with converging ideas and products. The goal is to ensure that all students experience a sense of mastery and accomplishment by the project's conclusion.
Challenges and Opportunities
Implementing PBL requires significant changes in how schools operate and how teachers approach their work. It demands a shift in mindset from seeing projects as add-ons to viewing them as integral to the learning process. This can be challenging in systems where literacy and numeracy dominate the curriculum, and where success is often measured by standardized test scores.
However, the potential benefits of PBL are substantial. When done well, it can lead to more engaged, motivated, and higher-performing students who are better prepared for the challenges of the 21st century. PBL aligns well with the goals of modern education systems, including those in New Zealand, which emphasize creativity, critical thinking, and the development of lifelong learning skills.
Conclusion
Project-Based Learning offers a powerful way to transform education, making it more relevant, engaging, and effective in preparing students for the future. By following the design principles outlined by Thom Markham, educators can ensure that PBL is not just a superficial activity but a rigorous and meaningful learning experience. As education systems around the world continue to evolve, PBL stands out as a promising approach to fostering the skills and mindsets that students need to succeed in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.

Junk Collector Learning: A Vision for Transformative Education
Introduction
In an era where education must increasingly adapt to the complex and interconnected challenges of the modern world, innovative ideas are crucial. One such idea is "Junk Collector Learning," a unique and imaginative approach that combines environmental education with hands-on learning. By transforming traditional school spaces into dynamic, multi-environment learning ecosystems���such as a cattail swamp on the roof, a rainforest generator on the main floor, and a kelp forest in the basement���this concept not only enriches the educational experience but also encourages sustainability, creativity, and critical thinking. This essay explores the potential of Junk Collector Learning to revolutionize how students engage with their education and the world around them.
The Concept of Junk Collector Learning
Junk Collector Learning is an innovative educational model that integrates natural ecosystems and environmental stewardship directly into the physical structure of schools. The idea involves creating distinct ecological zones within a school building, each serving as a learning environment where students can engage with nature, explore scientific concepts, and develop practical skills.
Cattail Swamp on the Roof
: The rooftop cattail swamp serves as an urban wetland, offering students a unique opportunity to study aquatic ecosystems, water filtration processes, and the role of wetlands in biodiversity conservation. This space would not only be a living laboratory but also a place for students to engage in environmental stewardship by maintaining the swamp and observing its seasonal changes.
Rainforest Generator on the Main Floor
: On the main floor, a rainforest generator replicates the dense, vibrant environment of a tropical rainforest. This space could be used to study ecology, botany, and the interdependence of species within an ecosystem. It would also serve as a dramatic contrast to the urban environment outside, inspiring students to think about the importance of preserving such ecosystems globally.
Kelp Forest in the Basement
: The basement kelp forest introduces students to marine biology and the vital role of kelp forests in coastal ecosystems. This underwater environment would allow for the exploration of oceanic life, marine conservation, and the impact of human activities on aquatic ecosystems.
Mnemonic Treasure Chests and Triturated Centrifugal Sorting
Beyond the ecological aspects, Junk Collector Learning incorporates innovative methods for collecting and processing materials to enhance learning. Students would engage in collecting "trinkets" or artifacts from their environment���natural or man-made��� to create mnemonic treasure chests. These chests would serve as personal repositories of knowledge, where each item represents a key concept or lesson learned. This tactile and visual approach to learning would help students retain information more effectively by associating it with tangible objects.
Additionally, the concept includes "triturated centrifugal sorting," a process by which collected materials are broken down and sorted for recycling or repurposing. This hands-on activity would teach students about the principles of waste management, recycling, and the lifecycle of materials. By participating in this process, students would learn valuable lessons about sustainability, resource conservation, and the environmental impact of human activities.
Educational Benefits of Junk Collector Learning
Engagement and Curiosity
: Junk Collector Learning transforms the school into a living, breathing environment where curiosity is nurtured. Students are more likely to engage deeply with their studies when learning takes place in such dynamic, interactive settings. The variety of ecosystems within the school would provide endless opportunities for inquiry-based learning.
Hands-On, Experiential Learning
: This model emphasizes learning by doing, which is crucial for developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Whether maintaining the cattail swamp, studying the rainforest, or sorting recyclables, students gain practical experience that reinforces classroom lessons.
Environmental Stewardship
: By incorporating real-world environmental challenges into the curriculum, Junk Collector Learning fosters a sense of responsibility and stewardship. Students learn to care for their immediate environment and understand the broader implications of environmental conservation.
Integration Across Disciplines
: This approach naturally integrates various subjects���science, art, mathematics, social studies���into a cohesive learning experience. For example, studying the cattail swamp might involve biology (understanding plant life), chemistry (water quality testing), and art (documenting observations through drawing).
Creativity and Innovation
: The use of mnemonic treasure chests and triturated centrifugal sorting encourages creativity and innovation. Students are not just passive recipients of knowledge but active participants in their learning journey, finding new ways to express and apply what they have learned.
Challenges and Considerations
While Junk Collector Learning presents an exciting vision, its implementation would require careful planning and resources. Schools would need to invest in the infrastructure to create and maintain these ecosystems, and teachers would require training to effectively integrate these environments into their curricula. Additionally, there would be logistical challenges, such as ensuring the safety and sustainability of these spaces over time.
However, the potential benefits far outweigh these challenges. By reimagining the physical space of schools and integrating learning with environmental stewardship, Junk Collector Learning has the power to transform education and prepare students for the complexities of the 21st century.
Conclusion
Junk Collector Learning represents a bold new approach to education, one that merges environmental education with experiential learning in a way that is both innovative and deeply engaging. By transforming schools into ecosystems where students can explore, create, and learn through hands-on experiences, this model fosters a deeper connection to the natural world and a stronger sense of responsibility for its preservation. In doing so, it not only enriches the educational experience but also prepares students to become thoughtful, innovative, and environmentally conscious citizens of the future.

Sardonic Review: The Educational Circus of Junk Collector Learning and Its Kindred Concepts
Introduction
Ah, education in the 21st century���an endless parade of buzzwords, rehashed theories, and grandiose ideas about how to rescue the next generation from the depths of ignorance. Enter the latest spectacle: Junk Collector Learning, a wild concoction of cattail swamps on rooftops, rainforest generators in school lobbies, and kelp forests in basements. It���s like someone took a mad scientist���s blueprint for a nature-themed amusement park and thought, ���Yes, this is the future of education!��� And if that weren���t enough, let���s sprinkle in some mnemonic treasure chests and triturated centrifugal sorting for good measure. Because what better way to learn than by turning our schools into mini recycling centers?
But before we drown in our cattail-infested eco-utopia, let���s not forget the intellectual heavyweights who have paved the way for such innovative nonsense. Paulo Freire���s
Pedagogy of the Oppressed
told us that education should be a liberating force, awakening the oppressed masses to their societal chains. Meanwhile, the ���science of reading��� debate wages on, pitting phonics drill sergeants against those who think maybe, just maybe, learning to read should involve some joy and comprehension. And in the midst of it all, we have Project-Based Learning (PBL), which tries valiantly to make students care about learning by throwing them into group projects and hoping they don���t just end up hating each other.
So, how do all these topics connect? Let���s wade through the cattails and find out.
The Deep and Tangled Roots of Education Ideals
At first glance, Junk Collector Learning,
Pedagogy of the Oppressed
, the ���science of reading��� wars, and Project-Based Learning seem like they belong to different planets in the educational galaxy. But dig a little deeper, and you���ll find that they���re all tangled in the same messy roots: the persistent belief that education should be more than rote learning, more than memorization���it should be an experience, a journey, a transformative process.
Freire, bless his revolutionary heart, argued that education should free us from oppression. Junk Collector Learning might claim to do just that, though with a bit more flair���after all, who wouldn���t feel liberated sorting through triturated recyclables in a kelp forest? But here���s the rub: while Freire���s ideas were about dismantling societal structures, Junk Collector Learning seems more about distracting students with shiny objects and hoping they accidentally learn something about ecosystems and waste management along the way.
Then there���s the ���science of reading��� debate, which, like Freire���s ideas, is all about how we think students should learn best. Should we focus on phonics and drill those letter sounds until they beg for mercy? Or should we let them immerse themselves in stories and discover the joys of reading organically? Junk Collector Learning, with its emphasis on mnemonic treasure chests, seems to lean towards the latter���though one might wonder if the mnemonic trinkets are just a fancy way of saying, ���Look, we���re doing something innovative!��� when it���s really just another layer of distraction.
Project-Based Learning is perhaps the most closely aligned with Junk Collector Learning. Both aim to engage students in hands-on, inquiry-based experiences that supposedly build deeper understanding and critical thinking. But here���s where the sardonic twist comes in: while PBL at least tries to anchor itself in real-world problem-solving, Junk Collector Learning seems to revel in its own absurdity. A cattail swamp on the roof? Really? Is this preparing students for the challenges of tomorrow or just giving them a crash course in why over-the-top educational experiments often flop?
A Sardonic Critique: When Education Jumps the Shark
Now, don���t get me wrong���innovation in education is crucial. The world doesn���t need another generation of factory-model students who can regurgitate facts but can���t think critically. But there���s a fine line between innovative and ridiculous, and Junk Collector Learning might just be doing the cha-cha right over that line.
The cattail swamp, rainforest generator, and kelp forest sound like they were dreamt up by someone who spent a little too much time binging nature documentaries. Sure, these environments could be immersive, but they also run the risk of being expensive, impractical, and ultimately unsustainable. How long before the cattail swamp turns into a mosquito-infested nightmare? What happens when the rainforest generator malfunctions and turns the school lobby into a tropical sweatbox?
And let���s talk about those mnemonic treasure chests and triturated centrifugal sorting. On paper, it sounds like a clever way to make learning tangible and memorable. But in practice, it could easily devolve into a gimmicky exercise where students spend more time collecting junk than actually learning. The idea that sorting recyclables could somehow become a core educational activity smacks of a desperate attempt to be ���innovative��� without considering whether it���s actually effective.
But perhaps the most damning critique is that Junk Collector Learning, like many well-intentioned educational reforms, risks becoming just another distraction. Instead of focusing on developing critical thinking, literacy, and a genuine understanding of the world, we might be turning education into an elaborate scavenger hunt. The cattail swamp might be fun for a while, but will it really help students navigate the complexities of modern life? Will mnemonic trinkets help them grasp the nuances of literature, history, or science, or will they simply become clutter in the educational landfill?
Conclusion: Treading Carefully in the Swamp of Educational Innovation
In the end, Junk Collector Learning, like Freire���s
Pedagogy of the Oppressed
, the ���science of reading��� debate, and Project-Based Learning, reflects a desire to make education more meaningful, more engaging, and more connected to the real world. But there���s a danger in chasing innovation for its own sake. Not every wild idea deserves to be implemented just because it sounds different. The true challenge is finding that delicate balance between innovation and practicality���between engaging students and actually educating them.
So, while the vision of a school teeming with cattail swamps, rainforests, and kelp forests might be an intriguing one, let���s remember that sometimes the best educational experiences come from less extravagant, more thoughtful approaches. After all, when it comes to education, we shouldn���t be collecting junk���we should be cultivating minds.
