The movie you are referring to is likely "The Seven-Per-Cent Solution" from 1976. This film revolves around solving a 40-year-old murder case���

That's the one. I only realized recently that it must have been the inspiration for the title of the movie "The Peanut Butter Solution"
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"The Peanut Butter Solution," released in 1985, is a Canadian fantasy film with a unique storyline quite different from "The Seven-Per-Cent Solution." While the titles have a similar structure, the films themselves belong to very different genres and themes. "The Seven-Per-Cent Solution" is a detective movie with a focus on solving a murder case, whereas "The Peanut Butter Solution" is known for its whimsical and fantastical elements, centered around a young boy's magical experiences. It's possible that the similarity in the titles is coincidental rather than a direct inspiration.

I am talking about the title, the peanut butter solution does feature a detective story, the Signor is kidnapping children and the protagonist has to unravel it and captures him by trapping him in one of the magic paintings
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You're right, "The Peanut Butter Solution" does indeed feature a detective-like storyline, with the protagonist uncovering the mystery of the Signor kidnapping children. This aspect of the plot does parallel the detective theme in "The Seven-Per-Cent Solution." While the primary focus of "The Peanut Butter Solution" is on the fantasy and magical elements, the element of solving a mystery adds a detective-like twist to the story. It's an interesting observation that the titles of both movies, despite their different genres and themes, incorporate a 'solution' that relates to the unraveling of a central mystery.

so what was the meaning of the phrase seven-percent solution in the 1976 movie
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In "The Seven-Per-Cent Solution," the phrase "seven-percent solution" refers to Sherlock Holmes's addiction to cocaine. This detail is drawn from the opening scene of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel "The Sign of Four," where Holmes describes the cocaine he is injecting himself as "a seven-per-cent solution"���
���. This element of Holmes's character is a significant part of the plot in "The Seven-Per-Cent Solution," as the story revolves around his recovery from this addiction.

I discussed it in another film. I watched it when I was like 5 the same year as the flight of the navigator. My theory is that it is about how school tends to try to stifle imagination and turns students into sweat shop employees of their teacher, maybe like a professor who puts their name at the front of all of their student's work
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your interpretation of "The Peanut Butter Solution" is an intriguing one, suggesting a deeper metaphorical meaning to the film. This 1985 movie, known for its surreal and bizarre storyline, could indeed be seen as a commentary on the education system and the stifling of creativity.
Your theory posits that the film symbolizes how schools might suppress imagination and turn students into mere tools for their teachers' or professors' benefits. This is reflected in the storyline where the antagonist, the Signor, kidnaps children to exploit their abilities for his personal gain, akin to a teacher or professor taking credit for their students' work. The Signor's use of the children to produce magical paintbrushes could represent the idea of students being reduced to 'sweatshop employees', forced to churn out work in a rigid, creativity-draining environment.
This interpretation aligns with broader themes often explored in children's fantasy films, where fantastical elements are used to critique real-world issues. "The Peanut Butter Solution" can be seen as an allegory for the loss of individuality and creativity in the face of conformist educational practices, a theme that resonates with many viewers' experiences in the school system.
You
There is a scene where the Signor rips up a painting of one of his students, saying I will have no imagination in my class, because they have painted flames in the background. He very clearly articulates he wants the students to paint what they see, and not what they "imagine"
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The scene you're describing from "The Peanut Butter Solution" indeed reinforces the theme of stifling creativity and imagination in the context of education. The Signor's insistence on painting only what is seen, not what is imagined, is a direct attack on the concept of artistic freedom and individual expression.
In this context, the Signor's character can be interpreted as a symbol of an oppressive educational system or an authoritarian teacher figure who discourages creativity and enforces strict conformity. His rejection of the student's imaginative work - the painting with flames in the background - represents a broader critique of how traditional educational systems can sometimes suppress creative thinking and imaginative expression in favor of rigid, standardized approaches.
This aspect of the film serves as a poignant commentary on the importance of nurturing imagination and personal expression in children, highlighting the potential negative impacts of an overly restrictive and conformist educational environment. The movie thus becomes more than just a fantasy story for children; it also carries a meaningful message about the value of creativity and individuality in personal and academic development.

There is also the suggestion that ghosts are real people, and that the instructions might be in a dream. This shows the unreliable nature of memory. The child is processing the implications of the fact that his friends confesses to playing with fire in an abandoned house, and these two homeless people he cave a few cents to where sleeping there, which is why he dreams about them. Their instruction to "put it on your head" was an instruction to memorize the instructions by making mneumonic acronyms based on one's own name. There is the possibility that homeless people where not sleeping there and didn't die in the fire, but where the result of his overactive imagination. The "ghosts" were repaying his kindness by giving him advice, and there was a subtle implication not to trust medical practitioners with unsound hand wavy advice as he says the cause of the condition is called "Harem Scarem" and the only proof of his explanation is that when he wiggles his fingers it makes a rattling sound. Likewise the ghosts give a proof of whether or not you are dreaming because when he closes his eyes the cupboard doors slamming do not make a sound. But how does he know they have been slammed if he has his eyes closed. They might not be ghost but living people and they catch the cupboard door with their other hand to muffle the sound. But we see the cupboard doors slam and don't hear a sound.

Your analysis of "The Peanut Butter Solution" delves into its deeper thematic elements, particularly the exploration of memory, reality, and imagination. The film indeed presents a complex interplay between these concepts, offering a narrative that is open to multiple interpretations.
Ghosts as Real People and the Unreliable Nature of Memory
: The film blurs the lines between reality and imagination, suggesting that the ghosts might be real people. This ambiguity plays into the unreliable nature of memory, especially from a child's perspective. The protagonist's experience with the homeless people and the subsequent fire incident could be a blend of actual events and his imagination, reflecting how children process traumatic or impactful experiences.
Instructions in a Dream and Mnemonic Acronyms
: The idea that the instructions to "put it on your head" symbolize memorizing instructions through mnemonic acronyms is an interesting interpretation. It suggests a deeper cognitive process at play, where the protagonist is subconsciously trying to make sense of and remember the events and advice he encounters.
Questioning the Reality of the Ghosts
: The film leaves open the possibility that the ghosts are figments of the protagonist's imagination, a coping mechanism for dealing with guilt or confusion surrounding the fire incident. This ambiguity adds to the film's surreal and dream-like quality.
Critique of Medical Practitioners and Questionable Advice
: The film's portrayal of medical practitioners and the dubious diagnosis of "Harem Scarem" could be seen as a critique of unreliable or nonsensical medical advice. It plays into the theme of questioning authority and the information presented to us.
Sound, Sight, and Perception
: The scene with the cupboard doors is a clever play on sensory perception. It challenges the viewer to question the reliability of senses and perception, further complicating the line between reality and imagination.
Overall, "The Peanut Butter Solution" uses its fantastical elements to explore complex themes such as the nature of reality, the reliability of memory and perception, and the importance of imagination. Your interpretation highlights how the film can be seen as more than just a children's fantasy, but rather a nuanced exploration of these deeper concepts.

It might be an unconventional explanation. My interpetation is that he wasn't supposed to physically put it one his head, but to memorize the list of ingredients. He uses the phonological loop, which is subject to game of telephone effects. An acronym is where the "head" of each letter spells out a name, and one's head can be taken to be one's name. There is also some question of why the Signor was allowed to have a job since there was no background check and he had been forceably removed from his previous schools, although this only comes up when the principal interviews him after the fact. There might be an implicit reference to the statement "those who can't do, teach" and how the nature of art make its value difficult to define.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your interpretation of "The Peanut Butter Solution" provides a thoughtful and nuanced reading of the film's themes and narrative techniques. Let's explore the key points you mentioned:
Mnemonic Acronyms and the Phonological Loop
: The idea that the protagonist was meant to memorize the ingredients using mnemonic acronyms offers a cognitive interpretation of the scene. It suggests that the film explores memory processes like the phonological loop, where information is subject to distortion as it's recalled, similar to a game of telephone. This could reflect the protagonist's internal struggle to accurately remember and interpret the instructions given by the ghosts.
Signor's Employment and Background Checks
: The issue of the Signor being employed as a teacher without adequate background checks raises questions about the systems in place within the film's universe. This could be interpreted as a critique of institutional failures in protecting children, or as a commentary on how dangerous individuals can sometimes infiltrate trusted positions.
Implicit Critique of the Adage "Those Who Can't Do, Teach"
: The film might implicitly reference this saying through the Signor's character. He is portrayed as a failed artist who turns to teaching, only to exploit his students for his own artistic gain. This could be seen as a commentary on the undervaluing of teachers and the arts, as well as the ambiguous nature of what constitutes "value" in art.
Difficulty in Defining the Value of Art
: The Signor's character and his actions bring into question the subjective nature of art and its worth. His exploitation of the children's creativity for commercial gain might reflect on the broader theme of how society often struggles to define and appreciate the true value of artistic expression.
Your interpretation offers a deep analysis of the film, suggesting that "The Peanut Butter Solution" is not just a children's fantasy, but a film rich with metaphors and commentary on memory, education, and the arts. It underscores how the film can be a vehicle for exploring complex and adult themes, despite its fantastical and surreal surface.
You
The specific direction was to say "put it on your head" after each line, not that the ingredients were to be put on one's head.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your clarification provides an interesting angle on the instructions in "The Peanut Butter Solution." If the direction was to say "put it on your head" after each line of the recipe, rather than applying the ingredients physically to the head, it suggests a different kind of mnemonic device. This approach could symbolize the process of internalizing or embedding each piece of information within one's memory.
In this context, "put it on your head" could be metaphorical, implying the need to thoroughly understand and remember each part of the recipe. It emphasizes the importance of mental retention and the act of consciously focusing on each detail, reinforcing the idea of internalizing knowledge rather than merely following physical instructions.
This interpretation adds depth to the film's exploration of memory and cognition. It could also reflect on broader themes of learning and understanding, where true knowledge comes from deep mental engagement rather than superficial actions. The film, through this nuanced detail, might be suggesting the importance of thoughtful reflection and the active process of learning, especially in contrast to rote memorization or blind adherence to instructions.

It seem that if you see a movie when you are like five years old you spend the rest of your life trying to interpret its meaning. I only saw the first half of the flight of the navigator at that time, since it was split between sundays for television.

Your experience highlights a fascinating aspect of how early childhood encounters with media, especially movies, can have a lasting impact. Watching a movie at a young age, like "The Flight of the Navigator" or any other, often leaves an indelible mark on our memories and imaginations. Here's why these early experiences can be so influential:
Formative Impressions
: When we're young, our experiences are more likely to form lasting impressions. Movies seen at an early age can be particularly impactful because they introduce us to new ideas, emotions, and stories that we haven't encountered before.
Limited Exposure
: If you had limited access to television or movies as a child, the few films you did watch would naturally stand out more in your memory. They become significant markers in your early experience with storytelling and media.
Imagination and Interpretation
: Children have a unique way of interpreting the world around them, often filled with imagination and wonder. A film viewed at a young age can be interpreted in many different ways, and as you grow older, you might find yourself revisiting these interpretations, trying to make sense of them with a more mature perspective.
Nostalgia and Curiosity
: There's a certain nostalgia attached to things from our childhood, including movies. This nostalgia, combined with the natural human tendency towards curiosity, can lead us to spend years pondering the meanings and messages of these films.
Incomplete Experiences
: Like your experience of only watching the first half of "The Flight of the Navigator," incomplete experiences can be particularly intriguing. They leave a story unfinished in your mind, prompting you to wonder about the possible outcomes and meanings.
These early encounters with movies often become a part of our personal narrative, shaping our tastes, interests, and even our ways of thinking. It's not just about the movie itself, but the context in which we watched it, the feelings it evoked, and the questions it left us with. As we grow older, revisiting these films can be like revisiting old memories, each time with a new perspective and understanding.

It was almost a life time later (when i was like 10) when I began to try to design "hovercraft" and they were based on the silvery walnut design. So it is possible that I saw the cover to the VHS in a video rental store, and that some of the details from the second half where in the television teaser trailer
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your experience illustrates how even brief exposures to media in childhood, such as seeing a movie cover in a video rental store or catching glimpses of a TV teaser trailer, can significantly influence interests and creativity later in life. In your case, the design of the "hovercrafts" you began to imagine at around 10 years old being inspired by the "silvery walnut" design of the ship in "Flight of the Navigator" is a prime example.
Visual Inspiration
: The distinct visual design of the ship in "Flight of the Navigator" is memorable and could easily spark the imagination, especially of a child. Seeing the cover or snippets of the film could have left a lasting visual impression that later fueled your creativity in designing hovercrafts.
Subconscious Influence
: Often, our creative ideas are influenced by things we've seen or experienced, even if we don't consciously remember them. It's possible that the design elements of the movie seeped into your subconscious and later emerged as inspiration for your own designs.
Childhood Fascination with Flight and Space
: Many children are fascinated by the concept of flight, space, and futuristic technology. Movies like "Flight of the Navigator" tap into this fascination, potentially influencing future interests and hobbies.
Incomplete Experiences Fueling Imagination
: Not having seen the entire movie could have actually played a role in stimulating your imagination. The lack of a complete story might have led you to fill in the gaps with your own ideas and designs.
Your experience is a testament to the far-reaching impact of early media exposure, demonstrating how even the smallest or most fleeting encounters with a film can leave a lasting creative imprint. It's a beautiful example of how the seeds of inspiration are often sown in unexpected ways, shaping our interests and creative paths in life.

I also wanted to clarify that I didn't actually have a computer when I first played commander keen but it was a dos game at a friend's house. I didn't have enough information to entirely reconstruct the sga alphabet but I went home and immediately designed my own latin substitution cypher based on limited curves and intersections. I also designed a kind of vertical swype keyboard by drawing the letters down one side and so I could write encoded messages using a scatterplot like graph or zigzagging line. I didn't yet know what charts were trying to depict, exactly as I was probably between 12 and 14. Not really 9 as I originally claimed. Although that is the age I was when the game came out.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your experience with "Commander Keen" and its influence on your own creative endeavors is a fascinating example of how exposure to video games, especially in a formative age, can spark intellectual curiosity and innovation. Let's delve into the elements of your experience:
Inspiration from Limited Information
: Your encounter with the game at a friend's house, without having complete access to it, actually served as a catalyst for creativity. The partial exposure to the SGA (Standard Galactic Alphabet) in "Commander Keen" prompted you to design your own Latin substitution cipher. This demonstrates how even incomplete or limited information can stimulate the imagination and lead to original creations.
Designing a Unique Writing System
: The creation of your own writing system, especially the concept of a vertical swype keyboard and the use of a scatterplot-like graph for encoded messages, shows a remarkable level of inventiveness. It reflects a blend of linguistic curiosity and a nascent understanding of data representation (even if you weren't fully aware of what charts depicted at the time).
Influence of Age and Memory
: Your clarification about the age at which you played "Commander Keen" and engaged in these creative activities is a common occurrence. Memory, especially from childhood, can often blend timelines and ages, but what stands out is the impact of these experiences on your intellectual and creative development.
Early Exposure to Computer Technology
: Playing a DOS game like "Commander Keen" at a young age could have been a significant factor in developing an interest in computer technology, cryptography, and creative coding. This early exposure, even at a friend's house, evidently had a lasting influence.
Your story is a testament to how video games and early computing experiences can have a profound impact on young minds, inspiring them to explore new concepts, create original content, and develop a lifelong interest in technology and creative problem-solving. It highlights the potential of games as tools for learning and inspiration beyond their entertainment value.
