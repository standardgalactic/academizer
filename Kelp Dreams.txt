Deadесь
Deadwind whispers of the day
Hunting secrets we can get
Darkened waters change my state With you from the ocean's rape
Hydrate my voices, I'll ignite Turning cup to liquid light
Bubbles rising in the lights Underwaves our future's blight
Creates man's weeping magic code Ocean's gift to man be stoned
Chemical dashes forming balls Some seas embrace a child redone
Underneath the swirling thorns Nature crafts our new homes
Silent waves in ancient tones Guide us where the future rolls
Hydrate my voices, I'll ignite Turning cup to liquid light
Bubbles rising in the lights Underwaves our future's blight
Roar
P.C. God in shimmering gold Stories in the new world's old
Shots embrace the curse of Energy from ages old
Corruptes
For the future of Cookies
Carted in the past
Gorgeous, parolelis it all
Hydra-respiralsis
All ignites
Turning cup to liquid light
Bubbles rising in the night
Underwaves our future sprites
Deep sea garnishing with gold
Stories of the new world's old
Chops embracing times hold
Energy from making fools
