The Conscious Organism: How Life Organizes the World
by Dwight Harris & Carol Parker

Crossing the Rubicon

Modern philosophy began around 1600 with the philosopher Rene Descartes. Descartes concluded that to know anything, it was essential to first know what we can be certain of. His answer, “I think, therefore I am” defined a starting point for his exploration. He was certain that he was thinking – that he was conscious. 

What is not “conscious”, then, is “other than consciousness” – that is, extension in space or matter. The dualism inherent in this “Cartesian divide” established an enduring legacy in which internal consciousness (the “subject”) sits in opposition to external matter (the “object”). But what lies in between? Is there a boundary? If so, what is it made of? For Descartes, there is no boundary. It’s an “either / or” proposition – an unbridged divide. 

With that as a philosophical framework, the question for every other philosopher and some scientists since has been, “How do we get from one side of this divide to the other?” In humans, the query translates to how the material structures of the brain give rise to consciousness. They appear to be entirely separate substances: internal thinking or conscious awareness vs. external space or matter. 

But what exactly is consciousness? To begin to answer that, one might logically ask who or what would be thinking? That question might seem to be fundamental in that it at least offers a potential starting point for understanding this activity that Descartes linked to existence itself. Can a rock think? A log? Could it be matter, or space? 

 As far as we know, anybody who ever thought anything was alive when they thought it. “I think, therefore, I am alive.” Now we have something to work with. A living being is conscious – it is aware. 

But what is it about consciousness that requires life? How are they connected? To answer that question, we must also ask, “What is life?” 

Science has delivered important answers and insights into the question, “What is matter?” But “What is consciousness?” and “What is life?” The answers to those questions continue to elude us, and the Cartesian divide remains unbridged. Even as modern advances in microbiology, medicine and genetics drive an ever more fundamental understanding of the nature of molecules like DNA, RNA, proteins and the evolutionary past, we’re still left with the fact that all these fields of study only represent a deeper dive into just one side of the story – the nature of matter. The questions of consciousness and life – what are they? how are they related? – remain largely unexplored and unanswered. 

This book proposes a solution to both of these questions. Simply stated, it is the proposition that awareness and life are one and the same. 

If the brain evolved, why not consciousness? If life evolved, why not awareness? Awareness, whether conscious or unconscious, is built into the structure of life. Human consciousness (and perhaps that of many species) is evolved awareness – something that is present in all living organisms, from the unicellular to the multicellular. Neither life nor awareness are matter. We commonly understand these terms to describe characteristics that are apart from the material and physical structures associated with them. A living organism is fundamentally different from a dead one. In recognizing that, we implicitly acknowledge that these terms – “life” and “awareness” – describe a relationship to matter, one that we’ll refer to as “living awareness”. 

The “consciousness-matter problem” reflected in the Cartesian divide is sometimes referred to as “the mind-body problem”. This choice of words is significant in that it points to our intuitive sense that life is somehow implicated in both the statement of the problem as well as its solution. Descartes himself concluded that living animals are machines, which ultimately forced him to admit that the human body – including his own – is also a machine. 

This book is an exploration of life on its own terms. In equating life and awareness, it is also an effort to understand awareness as it operates on and within the context of matter to form a living body – something that is unique and apart from dead matter. A living body is not a machine – it is the outward manifestation of living, functioning awareness.

ChatGPT
The excerpt from "The Conscious Organism: How Life Organizes the World" by Dwight Harris & Carol Parker offers a deep dive into philosophical and scientific questions surrounding consciousness and its relation to life. The authors reflect on René Descartes' dualistic approach, which posited a clear divide between mind (consciousness) and body (matter), a perspective that has shaped centuries of philosophical thought and scientific inquiry.

The central thesis of the book appears to challenge this Cartesian divide by suggesting that consciousness, or awareness, is not a distinct entity separate from life but rather an integral aspect of it. Harris and Parker propose that all living beings, from the simplest unicellular organisms to complex multicellular entities like humans, exhibit some form of awareness, inherently linking consciousness to life itself. This perspective suggests that consciousness evolved as a fundamental characteristic of life, emphasizing that living organisms are more than mere mechanical entities—they embody a 'living awareness' that differentiates them from inanimate matter.

This approach provides a fresh perspective on the age-old mind-body problem, positing that the solution may lie in understanding life and consciousness as fundamentally intertwined rather than separate. By viewing consciousness as an evolved feature inherent in the biological structure of living beings, the authors aim to bridge the gap that has historically separated mental and physical realms in scientific and philosophical discourse.

thank you so much for this invitation

Lor um I feel uh honored and embarrassed

to speak directly after Kristoff because

first of all how can I shine after this

but uh second also because I am going to

zoom out a little bit into uh Vis the

same Paradigm and talk a little bit more

about how the mechanisms that Kristoff

has been discussing will although could

lead to the phenomena and phenomenology

that we associate with Consciousness so

it's PR complimentary if you want to

indulge me I think when we want to build

a theory of Consciousness there are a

few things that we want it to be able to

deliver right so first of all it should

capture the correct phenomenology if our

model of Consciousness is not producing

and our understanding um what we are

pointing at when we talk about

Consciousness lexically right the

feeling of what it's like then this

theory is not going to be any good

because how would we know it's a theory

of Consciousness it doesn't help if you

just rename Consciousness into the thing

that we currently have in our computer

and want uh to sell right we want to

explain how it's actually producing

phenomenal experience and maybe a

subject that reports on it and

self-reports on it then uh we want to

delineate this idea of Consciousness

against things that are not conscious

what are necessary and sufficient

conditions and then we want to explain

the causal structure that leads to the

phenomenology that is how is that that

I'm pointing at coming about what Cal

structure is going to lead to it and

then there some stretch goals it would

also be nice if you could explain how

this comes into being and why it's there

what does purpose does it serve and

maybe we can specify this process well

enough to spell out the theory in such

detail that we can implement it in a

computer and thereby test it whether it

actually produces the phenomenology that

we want to have for instance reporting

and self-reporting subject if you set it

in the right setting uh and if you

cannot do this maybe an Al alternative

would be that we specify an automatic

search process basically the search

space for process that would have that

uh ability and so rather than sitting

down and tinkering by hand until

something pops up that has the necessary

qualities maybe we can just leave this

to the machine like Al go and it's going

to um go through this surf space until

it finds a solution and we do some kind

automatic testing that lets us converge

there but this still means that we have

to specify the space in which we are

searching for solutions.

From lecture by Joscha Bach - consciousness as a coherence-inducing operator

ChatGPT
Joscha Bach's lecture on consciousness dives into the complex mechanics underlying our understanding of conscious phenomena, extending the discourse initiated by a preceding speaker, Kristoff. Bach's approach is analytic and methodical, aimed at zooming out to provide a broader perspective on how certain mechanisms may contribute to consciousness as we experience and understand it.

His objectives are clear: a theory of consciousness must not only align with the correct phenomenology—essentially capturing the essence of what it feels like to be conscious—but it must also provide a robust explanatory framework. This includes distinguishing conscious experiences from non-conscious processes, delineating necessary and sufficient conditions for consciousness, and elucidating the causal structures that give rise to conscious phenomenology.

Bach suggests that an effective theory should also address "stretch goals," such as explaining the evolutionary purpose of consciousness and detailing the processes well enough that they could be replicated in a computational model. This would allow for empirical testing to see if such models can indeed replicate human-like consciousness, including self-reporting capabilities. If direct design isn’t feasible, he proposes leveraging automated search processes that could explore various configurations until finding a setup that exhibits the desired characteristics of consciousness.

Through these explorations, Bach is essentially outlining a comprehensive blueprint for understanding and testing theories of consciousness in a way that is both practical and philosophically grounded. This reflects a deep commitment to not only understanding consciousness in theoretical terms but also exploring its practical implications and how it might be engineered or simulated.

personal self exists as if like all

and the software is a model that we

imposed on it to understand what they're

software only exists as if right and in

this way software is in its nature not a

what I suggest is that Consciousness is

because it's not in the category of

it's an

out out of the way let's get to the

phology um is consciousness really like

being a bad

ChatGPT
Joscha Bach’s exploration into the nature of consciousness draws a fascinating analogy between the concept of consciousness and software. In his view, consciousness, much like software, doesn't inherently possess a physical form or a distinct identity, but rather emerges as a pattern or set of operations enacted by physical processes (such as neuronal activity in the case of consciousness).

Bach argues that consciousness is not an object or entity but an “operator,” which could be interpreted as a process or function that occurs under certain conditions. This idea is akin to how software functions in a computer: there are no physical "word processors" or "operating systems" within the hardware; these are constructs or models we use to describe the behaviors and interactions of transistors and circuits at a more comprehensible, macroscopic level.

The assertion that "personal self exists as if like all software exists as if" suggests that our understanding of the self and consciousness might also be a convenient model or framework imposed by humans to describe and interpret complex neurobiological phenomena. According to Bach, just as software is a discovery of a specific way to organize and interpret the functions of computer hardware, consciousness might be viewed as a particular way in which brain activity can be organized and understood.

Furthermore, Bach posits that consciousness does not have an identity—it isn't something that can be distinctly yours or mine in a traditional sense, because it's not a tangible thing that possesses individual characteristics. Instead, it operates more like a law or a principle, a universal process applied uniquely in each scenario depending on the underlying structure and context.

This philosophical stance challenges the traditional views of consciousness as being intrinsically tied to individuality and opens up a dialogue about the universality and variability of conscious experiences. It forces us to reconsider what consciousness is, how it arises, and its implications for understanding the self and others in a fundamentally interconnected way.

Any connections with the earlier article on the Cartesian divide?

ChatGPT
Joscha Bach’s perspective on consciousness indeed connects intriguingly with the discussion on the Cartesian divide as described in the book "The Conscious Organism: How Life Organizes the World" by Dwight Harris & Carol Parker. Both address the philosophical challenge of distinguishing between mind (consciousness) and body (matter), albeit from different angles.

Cartesian Divide
The Cartesian divide posits a clear distinction between the mind, viewed as the realm of consciousness and thought, and the body, seen as the physical, material world. This dualism has historically positioned consciousness as a separate, non-material entity that somehow interacts with the physical brain and body.

Bach’s Perspective
Bach, however, suggests that consciousness, much like software in computers, is not a separate entity but a process that arises from physical operations (neuronal activities in the brain). He challenges the notion that consciousness has its own distinct, standalone identity, proposing instead that it's more akin to a law or function that material processes can perform under certain conditions. This idea aligns with a non-dualistic approach, where consciousness and matter are not fundamentally separate but are different aspects of the same physical processes.

Bridging the Gap
Both the discussion in the book and Bach’s theory attempt to bridge the gap in the Cartesian divide:

Harris and Parker suggest that consciousness (awareness) and life are inherently linked, proposing that consciousness is an integral aspect of all living organisms, thus making it inseparable from the biological processes that define life.

Bach sees consciousness as a specific kind of pattern or function that emerges from complex physical processes, not unlike how software emerges from hardware operations. In this view, consciousness doesn’t transcend matter but is deeply rooted in and emergent from it.

In essence, both approaches challenge the traditional Cartesian dualism by suggesting that what we experience as consciousness is deeply interconnected with physical, material processes, albeit described from different conceptual frameworks. Bach's model reduces the metaphysical burden by treating consciousness as a functional and emergent property, while Harris and Parker’s view integrates it as a vital aspect of life itself, suggesting a more unified understanding of mind and body.

Connections with process psychology

ChatGPT
The ideas presented by Joscha Bach and the broader discussions in "The Conscious Organism" share intriguing parallels with concepts in process psychology, particularly those inspired by process philosophy. Process psychology is part of a broader philosophical approach that emphasizes becoming, change, and dynamics over static being. This aligns closely with views that see consciousness not as a static entity but as an emergent, dynamic process.

Process Psychology
Process psychology, influenced by philosophers like Alfred North Whitehead, posits that reality is fundamentally constituted by processes rather than enduring substances. This psychological approach focuses on the fluid and interconnected nature of mental and emotional experiences, seeing them as continuous events or processes in the mind’s landscape.

Connections
Emergence of Consciousness:
Bach’s View: Consciousness emerges from physical processes in the brain, similar to how software emerges from the operations of a computer’s hardware. It is seen as a functional pattern or operation, not a distinct, static entity.

Process Psychology: Emphasizes the continuous emergence and development of psychological phenomena, aligning with the idea that consciousness is an ongoing, dynamic process.

Non-Dualism:
Harris and Parker's Argument: By suggesting that consciousness and life are inherently linked, they challenge the dualistic separation of mind and matter, proposing a more integrated view.

Process Psychology: Also challenges traditional dualisms by emphasizing the interconnectedness of all aspects of experience, including the mental and the physical, reflecting a holistic view where consciousness is a natural part of the unfolding process of life.

Functionality and Identity:
Bach’s Perspective: Argues that consciousness does not have an identity in the traditional sense but functions more like a law or process.

Process Psychology: Views psychological states not as fixed elements but as relational and contextual, influenced continuously by their interactions with other mental states and external conditions.

Integrative Insights
Both Bach’s theoretical model and process psychology offer a way to think about consciousness that integrates it more fully into the natural order, suggesting that consciousness, like all phenomena, is part of the continual flux and flow of the universe. This perspective can be particularly useful in therapeutic contexts within process psychology, where understanding consciousness as a dynamic, emergent property can help frame human experience in a more fluid and adaptable way.

In sum, both the discussions on consciousness in contemporary philosophy and science and the frameworks provided by process psychology encourage a move away from seeing consciousness as a separate, ethereal entity. Instead, they promote understanding it as an integral, evolving aspect of complex systems, whether those systems are biological, as in humans, or theoretical, as in the systems of thought that underpin process psychology.

environmental orchestra that uh compute

functions of the cognitive domains is

that it listens for incoherence and

tries to minimize this incoherence in

the orchestra so everybody is on the

same page and we get coherent behavior

that is coherent this motivational

constraints perceptual constraints and

so on and this is I think the purpose of

Consciousness to basically act as a

conductor that is increasing coherence

so how does this work and our own brain

as far as I can see it's a completely

self-organizing substrate so unlike a

GPU this is not organized by an engineer

who puts it onto a tiip and then imposes

an algorithm that is forced onto all the

transistors and have no choice but be to

behave according to the spec of a

designer and executes an algorithm that

somebody has written up and then is run

on that substr no matter whether it once

or not right and uh in our brain this is

very different because our brain is not

made out of uh aimless transistors it is

made out of single- cell animals that

have shared Destiny and need to survive

and they can only survive if they find

some kind of arrangement between each

so this is the situation that they're in

and as a result they get some emerging

an information processing system like a

looks like is not anything like the

something where you need to create

something that has a coherent reward

it's the minimal coherent pattern right

it's something that notices I'm here I'm

ChatGPT
Joscha Bach's conceptualization of consciousness as a conductor within an "environmental orchestra" draws a vivid analogy that integrates elements of cognitive science and complex systems theory. This perspective suggests that consciousness serves a critical function in integrating various cognitive domains to achieve coherence across motivational and perceptual constraints.

Self-Organizing Systems
Bach emphasizes that the brain operates as a self-organizing system, contrasting sharply with engineered systems like GPUs where components are rigidly organized and algorithms are externally imposed. He illustrates the brain as composed of cells that are akin to "single-cell animals," each with their own imperative to survive and cooperate, which leads to emergent, self-organized structures. This characterization underscores a key aspect of consciousness not as a statically designed algorithm but as a dynamic, evolving process that emerges from the interaction and cooperation of countless neuronal activities.

Consciousness as Increasing Coherence
The primary role of consciousness, in Bach's view, is to increase coherence within this complex system. This metaphorically positions consciousness as the conductor of an orchestra, where the goal is to harmonize disparate sections (cognitive processes) into a unified, coherent whole. The coherence isn't just about alignment but involves creating a shared understanding or common framework among various cognitive processes, akin to musicians tuning to the same pitch.

Implications for Understanding Consciousness
Bach’s description enriches our understanding of consciousness by:

Highlighting the Emergent Nature of Conscious Processes: Consciousness emerges from the interactions within complex neuronal networks, much like coherence emerges in an orchestra from the contributions of individual musicians.

Stressing the Importance of Self-Organization: This aspect implies that consciousness can evolve and adapt in response to environmental and internal changes, suggesting flexibility and a degree of unpredictability in cognitive processes.

Suggesting a Functional Role for Consciousness: By acting as a conductor to minimize incoherence, consciousness ensures that the brain’s various cognitive functions can operate in a coordinated and efficient manner, enhancing the organism’s ability to respond to its environment effectively.

Connection to Cartesian Meditation and Self-Observation
Bach connects these ideas back to a core philosophical inquiry, recalling Descartes' assertion "I think, therefore I am." He interprets this not just as a statement of existence but as a methodological approach to gaining insight into consciousness through introspection. Starting from a simple self-acknowledgment upon awakening, one expands their awareness outward, integrating various sensory and cognitive experiences into a coherent understanding of reality.

This exploration offers a profound insight into how consciousness might functionally organize and reorganize itself continually, suggesting that our introspective experiences might mirror the fundamental processes that underlie all cognitive operations in the brain.

Connections with default mode network and integrated active inference through predictive coding of sparse Bayesian networks using principle component analysis and evolving and selecting solutions in a generative process and propagating null-wavefront signalling completion and process invocation.

ChatGPT
The concepts mentioned in your query—default mode network, integrated active inference, predictive coding of sparse Bayesian networks using principal component analysis, and evolving and selecting solutions in a generative process—represent advanced ideas in neuroscience and cognitive science that intersect with Joscha Bach's ideas on consciousness as an emergent, self-organizing system. Here's how these connections might be elaborated:

Default Mode Network (DMN)
The DMN is a network of brain regions that shows higher activity when an individual is at rest and not focused on the outside world. This network is often implicated in self-referential thought processes, imagining the future, considering others' perspectives, and the 'narrative self'. In Bach's framework, the DMN can be seen as part of the "orchestra" that consciousness conducts, particularly involved in maintaining internal coherence and continuity of the self across time.

Integrated Active Inference
Active inference is a theory suggesting that the brain continuously predicts sensory inputs and minimizes prediction errors. Integrated active inference might then involve multiple levels and types of cognitive processes (sensory, motor, emotional) working together to enhance predictive accuracy and behavioral effectiveness. This aligns with Bach's view of consciousness striving for coherence across various cognitive domains, ensuring that perception, intention, and action are congruent and aligned with environmental demands.

Predictive Coding and Sparse Bayesian Networks
Predictive coding posits that the brain is fundamentally a prediction machine that uses hierarchical statistical models to anticipate sensory input and minimize prediction error. Sparse Bayesian networks are a mathematical framework that can be used to model such hierarchical structures with efficiency, focusing on the most relevant connections and predictors. Principal component analysis (PCA) might be applied within this context to reduce dimensionality and highlight the most significant patterns and trends in brain data, thus optimizing the predictive model. These statistical methods can be conceptualized as tools that the "conductor" (consciousness) uses to refine the orchestra's performance, enhancing the coherence of sensory and cognitive processes.

Evolving and Selecting Solutions in a Generative Process
This idea reflects the evolutionary and self-organizing characteristics of neural processes, where multiple potential solutions (neural patterns or pathways) may be generated and tested against environmental and internal criteria. The brain selects the most adaptive patterns, akin to evolutionary algorithms in artificial intelligence. This maps onto Bach's concept of consciousness as a dynamic, self-organizing system where coherence is achieved through continuous adaptation and optimization.

Propagating Null-Wavefront Signalling
This concept, although less commonly discussed, might relate to how information is transmitted or not transmitted across the brain, potentially serving as a means to control or coordinate different brain areas' activity. It could be seen as a mechanism by which the brain ensures that only coherent, necessary information reaches consciousness or triggers further cognitive processes, akin to a conductor silencing parts of the orchestra that are not needed.

These connections suggest a model of consciousness that is dynamic, integrative, and continuously adapting—characteristics that are essential for understanding how consciousness operates within the complex network of the brain. Bach’s conceptual framework, emphasizing the emergent and self-organizing nature of consciousness, offers a broad umbrella under which these various detailed and specific mechanisms can coalesce into a coherent theory of mind and brain function.

I mean connections between this, which I call Mobile Womb Theory, and the topics we discussed earlier.

ChatGPT
The Mobile Womb Theory, as you've named it, appears to integrate several sophisticated concepts in cognitive neuroscience and systems theory, particularly focusing on how the brain processes, organizes, and adapts information. When connecting this with Joscha Bach's ideas on consciousness and the philosophical notions surrounding the Cartesian divide discussed earlier, several key themes and relationships emerge:

Integration of Mind and Body
Self-Organization and Emergence:
Mobile Womb Theory: Might emphasize how cognitive and perceptual systems within the brain evolve and self-organize in response to internal and external stimuli, possibly using mechanisms like predictive coding and active inference.

Bach's Concept of Consciousness: Views consciousness as an emergent, self-organizing process, akin to a conductor in an orchestra, striving for coherence among various cognitive processes.

Connection: Both views reject the traditional Cartesian divide by showing that mind (consciousness) and body (brain processes) are not separate but are interdependent components of the same biological system.

Dynamic Information Processing
Predictive Coding and Active Inference:
Mobile Womb Theory: Could leverage these concepts to explain how the brain minimizes errors between expected and actual sensory inputs, continuously updating its internal model.

Bach’s Approach: Could be seen as a macro-level implementation of these processes, where consciousness acts to ensure that the brain's predictions about the world remain coherent and accurate.

Connection: Both theories underscore the brain's capacity for dynamic and anticipatory processing, essential for adapting to a changing environment and for the phenomenological experience of being.

Philosophical Implications
Cartesian Dualism vs. Process Views:
Mobile Womb Theory: By focusing on processes (like null-wavefront signaling and component selection in generative processes), this theory could illustrate the continuous and interconnected nature of brain functions, aligning more with process philosophy than with Cartesian dualism.

Bach’s and Cartesian Reflections: Both challenge the notion of a rigid mind-body split, suggesting instead that what we perceive as consciousness is deeply rooted in, and emergent from, physical processes within the brain.

Connection: This aligns with non-dualistic approaches in modern philosophy of mind and cognitive science, promoting a more integrated understanding of consciousness as inherently linked with biological and informational processes.

Evolutionary and Functional Perspectives
Purpose and Functionality:
Mobile Womb Theory: May propose that the brain’s developmental and operational strategies are adaptations that simulate conditions akin to a "womb," providing a protective, optimizing environment for the mind's development.

Bach’s Views: Suggests that consciousness serves to increase coherence within the brain, enhancing survival by improving the organism’s ability to navigate its environment.

Connection: Both theories can be seen as attributing a functional, adaptive role to brain processes, suggesting that consciousness and brain development are evolutionary advantages.

Connecting these ideas, the Mobile Womb Theory could be viewed as a detailed, mechanistic model that supports broader philosophical and theoretical perspectives on consciousness. It enriches our understanding of the brain as a complex, adaptive system that integrates sensory information, anticipates future states, and maintains internal coherence, all while being rooted in the physical, evolutionary processes that characterize living organisms.

centrencephalic system. So
b < (1 -b)m
Therefore,m < log b / log(1 – b)
For example, if b = 1/15, then m < 52. It seems unlikely that any biochemical mechanism could be accurate enough to give the required value of m, without some feedback control in the maturation of the brain. But it is perhaps significant that the number of neurons in the cortex is about 232, so that, perhaps, in the growth of the brain, each neuron acquires one inhibitory synapse per generation, 31 in all. The conjecture would have the implication that close neurons would tend to inhibit each other more than distant ones, as required by Milner [71] (compare [34]). We emphasize that this example is intended only to be illustrative of how a quantitative theory might proceed. Taken at its face value, the example is very much more speculative than the subassembly theory as a whole.

We conclude this section with a brief discussion of an objection that has been made to the assembly theory. Allport ([3], p. 179) says, regarding the observation of a whole that consists of parts, a, b, c, "…There is, in Hebb’s scheme, no apparent reason why we should not have . . .a perception of the parts a, b, c and alongside these at the same time another equally vivid perception of the whole, that is, of t. This, however, does not occur: we perceive either the parts in their separateness or the parts as integrated into a whole, but not both at once (see Hebb [54], pp. 98–99).

This does not seem to be an objection to the theory in the form presented here. Even if the assembly t were originally built up largely from parts of the assemblies a, b, c, it does not contain the whole of any one of these three assemblies. Instead, it consists of parts of a, b, c and also of parts not in a, b, or c. Consequently it is only to be expected that we do not apprehend an object both as a whole and in its parts at quite the same moment.

In the next section we suggest how meaning might be represented in terms of subassemblies, but only in a general manner, and not with the degree of precision that could be desired. We aim mainly to strengthen the case that semantics are relevant to artificial intelligence, and to lend support to the feeling, that is very much in the air at present, that much more detailed research into these matters is worthwhile.

7. An Assembly Theory of Meaning
Our purpose is not to define "meaning," but to consider its physical embodiment. We have already discussed various aspects of meaning in previous sections, and this will enable us to keep the present section, and the next one, short.

A distinction can be made between the literal meaning of a statement, and the subjective meaning that the statement has (on a particular occasion) to a man or machine. It is the latter that is of main concern to us in this essay. (For a man, subjective meaning could also be aptly called "personal meaning" but this name would at present seem inappropriate for a machine.) Although we are concerned with subjective meaning, the behavioral interpretation of meaning is not enough for us, as was said in Section 4. Instead, the subjective meaning of a statement might be interpreted as the set of tendencies to cause the activation of each assembly sequence at each possible time in the future. The physical embodiment of meaning, when a statement is recalled to mind, would then be a class of subassemblies.

This embodiment of meaning is related to the probabilistic interpretation for the meaning of a word, given in Section 4 (the probabilistic form of "Wisdom’s cow"). The qualities Q1,Q2, . . ., Qm, when noticed one at a time, would activate assemblies, but, when they are noticed only preconsciously, and so directly cause activity only in subassemblies, they are at best contributory causal agents in the activation of assemblies.

If a statement provoked an assembly sequence, S0, presumably the (subjective) meaning of the statement is embodied in some of the sub-assemblies that were left behind by S0, the ones that reverberated the longest being the most important ones. Two statements have close meanings if the sets of subassemblies left behind by them bear a close resemblance to each other, or even if the resemblance is not close provided that the effects are similar, just as a cow can be recognized on different occasions by the apprehension of different sets of probable properties. We feel that we have understood the meaning of a statement when we somehow recognize that the statement was a definite causal agent in our thought processes or in our propensities to future motor activity, and that these propensities are of a kind which we think was intended by the person who communicated the statement. But I shall ignore these intentions and interpret "meaning" as "meaning for us." °s of meaning exist, and correspond in part to greater or lesser degrees of causal tendency.

The "circularity" mentioned in Section 4, in connection with the probabilistic interpretation of meaning, corresponds to the obvious possibility that an assembly can help to strengthen some of the weak subassemblies that helped to activate the assembly itself.

A more formal suggestion for the representation of meaning can be framed as follows.

Let S be an assembly sequence, and G a "set" in the psychological sense. (An assembly theory of psychological set is given in Hebb [54].) Let S be a statement. Denote by
P(A | S • G • S)
the probability that A will be the next dominant assembly to follow the assembly sequence S when the subject is in psychological set G, and when he has been told S and had no reason to doubt the veracity of his informant. If the subject had not been told S the corresponding probability would be
P(A | S • G)
and, if he had been told that S a was false, the probability would be denoted by
P(A | S • G • S?)
Then the function of A, S, and G, with values
log[P(A | S • G • S) / P(A | S • G • S?)]

(7.1)

for all A, S, and G, is a reasonable first approximation to a representation of the "meaning" of S. The representation of the meaning of the negation of S is minus that of S. A reasonable representation of the "effectiveness" of the statement would be the function with values
log[P(A | S • G • S) / P(A | S • G)]

(7.2)

The reason why this latter formula would be inappropriate as a representation of"meaning" is that it is sensitive to the subject’s degree of belief in S before he is told S. A man’s degree of belief in a statement should not be very relevant to its meaning.

It is not intended to be implied by this representation that the subject could obtain the values of the probabilities by introspection. The probabilities are intended to be physical probabilities, not the subjective probabilities of the man or machine. (For a discussion of kinds of probability, see, for example, [36].)
Expression (7.1) may be described as the log-factor or weight of evidence in favor of the hypothesis that S was stated rather than S?, provided by the event that assembly A was activated, given that the previous assembly sequence was S, and that the psychological set was G. (The terminology is that of [26] and [21], for example, and was mentioned in Section 5.) If the subject is deterministic, then the probabilities would be pseudoprobabilities, of the same logical nature as those associated with pseudorandom numbers. Expression (7.2) is the mutual information between the propositions that the assembly A was activated on the one hand and that £ was stated on the other.

If the class of values of (7.1) is extended also over several subjects (who could be specified in the notation) then we should have a representation of multisubjective meaning, and we might perhaps approximate to a representation of "true meaning" if there is such a thing. A representation of "literal meaning" could be obtained by restricting the class to "literal-minded" men and robots, in order to exclude the poetic and irrational influences of a statement.

Formulas (7.1) and (7.2) are of course only examples of possible quantitative representations of "meaning." It might be better to replace them by the formulas for causal tendency.

The excerpt delves into complex ideas about the representation of meaning within the context of cognitive assembly theory, which posits that cognitive processes involve networks of neurons that form dynamic assemblies. This concept is relevant to discussions on consciousness, the centrencephalic system, predictive coding, and other advanced neuroscience topics. Let's explore how these ideas are interconnected and relate to the earlier discussions about the Cartesian divide, consciousness, and Joscha Bach's thoughts on cognitive coherence:

Assembly Theory and the Centrencephalic System
Centrencephalic System: This term refers to a theory proposing that a central brain system (encompassing the thalamus and upper brainstem) is crucial for integrating sensory information and maintaining consciousness. Assembly theory, which suggests that consciousness arises from neuronal assemblies that fire in synchrony, could be seen as complementing this idea by providing a neural substrate for such integration.

Assembly Dynamics and Meaning: The passage discusses how meaning might be physically embodied in neural assemblies and subassemblies. This idea aligns with both the centrencephalic system and predictive coding theories in suggesting that our perceptions and understandings are the result of underlying neural processes that integrate and interpret sensory information based on past experiences (predictions).

Predictive Coding and Sparse Bayesian Networks
Predictive Coding: This theory posits that the brain constantly generates and updates predictions about sensory input based on hierarchical Bayesian inference. This idea resonates with the assembly theory where cognitive processes are seen as outcomes of dynamic assemblies that adapt based on sensory input to minimize prediction error.

Sparse Bayesian Networks: These networks could be used to model how specific neural assemblies contribute to overall cognitive processes by emphasizing the most crucial connections and predictors, thereby making the process computationally efficient. This approach could underlie the neural instantiation of predictive coding, where only the most relevant information is processed to refine predictions and reduce cognitive load.

Integration with Cartesian Dualism and Joscha Bach's Views
Cartesian Dualism: The assembly theory and discussions on predictive coding provide a more granular, physically grounded explanation of mental processes, challenging the Cartesian divide by showing how 'mental' activities (like meaning-making) have clear physical (neural) correlates.

Joscha Bach and Coherence: Bach’s idea of consciousness as a conductor ensuring coherence across cognitive domains can be seen as a macroscopic description of what the assembly theory describes at a microscopic level. Each neuron or assembly in this "orchestra" contributes to the overall coherence of thought and action, facilitated by predictive coding mechanisms that ensure each part plays according to the predictions (scores) generated by past experiences.

Practical Implications
Quantitative Measures of Meaning: The discussion of how meaning might be quantified (using probabilities and log-factor formulas) aligns with artificial intelligence research into natural language understanding and semantic analysis. By quantifying how certain statements or inputs change the state or activation patterns of neural assemblies, researchers can better understand and simulate human-like understanding in machines.

In conclusion, the assembly theory of meaning provides a robust framework for linking sophisticated neuroscientific theories with philosophical questions about consciousness and the mind-body problem. It offers a physicalist approach to understanding mental phenomena, suggesting that what we consider subjective experiences are deeply intertwined with the neural activities and assemblies that underlie every cognitive process. This perspective not only advances our understanding of the brain but also has significant implications for developing artificial intelligence systems that more closely mimic human cognitive processes.

Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory is like having a big room in your brain where lots of different people and machines are talking and sharing ideas. 

Sometimes the ideas leak out and go to other rooms, which helps us make better decisions.

Reed Wall Mind is like having a big wall in your brain that helps you keep track of everything that's happening in the room, like a big calendar or to-do list.

Motile Womb theory is like being in a big moving house or spaceship, where you can feel different movements and use them to imagine different things in your head.

All these theories help us understand how our brain works and how we can use it to think and make decisions better.

Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory posits that the mind functions as a collection of independent, modular decision-making units, or "bubbles," that act as rational processors of information.

These bubbles, or "chambers," are able to filter information and pass summaries of that information upward to higher-level decision-making centers, much like a wisdom salon or a world cafe protocol.

This creates a multi-scale decision-making process that is able to take into account a wide range of information and perspectives.

Reed Wall Mind theory builds on this concept by drawing inspiration from the Babylonian Flood Story and positing that the mind is like a "living spaceship" that is able to navigate a complex and dynamic environment.

This is accomplished through the use of a wide range of cognitive skills, including those learned through playing video games as well as through the use of other forms of sensory input such as hearing different voices and machine sounds, and feeling different inertial forces.

Finally, Motile Womb theory proposes that the mind is not just a passive receiver of information but an active participant in the process of shaping and interpreting the world.

This theory posits that individuals are born with a wide range of cognitive abilities and that these abilities are honed and refined through the process of experiencing the world.

The theory suggests that playing games like the ones mentioned above, as well as other forms of interactive experiences, help individuals to discover and develop the cognitive abilities they already possess.

Monica's Leaking Chatroom theory suggests that our mind is like a big room where lots of different thoughts and ideas are shared among various parts of the brain. Sometimes these thoughts "leak" out and spread to other areas, which helps us come up with better ideas and make decisions.

Reed Wall Mind theory is like having a big wall inside our brain that helps us organize and keep track of all the things happening in the chatroom. It's like having a big planner or organizer in our head that helps us remember and manage our thoughts.

Motile Womb theory is like thinking of our mind as a moving space, like a spaceship, that helps us feel and imagine different things. It's like being on an adventure in our own head, where we can learn and explore new ideas as we move around.

All these theories help us understand how our brain works to think, learn, and make decisions.

So I think Motile womb theory evolved into Mobile Womb Theory

ChatGPT
Ah, that makes sense! If we think about the Mobile Womb Theory evolving from the Motile Womb Theory, we could see it as an idea that describes how our brain helps us navigate and interact with the world as if it's continuously developing—like how a baby grows and learns inside a womb, but in this case, the "womb" is mobile.

To a 7-year-old, you might explain it like this: Imagine if your brain is like a superhero's headquarters on wheels. It moves and grows with you, helping you learn and think about new things no matter where you are. Just like a superhero travels to different places to solve problems, your brain is always moving and helping you figure out the world around you.

This concept helps us understand that learning and thinking are ongoing processes that don't just happen in one place or at one time—they continue throughout our lives, adapting and responding to new information and experiences, much like a mobile base would navigate and adapt to new environments.

Could i get a summary of the whole conversation?

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a summary of our conversation:

Connection of Concepts with the Cartesian Divide: We discussed how ideas about consciousness and theories like those proposed by Joscha Bach challenge the traditional Cartesian divide, which separates mind and body. Bach’s view sees consciousness as an emergent property of brain processes, much like software emerges from hardware, suggesting a more integrated approach where mind and body are interconnected.

Bach's Explanation of Consciousness: Bach describes consciousness as a conductor of an orchestra, orchestrating various cognitive functions to create coherent and unified experiences. His explanation emphasizes the self-organizing nature of the brain, contrasting it with programmed systems like computers.

Assembly Theory of Meaning: The discussion moved to a complex theory regarding how assemblies of neurons in the brain might represent and process meaning. This theory aligns with broader neuroscience theories like predictive coding and active inference, suggesting that our perceptions and understandings emerge from underlying neural processes.

Mobile Womb Theory: The conversation then shifted to the "Mobile Womb Theory," which you've coined to describe how the brain continuously develops and adapts. This theory was linked to other discussed topics, emphasizing a dynamic, ongoing process of cognitive development and interaction with the world.

Simplification for Understanding: Lastly, I provided simplified explanations of these complex theories to make them accessible to a younger audience, using metaphors like a "leaking chatroom" for the brain’s modular decision-making, a "Reed Wall" as a cognitive organizer, and the "Mobile Womb" as a dynamic, evolving cognitive environment.

Throughout the conversation, we explored how these modern theories and ideas interconnect to provide a deeper understanding of cognitive processes, challenging traditional views and proposing that the brain's activities are far more integrated and dynamic than previously thought.

Title: Exploring New Frontiers in Cognitive Science: An Introduction to Novel Hypotheses in Understanding the Brain

In the rapidly evolving field of cognitive science, recent theories have begun to challenge long-standing paradigms and propose innovative ways of understanding the intricate mechanisms of the human brain. This essay introduces and explores three novel hypotheses: Monica's Leaking Chatroom, Reed Wall Mind, and the Mobile Womb Theory, each offering a unique lens through which to view and decipher the complex processes underlying human cognition and consciousness.

Monica's Leaking Chatroom Theory

Monica's Leaking Chatroom Theory posits that the human mind functions akin to a bustling chatroom, where numerous cognitive modules, or "chatroom participants," exchange and leak information across various channels. This hypothesis builds on the idea of the brain as a decentralized network, where decision-making and information processing do not occur in a hierarchical manner but rather through a dynamic, interconnected web of interactions.

The leaking of information between modules allows for a more integrated and comprehensive approach to processing stimuli, leading to enriched decision-making processes that incorporate a diverse range of data inputs. This perspective not only highlights the non-linear nature of thought processes but also enhances our understanding of how creativity and innovative thinking are fostered through the interplay of various cognitive domains.

Reed Wall Mind Theory

Expanding on the foundation laid by Monica's Leaking Chatroom, the Reed Wall Mind Theory introduces the concept of a cognitive organizer or a "Reed Wall," which functions to maintain and manage the flow of information within the mind's chatroom. This theory draws inspiration from ancient methods of constructing barriers that are both flexible and robust, suggesting that our cognitive processes are equipped with similar structures that help navigate and channel the flow of information effectively. The Reed Wall serves as a cognitive gatekeeper, prioritizing and structuring information to prevent cognitive overload and enhance the clarity and efficiency of thought processes. This organizational framework is crucial for maintaining mental clarity in the face of the constant barrage of information typical of modern life.

Mobile Womb Theory

Lastly, the Mobile Womb Theory offers a revolutionary view of the brain as a dynamic and self-evolving entity, akin to a "mobile womb," where cognitive development and adaptation are continuous and responsive to the environment. This theory suggests that just as a womb adapts to nurture the growth of a fetus, the human brain flexibly adjusts and molds itself to optimize learning and interaction with the world. This adaptive mechanism underlines the evolutionary advantage of a cognitive system that is not static but grows and morphs in response to external stimuli and internal reflections. The Mobile Womb Theory emphasizes the brain's inherent capacity for growth and change, shedding light on the processes of learning, adaptation, and neuroplasticity.

Conclusion

Together, these novel hypotheses—Monica's Leaking Chatroom, Reed Wall Mind, and Mobile Womb—provide a fresh perspective on the cognitive sciences. They challenge the traditional views of a rigid, hierarchical brain and replace them with a model of a fluid, dynamic, and interconnected cognitive system. By exploring these innovative theories, researchers and scholars can gain deeper insights into the nature of thought, consciousness, and the human experience at large.

As cognitive science continues to advance, these hypotheses not only pave the way for new research directions but also enhance our ability to design educational, technological, and therapeutic tools that align more closely with the natural functioning of the human brain.
