You
So I have a video file, which I think has no audio, but some of the frames are repeated too many times. Which linux tool can help, imagemagic ffmpeg?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
For your needs,
ffmpeg
is a highly suitable tool. It is a powerful command-line utility for processing video and audio files and can be used both to check if your video file has audio and to remove repeated frames.
Checking for Audio in the Video:
To check if your video file has an audio track, you can use
ffmpeg
to analyze the streams in the file. The command would be something like this:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -i your_video_file.mp4
This command doesn't change the file; it only displays information about it. In the output, look for a section that starts with
Stream #...: Audio
. If such a section is present, your file has an audio track.
Removing Repeated Frames:
To remove repeated frames,
ffmpeg
can also be useful. You can use the MPDecimate filter, which is designed to drop similar or duplicate frames. The command might look like this:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -i your_video_file.mp4 -vf mpdecimate,setpts=N/FRAME_RATE/TB output_video.mp4
This command reads your video file, removes frames that are similar to each other, and then adjusts the timing of the frames to maintain a consistent playback speed.
Remember to replace
your_video_file.mp4
and
output_video.mp4
with the appropriate file names for your situation. Also, be aware that processing video in this way can be quite resource-intensive, depending on the size and format of your video file.
You
so this command should shorten the video time correct?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. The command I provided using
ffmpeg
with the
mpdecimate
filter will remove repeated or similar frames and can potentially shorten the video duration. This happens because it drops frames that are deemed unnecessary or redundant, effectively reducing the total number of frames in the video.
The
setpts=N/FRAME_RATE/TB
part of the command adjusts the presentation timestamps of the frames after the decimation process. This is necessary because simply removing frames would disrupt the timing of the video, potentially causing playback issues. By adjusting the timestamps, the video will play smoothly, but with a shorter duration due to the removed frames.
So, if your video has sections where frames are unnecessarily repeated, applying this command should result in a shorter video, with the redundant parts removed. The actual reduction in duration will depend on how many repeated frames there are in the original video.
You
Come up with some potential names for this command or program?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are some creative and descriptive names for a command or program that removes repeated frames from a video:
FramePruner
ClipCondenser
EchoFrameEliminator
ReFrameReducer
FrameStripper
DejaVuDrop
RepeatReaper
FrameFilter
Streamliner
DuplicateDiminisher
These names aim to convey the functionality of the tool - reducing video length by removing unnecessary repeated frames, thus making the video more efficient and streamlined.
You
I'm just going to call it lr for liquid-rescale
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"Liquid-Rescale" (abbreviated as "lr") is a catchy and modern name for a program designed to remove redundant frames from videos. It suggests a fluid and adaptable approach to video processing, emphasizing the tool's capability to reshape and optimize video content efficiently. The term "liquid" implies flexibility and adaptability, while "rescale" directly relates to the idea of adjusting the video's scale or length by removing unnecessary parts. This name positions the tool as both innovative and functional in the realm of video editing.

::foreshorten::ffmpeg -i peripatetic.mp4 -vf mpdecimate,setpts=N/FRAME_RATE/TB patetic.mp4
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
"foreshorten" is a creative and fitting choice for your frame-reducing command. It nicely encapsulates the idea of shortening the video by removing redundant frames, and the use of a distinct, descriptive name like this can make the command more memorable and intuitive for users.
Your command structure:
bash
Copy code
::foreshorten::ffmpeg -i peripatetic.mp4 -vf mpdecimate,setpts=N/FRAME_RATE/TB patetic.mp4
This is a clear and well-formulated command, leveraging
ffmpeg
with the
mpdecimate
filter to reduce repeated frames in
peripatetic.mp4
, and then outputting the shortened video as
patetic.mp4
. The use of
::foreshorten::
as a prefix provides a unique and easily recognizable identifier for the process.
Great choice and implementation!

The error message you're seeing indicates that
ffmpeg
is unable to recognize the 'mpdecimate' filter. This could be due to several reasons:
Version of
ffmpeg
: The 'mpdecimate' filter is not available in all versions of
ffmpeg
. Ensure you are using a version of
ffmpeg
that includes this filter.
Typo or Syntax Error
: Double-check the command for any typos or syntax errors. The filter name should be exactly 'mpdecimate'.
Filter Availability
: In some
ffmpeg
builds, certain filters might not be included. This is common in custom or minimal builds of
ffmpeg
.
Here's what you can do:
Update
ffmpeg
: Make sure you have the latest version of
ffmpeg
installed. You can update
ffmpeg
or install the latest version from the official website or your operating system's package manager.
Check for Filter Support
: You can check if the 'mpdecimate' filter is available in your
ffmpeg
installation by running:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -filters | grep mpdecimate
If the filter is available, it should be listed in the output.
Correct Command Syntax
: Ensure your command syntax is correct. The standard syntax for using the 'mpdecimate' filter is:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf
"mpdecimate,setpts=N/FRAME_RATE/TB"
output.mp4
Replace
input.mp4
and
output.mp4
with your actual input and output file names.
If after these steps the 'mpdecimate' filter is still not recognized, you might need to consider compiling
ffmpeg
from source with the necessary filters included or finding a build that already includes them.

Based on the version information of
ffmpeg
you've provided (version 4.3), it seems that your
ffmpeg
build should generally support the
mpdecimate
filter, as it's a commonly included filter in most standard builds. However, there are a few aspects to consider:
Custom Build Configuration
: Your
ffmpeg
is built with a custom configuration, as indicated by the
--prefix=/home/bonobo/anaconda3
and other specific flags. This custom build may not include all the filters that are typically found in the standard builds of
ffmpeg
.
Anaconda Distribution
: It seems your
ffmpeg
is installed via Anaconda, a popular Python distribution. The Anaconda distribution of
ffmpeg
might not include all the filters found in the standard
ffmpeg
distribution, especially if it's tailored for specific use cases.
Here's what you can do:
Check for Filter Availability
: Run the following command to check if the
mpdecimate
filter is indeed available in your build:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -filters | grep mpdecimate
If
mpdecimate
appears in the output, the filter is included in your build.
Install a Different Build
: If
mpdecimate
is not included in your Anaconda distribution of
ffmpeg
, consider installing a different build. You can obtain
ffmpeg
from the official website or use a package manager like
apt
(for Debian/Ubuntu) or
brew
(for macOS) to install a more standard build.
For Linux (Debian/Ubuntu), you can install
ffmpeg
using:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
Recompile
ffmpeg
: If you need to keep your Anaconda environment and require
mpdecimate
, you might consider compiling
ffmpeg
from source with the necessary filters. This, however, is a more complex route and typically only recommended if you have specific requirements.
Alternative Methods
: If updating or changing your
ffmpeg
installation isn't feasible, you might need to look for alternative methods or tools to remove repeated frames from your video.
You
I just tried it on the mac instead of ubuntu on windows and it seems to be working
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Great to hear that it's working on your Mac! Different operating systems and their respective
ffmpeg
installations can have variations in included features and filters. It's not uncommon for a command to work on one platform but encounter issues on another, especially if
ffmpeg
is installed through different methods or from different sources.
Since it's working on your Mac, you should be able to proceed with processing your video. Just a reminder, the command you're using with
ffmpeg
is designed to remove repeated or similar frames from your video, which can help in shortening and optimizing the video playback.
If you encounter any other issues or have more questions, feel free to ask!
You
I also added this command: ::convertt::ffmpeg -i peripatetic.mkv -codec copy peripatetic.mp4
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your new command
::convertt::
is a straightforward and efficient way to convert a video file from one format to another without re-encoding the content. In your specific command:
bash
Copy code
::convertt::ffmpeg -i peripatetic.mkv -codec copy peripatetic.mp4
Here's what's happening:
Input File (
-i peripatetic.mkv
)
: This specifies the input file,
peripatetic.mkv
, which is the file you're converting.
Codec Copy (
-codec copy
)
: This option tells
ffmpeg
to copy the video and audio streams from the input file to the output file without re-encoding. It's a fast process because it doesn't alter the original quality or content; it simply changes the container format.
Output File (
peripatetic.mp4
)
: The output file will be
peripatetic.mp4
. This is the file in the new format (in this case, MP4).
A few things to note about this command:
Compatibility
: While the codec copy option (
-codec copy
) is fast and preserves the original quality, it's important to ensure that the codecs used in the MKV file are compatible with the MP4 container format. If they are not compatible, you might encounter playback issues or errors.
Metadata and Subtitles
: This command will also copy metadata and subtitles (if any) from the MKV file to the MP4 file. However, compatibility and display of such elements can vary depending on the player and the codecs used.
File Size
: Since there's no re-encoding, the file size of the output will be very similar to the input.
Overall, your command is a good choice for quick format conversion where re-encoding is not necessary or desired.
You
ok we have an issue, it didn't remove any frames because there is a clock running in a taskbar, which means each frame is unique. I might need to crop out the bottom footer it could be ten or twenty pixels tall apparently
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
If there's a continuously changing element like a clock in the taskbar that makes each frame unique,
ffmpeg
's
mpdecimate
filter won't be effective in removing what you perceive as repeated frames. Cropping out the part of the video with the clock before applying the
mpdecimate
filter could be a good solution. Here's how you can do it:
Determine the Crop Parameters
: First, you need to figure out how much of the bottom of the video you want to crop. This will depend on the resolution of your video and the size of the taskbar. If it's about ten or twenty pixels tall, as you mentioned, you can start with that.
Cropping the Video
: Use the following
ffmpeg
command to crop the video:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf
"crop=in_w:in_h-20"
-c:a copy cropped_output.mp4
This command crops 20 pixels from the bottom of the video.
in_w
and
in_h
represent the input width and height, respectively. Adjust the number
20
to match the height of the taskbar you want to remove.
-c:a copy
copies the audio without re-encoding.
Apply Frame Reduction
: After cropping, you can then apply the
mpdecimate
filter to remove repeated frames:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -i cropped_output.mp4 -vf
"mpdecimate,setpts=N/FRAME_RATE/TB"
final_output.mp4
This two-step process first removes the part of the video that makes each frame unique (the clock) and then eliminates the repeated frames. Remember to replace
input.mp4
,
cropped_output.mp4
, and
final_output.mp4
with your actual file names.

[out#0/mp4 @ 0x600001a143c0] Output file does not contain any stream
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The error message "Output file does not contain any stream" indicates that
ffmpeg
did not process any video or audio streams for the output file. This can happen due to various reasons, such as an incorrect filter syntax or missing codec specifications. Let's troubleshoot this:
Check Filter Syntax
: Ensure the filter syntax is correct. For cropping and then applying the
mpdecimate
filter, the command should be something like:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf
"crop=in_w:in_h-20,mpdecimate,setpts=N/FRAME_RATE/TB"
-c:a copy final_output.mp4
In this command:
crop=in_w:in_h-20
is the cropping filter (adjust
20
to the height of the taskbar you want to remove).
mpdecimate,setpts=N/FRAME_RATE/TB
is for removing redundant frames and adjusting the timestamps.
-c:a copy
copies the audio stream without re-encoding.
Confirm Stream Presence
: Make sure the input file (
input.mp4
) actually contains video and audio streams. You can check this with:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -i input.mp4
Look for
Stream #...: Video:
and
Stream #...: Audio:
in the output.
Compatibility of Crop Dimensions
: Ensure the crop dimensions are compatible with the video's resolution. Cropping more pixels than the video's height will result in an error.
File Path and Names
: Double-check the file paths and names to ensure they are correct and accessible.
If you've verified these points and the issue persists, it might be helpful to see the full
ffmpeg
command you're using along with any output messages for further troubleshooting.
You
it says the frame width is 1272 and frame height 720, lets see if it works
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Given your video's frame dimensions of 1272x720, you can crop out the bottom part (e.g., the taskbar) and then apply the frame reduction. Here's how you can modify the
ffmpeg
command based on these dimensions:
Cropping the Video
: To crop out the bottom part of the video, you can use the following command. Adjust the number
20
(or whatever value you deem appropriate) for the height of the taskbar you want to remove:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf
"crop=1272:700"
-c:a copy cropped_output.mp4
This command crops the bottom 20 pixels off a 720p video (resulting in a 1272x700 video). The audio is copied without re-encoding.
Applying Frame Reduction
: After cropping, apply the
mpdecimate
filter to the cropped video:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -i cropped_output.mp4 -vf
"mpdecimate,setpts=N/FRAME_RATE/TB"
final_output.mp4
This command will remove redundant frames from the cropped video.
Ensure you replace
input.mp4
,
cropped_output.mp4
, and
final_output.mp4
with the actual names of your input and output files. This two-step process should effectively crop out the constantly changing element (the clock) and then remove any redundant frames from the resulting video.
You
ok it seems like it might have worked but now the whole movie is only like 30 or 40 seconds long and the last frame lingers for 23 minutes? can we cut off the mp4 at 40 seconds?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly, you can trim your video to a specific length using
ffmpeg
. To cut the video at the 40-second mark, you can use the
-t
option in
ffmpeg
, which specifies the duration of the output file. Here's the command to do that:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -t 40 -c:v copy -c:a copy trimmed_output.mp4
In this command:
-i input.mp4
specifies the input file.
-t 40
sets the duration of the output video to 40 seconds.
-c:v copy
and
-c:a copy
tell
ffmpeg
to copy the video and audio streams without re-encoding.
Replace
input.mp4
with the name of the file you want to trim and
trimmed_output.mp4
with the desired name for the trimmed file. This command will create a new video file that is 40 seconds long, cutting off anything beyond that point.
You
the name of the file now is patetic.mp4 can we make the output peripatetitic-walking.mp4?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Absolutely! You can specify
patetic.mp4
as the input file and
peripatetitic-walking.mp4
as the output file in your
ffmpeg
command. Here's how you do it:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -i patetic.mp4 -t 40 -c:v copy -c:a copy peripatetitic-walking.mp4
In this command:
-i patetic.mp4
is your current file which you want to trim.
-t 40
sets the duration of the output video to 40 seconds.
-c:v copy
and
-c:a copy
are used to copy the video and audio streams without re-encoding.
peripatetitic-walking.mp4
is the name of the output file which will be the trimmed version of your video.

for frame reduction and format conversion, respectively.
Cropping Solution
: To address the unique frame issue, I suggested cropping out the changing element (the clock) before applying frame reduction.
Execution Challenges
: You faced some challenges executing the commands, including an
ffmpeg
error and compatibility issues across different operating systems.
Successful Cropping and Frame Reduction
: Eventually, you successfully cropped the video to remove the clock and then applied the frame reduction, significantly shortening the video.
