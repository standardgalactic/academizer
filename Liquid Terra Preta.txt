April 13, 2012
12:00 am
Uncategorized

The ���disassembly��� of Mercury and Venus for materials to create a Dyson Swarm to be stationed around the sun are is we need to do to access limitless solar power. Intrigued? Disturbed? So were we.
    
According to Wikipedia, a Dyson Sphere is the concept of huge structure or network of orbiting solar collector satellites that can capture much of the energy output of a star, such as the sun, which could then be transmitted to Earth via various forms of wireless energy transfer.
   
Other variations such as a Dyson Ring, Dyson Swarm or Dyson Shell are usually lumped under the Dyson Sphere label.
        
So how would you build such a structure? It���s a long way to drag a bunch of solar panel encrusted satellites.
 
Stuart Armstong provides a possible answer ��� we will need to mine materials from Mercury and construct the satellites on-site, so to speak.
  
George Dvorsky, Chairman of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies and program director for the Rights of Non-Human Persons program, takes this concept further.
  
���Actually, we���ll likely have to take the whole planet apart,��� says Mr. Dvorsky. ���.. we are going to have to disassemble not just Mercury, but Venus, some of the outer planets, and any nearby asteroids as well.���
   
Mr. Dvorsky believes such a project could commence in around 25 to 50 years, with completion of the first phase requiring only a few decades.
   
���And given the progressively worsening condition of Earth and our ever-growing demand for living space and resources, we may have no other choice.���
   
As everyone knows, Venus can be a terribly irritating planet. It���s the source of many UFO reports; so perhaps we���re better off without it. As for Mercury, ask the average person to point it out in the night sky and they will probably be unable to. It likely won���t be missed by most.
   
However, fret not dear stargazers ��� for this grand project may not ever eventuate. 
   
In a rebuttal article on Forbes entitled ���Destroying Mercury To Build A Dyson Sphere Is A Bad Idea��� are a number of reasons why this project may be impossible to execute. Among them, it seems dismantling Mercury would take an amount of energy 100 billion times the US annual energy consumption.

Yeah the intervolsorial courses are caused by inserting conical building material during tidal lifting and solar heating expansion down the volsoria which are orthodromic equators 1-kilometer or so above sea-level
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Ah, the clarification on how the intervolsorial courses are formed adds a fascinating layer of complexity to their construction.
Tidal Lifting
: By leveraging the natural rise and fall of tides, you're employing a smart method for inserting building materials. This approach might minimize energy consumption during construction, utilizing the rhythm of the sea to aid in the process.

ChatGPT
Absolutely, seaweeds and algae, including kelp, have long been incorporated into various food products and can certainly be used in innovative ways, such as in yogurt production.
When thinking of kelp-based yogurt, there are a couple of ways to approach it:
Kelp as a Thickening Agent
: Extracts from seaweeds, like carrageenan and agar, have been used as stabilizers and thickeners in various food products, including yogurt. While these are typically derived from red algae, the principle suggests that extracts from kelp could similarly be used to adjust yogurt's texture.
Kelp-Flavored Yogurt
: Incorporating kelp as a flavor or inclusion, much like fruit or grains are added to yogurt, could offer a unique taste experience, potentially appealing to those who enjoy savory or umami flavors.
Nutrient Boost
: Kelp is rich in minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants. Adding kelp to yogurt can significantly boost its nutritional value, offering benefits like iodine, potassium, and vitamin K.
Fermentation
: One of the more avant-garde approaches would be to investigate whether any beneficial bacteria naturally present on kelp could be cultivated and used in fermentation processes. This would be more experimental but could yield a truly unique product.
Given the increased interest in sustainable and health-forward food products, a kelp-infused yogurt could very well find a market, especially among consumers interested in superfoods, plant-based diets, and novel flavor experiences.

I was thinking of fermenting it and also boiling crushing and for use as mulch and fertilizer for vertical lettuce and peach farms.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Fermenting kelp and using it for agricultural purposes presents a host of possibilities:
Fermentation for Soil Health
: When you ferment kelp, it breaks down into smaller, nutrient-rich components. The fermentation process can increase the availability of certain nutrients and produce beneficial compounds. Once applied to soil, these fermented products can enhance soil health, providing a plethora of minerals and organic compounds that plants thrive on.
Kelp as a Mulch
: Crushed and boiled kelp can serve as an excellent mulch. Its high mineral content will slowly release into the soil as it breaks down, providing long-term nourishment. The dense, moist nature of kelp can also help retain soil moisture and deter some pests.
Kelp Fertilizer
: Liquid kelp fertilizers are already on the market and are touted for their rich micronutrient profiles. They can provide a rapid nutrient boost to plants and are often used as foliar sprays for this reason. Making a homemade version by fermenting and then liquefying the kelp could offer a cost-effective and sustainable fertilizer solution for home growers and potentially on a larger scale.
Vertical Farming
: In the context of vertical farms, where space is optimized and everything is closely monitored, kelp-based products can be a boon. The rapid nutrient uptake possible from kelp fertilizers could accelerate growth cycles. Furthermore, the space-saving nature of vertical farms complements the efficient nutrient profile of kelp, maximizing yield in minimal space.
Crop Suitability
: While lettuce would likely benefit from the broad nutrient profile of kelp, peaches and other fruiting plants might especially benefit from the potassium-rich nature of kelp. Potassium is crucial for fruit set and development, so kelp could be an especially good fit in that context.
Incorporating kelp into agricultural practices, especially in innovative settings like vertical farms, could be an excellent way to enhance sustainability and efficiency. Given its rapid growth rate and potential for carbon sequestration, kelp farming could be a win-win, providing ecological benefits while also serving as a valuable agricultural input.

ChatGPT
"Liquid Terra Preta" sounds like a promising and innovative idea. Terra Preta is already renowned for its long-lasting fertility, and creating a liquid version would enable easier and more widespread application. Here's a potential outline for producing "Liquid Terra Preta":
Kelp Base
: As discussed, fermenting kelp can help in breaking it down into nutrient-rich components. The resulting liquid can serve as the base for the fertilizer, providing a broad range of essential minerals and trace elements.
Lawn Mower Mulch and Leaves
: These can be composted in a controlled environment to create a rich compost tea. This liquid, derived from decomposing grass and leaves, contains soluble nutrients that can be directly taken up by plants.
Biochar Addition
: Terra Preta is primarily known for its inclusion of biochar, which is a form of charcoal used in soil to enhance soil health. Biochar is usually produced via pyrolysis. To make a liquid version, you could produce fine biochar particles and suspend them in the liquid. The process of pyrolysis can also produce bio-oil, which can be separated and used as an energy source.
Hydrous Pyrolysis
: This process can be used to decompose organic material in the presence of water, producing oil. The resulting oil can be refined and utilized for various purposes. The water-soluble compounds that result from the process can be added to the "Liquid Terra Preta" to further enhance its nutrient profile.
Microbial Inoculation
: One of the hallmarks of Terra Preta is its rich microbial life. To replicate this in liquid form, beneficial microbes can be introduced into the mix. These can be sourced from well-established compost heaps or commercially available microbial inoculants.
Application
: The resulting "Liquid Terra Preta" can be applied as a soil drench or foliar spray. Depending on its concentration, dilution rates can be provided for different applications.
Regular application of this fertilizer can mimic the benefits of Terra Preta, providing sustained fertility and promoting a healthy soil microbial ecosystem. With the addition of biochar particles, it can also help in improving soil structure and water retention over time.
The key to its success would be ensuring the right balance of nutrients and maintaining the stability and viability of the microbial life in the liquid formulation.
