You
Do you happen do know if there are any punctuations symbols I can give to the mac say program that will make it pause. I know the period and comma does, but I am looking for a longer break between paragraphs or sections?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, you can control the pacing and pauses in the macOS
say
program using various punctuation symbols and special commands. Here are a few options to create longer breaks:
Ellipsis (...):
An ellipsis can create a longer pause than a period or a comma.
Multiple Periods:
Using several periods in a row (e.g.,
....
) can create a longer pause than a single period.
Special Characters:
You can experiment with other special characters like semicolons (;) or dashes (--) to see how they affect the pacing.
Custom Delays with [[slnc]] Command:
The
say
command supports embedded speech commands that can customize how the text is read. One such command is
[[slnc]]
, which stands for "silence."
You can specify the duration of the silence in milliseconds. For example,
[[slnc 1000]]
will insert a pause of 1 second.
To use this in a text, you would write something like
This is the first paragraph. [[slnc 1000]] This is the second paragraph.
Break Tags in SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language):
If you are using SSML with the
say
command, you can use the
<break>
tag to insert pauses.
The
<break>
tag allows you to specify the length of the pause in either milliseconds or seconds. For example,
<break time="1000ms"/>
or
<break time="1s"/>
.
Remember that the effectiveness of these methods can vary based on the voice and settings you are using with the
say
program. Experimenting with different options will help you find the best solution for your specific needs.

Thank you that is extremely helpful. I have been making audiobooks, but find it doesn't take a long enough break between paragraphs or chapters. Do you happen to have a list of which voices speak spanish? -v
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In macOS, there are several voices available that can speak Spanish, which can be very useful for creating Spanish audiobooks or other audio content. Here's a list of some of the Spanish-speaking voices you can use with the
say
command:
Spanish (Spain):
Diego: A male voice.
Monica: A female voice.
Juan: Another male voice.
Jorge: Another male voice.
Spanish (Mexico):
Paulina: A female voice.
Javier: A male voice.
Spanish (United States):
Rosa: A female voice.
To use one of these voices, you would include the
-v
option in your
say
command followed by the voice name. For example:
bash
Copy code
say -v Monica
"Hola, ��c��mo est��s?"
To see a complete list of available voices, including those for other languages, you can use the following command in the Terminal:
bash
Copy code
say -v
'?'
This command will display all the voices installed on your system, along with the language they are associated with. If you don't see the voice you need, you can download additional voices through System Preferences under Accessibility > Spoken Content > System Voice > Customize. Keep in mind that the availability of voices can vary depending on the version of macOS you are using.

It sounds like you're managing your macOS system remotely via SSH from a Windows machine running Ubuntu. That's an efficient way to work, especially if you're more comfortable with command line interfaces and remote management. Here are a few tips that might help you as you continue to work with your macOS system in this manner:
Remote Management Tools:
Beyond SSH, consider using tools like VNC (Virtual Network Computing) for remote desktop access. VNC allows you to view and interact with the macOS GUI from your Windows/Ubuntu machine.
Scripting and Automation:
For tasks like setting up voices or other system preferences, you can often use AppleScript or shell scripting. These scripts can be run remotely via SSH.
Install Voice Packages via Command Line:
While the GUI provides an easy way to download additional voices, it might be possible to automate this through the command line. This typically involves identifying the package names and using a command like
softwareupdate --install
followed by the package name. However, the specifics can vary based on the macOS version.
File Transfers:
For transferring files between your Windows/Ubuntu machine and your Mac, consider using
scp
(secure copy protocol) or setting up an FTP server on the Mac.
Remote Text Editing:
If you need to edit text files on your Mac, tools like
vim
,
nano
, or
emacs
can be powerful options accessible via SSH.
Learning macOS Command Line:
Since macOS is based on Unix, many commands are similar to Linux. Familiarizing yourself with the macOS-specific nuances can be very beneficial. There are many resources and tutorials available online for mastering the macOS command line.
Accessing macOS Specific Features:
Some macOS features may not have command line equivalents or may require unique approaches compared to Linux systems. Online communities and forums can be a great resource for finding solutions to specific macOS-related tasks.
Remote Audio Playback:
If you are creating audiobooks and need to test audio playback, consider setting up a remote audio solution. This might involve streaming the audio back to your Ubuntu system or using a command-line audio player on the Mac.
Navigating a different operating system, especially remotely and without the use of its native UI, can be challenging. However, with the right set of tools and some exploration, you can efficiently manage most tasks.

So there really isn't a command just to download the voice from the command line? i managed to get Diego downloaded. also How do i get rid of some large files?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Regarding downloading voices via the command line on macOS, there isn't a straightforward, built-in command that allows you to directly download and install voice packages like you can with application packages. This process is typically handled through the System Preferences GUI. However, since you've already managed to download the "Diego" voice, it seems like you've found a way around this, which is great!
For dealing with large files and managing disk space on your macOS system via SSH, you can use several command line tools and strategies:
Finding Large Files:
Use the
find
command to locate large files. For example, to find files larger than 100MB in your home directory, you could use:
bash
Copy code
find ~/ -
type
f -size +100M
Disk Usage Analysis:
The
du
command can help you understand which directories are using the most space. For a summary of a specific directory, use:
bash
Copy code
du
-sh /path/to/directory
Deleting Files:
To delete files, use the
rm
command. For instance:
bash
Copy code
rm
/path/to/large/file
Be cautious with this command, as it permanently deletes files without placing them in a recycle bin.
Archiving and Compression:
If you want to keep the files but save space, consider compressing them using
tar
and
gzip
:
bash
Copy code
tar -czvf compressed-file-name.tar.gz /path/to/large/files
Moving Files to External Storage:
If you have an external storage device or network storage, you can move large files off your system using the
mv
command:
bash
Copy code
mv
/path/to/large/file /path/to/external/storage
Safe Cleanup:
For a safer cleanup, you might want to move files to a temporary location before permanently deleting them, ensuring you don't accidentally remove important files.
Automated Cleaning Tools:
Although primarily GUI-based, tools like CleanMyMac can be scheduled to clean up certain types of files automatically. However, command-line alternatives or scripting might be necessary for remote management.
Checking Disk Space:
To check the available disk space, use the
df
command:
bash
Copy code
df
-h
Always double-check the files and commands before executing them, especially when deleting or moving files, to avoid accidental data loss.

2023-11-24 21:49:16.114 say[4283:5017841] Could not retrieve voice [AVSpeechSynthesisProviderVoice 0x600001b49180] Name: Rocko, Identifier: com.apple.eloquence.en-GB.Rocko, Supported Languages (
    "en-GB"
), Age: 0, Gender: 0, Size: 0, Version: (null)
(base) mecha@Mac ~ % say -v Diego "hola"
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The error message you received indicates a problem with the voice 'Rocko', which is an English (Great Britain) voice, not a Spanish one. This could be due to several reasons, such as the voice not being properly installed or configured on your macOS system.
Regarding the command you used with 'Diego', which is a Spanish voice, it should normally work if the voice 'Diego' is installed correctly on your system. If 'Diego' is a Spanish voice available on your system, the command
say -v Diego "hola"
should result in the voice 'Diego' saying "hola."
Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:
Verify Voice Installation:
Ensure that the 'Diego' voice is indeed installed on your system. You can check the installed voices using:
bash
Copy code
say -v
'?'
This command lists all available voices along with their languages.
Check for Partial Downloads:
Sometimes, a voice download might be incomplete or corrupted. In such cases, removing the voice and downloading it again can resolve the issue.
System Preferences:
Although you primarily interact with your Mac via SSH, for voice-related issues, sometimes checking the System Preferences on the Mac itself can give you more information. If possible, access the Mac directly or via a remote desktop tool to check the voice settings under System Preferences > Accessibility > Spoken Content.
Restarting the Speech Service:
Restarting the speech synthesis service might resolve any temporary glitches. You can do this by restarting your Mac.
Testing with Another Voice:
As a diagnostic step, try using a different voice with the
say
command to check if the issue is specific to the 'Diego' voice or a general problem with the speech synthesis service.
Software Updates:
Ensure your macOS is up to date, as updates can often fix bugs related to system services like speech synthesis.
Reinstalling the Voice:
If none of the above steps work, try removing and reinstalling the 'Diego' voice. This might require accessing the System Preferences GUI.
If after trying these steps the issue persists, it might be a more complex problem with the macOS system's speech synthesis capabilities, requiring further investigation or assistance from Apple support.

It looked like there were Rocko versions available in different languages, but I hadn't downloaded it. I manually went and turned one the screen and installed Diego, that was me checking to see if it worked. It was good though I saw that the battery symbol was red it seems it takes hardly any power especially since I am not using the screen or GUI
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It's great to hear that you were able to successfully install the 'Diego' voice and verify that it works. Indeed, using a Mac primarily via SSH and not using the GUI or screen can significantly reduce power consumption. This setup can be particularly energy-efficient, which is likely why you observed the battery symbol indicating minimal power usage.
A few points to consider in your setup:
Energy Efficiency:
Running the Mac without the GUI and screen reduces the overall load on the CPU and GPU, which are among the most power-hungry components. This leads to lower power consumption and can be especially beneficial for battery life in laptops.
Heat Generation:
Reduced power usage also means less heat generation, which can be beneficial for the longevity and performance of the hardware.
Remote Management:
Continuously managing your Mac via SSH is an effective way to maintain control while minimizing physical interaction. This approach is widely used in server management and can be very effective for personal devices too, especially for users comfortable with command-line interfaces.
Battery Health:
Even if the Mac is not using much power, it's important to periodically check the battery's health, especially if it's an older device. MacOS provides battery health management features that can help extend the overall lifespan of the battery.
Software Updates:
Regularly updating your macOS and installed applications can ensure that you benefit from the latest performance improvements and energy efficiency enhancements.
Remote Monitoring:
You might want to set up a system for remotely monitoring the Mac's health and performance, including battery status, disk space, CPU usage, etc. Tools like SSH, SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), or custom scripts can be used for this purpose.
Physical Maintenance:
Periodic physical check-ups (like cleaning dust from vents and checking for hardware issues) are still important, even if you rarely use the GUI or open the laptop.
Your approach demonstrates a sophisticated use of technology, blending the strengths of different operating systems and interaction modes to suit your preferences and needs.

Yeah it doesn't seem that there is an easy way to do code switching yet. The audiobook I am about to make has the first chapter in English, the second in Spanish, and the rest in English, so I'll just generate the sections separatedly and then concatenate them together with ffmpeg or something if I can remember the command I used to join mp3s
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Creating an audiobook with chapters in different languages can indeed be a bit challenging, especially when it involves code-switching between English and Spanish. However, your approach to generate the sections separately and then concatenate them together is a practical solution. Here���s a brief guide on how to achieve this using
ffmpeg
, a powerful tool for processing audio and video files:
Generating Separate Audio Files
Using the
say
Command:
Generate the English and Spanish sections as separate audio files using the macOS
say
command with the appropriate voices. For instance:
For English:
say -v [EnglishVoice] -o chapter1.aiff "Your English text"
For Spanish:
say -v Diego -o chapter2.aiff "Tu texto en espa��ol"
Converting to MP3 (if needed):
If you want the final audiobook in MP3 format, convert the AIFF files to MP3 using
ffmpeg
:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -i chapter1.aiff chapter1.mp3
ffmpeg -i chapter2.aiff chapter2.mp3
Concatenating Audio Files with FFmpeg
To concatenate multiple MP3 files into a single file, you can use the following
ffmpeg
command:
Create a File List:
First, create a text file listing all the MP3 files in the order you want them to be concatenated. Let's call this file
filelist.txt
. It should look like this:
arduino
Copy code
file
'chapter1.mp3'
file
'chapter2.mp3'
file
'chapter3.mp3'
...
Concatenating with FFmpeg:
Use the following
ffmpeg
command to concatenate the files:
bash
Copy code
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i filelist.txt -c copy output.mp3
This command tells
ffmpeg
to treat the input as a list of file locations (
-f concat
), disable safety measures for file paths (
-safe 0
), read the file paths from
filelist.txt
, and concatenate them without re-encoding (
-c copy
).
Check the Output:
After running the command, check the
output.mp3
file to ensure all chapters have been concatenated correctly.
This method should result in a single MP3 file containing all your chapters in the correct order, switching languages as needed. Remember to check the syntax and paths in your commands, and adjust them according to your specific filenames and locations.

That is similar to my workflow. I use autohotkey to store my pipeline of commands:

;; audiobook ; audiobooks

::doit::say -o monicaspills.aiff -f mpills.txt
::thenn::lame -m m monicaspills.aiff pills.mp3

::supersplit::awk '{print > ("output/en_" sprintf("%05d.txt", NR)); close("output/en_" sprintf("%05d.txt", NR))}' english.txt

::foreach::for file in * `; do say -o "${file%.*}.aiff" -f "$file"`; done

::tomp3::for file in * `; do lame -m m ${file%.*}.aiff ${file%.*}.mp3 `; done

::sewit::ffmpeg -f concat -i list.txt -c copy output.mp3

;; microsize video to mp3 ;;

::musize::ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vn -ab 64k output.mp3
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your workflow using AutoHotkey scripts for creating audiobooks is quite efficient and well-organized. It showcases a great way to automate repetitive tasks in audio processing. Let's break down each step of your workflow for clarity:
Generating the AIFF File:
::doit::say -o monicaspills.aiff -f mpills.txt
This script uses the
say
command to convert text from
mpills.txt
into an AIFF audio file named
monicaspills.aiff
.
Converting AIFF to MP3:
::thenn::lame -m m monicaspills.aiff pills.mp3
This script uses LAME, an MP3 encoder, to convert the AIFF file to an MP3 format, creating
pills.mp3
.
Splitting a Large Text File into Smaller Files:
::supersplit::awk '{print > ("output/en_" sprintf("%05d.txt", NR)); close("output/en_" sprintf("%05d.txt", NR))}' english.txt
This script uses
awk
to split a large text file (
english.txt
) into smaller files, each containing a portion of the text. This is useful for processing large texts in smaller sections.
Batch Processing with say Command:
::foreach::for file in *; do say -o "${file%.*}.aiff" -f "$file"; done
This script loops through all files in a directory, using each file as input for the
say
command to create corresponding AIFF files.
Batch Conversion to MP3:
::tomp3::for file in *; do lame -m m ${file%.*}.aiff ${file%.*}.mp3; done
This script converts all AIFF files in the directory to MP3 format using the LAME encoder.
Concatenating Audio Files:
::sewit::ffmpeg -f concat -i list.txt -c copy output.mp3
This script uses
ffmpeg
to concatenate multiple audio files listed in
list.txt
into a single MP3 file (
output.mp3
).
Converting Video to Compressed MP3:
::musize::ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vn -ab 64k output.mp3
This script extracts the audio from a video file (
input.mp4
) and converts it into a compressed MP3 file (
output.mp3
) with a bitrate of 64 kbps.
Your use of AutoHotkey to streamline this process is impressive. It not only saves time but also reduces the chances of errors in manual operations. This kind of scripting is a powerful way to handle media processing tasks, especially in scenarios where you need to handle large volumes of text and audio data.
