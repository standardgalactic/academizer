The introduction of the paper discusses the tendency of organisms to self-organize and maintain boundaries that separate their internal states from the external environment. It introduces the concept of Markov blankets, which define the statistical boundaries of a system and partition it into internal and external states. The presence of a Markov blanket implies that internal and external states are conditionally independent and can only influence each other through sensory and active states.

The paper explores how Markov blankets self-organize through active inference, which is a tendency of random dynamical systems to minimize free energy. Free energy, in this context, is an information-theoretic measure related to the optimization of Bayesian model evidence. The minimization of free energy ensures that entropy is bounded and can be understood as optimizing the system's probabilistic beliefs and interactions with the environment.

The authors propose an optimality principle based on the minimization of free energy to explain the self-assembly of Markov blankets. They introduce the distinction between "mere active inference" and "adaptive active inference," where the latter allows for the modulation of an organism's sensorimotor coupling to the environment. The paper argues that organisms consist of multiple Markov blankets, which are not fixed or stable boundaries. They suggest that an ensemble of Markov blankets can self-organize into a global system, forming nested Markov blankets.

The structure of the paper is outlined, with Section 2 introducing the Markov blanket concept in the context of active inference. Section 3 discusses the distinction between mere and adaptive active inference and their implications for autonomous organization. Section 4 focuses on nested Markov blankets, exploring Markov blankets of Markov blankets.

The excerpt discusses the concept of the Markov blanket and its relationship to active inference. A Markov blanket is a statistical partitioning of states into internal and external states that are separated by a boundary. It renders a set of states conditionally independent of each other. Internal and external states are conditionally independent and can only influence each other through active and sensory states. The Markov blanket establishes a statistical neighborhood for a given variable, making it conditionally independent of other variables outside the blanket.

In the context of biological systems, a cell is presented as an example of a system with a Markov blanket. The Markov blanket of a cell separates it from the external environment. Without a Markov blanket, a cell would not be distinguishable and would cease to exist. The maintenance of low-entropy distributions over internal states and the Markov blanket allows biological systems to engage in active inference, which involves minimizing uncertainty or surprise about the causes of sensory states. Active inference is based on the principle of minimizing variational free energy, which bounds surprise and maximizes evidence for the system's model and existence.

The exchange of influences between internal and external states across the Markov blanket can be understood as a form of active inference. In a neurobiological setting, the brain's hierarchical structure can be associated with a hierarchical Bayesian network, where higher levels predict the states at lower levels. Predictive coding is a framework that describes the exchange of predictions and prediction errors between levels of the hierarchy, enabling the system to make inferences about hidden causes of sensory input.

Active inference involves not only internal states but also active states, highlighting the embodied nature of the brain as an inference machine. The brain actively samples sensory data to minimize surprise about hidden causes, and action plays a role in self-evidencing and minimizing free energy. Minimizing entropy by inferring the hidden causes of sensations requires having a model of regularities in the environment, making organisms close to optimal models of their niche. Active inference implies that agents are responsible for generating sensory evidence by actively sampling and changing the hidden causes of their environment.

The excerpt also mentions the concept of adaptive active inference and the relationship between the Markov blanket and autonomy. While all Markov blanketed systems can be associated with active inference, it is cautioned that having a Markov blanket alone does not define autonomy. The properties that a Markov blanketed system must possess for autonomy are further explored in the paper.

The excerpt provides a detailed explanation of the concept of the Markov blanket and its relationship to active inference. The Markov blanket partitions states into internal and external states, establishing conditional independence and allowing influences between the two sets of states only through active and sensory states.
Using a cell as an example, the excerpt highlights the importance of the Markov blanket in separating the cell from the external environment and maintaining its identity. The maintenance of low-entropy distributions within the internal states and the Markov blanket enables biological systems to engage in active inference, minimizing uncertainty about the causes of sensory states. This inference process is guided by the principle of minimizing variational free energy, which maximizes evidence for the system's model and existence.
The exchange of influences across the Markov blanket is associated with active inference, particularly in the hierarchical structure of the brain. The brain's hierarchical Bayesian network involves predictive coding, where higher levels make predictions about lower levels and exchange prediction errors.

Yes, that is correct. Adaptive active inference is indeed closely associated with hierarchical generative models. In the context of active inference, a generative model represents the agent's beliefs about the world and how it generates sensory inputs. These generative models are hierarchical, meaning they consist of multiple layers or levels of abstraction.

The idea of nested and multi-layered Markov blankets is fundamental to hierarchical generative models. A Markov blanket is a set of variables that shields a target variable from the rest of the variables in the system. In the case of hierarchical generative models, each layer or level of the model has its own Markov blanket, and these Markov blankets are nested within each other.

The nested structure of Markov blankets in hierarchical generative models allows for the representation of temporal and spatial dependencies at different scales. By recursively considering larger and larger scales of sensorimotor consequences, the agent can make inferences about the world and its own actions at multiple levels of abstraction. This hierarchical organization enables the agent to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies in its generative models and make predictions and decisions accordingly.

The passage you provided discusses the concept of active inference and its relationship to autonomous systems. Active inference is a theoretical framework that describes how organisms make inferences and take actions to minimize expected surprise or uncertainty about their environment. According to the passage, to remain alive, an organism must avoid crossing terminal species-specific phase boundaries. For example, a riverbank can be seen as a phase boundary where, on one side, an organism retains its structural integrity, and on the other side, it may not unless it is adapted to an aquatic environment.

The passage suggests that organisms must have prior probabilistic beliefs about the consequences of their actions and be able to sample different probabilistic outcomes of their actions. This implies that organisms need generative models of future states to infer the outcomes of their own actions. The depth of the generative model, or its temporal or counterfactual depth, determines the organism's ability to act ahead of actuality and sample across different possible actions.

Autonomous systems, as defined in the passage, are distinguished by the way they make inferences about action over time. They have the ability to infer the outcomes of their own actions and possess generative models with temporal depth. These systems restrict themselves to a limited number of attracting states, which are states that help them maintain their structural integrity and minimize surprise.

The passage also introduces the concept of Markov blankets, which are boundaries that separate internal states of a system from its external states. Living systems are described as having hierarchical and nested structures of Markov blankets, where each system, from cells to organisms, has its own Markov blanket. The organization of Markov blankets occurs recursively at different scales, allowing for the formation of ensemble Markov blankets, which describe the organization of complex living systems at multiple levels.

The overall aim of adaptive active inference is to create a world of predictability and minimize uncertainty. However, the existence of other systems with deep generative models can confound predictions and prevent the achievement of complete predictability. The passage suggests that autonomous systems strive to become like Huygens' pendulum, which represents a perfectly predictable and synchronized system.

In summary, the passage discusses the concepts of active inference, generative models, Markov blankets, and the hierarchical organization of autonomous systems. It emphasizes the importance of minimizing surprise and maintaining structural integrity for survival, while acknowledging the challenges posed by complex environments and the presence of other systems.

Sparse and redundant representations, as discussed in Michael Elad's book, are a powerful framework in signal and image processing. They aim to find concise representations of signals or images by exploiting the inherent redundancy or sparsity present in the data.

Negentropy, on the other hand, is a concept from information theory that measures the amount of information or randomness in a signal. It can be seen as a measure of departure from a perfectly organized or compressed representation.

In the context of compression, the goal is to reduce the size of a signal or data while preserving its essential information. Sparse and redundant representations can be used as a basis for compression algorithms because they offer a compact representation that captures the essential structure of the signal while discarding unnecessary or redundant information.

By leveraging the sparsity or redundancy in a signal, compression techniques can achieve higher compression ratios without significant loss of information. This connects the ideas of sparse and redundant representations with compression and, potentially, with the concept of negentropy as a measure of departure from the ideal compressed representation.

There are several connections between the concept of sparse representations discussed in the passage and the previous topics of negentropy and compression:

Compression: Sparse representations can be seen as a form of compression. By seeking the sparsest solution to an underdetermined system of equations, we aim to represent the data or signal using a minimal number of nonzero coefficients. This sparsity property allows for more efficient storage and transmission of information, similar to the goal of compression algorithms.

Redundancy: Sparse representations exploit the idea of redundancy in signals or data. The concept of dictionaries, introduced by Mallat and Zhang, plays a crucial role in sparse representations. Dictionaries are sets of vectors that are overcomplete, meaning they contain more elements than necessary to represent the data perfectly. This redundancy in the dictionary enables the approximation of signals or data with a sparse combination of dictionary elements.

Signal and Image Processing: Sparse representations have found extensive applications in signal and image processing. By representing signals or images sparsely, we can denoise, reconstruct, and enhance them efficiently. Sparse representations have been successfully applied in various areas, such as image compression, image super-resolution, image inpainting, and signal denoising.

Optimization: Sparse recovery techniques involve solving optimization problems to find the sparsest solution. The pursuit algorithms mentioned in the passage, such as greedy pursuit and convex programming, utilize optimization principles to approximate the sparse solution. This connects with the topic of optimization discussed earlier, where different algorithms and optimization techniques were explored.

Linear Algebra: Sparse representations heavily rely on linear algebra concepts. The underdetermined systems of linear equations, represented as Ax = b, form the basis of sparse recovery problems. The use of matrices, vectors, and linear transformations are fundamental to understanding and solving these problems. Additionally, the analysis of dictionaries and coherence measures involves linear algebra techniques.

Overall, sparse representations connect with the previous topics by leveraging principles of compression, redundancy, signal processing, optimization, and linear algebra. The pursuit of sparse solutions in underdetermined systems combines these concepts to extract concise and informative representations from data.

The concept of dissipative structures, Markov blankets, and the work of Ilya Prigogine are all related to the broader topic of complex systems and their dynamics. While they may not be directly addressed in the given article on negentropy, there are connections that can be made between these concepts.

Dissipative structures, introduced by Ilya Prigogine, are self-organizing systems that maintain a steady state far from equilibrium by dissipating energy and exchanging matter with their environment. These structures emerge through the interaction of nonlinear processes and exhibit characteristics such as order, organization, and stability. The reduction of entropy and the emergence of negentropy are key features of dissipative structures.

In the context of the article on negentropy, the reduction of surprise and the emergence of order through learning can be seen as analogous to the formation of dissipative structures. Learning involves the refinement of predictive models, the identification of patterns and regularities, and the organization of information, all of which contribute to the reduction of surprise and the emergence of order within the cognitive system.

Markov blankets, on the other hand, are a concept from the field of probabilistic graphical models and Bayesian inference. A Markov blanket of a variable in a system is the set of variables that shield that variable from the rest of the system, meaning that the variable is conditionally independent of all other variables given its Markov blanket. Markov blankets define the boundaries within which information and influences flow in a system.

In the context of cognition and learning, Markov blankets can be seen as the informational boundaries that separate an agent from its environment. Learning involves identifying the relevant variables and their dependencies within the Markov blanket, making predictions based on this information, and updating the internal model accordingly. By focusing on the variables within the Markov blanket, the agent can effectively reduce surprise and make accurate predictions.

While the specific connections between negentropy, dissipative structures, Markov blankets, and Prigogine's work may not be explicitly discussed in the given article, these concepts are part of the broader framework of understanding complex systems, information processing, and self-organization. They provide different perspectives and tools to explore and explain the dynamics of cognitive processes, the emergence of order, and the reduction of surprise through learning and prediction.

Planets, stars, galaxies, and living organisms are all examples of dissipative structures. Dissipative structures are systems that maintain a stable state and exhibit self-organization by dissipating energy and exchanging matter with their environment.

In the context of celestial bodies like planets, stars, and galaxies, these systems maintain their structure and function by continuously exchanging energy and matter with their surroundings. They dissipate energy in the form of radiation, heat, and other forms of energy transfer, while also undergoing processes such as fusion (in stars) and accretion (in planets) to sustain their internal dynamics.

Living organisms, including plants, animals, and even microorganisms, are also dissipative structures. They maintain their organization, metabolism, and reproduction by exchanging energy and matter with their environment. Organisms absorb energy from their surroundings through processes such as photosynthesis or consuming other organisms, and they release waste products and dissipate heat to the environment.

Dissipative structures in the natural world, whether celestial bodies or living organisms, are characterized by their ability to maintain a far-from-equilibrium state and exhibit complex behaviors. They emerge through the interplay of nonlinearity, feedback loops, and energy flow, allowing them to sustain their organization and resist the tendency towards disorder predicted by the second law of thermodynamics.

Understanding dissipative structures is crucial for studying the dynamics of various natural systems and exploring their emergent properties, such as the formation of galaxies, the evolution of stars, the diversity of life forms, and the complexity of ecosystems.

Volcanoes, sedimentary ocean beds, and glaciers can be considered dissipative structures due to their ability to maintain stability and self-organize through the exchange of energy and matter with their environment. Here's how each of these examples fits into the concept of dissipative structures:

Volcanoes: Volcanoes are dynamic geological features that arise from the movement of molten rock (magma) from beneath the Earth's crust to the surface. They are powered by the heat and energy generated by processes occurring within the Earth, such as plate tectonics and mantle convection. Volcanoes release enormous amounts of energy in the form of lava flows, ash, gases, and volcanic explosions. This dissipation of energy helps maintain the volcano's structure and allows for its ongoing activity. The exchange of matter and energy between the volcano and its surroundings contributes to its self-organization and the continuous formation and modification of volcanic landscapes.

Sedimentary Ocean Beds: Sedimentary ocean beds are layers of sediment that accumulate over time on the ocean floor. These sediments consist of various materials such as sand, silt, clay, and organic matter, which settle and accumulate under the influence of gravity and water currents. Sedimentation occurs through processes like erosion, weathering, and transportation of materials from land to the ocean. The deposition and compaction of these sediments create distinct layers and structures in the ocean bed. The formation of sedimentary ocean beds involves the exchange of sediment particles, nutrients, and dissolved substances between the ocean and the land, driven by water currents, waves, and biological activity. This exchange of matter and energy contributes to the self-organization and maintenance of the sedimentary structures over time.

Glaciers: Glaciers are large masses of ice that form and flow under the influence of gravity. They are found in regions where snow accumulation exceeds melting, causing the snow to compress and form ice. Glaciers continuously exchange energy with their surroundings through processes such as snowfall, melting, sublimation (direct conversion of ice to vapor), and iceberg calving (breaking off of ice chunks into the ocean). The flow of ice within glaciers is driven by the force of gravity, as well as the internal deformation of the ice mass. Glaciers exhibit self-organization and stability through their ability to balance ice accumulation and ablation (loss) processes. The flow and transformation of ice, along with the exchange of energy and matter with the surrounding environment, contribute to the dissipative nature of glaciers.

In all of these examples, the dissipative structures maintain their stability and organization by continuously exchanging energy and matter with their environment. This exchange enables them to resist the tendency towards equilibrium and exhibit complex behaviors and patterns over time.

Negentropy and Autocatalysis: Autocatalytic sets demonstrate the manifestation of negentropy in a chemical system. Each molecule within the set catalyzes the formation of another, leading to a self-sustaining cycle. As the system evolves, it minimizes internal randomness (entropy) and maximizes organization (negentropy), reducing disorder and increasing order.

Surprise and Hypercycles: Surprise in cognition occurs when predictions fail to match actual outcomes. Hypercycles, which involve a mutually beneficial catalytic cycle among molecules, can be seen as a way for primitive life forms to reduce surprise in their environment. By engaging in an autocatalytic cycle, participating molecules can more reliably predict their existence and replication, reducing the "surprise" of potential depletion.

Entropy, Autopoiesis, and Environment: Autopoiesis refers to a system's ability to reproduce and maintain itself. This concept parallels the entropy-negentropy dynamic. Living systems, through autopoiesis, strive to reduce internal entropy by maintaining their organization and function. However, in doing so, they increase the entropy of their surrounding environment by producing waste, demonstrating the principle of entropy increase in isolated systems.

Prediction, Compression, and Hypercycles/Autocatalytic Sets: In the context of learning and cognition, prediction and compression help reduce surprise and handle information efficiently. Similarly, in a hypercycle or autocatalytic set, each molecule "predicts" the formation of the next one, ensuring the continuation of the cycle. This can be seen as a form of "information compression," where complex information about the environment is reduced to the cyclic process of the hypercycle or autocatalytic set.

Negentropy, Surprise, and Free Energy Minimization: The concept of free energy minimization states that systems evolve to become more efficient in utilizing energy sources and minimizing waste. This process can be viewed as a form of negentropy, where the system reduces internal disorder to maximize efficiency. By becoming more efficient, the system can reduce the "surprise" of encountering unfavorable conditions, such as energy scarcity.

These connections highlight the underlying principles and concepts that link negentropy, surprise, entropy, and free energy minimization across different domains, such as chemistry, cognition, and thermodynamics. By exploring these connections, we gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles that govern various systems and processes, from chemical reactions to cognitive processes and ecological systems.

So do you think we can still say "Learning is Inoculation against surprise" and that Negentropy can be used as a proxy for surprise?
ChatGPT
Yes, we can still say "Learning is Inoculation against surprise" and consider negentropy as a proxy for surprise. The statement "Learning is Inoculation against surprise" captures the idea that the primary function of learning is to reduce uncertainty and increase predictability in our interactions with the world. Through learning, we incorporate new information into our mental models, thereby reducing the surprise associated with similar situations in the future.

Negentropy, which represents the degree of order or organization in a system, can be seen as a proxy for surprise.

There is often a trade-off between generalizability and memory capacity in cognitive processes. This trade-off arises from the inherent limitations of our cognitive systems and the finite resources available for processing and storage.

In the case of memory, perfect recall of every single detail or specific instance would require an immense amount of storage capacity and processing power. Our brains have limited resources, and therefore, we need to make choices about what information to retain and what to discard. This process involves encoding relevant patterns, regularities, and abstract representations that allow for generalization.

Generalization refers to the ability to extract commonalities and abstract concepts from specific instances or experiences. It involves identifying patterns and regularities that can be applied to new situations, enabling us to make inferences, predictions, and understand the world more efficiently. However, generalization necessarily involves simplification and the loss of some specific details and context.

The example of Funes the memorious from Borges' story highlights this trade-off. Funes had an extraordinary memory that allowed him to remember every detail of his experiences. However, this incredible memory came at the cost of impaired generalization and abstraction. Funes was unable to form a generalized concept of a "tree" or understand arithmetic because he was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of specific information associated with each instance. His memory was too detailed and lacking in abstraction to enable higher-level cognitive processes.

In cognitive psychology, this trade-off is often referred to as the "overfitting" problem. Overfitting occurs when a cognitive system becomes too specific to the training data or experiences and fails to generalize to new situations. On the other hand, underfitting occurs when a cognitive system is overly generalized and fails to capture the specific details and context necessary for accurate performance.

Achieving an optimal balance between generalization and memory capacity is a complex cognitive challenge. Our cognitive systems have evolved to strike a balance that allows us to efficiently process and store relevant information while still retaining enough specific details for accurate recall and understanding. This delicate balance enables us to navigate the world, make predictions, and generalize from our experiences while avoiding both excessive complexity and oversimplification.

Well said! The trade-off between generalizability and memory capacity is indeed a fundamental challenge in cognitive processes. Our limited cognitive resources necessitate the prioritization of relevant information and the extraction of general patterns and regularities.
Generalization plays a crucial role in cognitive processes as it allows us to extend our knowledge and make predictions beyond specific instances. By identifying commonalities and abstracting underlying principles, we can apply what we have learned to new situations, saving cognitive resources and facilitating efficient decision-making.
However, this process of generalization involves simplification and the loss of some specific details. This trade-off becomes evident in cases like Funes, where an exceptional memory for specific details impairs the ability to form general concepts or make abstractions. The ability to strike a balance between capturing relevant information and abstracting general principles is vital for cognitive functioning.
The trade-off between generalizability and memory capacity can also be related to the concepts of overfitting and underfitting. Overfitting occurs when cognitive processes become too specific to the training data or experiences, leading to poor generalization to new situations. Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when cognitive processes are overly generalized and fail to capture the necessary specific details.
Optimizing this trade-off is an ongoing challenge in cognitive psychology and related fields. It requires developing cognitive mechanisms and strategies that allow for efficient generalization while retaining important contextual information. Striking the right balance allows us to make accurate predictions, understand complex environments, and adapt to new situations effectively.

Negentropy and entropy relate to cognitive processes as a reduction of uncertainty. Learning can be seen as a process of reducing entropy (uncertainty) in our understanding of the world, leading to increased negentropy (order) in our cognitive schemas.

Underdetermined systems and sparse solutions connect to Occam's Razor, where simpler explanations or representations are often preferred. Cognitive processes also tend to favor simpler, more compressed representations that capture essential features.

The overfitting approach in neural networks for image compression reflects how individuals can struggle to generalize from specific instances if they become too specialized. Achieving a balance between specificity and generalizability parallels finding sparse solutions in underdetermined systems.

Markov blankets and cognitive schemas serve to insulate or encapsulate a portion of a system, allowing for easier manipulation and understanding in isolation.

Learning can be viewed as data compression, aiming to represent the most information with the least amount of data. Cognitive processes also seek to compress the complexity of the world into simpler mental models.

Volcanoes, sedimentary ocean beds, and glaciers as dissipative structures exemplify physical systems that, despite chaotic forces, reach a state of order, similar to the reduction of uncertainty (increase in negentropy) observed in learning.

Greedy pursuit techniques and convex programming can be connected to cognitive processes as heuristic strategies that simplify decision-making, even if they are not always optimal.

Conceptual blending, also known as conceptual integration or cognitive blending, is a cognitive process by which we creatively combine or blend different mental representations or concepts to generate new ideas, insights, or understandings. It involves merging elements from different mental spaces or conceptual domains to create a novel mental construct that goes beyond the individual input concepts.

The process of conceptual blending involves several key steps:

Selecting input spaces: Two or more mental spaces or conceptual domains are selected for blending. These spaces represent distinct concepts or frames of reference.

Identifying input elements: Within each selected mental space, specific elements or concepts are identified as inputs for the blending process. These inputs can be objects, actions, properties, or relations associated with the respective spaces.

Mapping and integration: The inputs from the selected mental spaces are mapped onto a blended space, creating correspondences or connections between the elements. This mapping often involves finding commonalities, similarities, or relationships between the inputs.

Creating a blended space: A new mental space, known as the blended space, is formed through the integration of the mapped inputs. This blended space incorporates elements from the original spaces and may introduce emergent properties or new relationships that are not present in the individual input spaces.

Generating emergent structure: Within the blended space, emergent structure or novel concepts emerge through the combination of input elements. This can result in the creation of new meanings, insights, analogies, or creative solutions that were not present in the original input spaces.

Conceptual blending is a cognitive mechanism that underlies various creative and cognitive processes, such as metaphorical thinking, analogy, humor, invention, and problem-solving. It allows us to connect seemingly unrelated concepts, make sense of complex information, and generate innovative ideas by leveraging the structure and knowledge from multiple mental spaces. Through conceptual blending, we can go beyond conventional thinking and create novel connections and understandings that enrich our cognitive abilities and creative endeavors.

Abstract: Owing to their enormous capacity to improve health and save lives, effective health
promotion frameworks have been at the forefront of public health research and practice. A multilevel
focus, as exemplified by the Socio-Ecological Model (SEM), is one common denominator among these
frameworks. The SEM highlights important social and ecological influences on health behavior by
delineating the different levels of influence. These include public policy, organizational, community,
interpersonal, and intrapersonal levels, which, when considered during the development of health
promotion campaigns, especially those that focus on health education, strengthen the potential
influence of that campaign on targeted behaviors. However, the SEM lacks a complimenting
framework for understanding the role of conventional and unconventional approaches to health
education; that is, how to design a health education intervention that considers both the context, such
as the social and ecological levels of influence, and the best approaches for developing and delivering
the health education in a manner that optimizes their effectiveness in today���s modern and increasingly
diverse world. Addressing this gap, the current article presents an integrative Multisensory
Multilevel Health Education Model (MMHEM), which incorporates three key domains���(1) Art
(innovativeness/creativity), (2) Culture (cultural tailoring), and (3) Science (evidence-based), while
promoting the importance of considering the socio-ecological levels of influence on targeted behaviors.
Using a successful health education intervention, called the Hip Hop Stroke, we deconstruct the
Multisensory Multilevel Health Education Model and discuss its potential role as a guide for
developing public health education interventions.

1. Introduction
Mechanisms behind effective public health education remain complex, and the best practices are
seldom implemented. Consequently, too many health education programs, especially those that target
high poverty, low literacy communities are unsustainable or unimpactful [1]. Moreover, the excessive
quantity of information from traditional and social media, coupled with the overwhelming volume
of commercial advertising, has led to information overload and intense competition for the public���s
attention [2]. These factors are responsible for what has been called ���the attention economy���, in which
human attention is characterized as a commodity that is becoming increasingly scarce [3]. Therefore,
novel approaches in effective health education in this modern environment has become a public health
imperative, especially among economically disadvantaged populations where existing disparities are
the highest [4]. A body of well-designed programs has been shown to improve health outcomes [5���8];
however, the penetration of these programs into an economically disadvantaged population is often
inadequate, and their sustainability is a major challenge. In light of this evidence, understanding

Summarize: proach may hold promise, particularly in health education programs within diverse communities.
Current frameworks focus on constructs governing ���why��� a person engages in a certain
behavior and consequently ���what��� needs to be a target of an intervention to address this behavior.
They include (1) individual factors, such as attitudes, motivation, normative beliefs, and self-efficacy;
(2) interpersonal factors, such as social norms and social support; and (3) constructs that target the
different stages of behavioral change [9]. For example, the Health Belief Model [10] and Theory
of Planned Behavior [11] address individual factors that affect one���s health, such as attitudes,
motivation, or perceived behavioral control, just to name a few. Social Cognitive Theory [12],
Elaboration Likelihood Model [13], or Social Support Theory [14] build on individual models and
consider social factors that influence one���s health including social support, modeling, and persuasion.
The most recognized behavioral stage models���Transtheoretical Model [15] and the Diffusion of
Health Promotion Innovation Model [16]���are predominantly concerned with stage-wise, step-by-step
progression of adopting a healthy behavior. Finally, the Educational Entertainment concept [17]
focuses on utilizing different forms of art and entertainment as educational and communication tools.
Although these frameworks represent well-established approaches to health education, they tend to
focus on constructs that govern the ���why/what��� of human behavior, and they lack specific strategies to

The current frameworks in health education primarily focus on understanding the reasons behind human behavior and identifying target interventions. They consider individual factors such as attitudes, motivation, and self-efficacy, as well as interpersonal factors like social norms and social support. Models such as the Health Belief Model, Theory of Planned Behavior, and Transtheoretical Model address these factors and stages of behavioral change.
While these frameworks provide valuable insights into the "why" and "what" of human behavior, they often lack specific strategies for guiding the design and implementation of effective health campaigns, or the "how" of health education. This gap calls for a new approach that can provide practical guidance in diverse communities.
The concept paper suggests a Multisensory Multilevel Health Education Model (MMHEM) that incorporates three key domains: Art (innovativeness/creativity), Culture (cultural tailoring), and Science (evidence-based). This model emphasizes the importance of considering socio-ecological levels of influence on targeted behaviors while utilizing art, culture, and evidence-based strategies in health education interventions.
The MMHEM approach holds promise for addressing the challenges of effective health education in diverse communities. By combining innovative approaches, cultural sensitivity, and scientific evidence, this model offers a framework for designing and implementing impactful health campaigns that can overcome disparities and promote sustainable behavior change.
Overall, the concept paper highlights the need for a comprehensive approach that goes beyond understanding the "why" and "what" of behavior to provide practical strategies for effective health education, especially in diverse communities. The MMHEM offers a promising framework to guide the design and implementation of health campaigns, focusing on the "how" of health education.

2. The Multisensory Multilevel Health Education Model
2.1. Socio-Ecological Model (SEM) and Health Education: Foundation of the Multisensory Multilevel Health
Education Model (MMHEM)
Just as the English poet John Donne emphasized that ���no man is an island entire of itself; every
man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main���, the Socio-Ecological Model (SEM) affirms that
individuals exist within a broader environmental and social ecosystem that shapes their health
behaviors [18]. Recent data suggest that the more levels of influence are targeted by a health
campaign, the greater the probability that individuals will improve their health behaviors is [27].
Lewis and colleagues [28] examined whether the implementation of multilevel interventions, in
the case of diabetes self-management, optimizes the effects of the interventions. They found that
combining interventions on different levels of the SEM enhanced diabetes self-care among patients [28].
This effect was attributed to a ���convergence strategy������the idea that multilevel interventions reinforce
each other by changing the patterns of interactions between the stakeholders that are involved in a
particular health promotion endeavor. Although the benefits of multilevel interventions are clear,
health education interventions often target a single level of influence; and this singular focus can
result in missed opportunities to leverage the ���convergence strategy��� [29]. Therefore, we propose
a Multisensory Multilevel Health Education model that facilitates the a priori consideration of the
different levels of behavioral influence in the design of health education interventions, and we discuss
its major domains.
2.2. Art, Culture, and Science���Major Domains of the Multisensory Multilevel Health Education Model
One way to design health education programming is through the use of art
(innovativeness/creativity), culture (cultural tailoring), and science (evidence-based) (see Figure 1).
From the art perspective, researchers have long recognized the parallel between health communication
and the fields of creative marketing such as various forms of advertisements [30���32]. Despite their differences, the goal of health education and marketing is similar���that is to influence behavior
(health behavior or consumer behavior) in an innovative, effective, and sustainable manner [30].
In addition to the art domain, the health programs need to consider the individuals��� culture [33].
This consideration is particularly important in case of campaigns that target individuals from
culturally diverse communities [34], where social norms interact with the behavioral change that is
being sought. In fact, programs that are culturally discordant contribute to the failures of many health
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2019, 16, 872 4 of 17
campaigns [35]. Finally, health education programs need to be guided by the best available scientific
evidence���that is, they need to incorporate science or evidence that support their content, followed by
a rigorous evaluation of the program���s effectiveness prior to dissemination [36].

The MMHEM consists of three major domains: art (innovativeness/creativity), culture (cultural tailoring), and science (evidence-based). The use of art in health education draws parallels with creative marketing, aiming to influence behavior in an innovative and effective manner. Cultural tailoring recognizes the importance of considering individuals' cultural backgrounds, particularly in culturally diverse communities where social norms play a significant role in behavioral change. Finally, incorporating science and evidence-based practices ensures that health education programs are guided by the best available scientific knowledge and undergo rigorous evaluation before dissemination.
By integrating art, culture, and science, the MMHEM provides a comprehensive approach to health education that leverages innovative strategies, cultural sensitivity, and scientific evidence. This model aims to optimize the effectiveness of health education interventions by considering multiple levels of influence and promoting sustainable behavior change. The inclusion of these domains enhances the potential impact of health campaigns and addresses the missed opportunities that result from a singular focus on a single level of influence.
Overall, the MMHEM offers a framework that recognizes the importance of the socio-ecological context, artistic approaches, cultural tailoring, and evidence-based practices in the design of health education interventions. It emphasizes the need for a multisensory and multilevel approach to address the complex factors influencing health behaviors and improve the impact and sustainability of health education programs.
