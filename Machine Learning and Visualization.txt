That sounds like a fascinating project! Mapping 3D color spaces to musical microgenre spaces and exploring the connections between different modalities like keyboard mapping, theremin poi, dance, and sign language can lead to unique and immersive experiences in music.
To represent 3D color spaces as a vector space, you can consider using mathematical representations such as RGB (Red, Green, Blue) or HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness). These representations can be mapped to different dimensions or axes in a vector space, allowing you to visualize and manipulate color relationships.
Mapping this color space to a musical microgenre space involves finding meaningful associations between color and musical characteristics. For example, you could explore mappings that connect specific colors to different musical genres, moods, or instrumentation. This mapping can be subjective and open to interpretation based on personal preferences and cultural associations.
In addition to the keyboard-piano mapping, you can explore other possibilities to enhance the physical and textural aspects of music systems. Here are a few ideas:
Theremin Poi: Theremin poi is a combination of the theremin, an electronic musical instrument played without physical contact, and poi, a performance art using weighted balls attached to flexible handles. You could explore using theremin poi as a gestural interface for controlling musical parameters such as pitch, volume, or effects. The position and movement of the poi in 3D space can translate to musical expressions, providing a unique and interactive experience.
Dance: Dance movements can be mapped to musical elements to create a synchronized relationship between physical movements and sound. By analyzing and capturing dance gestures, you can generate or modify music in real-time based on the dancer's movements. This can result in a dynamic and visually captivating performance where the dancer's motion influences the musical composition.
ASL Sign Language: American Sign Language (ASL) has its own grammar, syntax, and expressive elements. You can explore mapping ASL signs to musical elements, such as specific notes, chords, or rhythms. This can create a connection between sign language and music, allowing individuals proficient in sign language to express themselves musically through gestures.
Exploring these possibilities can lead to innovative ways of experiencing and interacting with music. As you continue your project, consider prototyping and experimenting with different mappings and modalities to find the most engaging and expressive combinations.
