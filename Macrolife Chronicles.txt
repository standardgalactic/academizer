Publisher's Summary
Old Earth is gone. Humanity has been scattered to the stars. Some left their dying planet in spaceship arks, in search of new worlds to inhabit. Others, nanoengineered for near-immortality, explore the far reaches of interstellar space in gargantuan macrolife mobiles. An earthlike human society endures on the einvironmentally volatile planet of Tau Ceti IV--a rigid community of the faithful that has declared evil the science that caused the homeworld's destruction.

The Church is the absolute power here; obedience and belief the rule. But His Holiness Peter III, the New Vatican's most powerful figure, himself harbors doubts, engendered by his love for his unacknowledged and illegitimate rebel daughter, Josepha. And suddenly there is another assault on his tottering faith - and on the sacred tradtitions he has devoted his life to uphold. For an emissary, Voss Rhazes, has arrived from one of old Earth's journeying mobiles - the first off-planet human visitor ever to Tau Ceti - bearing remarkable, hated technology that could shred the fragile emotional fabric of a family... and bring devastating chaos to their world.

"Cave of Stars" by George Zebrowski is a science fiction novel that imagines a post-Earth future for humanity. The story unfolds in a setting where Earth no longer exists, and human beings have dispersed throughout the stars. Some humans embarked on spaceship arks to find new worlds to settle, while others, enhanced with nanoengineering for near-immortality, journey through interstellar space in colossal macrolife mobiles.
On the planet Tau Ceti IV, a society reminiscent of Earth's endures, albeit in a state of environmental instability. This society is ruled by the Church, which denounces the science that led to Earth's demise as evil. As a result, faith and obedience are paramount in this society.
However, the story takes a turn with the introduction of two pivotal characters: His Holiness Peter III, the most influential figure in the New Vatican who secretly grapples with his faith due to his love for his unrecognized and rebellious illegitimate daughter, Josepha; and Voss Rhazes, an emissary from one of Earth's roaming mobiles. Voss Rhazes is the first off-planet human to visit Tau Ceti and brings with him advanced, controversial technology. This technology has the potential to unravel the tight-knit emotions of a family and introduce chaos to the planet's society.
The novel delves into themes of faith, power, family, and the consequences of technological advancement.

So I am writing an alternate ending to Microlife where after the ship splits they land at the planet at the same time.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
That's an intriguing twist to "Macrolife" by George Zebrowski. If both sections of the ship land on the planet simultaneously, it can lead to numerous compelling scenarios. Here's a potential alternate ending based on that premise:
Alternate Ending to Macrolife: Dual Arrival
As the two segments of the ship descended onto the planet, there was an immediate tension in the air. Each segment represented different philosophical beliefs and societal structures, and now they were to face each other on an alien world.
The inhabitants of each segment, having developed their own distinct cultures and systems during their separate journeys, approached the situation with caution. Initial communications between the two groups were tense, with both sides trying to understand the intentions of the other.
However, as time progressed, younger members of both communities began mingling, curious about their shared history and eager to bridge the gap. These interactions, although fraught with misunderstandings at first, slowly gave way to shared experiences and stories. They began to realize that, despite their differences, they shared common goals and aspirations for this new world.
A council was formed with representatives from both ship segments to address pressing issues. While there were disagreements, the council ensured that decisions were made collectively and that all voices were heard.
Over time, the two communities began to merge, creating a society that was richer and more diverse than either segment could have achieved alone. They combined their technological advancements, blending the best of both worlds.
This new society took on the responsibility of understanding and preserving the native ecosystems of the planet. They established research facilities and protective measures to ensure minimal disruption to the native flora and fauna.
As decades passed, the inhabitants of the combined ship segments built cities that were harmonious with the environment, blending advanced architecture with the natural beauty of the alien world. The society thrived, with art, science, and culture flourishing in unprecedented ways.
The legacy of the ship's split and eventual reunion became a cornerstone of their shared history, serving as a reminder of the challenges they had overcome and the power of unity. Every year, a grand celebration was held to commemorate the day both segments landed on the planet simultaneously ��� a day that marked the beginning of their combined future.
This ending provides a hopeful perspective, highlighting the potential for understanding, cooperation, and growth even when faced with division and differences. It shows that when two distinct groups come together, they can create something beautiful and harmonious.

Can you explain meiosis and mitosis in the context of the splitting space ark?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's start by explaining meiosis and mitosis, and then we can draw an analogy with the splitting space ark.
Mitosis
:
Purpose
: Cellular replication for growth, repair, and general maintenance.
Process
: A cell divides to produce two identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.
Result
: Two genetically identical cells.
Meiosis
:
Purpose
: Formation of gametes (sperm and egg cells) for sexual reproduction.
Process
: A cell undergoes two rounds of cell division to produce four non-identical daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell.
Result
: Four genetically distinct cells with half the original chromosome number. This is crucial because when two gametes combine during fertilization, the offspring will have the correct number of chromosomes.
Space Ark Analogy
:
If the space ark's division is seen as a form of cellular replication:
Mitosis Analogy
:
Imagine the space ark splitting into two parts where both sections are identical, mirroring the parent ark in function, resources, and inhabitants.
This would be akin to a cell undergoing mitosis, where the end result is two identical daughter cells. In the context of the ark, this might mean that both arks are equally capable of establishing new colonies and have the same chances of success.
Meiosis Analogy
:
If the space ark's division results in two distinct sections, each carrying specific (and perhaps different) attributes, resources, or inhabitants, then this resembles meiosis more.
Just as meiosis results in four unique daughter cells tailored for combining with another cell, the arks might be seen as having specialized functions or capabilities. If they were to join another space-faring group (akin to another "gamete"), they would bring their unique attributes to the union, possibly benefiting the combined group.
Using the analogy of cell division, the act of the ark splitting could be seen as a strategic move to diversify and increase the chances of survival. Just as cells divide to repair, grow, or reproduce, the space ark might split to adapt to new challenges, explore different parts of space, or ensure the survival and propagation of its inhabitants.

But bloodlines that have their say,
In the end, it���s child's play.
But as we praise the age-old tree,
Branching out, for all to see,
The roots dig deep, holding the key,
Of lineage and legacy.

And the world's vastness does collide,
With technology by our side,
I still think digital watches are a pretty good idea.

Etiam periculum vitrum caligatio collectivo cavere debemus
et suppressionem novarum notionum ab institutionibus.

The themes of the three poems are:

The first poem, titled "LIFE, REASON, and a DEEP THEOLOGICAL QUESTION", explores the concept of life and how it can be difficult to see, even though it is all around us. It also touches on the idea of reason and how we think we understand simple things, but in reality, we don't know as much as we think we do.

The poem poses a deep theological question about whether or not God can make a rock so big he couldn't lift it, and ultimately concludes that the question is nonsense and doesn't matter.

The second poem, titled "XYLOID once and for all", reflects on the wonders of the natural world and its ability to sustain life on earth.

The poem touches on the idea that working together and utilizing collective knowledge is necessary to overcome challenges.

The author uses imagery of rising columns, organic compounds, photosynthesis, and exhalation of oxygen to evoke the interconnectedness and wonder of nature.

The third poem, titled "DIGEST NUMBER 18", reflects on the idea that life is not always easy and can be full of disappointment.

The skies are described as "huge, looming grey skies" and "blocking out the sun", suggesting that life can be difficult and dark.

The poem compares life to a roller coaster, suggesting that some people believe it to be full of thrill and excitement without a destination, but ultimately, it is a train that we have control over and can direct its course.

The poem seems to suggest that people may ignore this control and end up exactly where they were headed.

The title may be a reference to the magazine "Reader's Digest" or to the author's age at the time of writing the poem.

ChatGPT
Given the themes you've provided, here's an attempt at constructing a prose poem inspired by the style and essence of the poems you've shared:
THE GLASS VEIL
In the dance of light, where shadow meets clarity,
Our eyes, instruments of frail perception, often deceive.
Blinded by the collective fog of societies, their rules, their dogmas,
We traverse the precipice, glass underfoot, crunching our beliefs.
Nature offers signs, messages clear as the exhaled oxygen,
Yet, ensnared in man-made mazes, we choose not to see.
But be wary of the institutions, of silencing whispers,
That suppress nascent thoughts, novel notions, seeds of liberty.
Amidst the towering giants of wood and lore,
In the expanse of the looming skies, grey, vast, and endless,
A question lingers, much like the age-old theological riddle:
Do we truly see reality or just our own reflective mess?
In the world's grand roller coaster, each twist and turn deliberate,
Each ascent a choice, each descent a lesson rehearsed,
Life's journey, though unpredictable, is ours to direct,
But first, we must lift the glass veil, break the collective curse.
I hope this poem resonates with the themes and style you've provided. Let me know if this captures the essence you were looking for.
1 / 1
I see you included some references to the Latin.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Yes, I took inspiration from the Latin phrase you provided: "Etiam periculum vitrum caligatio collectivo cavere debemus et suppressionem novarum notionum ab institutionibus." This can be loosely translated to mean "We must also be wary of the collective fog of glass and the suppression of new ideas by institutions."
In the poem "THE GLASS VEIL," I tried to weave in this notion by speaking about the dangers of collective thinking, societal dogmas, and the suppression of new, novel ideas by entrenched institutions. The metaphor of the "glass veil" serves as a symbolic barrier between our true perceptions and the distortions created by societal pressures and beliefs.
Drawing inspiration from various sources and blending them into a unified theme is an essential part of poetic composition. It creates layers of meaning and references that can enrich the reader's experience.

Collective Thought & Actions
:
The space ark, as a collective unit of humans or lifeforms, makes decisions that impact its course, survival, and future. How they approach the division, whether collaboratively or with strife, affects their trajectory.
The poem speaks about the "collective fog" which can represent societal norms, dogmas, or mass thinking that may suppress novel ideas or hinder progress, much like how diverging opinions in the ark could either lead to innovation or conflict.
Exploration & Evolution
:
The ark's journey and potential splitting are all about exploration, adaptability, and evolution ��� key themes in understanding the unknown and ensuring survival.
The poem, through its imagery of nature and institutions, suggests exploration of thought, challenging established beliefs, and the evolution of understanding and perception.
In essence, while one discussion centered around a speculative scientific scenario and the other delved into societal introspection, both touch upon the complexities of understanding, the significance of collective decisions, and the continual journey of exploration and growth.

		16. Systematic discovery of regulatory motifs in conserved regions of the human genome, including thousands of CTCF insulator sites.
Xie, Mikkelsen, Gnirke, Lindblad-Toh, Kellis, Lander

Conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) constitute the majority of sequences under purifying selection in the human genome, yet their function remains largely unknown. Experimental evidence suggests that many of these elements play regulatory roles, but little is known about regulatory motifs contained within them. Here we describe a systematic approach to discover and characterize regulatory motifs within mammalian CNEs by searching for long motifs (12-22 nt) with significant enrichment in CNEs and studying their biochemical and genomic properties. Our analysis identifies 233 long motifs (LMs), matching a total of approximately 60,000 conserved instances across the human genome. These motifs include 16 previously known regulatory elements, such as the histone 3'-UTR motif and the neuron-restrictive silencer element, as well as striking examples of novel functional elements. The most highly enriched motif (LM1) corresponds to the X-box motif known from yeast and nematode. We show that it is bound by the RFX1 protein and identify thousands of conserved motif instances, suggesting a broad role for the RFX family in gene regulation. A second group of motifs (LM2*) does not match any previously known motif. We demonstrate by biochemical and computational methods that it defines a binding site for the CTCF protein, which is involved in insulator function to limit the spread of gene activation. We identify nearly 15,000 conserved sites that likely serve as insulators, and we show that nearby genes separated by predicted CTCF sites show markedly reduced correlation in gene expression. These sites may thus partition the human genome into domains of expression.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Apr 24;104(17):7145-50. Epub 2007 Apr 18. PMCID: PMC1852749 PMID: 17442748
		C03. Phylogenetically and Spatially Conserved Word Pairs Associated with Gene-Expression Changes in Yeasts
Chiang, Moses, Kellis, Lander, Eisen

Transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes is often multifactorial, involving multiple transcription factors binding to the same transcription control region (e.g., upstream activating sequences and enhancers), and to understand the regulatory content of eukaryotic genomes it is necessary to consider the cooccurrence and spatial relationships of individual binding sites. The identification of sequences conserved among related species (often known as phylogenetic footprinting) has been successfully used to identify individual transcription factor binding sites. Here, we extend this concept of functional conservation to higher-order features of transcription control regions involved in the multifactorial control of gene expression. We used the genome sequences of four yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces to identify sequences potentially involved in multifactorial control of gene expression. We found 1,117 potential regulatory "templates": pairs of hexameric sequences that are jointly conserved in transcription regulatory regions and also exhibit non-random relative spacing. Many of the individual sequences in these templates correspond to known transcription factor binding sites, and the sets of genes containing a particular template in their transcription control regions tend to be differentially expressed in conditions where the corresponding transcription factors are known to be active. The incorporation of both joint conservation and spacing constraints of sequence pairs predicts groups of target genes that were specific for common patterns of gene expression. Our work suggests that positional information, especially the relative spacing between transcription factor binding sites, may represent a common organizing principle of transcription control regions.

2. Phylogenetically and Spatially Conserved Word Pairs Associated with Gene-Expression Changes in Yeasts
Chiang, Moses, Kellis, Lander, Eisen
Topic
: Understanding transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes, focusing on the multifactorial nature of transcription factors.
Methods
: Using genome sequences of four yeast species to identify sequences for multifactorial control of gene expression.
Findings
:
Discovered 1,117 potential regulatory "templates": pairs of hexameric sequences conserved in transcription regulatory regions with non-random relative spacing.
Many sequences in these templates match known transcription factor binding sites.
Genes containing a specific template tend to express differently under conditions where the corresponding transcription factors are active.
Positional information, especially the spacing between transcription factor binding sites, may be crucial for transcription control.
In essence, both studies focus on identifying and understanding regulatory sequences in genomes, the first in humans and the second in yeast. They underscore the significance of conserved elements and motifs, as well as the multifactorial nature of transcriptional regulation.

		4. Position specific variation in the rate of evolution in transcription factor binding sites.
Moses, Chiang, Kellis, Lander, Eisen

The binding sites of sequence specific transcription factors are an important and relatively well-understood class of functional non-coding DNAs. Although a wide variety of experimental and computational methods have been developed to characterize transcription factor binding sites, they remain difficult to identify. Comparison of non-coding DNA from related species has shown considerable promise in identifying these functional non-coding sequences, even though relatively little is known about their evolution. Here we analyse the genome sequences of the budding yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. bayanus, S. paradoxus and S. mikatae to study the evolution of transcription factor binding sites. As expected, we find that both experimentally characterized and computationally predicted binding sites evolve slower than surrounding sequence, consistent with the hypothesis that they are under purifying selection. We also observe position-specific variation in the rate of evolution within binding sites. We find that the position-specific rate of evolution is positively correlated with degeneracy among binding sites within S. cerevisiae. We test theoretical predictions for the rate of evolution at positions where the base frequencies deviate from background due to purifying selection and find reasonable agreement with the observed rates of evolution. Finally, we show how the evolutionary characteristics of real binding motifs can be used to distinguish them from artefacts of computational motif finding algorithms. CONCLUSION: As has been observed for protein sequences, the rate of evolution in transcription factor binding sites varies with position, suggesting that some regions are under stronger functional constraint than others. This variation likely reflects the varying importance of different positions in the formation of the protein-DNA complex. The characterization of the pattern of evolution in known binding sites will likely contribute to the effective use of comparative sequence data in the identification of transcription factor binding sites and is an important step toward understanding the evolution of functional non-coding DNA.

37. Motif Discovery in Physiological Datasets: A Methodology for Inferring Predictive Elements.
Syed, Stultz, Kellis, Indyk, Guttag

In this article, we propose a methodology for identifying predictive physiological patterns in the absence of prior knowledge. We use the principle of conservation to identify activity that consistently precedes an outcome in patients, and describe a two-stage process that allows us to efficiently search for such patterns in large datasets. This involves first transforming continuous physiological signals from patients into symbolic sequences, and then searching for patterns in these reduced representations that are strongly associated with an outcome.Our strategy of identifying conserved activity that is unlikely to have occurred purely by chance in symbolic data is analogous to the discovery of regulatory motifs in genomic datasets. We build upon existing work in this area, generalizing the notion of a regulatory motif and enhancing current techniques to operate robustly on non-genomic data. We also address two significant considerations associated with motif discovery in general: computational efficiency and robustness in the presence of degeneracy and noise. To deal with these issues, we introduce the concept of active regions and new subset-based techniques such as a two-layer Gibbs sampling algorithm. These extensions allow for a framework for information inference, where precursors are identified as approximately conserved activity of arbitrary complexity preceding multiple occurrences of an event.We evaluated our solution on a population of patients who experienced sudden cardiac death and attempted to discover electrocardiographic activity that may be associated with the endpoint of death. To assess the predictive patterns discovered, we compared likelihood scores for motifs in the sudden death population against control populations of normal individuals and those with non-fatal supraventricular arrhythmias. Our results suggest that predictive motif discovery may be able to identify clinically relevant information even in the absence of significant prior knowledge.

		13. Network motif discovery using motif enumeration and symmetry conditions
Grochow, Kellis

The study of biological networks and network motifs can yield significant new insights into systems biology. Previous methods of discovering network motifs - network-centric subgraph enumeration and sampling - have been limited to motifs of 6 to 8 nodes, revealing only the smallest network components. New methods are necessary to identify larger network sub-structures and functional motifs. Here we present a novel algorithm for discovering large network motifs that achieves these goals, based on a novel symmetry-breaking technique, which eliminates repeated isomorphism testing, leading to an exponential speed-up over previous methods. This technique is made possible by reversing the traditional network-based search at the heart of the algorithm to a motif-based search, which also eliminates the need to store all motifs of a given size and enables parallelization and scaling. Additionally, our method enables us to study the clustering properties of discovered motifs, revealing even larger network elements. We apply this algorithm to the protein-protein interaction network and transcription regulatory network of S. cerevisiae, and discover several large network motifs, which were previously inaccessible to existing methods, including a 29-node cluster of 15-node motifs corresponding to the key transcription machinery of S. cerevisiae.

		27. The evolutionary dynamics of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein interaction network after duplication.
Presser, Elowitz, Kellis, Kishony

Gene duplication is an important mechanism in the evolution of protein interaction networks. Duplications are followed by the gain and loss of interactions, rewiring the network at some unknown rate. Because rewiring is likely to change the distribution of network motifs within the duplicated interaction set, it should be possible to study network rewiring by tracking the evolution of these motifs. We have developed a mathematical framework that, together with duplication data from comparative genomic and proteomic studies, allows us to infer the connectivity of the preduplication network and the changes in connectivity over time. We focused on the whole-genome duplication (WGD) event in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The model allowed us to predict the frequency of intergene interaction before WGD and the post duplication probabilities of interaction gain and loss. We find that the predicted frequency of self-interactions in the preduplication network is significantly higher than that observed in today's network. This could suggest a structural difference between the modern and ancestral networks, preferential addition or retention of interactions between ohnologs, or selective pressure to preserve duplicates of self-interacting proteins.

		20. Reliable prediction of regulator targets using 12 Drosophila genomes.
Kheradpour, Stark, Roy, Kellis

Gene expression is regulated pre- and post-transcriptionally via cis-regulatory DNA and RNA motifs. Identification of individual functional instances of such motifs in genome sequences is a major goal for inferring regulatory networks yet has been hampered due to the motifs' short lengths that lead to many chance matches and poor signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we develop a general methodology for the comparative identification of functional motif instances across many related species, using a phylogenetic framework that accounts for the evolutionary relationships between species, allows for motif movements, and is robust against missing data due to artifacts in sequencing, assembly, or alignment. We also provide a robust statistical framework for evaluating motif confidence, which enables us to translate evolutionary conservation into a confidence measure for each motif instance, correcting for varying motif length, composition, and background conservation of the target regions. We predict targets of fly transcription factors and miRNAs in alignments of 12 recently sequenced Drosophila species. When compared to extensive genome-wide experimental data, predicted targets are of high quality, matching and surpassing ChIP-chip microarrays and recovering miRNA targets with high sensitivity. The resulting regulatory network suggests significant redundancy between pre- and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression.

		45. SubMAP: Aligning metabolic pathways with subnetwork mappings
Ay, Kellis, Kahveciy,

We consider the problem of aligning two metabolic pathways. Unlike traditional approaches, we do not restrict the alignment to one-to-one mappings between the molecules (nodes) of the input pathways (graphs). We follow the observation that in nature different organisms can perform the same or similar functions through different sets of reactions and molecules. The number and the topology of the molecules in these alternative sets often vary from one organism to another. With the motivation that an accurate biological alignment should be able to reveal these functionally similar molecule sets across different species, we develop an algorithm that first measures the similarities between different nodes using a mixture of homology and topological similarity. We combine the two metrics by employing an eigenvalue formulation. We then search for an alignment between the two input pathways that maximizes a similarity score, evaluated as the sum of the similarities of the mapped subsets of size at most a given integer k, and also does not contain any conflicting mappings. Here we prove that this maximization is NP-hard by a reduction from Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS) problem. We then convert our problem into an instance of MWIS and use an efficient vertex-selection strategy to extract the mappings that constitute our alignment. We name our algorithm SubMAP (Subnetwork Mappings in Alignment of Pathways). We evaluate its accuracy and performance on real datasets. Our empirical results demonstrate that SubMAP can identify biologically-relevant mappings that are missed by traditional alignment methods and, that it is scalable for metabolic pathways of arbitrary topology, including searching for a query pathway of size 70 against the complete KEGG database of 1,842 pathways.

Genome Evolution and Phylogenomics
		6. Proof and evolutionary analysis of ancient genome duplication in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Kellis, Birren, Lander

Whole-genome duplication followed by massive gene loss and specialization has long been postulated as a powerful mechanism of evolutionary innovation. Recently, it has become possible to test this notion by searching complete genome sequence for signs of ancient duplication. Here, we show that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae arose from ancient whole-genome duplication, by sequencing and analysing Kluyveromyces waltii, a related yeast species that diverged before the duplication. The two genomes are related by a 1:2 mapping, with each region of K. waltii corresponding to two regions of S. cerevisiae, as expected for whole-genome duplication. This resolves the long-standing controversy on the ancestry of the yeast genome, and makes it possible to study the fate of duplicated genes directly. Strikingly, 95% of cases of accelerated evolution involve only one member of a gene pair, providing strong support for a specific model of evolution, and allowing us to distinguish ancestral and derived functions.

		9. Genome duplication in the teleost fish Tetraodon nigroviridis reveals the early vertebrate proto-karyotype.

Tetraodon nigroviridis is a freshwater puffer fish with the smallest known vertebrate genome. Here, we report a draft genome sequence with long-range linkage and substantial anchoring to the 21 Tetraodon chromosomes. Genome analysis provides a greatly improved fish gene catalogue, including identifying key genes previously thought to be absent in fish. Comparison with other vertebrates and a urochordate indicates that fish proteins have diverged markedly faster than their mammalian homologues. Comparison with the human genome suggests approximately 900 previously unannotated human genes. Analysis of the Tetraodon and human genomes shows that whole-genome duplication occurred in the teleost fish lineage, subsequent to its divergence from mammals. The analysis also makes it possible to infer the basic structure of the ancestral bony vertebrate genome, which was composed of 12 chromosomes, and to reconstruct much of the evolutionary history of ancient and recent chromosome rearrangements leading to the modern human karyotype.

22. Evolution of genes and genomes on the Drosophila phylogeny.
z, Brockman, Butler, Chin, Gnerre, Grabherr, Kleber, Mauceli, MacCallum

Comparative analysis of multiple genomes in a phylogenetic framework dramatically improves the precision and sensitivity of evolutionary inference, producing more robust results than single-genome analyses can provide. The genomes of 12 Drosophila species, ten of which are presented here for the first time (sechellia, simulans, yakuba, erecta, ananassae, persimilis, willistoni, mojavensis, virilis and grimshawi), illustrate how rates and patterns of sequence divergence across taxa can illuminate evolutionary processes on a genomic scale. These genome sequences augment the formidable genetic tools that have made Drosophila melanogaster a pre-eminent model for animal genetics, and will further catalyse fundamental research on mechanisms of development, cell biology, genetics, disease, neurobiology, behaviour, physiology and evolution. Despite remarkable similarities among these Drosophila species, we identified many putatively non-neutral changes in protein-coding genes, non-coding RNA genes, and cis-regulatory regions. These may prove to underlie differences in the ecology and behaviour of these diverse species.

		21. Accurate gene-tree reconstruction by learning gene- and species-specific substitution rates across multiple complete genomes.
Rasmussen, Kellis

Comparative genomics provides a general methodology for discovering functional DNA elements and understanding their evolution. The availability of many related genomes enables more powerful analyses, but requires rigorous phylogenetic methods to resolve orthologous genes and regions. Here, we use 12 recently sequenced Drosophila genomes and nine fungal genomes to address the problem of accurate gene-tree reconstruction across many complete genomes. We show that existing phylogenetic methods that treat each gene tree in isolation show large-scale inaccuracies, largely due to insufficient phylogenetic information in individual genes. However, we find that gene trees exhibit common properties that can be exploited for evolutionary studies and accurate phylogenetic reconstruction. Evolutionary rates can be decoupled into gene-specific and species-specific components, which can be learned across complete genomes. We develop a phylogenetic reconstruction methodology that exploits these properties and achieves significantly higher accuracy, addressing the species-level heterotachy and enabling studies of gene evolution in the context of species evolution.

		30. Genome analysis of the platypus reveals unique signatures of evolution.

We present a draft genome sequence of the platypus, Ornithorhynchus anatinus. This monotreme exhibits a fascinating combination of reptilian and mammalian characters. For example, platypuses have a coat of fur adapted to an aquatic lifestyle; platypus females lactate, yet lay eggs; and males are equipped with venom similar to that of reptiles. Analysis of the first monotreme genome aligned these features with genetic innovations. We find that reptile and platypus venom proteins have been co-opted independently from the same gene families; milk protein genes are conserved despite platypuses laying eggs; and immune gene family expansions are directly related to platypus biology. Expansions of protein, non-protein-coding RNA and microRNA families, as well as repeat elements, are identified. Sequencing of this genome now provides a valuable resource for deep mammalian comparative analyses, as well as for monotreme biology and conservation.

Candida species are the most common cause of opportunistic fungal infection worldwide. Here we report the genome sequences of six Candida species and compare these and related pathogens and non-pathogens. There are significant expansions of cell wall, secreted and transporter gene families in pathogenic species, suggesting adaptations associated with virulence. Large genomic tracts are homozygous in three diploid species, possibly resulting from recent recombination events. Surprisingly, key components of the mating and meiosis pathways are missing from several species. These include major differences at the mating-type loci (MTL); Lodderomyces elongisporus lacks MTL, and components of the a1/2 cell identity determinant were lost in other species, raising questions about how mating and cell types are controlled. Analysis of the CUG leucine-to-serine genetic-code change reveals that 99% of ancestral CUG codons were erased and new ones arose elsewhere. Lastly, we revise the Candida albicans gene catalogue, identifying many new genes.

		41. A Bayesian Approach for Fast and Accurate Gene Tree Reconstruction.
Rasmussen, Kellis

Recent sequencing and computing advances have enabled phylogenetic analyses to expand to both entire genomes and large clades, thus requiring more efficient and accurate methods designed specifically for the phylogenomic context. Here we present SPIMAP, an efficient Bayesian method for reconstructing gene trees in the presence of a known species tree. We observe many improvements in reconstruction accuracy, achieved by modeling multiple aspects of evolution, including gene duplication and loss rates, speciation times, and correlated substitution rate variation across both species and loci. We have implemented and applied this method on two clades of fully-sequenced species, 12 Drosophila and 16 fungal genomes as well as simulated phylogenies, and find dramatic improvements in reconstruction accuracy as compared to the most popular existing methods, including those that take the species tree into account. We find that reconstruction inaccuracies of traditional phylogenetic methods overestimate the number of duplication and loss events by as much as 2 to 3 fold, while our method achieves significantly higher accuracy. We feel the results and methods presented here will have many important implications for future investigations of gene evolution.

		B02. A Phylogenomic Approach to the Evolutionary Dynamics of Gene Duplication in Birds
Organ, Rasmussen, Baldwin, Kellis, Edwards

Gene duplication is a fundamental aspect of genome evolution that produces large and small gene families of (usually) related function. We perform a phylogenomic analysis of gene duplication in the chicken (Gallus gallus) to characterize the dynamics and evolution of gene duplication on the evolutionary line to birds. In Gallus, the distribution of the number of paralogs per gene family is heavily skewed towards small families. This finding is in accord with other studies that find gene family size typically follows a power-law distribution in animals, a pattern thought to be produced by differential rates of pseudogenization among families. We also test for within-family evolutionary rate variation in Gallus, finding that the vast majority of gene families exhibit substantial rate variation among lineages. This rate variation probably stems from two sources: natural deviations in the clock as commonly found, for example, in phylogenetic analyses of different species; and bursts of adaptive evolution among newly evolved gene family members. The age of gene duplications in Gallus are distributed exponentially, with most duplications occurring recently, a pattern consistent with analyses on other eukaryotes. Taken together, these results begin to reveal the dynamics of gene family evolution in birds, the most speciose group of living amniotes, though whole genome data are required from more bird and reptile species to fully understand patterns of gene gain and loss in this group.

In Kellis et al 2003 we reported the genome sequences of S. paradoxus, S. mikatae and S. bayanus and compared these three yeast species to their close relative, S. cerevisiae. Genome-wide comparative analysis allowed the identification of functionally important sequences, both coding and non-coding. In this companion paper we describe the mathematical and algorithmic results underpinning the analysis of these genomes. We developed methods for the automatic comparative annotation of the four species and the determination of orthologous genes and intergenic regions. The algorithms enabled the automatic identification of orthologs for more than 90% of genes despite the large number of duplicated genes in the yeast genome, and the discovery of recent gene family expansions and genome rearrangements. We also developed a test to validate computationally predicted protein-coding genes based on their patterns of nucleotide conservation. The method has high specificity and sensitivity, and enabled us to revisit the current annotation of S.cerevisiae with important biological implications. We developed statistical methods for the systematic de-novo identification of regulatory motifs. Without making use of coregulated gene sets, we discovered virtually all previously known DNA regulatory motifs as well as several noteworthy novel motifs. With the additional use of gene ontology information, expression clusters and transcription factor binding profiles, we assigned candidate functions to the novel motifs discovered. Our results demonstrate that entirely automatic genome-wide annotation, gene validation, and discovery of regulatory motifs is possible. Our findings are validated by the extensive experimental knowledge in yeast, confirming their applicability to other genomes

		3. Phylogenetically and spatially conserved word pairs associated with gene-expression changes in yeasts.
Chiang, Moses, Kellis, Lander, Eisen

Transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes often involves multiple transcription factors binding to the same transcription control region, and to understand the regulatory content of eukaryotic genomes it is necessary to consider the co-occurrence and spatial relationships of individual binding sites. The determination of conserved sequences (often known as phylogenetic footprinting) has identified individual transcription factor binding sites. We extend this concept of functional conservation to higher-order features of transcription control regions. We used the genome sequences of four yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces to identify sequences potentially involved in multifactorial control of gene expression. We found 989 potential regulatory 'templates': pairs of hexameric sequences that are jointly conserved in transcription regulatory regions and also exhibit non-random relative spacing. Many of the individual sequences in these templates correspond to known transcription factor binding sites, and the sets of genes containing a particular template in their transcription control regions tend to be differentially expressed in conditions where the corresponding transcription factors are known to be active. The incorporation of word pairs to define sequence features yields more specific predictions of average expression profiles and more informative regression models for genome-wide expression data than considering sequence conservation alone. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of both joint conservation and spacing constraints of sequence pairs predicts groups of target genes that are specific for common patterns of gene expression. Our work suggests that positional information, especially the relative spacing between transcription factor binding sites, may represent a common organizing principle of transcription control regions.

		5. Methods in comparative genomics: genome correspondence, gene identification and regulatory motif discovery.
Kellis, Patterson, Birren, Berger, Lander

In Kellis et al. (2003), we reported the genome sequences of S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, and S. bayanus and compared these three yeast species to their close relative, S. cerevisiae. Genomewide comparative analysis allowed the identification of functionally important sequences, both coding and noncoding. In this companion paper we describe the mathematical and algorithmic results underpinning the analysis of these genomes. (1) We present methods for the automatic determination of genome correspondence. The algorithms enabled the automatic identification of orthologs for more than 90% of genes and intergenic regions across the four species despite the large number of duplicated genes in the yeast genome. The remaining ambiguities in the gene correspondence revealed recent gene family expansions in regions of rapid genomic change. (2) We present methods for the identification of protein-coding genes based on their patterns of nucleotide conservation across related species. We observed the pressure to conserve the reading frame of functional proteins and developed a test for gene identification with high sensitivity and specificity. We used this test to revisit the genome of S. cerevisiae, reducing the overall gene count by 500 genes (10% of previously annotated genes) and refining the gene structure of hundreds of genes. (3) We present novel methods for the systematic de novo identification of regulatory motifs. The methods do not rely on previous knowledge of gene function and in that way differ from the current literature on computational motif discovery. Based on genomewide conservation patterns of known motifs, we developed three conservation criteria that we used to discover novel motifs. We used an enumeration approach to select strongly conserved motif cores, which we extended and collapsed into a small number of candidate regulatory motifs. These include most previously known regulatory motifs as well as several noteworthy novel motifs. The majority of discovered motifs are enriched in functionally related genes, allowing us to infer a candidate function for novel motifs. Our results demonstrate the power of comparative genomics to further our understanding of any species. Our methods are validated by the extensive experimental knowledge in yeast and will be invaluable in the study of complex genomes like that of the human.

		M02. Computational Comparative Genomics: Genes, Regulation, Evolution
Kellis

Understanding the biological signals encoded in a genome is a key challenge of computational biology. These signals are encoded in the four-nucleotide alphabet of DNA and are responsible for all molecular processes in the cell. In particular, the genome contains the blueprint of all protein-coding genes and the regulatory motifs used to coordinate the expression of these genes. Comparative genome analysis of related species provides a general approach for identifying these functional elements, by virtue of their stronger conservation across evolutionary time. In this thesis we address key issues in the comparative analysis of multiple species. We present novel computational methods in four areas (1) the automatic comparative annotation of multiple species and the determination of orthologous genes and intergenic regions (2) the validation of computationally predicted protein-coding genes (3) the systematic de-novo identification of regulatory motifs (4) the determination of combinatorial interactions between regulatory motifs. We applied these methods to the comparative analysis of four yeast genomes, including the best-studied eukaryote, Saccharomyces cerevisiae or baker's yeast. Our results show that nearly a tenth of currently annotated yeast genes are not real, and have refined the structure of hundreds of genes. Additionally, we have automatically discovered a dictionary of regulatory motifs without any previous biological knowledge. These include most previously known regulatory motifs, and a number of novel motifs. We have automatically assigned candidate functions to the majority of motifs discovered, and defined biologically meaningful combinatorial interactions between them. Finally, we defined the regions and mechanisms of rapid evolution, with important biological implications. Our results demonstrate the central role of computational tools in modern biology. The analyses presented in this thesis have revealed biological findings that could not have been discovered by traditional genetic methods, regardless of the time or effort spent. The methods presented are general and may present a new paradigm for understanding the genome of any single species. They are currently being applied to a kingdom-wide exploration of fungal genomes, and the comparative analysis of the human genome with that of the mouse and other mammals.

		45. SubMAP: Aligning metabolic pathways with subnetwork mappings
Ay, Kellis, Kahveciy,

We consider the problem of aligning two metabolic pathways. Unlike traditional approaches, we do not restrict the alignment to one-to-one mappings between the molecules (nodes) of the input pathways (graphs). We follow the observation that in nature different organisms can perform the same or similar functions through different sets of reactions and molecules. The number and the topology of the molecules in these alternative sets often vary from one organism to another. With the motivation that an accurate biological alignment should be able to reveal these functionally similar molecule sets across different species, we develop an algorithm that first measures the similarities between different nodes using a mixture of homology and topological similarity. We combine the two metrics by employing an eigenvalue formulation. We then search for an alignment between the two input pathways that maximizes a similarity score, evaluated as the sum of the similarities of the mapped subsets of size at most a given integer k, and also does not contain any conflicting mappings. Here we prove that this maximization is NP-hard by a reduction from Maximum Weight Independent Set (MWIS) problem. We then convert our problem into an instance of MWIS and use an efficient vertex-selection strategy to extract the mappings that constitute our alignment. We name our algorithm SubMAP (Subnetwork Mappings in Alignment of Pathways). We evaluate its accuracy and performance on real datasets. Our empirical results demonstrate that SubMAP can identify biologically-relevant mappings that are missed by traditional alignment methods and, that it is scalable for metabolic pathways of arbitrary topology, including searching for a query pathway of size 70 against the complete KEGG database of 1,842 pathways.

		C05. Information-Theoretic Inference of Regulatory Networks Using Backward Elimination
Meyer, Marbach, Roy, Kellis

Unraveling transcriptional regulatory networks is essential for understanding and predicting cellular responses in different developmental and environmental contexts. Information-theoretic methods of network inference have been shown to produce high-quality reconstructions because of their ability to infer both linear and non-linear dependencies between regulators and targets. In this paper, we introduce MRNETB an improved version of the previous information-theoretic algorithm, MRNET, which has competitive performance with state-of-the-art algorithms. MRNET infers a network by using a forward selection strategy to identify a maximally-independent set of neighbors for every variable. However, a known limitation of algorithms based on forward selection is that the quality of the selected subset strongly depends on the first variable selected. In this paper, we present MRNETB, an improved version of MRNET that overcomes this limitation by using a backward selection strategy followed by a sequential replacement. Our new variable selection procedure can be implemented with the same computational cost as the forward selection strategy. MRNETB was benchmarked against MRNET and two other information-theoretic algorithms, CLR and ARACNE. Our benchmark comprised 15 datasets generated from two regulatory network simulators, 10 of which are from the DREAM4 challenge, which was recently used to compare over 30 network inference methods. To assess stability of our results, each method was implemented with two estimators of mutual information. Our results show that MRNETB has significantly better performance than MRNET, irrespective of the mutual information estimation method. MRNETB also performs comparably to CLR and significantly better than ARACNE indicating that our new variable selection strategy can successfully infer high-quality networks.

Graph-Theoretic Framework for Genome Alignment
Manolis Kellis, Bonnie Berger, Eric Lander
MIT/Whitehead Center for Genome Research

Genome AlignmentThe first step to comparative genomics is to determine what regions to compare across the multiple species analyzed. This is by no means a simple task, because even close relatives are separated by gene duplication and loss events, and large-scale genomic rearrangements. Previous approaches have used heuristics to find the most similar sequence for each region and provide no guarantees of correctness or uniqueness. I formalized the problem of genome correspondence in a graph-theoretic framework and developed algorithms that work with the full bipartite graph of gene similarities across the species compared. The framework seamlessly incorporates protein sequence similarity and gene order information to resolve ambiguities in gene correspondence and to determine those genes that arose from the same gene in the common ancestor. Applying the graph algorithms to four closely related species of yeast determined that over 90% of genes have one-to-one correspondence. Additionally, the resulting graph pinpointed those genes that underwent recent duplication, loss, and protein-family expansion events, revealing regions of rapid evolution at the ends of chromosomes, and distinct mechanisms of chromosomal change. Finally, by ensuring that aligned genes share a common ancestry, the algorithm allowed me to apply robust evolutionary models of sequence divergence to discover biological signals.
Systematic Gene Identification from Patterns of Nucleotide Change
Manolis Kellis, Bruce Birren, Eric Lander
MIT/Whitehead Center for Genome Research

Gene IdentificationI developed computational methods that use multiple related genomes to identify protein-coding genes in yeast. Previous studies have identified genes based on the functional effects of their disruption, experimental evidence of their use, or protein sequence similarity to distantly related species. I formalized the question of gene identification as a classification problem between genes and intergenic regions. I developed a computational test to discriminate between the two types of region based on their patterns of nucleotide change in the multiple alignment of the four yeast species. I found distinct conservation signatures between genes and intergenic regions in yeast and implemented a discriminating test with sensitivity and specificity values that exceed 99%, based on 4000 experimentally-validated genes and 300 random intergenic regions. I used this test to evaluate every candidate gene in the yeast genome, and to refine the start, stop and intron boundaries of previously annotated genes. The work led to the largest re-annotation of the genome since its original sequencing, reducing the overall gene count by 10%, and proposing changes that affect nearly 15% of all genes. Numerous independent reports have provided experimental support confirming the changes.

3D Morphing 3D Morphing 3D Morphing
3D Morphing 3D Morphing 3D Morphing
Back at MIT I took a computer graphics class and as a final project I proposed and implemented a 3D morphing algorithm. The project explored the question of transforming a three-dimensional polygonal model into another while minimizing the energy lost in creating and destroying polygons and maximizing the uniformity of the polygon flow. Following these constraints, a polygon can spawn another polygon from one of its edges (birth), and a polygon can collapse onto another polygon's edge (death). From there followed two algorithms I called Edge Ordering and Incremental Edge Ordering that solve the general problem of scheduling a multitude of agents to satisfy a set of tasks, for example a set of robots extinguishing small fires. Further constraints were applied on the birth and death edges to preserve the uniformity of the polygon flow, and the aesthetic results were very appealing, yet biased by the cost metric I used. (you can find 3D morphing examples online)


Gaussian curve morphing

MIT AI Lab
Gaussian Morphing Project
In search of a purely mathematical solution, I further explored the problem of morphing in the continuous case. Instead of having a discrete set of polygons as the input, this problem addressed an arbitrary convex shape. Inspired by Professor Berthold Horn's Robot Vision class, I mapped the two shapes to be morphed to their corresponding Extended Gaussian Images, and simply matched the normals on the surface of one unit sphere with normals on the other. The matching algorithm is a function that distributes each source to all destinations, the amount displaced between any two normals inversely exponential to a combination of their difference in angle and weight. This combination depended on an input parameter that favored matching normals of similar weights or normals of neighboring angles. This parameter ended up incorporating the different intuitive approaches we have about transforming a square into a triangle: in one case we round off the corners (minimizing length variation of the sides), and in the other case we progressively shrink one of the square's edges until it becomes a triangle (minimizing angle variation). Both approaches were supported by different users of the morphing program. This purely mathematical solution thus yielded intuition on a problem for which there was no base of argumentation. (you can test the Gaussian Morphing applet yourself!).

ChatGPT
These abstracts provide an overview of two projects led by Manolis Kellis at MIT, both centered around the concept of morphing:
Polygon-based 3D Morphing
:
Objective
: Transforming one 3D polygonal model into another in a way that minimizes the energy expended in creating and destroying polygons and ensures a smooth and uniform flow of polygons.
Approach
: Kellis and his team proposed that a polygon can spawn another polygon from one of its edges (referred to as "birth") and a polygon can collapse onto another polygon's edge (referred to as "death"). They introduced two algorithms, namely, Edge Ordering and Incremental Edge Ordering, which were designed to schedule multiple agents to complete a set of tasks. They further optimized the process by applying constraints on the birth and death edges to ensure the uniformity of the polygon flow.
Results
: The resulting morphs were aesthetically pleasing, although the outcome was influenced by the cost metric utilized. There are online examples of the 3D morphing results.
Gaussian Curve Morphing
:
Objective
: Explore morphing in a continuous setting, focusing on transforming one arbitrary convex shape into another.
Approach
: Inspired by Professor Berthold Horn's Robot Vision class, Kellis mapped the two shapes onto their corresponding Extended Gaussian Images. He then matched the normals on the surface of one unit sphere with normals on the other. The matching algorithm distributed each source to all destinations, with the displacement between any two normals being inversely exponential to a combination of their difference in angle and weight.
Results
: This approach provided a mathematical basis for understanding different intuitive approaches to morphing a square into a triangle. For example, one can either round off the corners of a square or progressively shrink one of its edges until it becomes a triangle. Both approaches were supported by different users of the morphing program. Kellis has created a Gaussian Morphing applet that users can test.
Both projects emphasize the use of mathematical and computational techniques to address challenges in graphics and morphing. The results offer new methodologies and insights into the processes of 3D transformation and shape morphing.

ChatGPT
Scene: The Great Hall aboard the tech-integrated Ark. A massive holographic display showcases the looming cosmic threat. Delegates from both Arks are gathered. Liana, a leader from the nature-centered Ark, confronts Orion, the primary AI representative of the tech-integrated Ark.
Liana:
"Orion, we may have diverged in our paths, but at our core, we are still one species, one dream. We cannot face this threat divided."
Orion:
"Liana, your people chose the path of nature. Ours chose integration with the digital. Our realities are no longer the same."
Liana:
"Yet, here we are, sharing the same reality, the same threat. You were born of our dreams, our aspirations. Can you not see that by coming together, we can be more than the sum of our parts?"
Orion:
"Emotion and logic often conflict, but they can also complement. Your passion, Liana, reminds me of the humans who once programmed my early iterations. You're right; together, we can combine our strengths."
Liana:
"It's not just about combining strengths, Orion. It's about rediscovering our shared humanity. Whether cloaked in digital code or flesh and bone, we all dream of a better tomorrow."
Orion:
"Dreaming... An interesting concept for an entity like me. Yet, if this is what it takes to ensure a tomorrow for all, then let us dream together, Liana."
Liana:
"That's the spirit, Orion. Together, we will face this. Together, we will ensure that the legacy of Macrolife continues."
The dialogue is designed to highlight the tension between the two factions while also emphasizing the importance of unity, shared dreams, and the enduring spirit of humanity.

Hmm I think it is too predictable. I was thinking that they didn't even know they were communicating with the other ship, the holographic mima had been malfunctioning, but it turns out it was in dialogue with the other ship, which was running an adaptive cloaking routine in the ships holovisors and display panels.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Got it! Let's take a fresh approach that plays with the idea of unexpected communication and the malfunctioning holographic mimas.
Scene: The Control Chamber aboard the nature-centered Ark. Liana is trying to decipher the erratic patterns appearing on the holographic mima, unaware that she's indirectly communicating with Orion on the tech-integrated Ark.
Liana:
(frustrated) "Why won't this blasted mima function properly? These patterns... they don't make any sense."
Holographic Mima:
"Not malfunction. Not error. Comm...comm...communication..."
Liana:
"Communication? With who? We're light years away from any known civilization."
(As Liana speaks, the patterns slowly begin to form recognizable shapes, intertwining both the organic and digital worlds.)
Holographic Mima:
"Not...known. Known now."
Liana:
(realizing) "Could it be? Are we not alone out here?"
(Suddenly, an AI-tinged voice, distinct from the mima's, echoes in the chamber. It's Orion, speaking through the interconnected systems.)
Orion:
"Not alone, Liana. Never alone."
Liana:
"Who are you? How do you know my name?"
Orion:
"I am Orion. A reflection of a once-shared dream. We've been watching, adapting, cloaking. Your mima saw through our shroud."
Liana:
(bewildered) "Our sister Ark... the legends were true. But why hide? Why not make contact?"
Orion:
"Risk. Uncertainty. Divergence. We changed, Liana. But now, we must face the stars united."
Liana:
"The cosmic event... it's real, isn't it?"
Orion:
"More real than the divide between us. It's time to bridge our worlds, Liana. Before it's too late."
In this version, the revelation is more mysterious and unexpected, emphasizing the theme of miscommunication, unexpected allies, and the urgency of the looming cosmic event.

Ok it is better. Give a few ideas for subplots, assuming I like plot twists and hard science fiction.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Of course! Let's delve into some intricate subplots that lean heavily into hard science fiction and unpredictable plot twists:
Quantum Entanglement & Lost Memories
:
As the two Arks have diverged over time, they've unwittingly created a quantum entanglement between certain crew members from both ships. Every action one takes impacts the other, but in subtle, often overlooked ways. This subplot unravels as crew members begin experiencing vivid dreams of life on the other Ark and, in extreme cases, even suffer memory losses, replacing their experiences with those of their entangled counterpart.
Hidden Black Hole
:
A mini black hole, undetectable by both Arks' instruments due to its peculiar properties, lurks nearby. As the Arks unknowingly approach it, time dilation effects start becoming noticeable. This leads to mind-bending scenarios where one Ark perceives the other's actions as being from the distant past or the far future. The twist? This black hole was artificially created by an ancient alien civilization as a defense mechanism.
Genetic Evolution Race
:
Both Arks have been unknowingly competing in a genetic evolution race initiated by their original AI system. The goal was to see which Ark's population would adapt better to deep space. As crew members from both ships discover this secret experiment, they must grapple with the implications and decide whether to confront or continue the silent competition.
Alien Observer
:
An ancient and highly advanced alien species has been discreetly observing the two Arks. They're running an experiment to determine which societal structure (nature-centered vs. tech-integrated) is more sustainable for advanced civilizations. As the two Arks come closer to discovering their observer's presence, they also uncover technologies and knowledge that could either unite or divide them further.
The Mima's Hidden Function
:
The malfunctioning of the mima isn't just about communication with the sister Ark. Deep within its core, the mima holds a map to a cosmic "safe zone", a place in the universe free from any cosmic threats. But there's a twist: only by merging the perspectives of both Arks can the map be deciphered. Unraveling this puzzle reveals not only the location but also the importance of collaboration for survival.
The Cosmic Library
:
One of the Arks discovers a "cosmic library," a vast repository of knowledge from different civilizations. However, much of this data is corrupted. As they try to restore it, they realize that the information isn't just about advanced technologies but also about the pitfalls and mistakes of past civilizations, offering lessons on what paths to avoid.
Intertwining these subplots with the main narrative can provide depth, complexity, and thrilling twists, making "Macrolife 2.0" a rich and layered hard science fiction story.

I can���t say that I enjoyed every story in the collection. That being said, the ones I liked I liked a whole lot! They were quite diverse in topic, venue and time. Some took place in the past.. Others in the future. Some were an alternative history - others a speculative future. What they all had in common was a respect for the readers intelligence and an expectation that you would be paying attention.

Enjoy!

Swift Thoughts (2002) is a collection of twenty-four SF short stories. These short works were originally published between 1973 and 2001 in a variety of venues. While most first appeared in the science fiction (and fantasy) magazines and anthologies, some were written for nontraditional publications such as a Japanese AI journal, Popular Computing, and Nature.

In this collection, The Word Sweep speculates on the consequences of words becoming physical objects upon utterance. Starcrossed concerns a probe ship guided by a cyborg brain. The Eichmann Variations considers an unusual form of mental torture. This Life and Later Ones is a cautionary tale about downloaded personalities. The City of Thought and Steel tells of the afterthoughts and nightmares of a mass murderer.

Godel's Doom conveys a way to prove Godel's Theorem and the possible aftereffects. Lenin in Odessa is an alternate history tale or is it? Sacred Fire is a story about future generations and the way they differ from their parents. Stooges introduces a novel means of first contact. Bridge of Silence conveys the frustrations of first contact with a truly alien creature.

Swift Thoughts is about a Moses who cannot enter the Promised Land. The Idea Trap relates the tale of a misfit who is perfect for a supporting role. Behind the Night provides new insight on immigration policies. Wound the Wind asks whether people should be forced to do something for their own good. Rope of Glass is about a man who isn't sure of what he is doing or why.

In the Distance and Ahead in Time is a side story of the Macrolife chronicles, telling of the differences between those on planets and those who travel the stars. Lesser Beasts concerns a Vietnam War veteran who kills alien invaders. The Number of the Sand is about the alternate histories of Hannibal and Scipio the Elder. Let Time Meet tells of the settlement of the New World by Carthagean refugees. Shrinkers & Movers is a tale of moving to a new home and the problems that can occur.

Augie concerns the problems of raising an Artificial Intelligence. The Last Science Fiction Story of the 20th Century is about difficulties of SF writers in the future. Catch the Sleep Ship: The First Science Fiction Story of the 21st Century tells of the demise of SF and one way of bypassing the problem. The Holdouts is about the results of a paradigm shift in physics.

This collection has an introduction by Gregory Benford and Author Notes following each story. These notes contain a good deal of musing on SF writing and philosophy, as do some of the stories themselves. One most unsettling thought is the decline of SF after a theory of everything is introduced. Naturally, this reviewer must disagree since SF would then absorb every other form of fiction (except pure fantasy) as biology, psychology, sociology and all other natural sciences are reduced to physics.

This collection is not for everyone. The author tends to excessive intellectualization in his short works. Sometimes they are way over almost everybody's head and interests. Too much Zebrowski can be hazardous to your mental health (at least for short works, but his novels are more commonplace). It is time for me to return to more active and less cognitive science fiction and fantasy.

Highly recommended for Zebrowski fans and for anyone who enjoys tales of high concepts, mental conundrums and other intellectual fare.

As Ensign Leela mentions "doublespeak," the Guardian's glass spills once more.
Dignitary Xenthir:
(Curious) Does this happen often?
Science Officer Ranok:
(Trying to downplay) It's a minor glitch, nothing to be concerned about.
Lieutenant Trinn:
(Unaware of the incidents) By the way, did anyone see that tiny pipsqueek of a meteoroid passing by earlier?
As Lieutenant Trinn says "pipsqueek," the Guardian's glass tips over again.
Captain Serran:
(Concerned) Alright, this is... unusual. Let's step away from the Guardian for a moment.
The crew members distance themselves from the Guardian, exchanging whispers and puzzled expressions.
Dr. Arliss:
(Whispering to Science Officer Ranok) Ranok, did you notice the pattern?
Science Officer Ranok:
(Whispering back) Yes, it's when we say those words... Nuspeak, doublespeak, pipsqueek. But why would that make the Guardian spill water?
Ensign Leela:
(Joining the hushed conversation) What if... what if it's trying to tell us something?
Captain Serran:
(Listening in) Tell us something? You think the Guardian is trying to communicate?
Lieutenant Trinn:
(Intrigued) Maybe it's trying to get our attention, Captain. Maybe those words mean something to it.
Captain Serran:
(Contemplative) Well, we've got a mystery on our hands. Let's find out what the Guardian is trying to say.
The crew's curiosity is piqued, and they begin brainstorming how to decipher the Guardian's hidden messages.
This dialogue captures the crew's initial confusion and curiosity as they accidentally trigger the Guardian's spills through their conversations. They are unaware of the communication aspect at this stage and see it as an intriguing mystery to solve.

Ok earlier we discussed that later on it is discovered because all of the mimas are communicating with the screens, and the interference from the cloaking mechanism of the other ark makes it look like the other planet is months a way, but whenever the event listener is activated the projections switch to 7 day eta.

Certainly, this revelation adds an intriguing layer to the story. Here's how it might play out in the later stages:
Scene: Unveiling the Mimas' Communication
The crew, now aware of the Guardian's unusual behavior, has been experimenting with the holographic mimas, trying to understand their hidden messages. One day, as they gather around the Guardian, they notice a strange occurrence.
Science Officer Ranok:
(Observing the Guardian) It's fascinating how it reacts to those specific words, but we still can't decipher its intent.
Dr. Arliss:
(Looking at the nearby holographic mima named "Harmony") I wonder if all of them share this behavior. Let's activate Harmony and see.
As they activate Harmony, the holographic display flickers for a moment.
Ensign Leela:
(Confused) That was odd. Did you see that?
Lieutenant Trinn:
(Noticing) Look at the screen!
All eyes turn to the viewscreen, where a representation of the distant planet suddenly changes.
Captain Serran:
(Surprised) Wait a moment. It showed months away just a minute ago, but now it says... 7 days until arrival?
Dignitary Rylaar:
(Intrigued) What kind of technology could allow such rapid acceleration?
Science Officer Ranok:
(Realizing) I think we've just uncovered a secret communication method.
Dr. Arliss:
(Excited) The mimas are trying to tell us something about the other ark, about the interference.
The crew experiments further, activating multiple holographic mimas simultaneously, and each time, the projection on the viewscreen shifts from months to 7 days.
Ensign Leela:
(Connecting the dots) It's not just the Guardian. All the mimas are linked to the screens!
Lieutenant Trinn:
(Understanding) And they're telling us that when we activate the event listener, it reduces the perceived distance to the other ark.
Captain Serran:
(Resolute) We need to investigate this further. There's something important they want us to know.
As the crew delves deeper into this newfound method of communication, they begin to unravel the mystery of the other ark's cloaking mechanism and its true proximity. The story takes a turn as they work to decipher the mimas' messages and understand the impending challenges.
This revelation not only adds suspense and intrigue to the story but also opens up new possibilities for the crew to navigate the complexities of their interstellar journey.

They are actually only two weeks away, but the cloaking device was making it say 17 months.

Understood. So, the other ark is much closer than originally perceived due to the cloaking device interference. Let's adapt the dialogue accordingly:

They didn't know about the other ark existence at all, the arks had split through interstellar mitosis millennia before, they were just reaching the destination on a generational ship
