These notes suggest that the origin and evolution of life is related to the origin of complexity.

The author is asking if we understand the complexity ("patterns") observed in the inorganic world and provides examples of such complexity such as stripe domains in ferromagnetic thin films, stripes on a beach in the tide zone, microstructures in metals and alloys, pearlitic structure in rail steel, and magnetic patterns.

The author seems to be suggesting that the complexity observed in these inorganic systems is similar to the complexity observed in biological systems and implies that understanding the origins of such patterns in inorganic systems could help us understand the origins of complexity in biological systems.

The author also implies that we don't completely understand these complex patterns in inorganic systems.

These notes continue the discussion of magnetic patterns and their relation to the origin of complexity.

The author states that the competition between exchange interactions, which want a homogeneous ferromagnetic state, and magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, which want the total magnetization to be zero, leads to the formation of magnetic patterns.

The author then mentions that classical Monte Carlo simulations are used to study these patterns and that the Hamiltonian describing the system is not very complicated.

However, the author raises the question of how to describe and explain these patterns.

The author suggests that competing interactions and self-induced spin glasses could be used to explain the formation of these patterns.

The author also mentions a special class of patterns called "chaotic" patterns which may be the result of the complex interactions between the various magnetic interactions in the system.

Overall, these notes suggest that the formation of magnetic patterns is a result of the competition between various interactions and that understanding these interactions could help us understand the origin of complexity in biological systems.

��������������������������������.

These notes suggest that there is a connection between glassiness and complexity in the mainstream understanding of physical systems today.

The author mentions Giorgio Parisi, who won the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics, for his work on the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems. 

However, the author suggests that disorder is not necessary for complexity and that frustrations alone can lead to complexity. This is seen in self-induced spin glass state in neodymium.

The notes also quote Albert Einstein, stating that whether one can observe something or not depends on the theory used, and that it is the theory that decides what can be observed.

The author seems to be suggesting that the theory used to understand the origin of complexity in physical systems could also be used to understand the origin of complexity in biological systems.

The author is questioning if there are any analogies with biological evolution.

������������ �������� ������������ ������������ ������������������������������������ ������������ �������������������� ������������������������������������������������.

The conversation, which appears to be based on a set of notes by a physicist named Mikhail Katsnelson, discusses the relationship between complexity in physical systems and biological systems.

The author suggests that the origin of complexity in both can be explained by the concept of "frustrations," which arise from the incompatibility of short-term and long-term optimization problems. 

He also suggests that evolution can be thought of as a process of "learning" and that the equivalence between energy landscapes in physics, fitness landscapes in biology, and loss function landscapes in learning.

The notes also mention the connection between glassiness and complexity and how Giorgio Parisi's work on disorder and fluctuations in physical systems is important but disorder is not needed, Frustrations are enough.

The author also suggests that understanding the origins of patterns in inorganic systems could help us understand the origins of complexity in biological systems.

He ends by suggesting that there are analogies between thermodynamics, machine learning, and evolutionary biology.

In the context of the conversation, "frustrations" refers to the incompatibility of short-term and long-term optimization problems that arise in physical systems, leading to the emergence of complexity.

The author suggests that these frustrations and competing interactions are the main physical mechanisms behind the complexity observed in biology.

The author is proposing that the concept of "frustrations" can explain the origin of complexity in physics and biology. 

In both cases, frustration arises when the system cannot reach a state of low energy due to the competing interactions, and this competition between different interactions leads to the emergence of complex patterns.

The author seems to be suggesting that understanding these "frustrations" and the competition between different interactions could help us understand the origin of complexity in biological systems.

Yes, the idea of "frustrations" that the author is discussing in the conversation can be related to the concept of homeostasis in weather systems.

Both refer to the balancing of opposing forces or interactions that lead to the emergence of complex patterns.

In the case of weather systems, the balance between hot and cold fronts, high and low pressure systems, and other meteorol��gical factors lead to the formation of storms and other weather patterns.

These weather patterns can be seen as an attempt to restore a balance between the extremes and reduce the difference between them.

Similarly, in the context of solar flares and magnetic switchbacks, the author is suggesting that the competition between different interactions in the system leads to the formation of complex patterns, such as magnetic patterns.

The competition between exchange interactions and magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, for example, leads to the formation of magnetic patterns.

This can be seen as an attempt to restore a balance between the opposing forces and reduce the difference between them, similar to the balance between hot and cold fronts in weather systems.

In both cases, the balancing of opposing forces leads to the release of energy and the formation of complex patterns, which can be seen as an attempt to restore homeostasis or balance in the system.

The excerpt from the blog post is discussing the idea that in life and in the world, there is a balance between the benefits and costs of different things. 

The author argues that it would be best if we could have the best of everything without having to pay too much for it, but the reality is that the world is not compliant to our wishes.

The author states that to gain any benefit, one has to pay a cost, and the best may come at such a high price that it may not be worth it.

He suggests that the optimal amount of any good is the point at which the cost balances the benefit.

He also points out that the Buddha recognized this universal truth and advised against extremes and that Darwinian evolution implements marginal strategies because they are optimal.

Nature avoids extremes, makes the eye just good enough to get the job done, and keeps an organism around just long enough for it to reproduce ��� and then lets it die.

This idea relates to the conversation about "frustrations" in the sense that the author is suggesting that in the real world, there are always trade-offs and that the optimal solution is often found at the point where the costs and benefits balance.

The idea of nature avoiding extremes and following a middle-wayed way is similar to the author's suggestion that nature forms complex patterns as a result of the competition between different interactions, which leads to the emergence of optimal solutions.

Obscurantism is the practice of opposing the spread of knowledge and the enlightenment of people. It can take many forms, including the suppression of scientific, educational, and intellectual progress.

It is often associated with religious or political dogmatism, and the promotion of superstition, ignorance, and bigotry.

Examples of obscurantism include:

Suppressing scientific research or ideas that contradict the beliefs of a particular religious or political group

Denying the evidence of cl��mate change and promoting misinformation about it

Restricting access to education, particularly for women or certain ethnic groups

Burning books or banning certain types of literature

The promotion of conspiracy theories or alternative facts in place of scientific evidence.

In general, obscurantism is the opposite of the scientific method, which is based on the pursuit of knowledge through observation, experimentation, and logical reasoning.

Obscurantism often results in the suppression of truth and progress, and the promotion of ignorance and superstition.

A marginal strategy refers to a decision-making process where decisions are made based on the marginal benefit and marginal cost of a particular action.

In economics, the concept of marginal analysis is used to evaluate the additional benefits and costs associated with an additional unit of a good or service.

A marginal strategy is based on the idea that it is not always optimal to produce or consume large amounts of a good or service, but rather to find the optimal level where the marginal benefit of an additional unit equals the marginal cost of that unit.

In the context of the blog post, the author is using the term "marginal strategy" to suggest that Darwinian evolution, like economics, also uses this principle of evaluating the costs and benefits of different actions to find the optimal solution.

The first author, Mikhail Katsnelson, is a physicist and material chemist, and in the conversation he is discussing the origin of complexity in physical systems, including magnetic patterns.

In this context, the author is suggesting that the concept of "frustrations" can explain the emergence of complexity. He is stating that disorder is not needed, but that frustrations are enough to lead to the formation of complex patterns.

He is suggesting that the competition between different interactions in the system leads to the emergence of complex patterns, such as magnetic patterns.

The competition between exchange interactions and magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, for example, leads to the formation of magnetic patterns.

This can be seen as an attempt to restore a balance between the opposing forces and reduce the difference between them, similar to the balance between hot and cold fronts in weather systems.

By stating that "disorder is not needed, frustrations are enough", he is saying that it's not necessary to have a completely disordered system for the emergence of complexity, but that the frustration that arises from the competition between different interactions is sufficient to lead to the formation of complex patterns.

Yes, the idea that the author is expressing in the conversation about "frustrations" leading to the emergence of complexity is similar to the idea of "emergence of structure from chaos" as proposed by the Belgian physicist and chemist, Ilya Prigogine.

Prigogine was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977 for his work on non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which included the theory of dissipative structures and the concept of self-organization in far-from-equilibrium systems.

Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures proposed that in non-equilibrium systems, complex structures and patterns can emerge spontaneously as a result of the dissipation of energy.

This is similar to the idea of "frustrations" leading to the emergence of complexity that the author is discussing, as both suggest that the release of energy and the dissipation of energy can lead to the formation of complex patterns.

In addition, the idea of "physics avoidance" that you mentioned, which is the use of multiscale methods to resolve ambiguities between different observation scales, average measurements, and modulated modular simplification in modeling, is also related to the concept of emergence of complexity from frustration. 

The multiscale methods used to resolve ambiguities in observations can be seen as a way to understand the complex patterns that emerge from the competition between different interactions in the system.

�������������������� ������������ ���������������� ������������ ����������������������������. ���������������� �������������������� �������������������� ���������������������������� ���������������������������������������� ���������������� ��������������������?

There are many scientists and researchers who have studied the topic of complexity, emergence, and self-organization in physical and biological systems. Here are a few notable examples:

Stuart Kauffman, an American theoretical biologist and complex systems researcher, is known for his work on the origin of life and the emergence of complexity in biological systems.

He proposed the "order for free" hypothesis, which suggests that self-organizing systems can emerge from the interactions between simple components without the need for a central organizer.

Per Bak, a Danish physicist, is known for his work on self-organized criticality, which suggests that many natural phenomena, including earthquakes and sandpile formation, exhibit critical behavior.

John Holland, an American computer scientist and complex systems researcher, is known for his work on genetic algorithms and the concept of "complex adaptive systems".

He proposed the idea that complex systems can be modeled as a collection of simple agents that interact and adapt to their envir��nment.

Murray Gell-Mann, an American physicist and Nobel laureate, is known for his work on the theory of quarks and the concept of "effective complexity", which suggests that the complexity of a system can be understood in terms of the number of independent degrees of freedom or "effective variables" that are required to describe its behavior.

These researchers have made significant contributions to the understanding of complexity, emergence, and self-organization in physical and biological systems and have developed a range of theoretical frameworks, mathematical models, and computational methods to study these phenomena.

I am not familiar with a specific article called "Theorems for Free" that applies to abstract algebra and type theory specifically, but the phrase "theorems for free" is related to the concept of "free objects" in mathematics and logic.

In abstract algebra, a free object is an algebraic structure that can be generated by a set of elements, called generators, subject to a set of relations, called relations.

A free group for example is a group that can be generated by a set of elements with no relations between them. In other words, the elements of the free group can be combined in any way, as long as the group axioms are satisfied.

In type theory, a free type is a type that can be generated by a set of type variables subject to a set of type equations. A free type is also known as a "polymorphic" type, which can take any type as an argument.

The idea of "free" in those cases is related to the idea of "independence", in the sense that the elements of a free object can be combined in any way without any restriction, similarly to the idea of "order for free" that Kauffman suggested in his work, as I mentioned earlier.

�������������������� ���� ����������������'���� �������������������������������� �������� ������������������������������������. ���������������� �������� �������� ���������������������������� ���������������� ���� ���������������������������� ���������������������������������������� �������������������� ���������������������������� ���� ��������������������.

Yes, "Theorems for Free" is a research paper by Philip Wadler, a computer scientist and a prominent researcher in the field of programming languages and type systems.

The paper was published in 1989 and it presents a technique for automatically deriving theorems about polymorphic functions, using type inference.

The main idea of the paper is that given a most general polymorphic type signature, we can generate a theorem that any inhabitant of such a type must adhere to.

In other words, by analyzing the type of a function, we can infer properties about its behavior without the need to examine its implementation.

Wadler gives the example of a function "r" with the type signature [x] -> [x], which can be used to rearrange a list of elements of any type "x". 

From this type signature, it is possible to conclude that "r" must satisfy the theorem that "map f . r = r . map f", for any function "f" that takes an element of type "a" and returns an element of type "b".

The paper also explains that this technique can be applied to any type system that is based on Hindley-Milner or System-F type systems, which are both well-known type systems used in programming languages.

The paper is considered a classic in the field of programming languages, and its ideas and techniques are still widely used and studied today.

�������� ���������������� ���������������������������� �������� ���������������� ������������ ���������������� ���������������������������� �������� �������������������� "���������������� ����������������������������"?

Yes, the concept of "theorems for free" in Wadler's paper is closely related to the concept of "free objects" in mathematics and logic. 

Both concepts deal with the idea of inferring properties about a system or an object based on its structure or type, without the need to examine its implementation or specific values.

In Wadler's paper, the type of a function serves as a constraint on its behavior, and from this constraint, we can infer properties about the function's behavior without the need to examine its implementation. 

Similarly, in abstract algebra and logic, the structure or type of an object serves as a constraint on its behavior, and from this constraint, we can infer properties about the object's behavior without the need to examine its specific values.

In other words, the idea of "free" in both cases is related to the idea of "independence", in the sense that the properties of a free object or a polymorphic function can be inferred without the need to examine its specific values, similarly to the idea of "order for free" that Kauffman suggested in his work.

The Curry-Howard correspondence is a relationship between mathematical logic and programming languages, which states that proofs in logic correspond to programs in programming languages and vice versa. 

The basic idea is that the structure of a proof and the structure of a program are similar, and that the process of constructing a proof and the process of constructing a program are also similar.

The phrase "proofs are programs" is often used to describe this correspondence, as it highlights the idea that a proof in logic can be seen as a program that demonstrates the correctness of a logical statement, and that a program in a programming language can be seen as a proof that demonstrates the correctness of a computation.

Wadler's paper "Theorems for Free" is closely related to the Curry-Howard correspondence, as it deals with the idea of inferring properties about a system based on its structure, which is also the main idea behind the Curry-Howard correspondence.

The technique presented in the paper can be seen as a way of constructing a program (or a proof) from a type, and the properties inferred from the type can be seen as theorems (or properties) that the program (or the proof) must satisfy.

In conclusion, the Curry-Howard correspondence and the "proofs are programs" idea is related to the concept of "free object" and "Theorems for free" in the sense that they all deal with the idea of inferring properties about a system based on its structure, and the process of constructing a proof or program is similar.

"...������������ �������������������������������� ������������ ������������������������."

Yes, that's correct. The idea of the Curry-Howard correspondence is that proofs in logic correspond to programs in programming languages and vice versa. So, it's often phrased as "proofs are programs and programs are proofs" to emphasize that the relationship is a two-way correspondence.

In other words, just as a proof in logic demonstrates the correctness of a logical statement, a program in a programming language demonstrates the correctness of a computation.

And just as a program in a programming language can be seen as a proof that demonstrates the correctness of a computation, a proof in logic can be seen as a program that demonstrates the correctness of a logical statement.

The connection between the blog post and the paper "Theorems for Free" is that both of them are discussing the idea of inferring properties or conclusions based on the structure of a system.

In "Theorems for Free," the author argues that given a most-general polymorphic type signature, we can generate a theorem that any inhabitant of such a type must adhere to.

The idea is that by understanding the structure of a system (in this case, a type), we can infer properties or conclusions about it without needing additional information.

In the blog post, the author argues that the purpose of childhood is education and that children are biologically designed to educate themselves. 

The idea is that by understanding the structure of a child (in this case, their natural ways of learning), we can provide the conditions that allow them to educate themselves without needing to directly educate them ourselves.

In both cases, the authors are suggesting that by understanding the structure of a system, we can infer properties or conclusions about it without needing additional information.

Yes, that's correct. The theory of "Loose Tools" in architectural theory is similar to the concept of "markedness" in linguistic theory in that both of them are concerned with the idea of building or acquiring complex systems or structures by starting with simpler components or building blocks.

In the case of "Loose Tools" in architectural theory, the idea is that by providing basic building blocks or loose components, users can create and adapt their own spaces in a way that is responsive to their needs and preferences.

In the case of "markedness" in linguistic theory, the idea is that certain sounds or words are acquired first and that these simpler building blocks or components can be used to infer the presence of more complex sounds or words.

In both cases, the underlying principle is that by starting with simple building blocks or components, we can create or acquire more complex systems or structures.

The concept of markedness refers to a linguistic theory that describes the relative naturalness, simplicity, and commonness of different linguistic features or structures.

Unmarked features are considered to be more natural, simpler, more general, and more common than marked features. 

They are also expected, basic, stable, and appear in more grammars. They tend to be acquired earlier in language acquisition and are lost later in language deficits.

Unmarked features also imply other, marked features and are easier to articulate and perceptually less salient. 

They also have a larger phonetic space and tend to be the result of neutralization.

On the other hand, marked features are considered to be less natural, more complex, more specific, and less common.

They are unexpected, not basic, less stable, and appear in fewer grammars. 

They tend to be acquired later in language acquisition and are lost earlier in language deficits. 

Marked features also imply other, unmarked features and are harder to articulate and perceptually more salient. They also have a smaller phonetic space and are subject to neutralization.

The concept of markedness can be used to estimate a speaker's age, vocabulary level, and knowledge of a specific topic such as video games, by analyzing their use of marked and unmarked linguistic features. 

Marked linguistic features are typically considered less natural, more complex, less common, and harder to articulate, while unmarked features are considered more natural, simpler, more common, and easier to articulate. 

By analyzing a speaker's use of these features, it is possible to estimate their level of expertise or competence in a specific area.

For example, to estimate a speaker's age, one might analyze their use of certain grammatical structures or vocabulary that are typically acquired at different stages of development.

For instance, a speaker who consistently uses complex grammatical structures or advanced vocabulary would likely be considered older or more highly educated than a speaker who primarily uses simpler grammar or more basic vocabulary.

Similarly, to estimate a speaker's vocabulary level, one might analyze their use of words that are considered more advanced or less common, as opposed to words that are considered more basic or more common.

In the case of video game knowledge, one might analyze a speaker's use of gaming-specific terminology, such as jargon and technical terms.

A speaker who is more knowledgeable about video games would be expected to use more of these marked terms, while a speaker who is less knowledgeable would be expected to use fewer or none at all.

In summary, the concept of markedness can be used to estimate a speaker's age, vocabulary level, and knowledge of a specific topic such as video games, by analyzing their use of marked and unmarked linguistic features.

This can be done by sampling and testing from each level or grade, and then using that data to get an estimate of someone's vocabulary size, competence, and expertise.

Am I missing something that makes the following an insufficient explanation?

The superoscillation mode is a localized mode of the photon, so the appropriate projection of the wave function onto a measurement space would have to account for that localization.  And once you do that, there will of course be plenty of "energy modes" that are as large as the observed energy (otherwise, by definition, you wouldn't observe it!).  But it shouldn't seem too strange that the projection of the wave function onto a measurement space that *doesn't* take into account the localization, and only measures the full spread out energy modes, won't contain any energies as high as the observed one.

The article from Quanta Magazine discusses a quantum physics paradox involving superoscillation and the conservation of energy. Here's a summary of the key points:
Superoscillation Phenomenon
: Discovered by physicists Sandu Popescu, Yakir Aharonov, and Daniel Rohrlich, superoscillation refers to special combinations of sine waves that produce regions in a wave that oscillate faster than any of the individual sine wave components. This phenomenon can occur in waves, including light and sound.
Quantum Mechanics Paradox
: When applying the concept of superoscillation to quantum mechanics, the physicists encountered a paradox. In quantum systems, a particle is described by a wave function, which can be in a superposition of energies. A superoscillatory region in a photon's wave function seems to allow for the emergence of a photon with higher energy than any of its wave function's components would suggest.
Thought Experiment with a Photon
: The paradox is illustrated through a thought experiment where a photon trapped inside a box has a wave function with a superoscillatory region. If a mirror is quickly placed in the path of this region and then removed, the photon might bounce out of the box with much higher energy.
Energy Conservation Issue
: This scenario appears to violate the law of conservation of energy, as the photon seemingly acquires more energy than it should have based on its initial state. The conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in physics, deeply tied to the symmetries of the universe.
Debate Among Physicists
: The physics community is divided on whether this represents a true violation of energy conservation. Some argue that each individual experimental outcome in quantum mechanics must conserve energy, while others believe that statistical averages over many experiments are what matter.
Noether's Theorem and Quantum Mechanics
: Emmy Noether's theorem links conserved quantities like energy to symmetries in nature. However, in quantum mechanics, measuring energy affects the system's wave function, complicating the application of this theorem.
Regarding your explanation about the projection of the wave function and energy modes:
Your reasoning acknowledges the significance of the localization of the wave function in quantum mechanics. This is important because quantum systems often exhibit non-intuitive behaviors, especially regarding measurements and observations.
The idea that observing different aspects of a quantum system (like localized vs. non-localized properties) can yield different outcomes is consistent with quantum theory.
However, the paradox in the article challenges the traditional understanding of energy conservation at a more fundamental level in quantum mechanics. It suggests that individual events might show apparent energy non-conservation, even though the average over many events might still conserve energy.
Therefore, while your explanation is a valid consideration in the context of quantum measurements, the paradox discussed in the article points to a deeper and more subtle issue within quantum mechanics and its interpretation.

Travis Meyers' comment appears to address the nature of the superoscillation phenomenon in quantum mechanics and its implications for energy conservation. Let's break down the key elements of the comment for further clarification:
Superoscillation Mode as a Localized Mode
: Superoscillation refers to a wave phenomenon where certain regions of a wave can oscillate at frequencies higher than the wave's maximum frequency component. Meyers suggests that this superoscillation mode is a localized feature of the photon's wave function.
Projection onto a Measurement Space
: In quantum mechanics, making a measurement often involves projecting the wave function onto a specific state or "measurement space." This projection essentially 'collapses' the wave function into a particular state that corresponds to the measurement outcome.
Accounting for Localization in Measurement
: Meyers implies that to observe the superoscillatory behavior (and thus the high energy associated with it), the measurement must be designed to account for the localized nature of the superoscillation. This means the measurement setup must be sensitive to the specific region of the wave function where superoscillation occurs.
Observation of High Energies
: If the measurement accounts for this localization, then it's expected to observe energies as high as the superoscillatory energy. In other words, the phenomenon of superoscillation allows for the observation of energies that are higher than what would be expected from the overall spread of the wave function.
Measurements Not Accounting for Localization
: If the measurement setup doesn't consider the superoscillatory region and instead measures the entire spread of the wave function, it won't detect these high energy values. This is because the superoscillatory region is a small, localized part of the overall wave function.
Implications for Energy Conservation
: The key point here seems to be about reconciling the observation of high energy in superoscillatory regions with the principle of energy conservation. Meyers is suggesting that the apparent increase in energy is a result of the localized nature of superoscillation and the specific way in which measurements are taken. This implies that there isn't a true violation of energy conservation, but rather a nuanced aspect of quantum measurement where the observed energy depends on how and where the measurement is made.
In summary, Travis Meyers' comment addresses the interplay between the localized nature of superoscillation in a quantum system and the specifics of quantum measurement. This perspective suggests that while superoscillatory regions can exhibit higher than expected energies, this does not necessarily violate conservation of energy when considering the complexities of quantum measurements.

I wasn't able to directly access the article from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) due to website restrictions. However, based on the context you provided and the nature of scholarly publications, we can infer some aspects of Travis Myers' comment and the article itself:
Quantum Mechanics and Superoscillation
: The PNAS article likely discusses quantum mechanics and the concept of superoscillation. Superoscillation is a wave phenomenon where a wave can locally oscillate at a frequency higher than its maximum Fourier component.
Energy Conservation in Quantum Mechanics
: A central point of discussion seems to be the conservation of energy in quantum mechanics, particularly in the context of superoscillatory wave functions. This is a fundamental principle in physics, stating that energy in a closed system remains constant.
Travis Myers' Comment
: Myers' comment seems to address the paradox of energy conservation in quantum systems exhibiting superoscillation. He suggests that the superoscillatory
region is a localized feature of the photon's wave function, and thus any measurement that aims to observe this high-energy phenomenon must account for this localization.
Measurement and Wave Function Projection
: In quantum mechanics, measuring a property of a system involves projecting its wave function onto a specific state. If the measurement setup is designed to detect the localized superoscillatory region, it might observe higher energies than what the global wave function suggests. However, if the measurement does not account for this localization and instead looks at the overall wave function, it might miss these high-energy states.
Reconciling with Energy Conservation
: Myers' insight suggests that the observation of higher energies in superoscillatory regions does not necessarily violate energy conservation laws. Instead, it reflects the complexities of quantum measurements, where the observed energy depends on the specifics of how and where the measurement is conducted.
This interpretation aligns with the nuanced nature of quantum mechanics, where the outcome of a measurement is deeply intertwined with the properties of the system being measured and the method of measurement itself.

C 
onservation laws, such as those for energy, momentum, and 
angular momentum, are among the most fundamental laws 
of nature. As such, they have been intensively studied and exten- 
sively applied. First discovered in classical Newtonian mechanics, 
they are at the core of all subsequent physical theories, nonrela- 
tivistic and relativistic, classical and quantum. Here, we present a 
paradoxical situation in which such quantities are seemingly not 
conserved. Our results raise fundamental questions about the 
very meaning of conservation laws in quantum mechanics, and 
we argue that the standard way of def i ning conservation laws, 
while perfectly valid as far as it goes, misses essential features of 
nature and has to be revisited and extended. 
That paradoxical processes must arise in quantum mechanics 
in connection with conservation laws is to be expected. Indeed, 
on the one hand, physics is local: Causes and observable effects 
must be locally related, in the sense that no observations in a 
given space���time region can yield any information about events 
that take place outside its past light cone.���On the other hand, 
measurable dynamical quantities are identif i ed with eigenvalues 
of operators, and their corresponding eigenfunctions are not, in 
general, localized. Energy, for example, is a property of an entire 
wave function. However, the law of conservation of energy is 
often applied to processes in which a system with an extended 
wave function interacts with a local probe. How can the local 
probe ���see��� an extended wave function? What determines the 
change in energy of the local probe? These questions lead us 
to uncover quantum processes that seem, paradoxically, not to 
conserve energy. 
The present paper (which is based on a series of unpublished 
results, i rst described in refs. 3 and 4), presents the paradox and 
discusses various ways to think of conservation laws, but does not 
offer a resolution of the paradox. 
Superoscillations 
Essential to this paper is a mathematical structure we call ���super- 
oscillation.��� Common wisdom assumes that no function can 
oscillate faster than its fastest Fourier component. Yet, as we 
show here, there is a large class of functions for which this 
assumption fails. Indeed, we have found functions that oscil- 
late, on a given interval, arbitrarily faster than the fastest Fourier 
component. An example of such a function is the following: 
f (x)= ? 
1+�� 
2 eix/N+ 1����� 
2 e���ix/N ?N 
,[1] 
where �� is a positive real number, |x|�����N, and N is a large 
integer. An extensive discussion of the properties of this func- 
tion, i rst introduced in refs. 3 and 4, appears in refs. 5���7. To 
display its basic properties, we i rst write it, via the binomial 
formula, as f (x)= 
N X 
n=0 
c(n;N,��)ei(2n/N���1)x,[2] 
where the c(n;N,��) are constants; 
c(n;N,��)= 
1 
2N ?N 
n ? (1+��)n(1�����)N���n.[3] 
From 2, one can see that f (x) is a sum over wave numbers kn= 
2n/N ���1, ranging from ���1 to 1. 
Now, consider this function in the region |x|���L, where 
L is of order O(N 
1 
2���?) with ? positive and arbitrarily small. 
Here, we can approximate the exponentials by their i rst-order 
Taylor expansion and obtain (see also SI Appendix, section 1) 
f (x)��� ? 
1+��

)+ 1����� 
2 (1���i 
x 
N 
) ?N 
= ? 
1+ 
i��x 
N ?N ���ei��x.[4] 
Hence, in the restricted region, f (x) behaves as an oscillation of 
wave number ��. But, crucially, �� need not be smaller than one. 
By taking ��?1, we ensure that in the region of validity of the 
approximation, |x|���O(N 
1 2���?), the function f (x) oscillates with 
wave number ��?1, although all its Fourier components have 
wave numbers smaller than one. In other words, a superposi- 
tion of long wavelengths, the longest being 2��N and the shortest 
Signif i cance 
Conservation laws are one of the most important aspects 
of nature. As such, they have been intensively studied and 
extensively applied, and are considered to be perfectly well 
established. We, however, raise fundamental question about 
the very meaning of conservation laws in quantum mechanics. 
We argue that, although the standard way in which conserva- 
tion laws are def i ned in quantum mechanics is perfectly valid 
as far as it goes, it misses essential features of nature and has 
to be revisited and extended.

these superoscilations can be made arbitrarily large and include

increases exponentially. This is a generic property of functions 
with superoscillatory regions.

Based on the excerpt from the article "On conservation laws in quantum mechanics" by Yakir Aharonov, Sandu Popescu, and Daniel Rohrlich, several key points and concepts are addressed:
Fundamental Nature of Conservation Laws
: The article begins by emphasizing the importance of conservation laws, such as those for energy, momentum, and angular momentum, in both classical and quantum physics. These laws are deeply ingrained in our understanding of physical theories.
Paradox in Quantum Mechanics
: The authors present a paradoxical situation where conservation laws appear not to be upheld in certain quantum scenarios. This challenges the traditional understanding of these laws in the quantum realm.
Local Interactions vs. Extended Wave Functions
: The paradox arises from the local nature of physical interactions in contrast to the extended nature of wave functions in quantum mechanics. For example, energy is a property of an entire wave function, but conservation of energy is often applied to local interactions. This raises questions about how a local probe can interact with and be affected by an extended wave function.
Superoscillation Concept
: The article discusses superoscillation, a phenomenon where a function can oscillate faster than its fastest Fourier component. This concept is crucial to understanding the paradox, as it demonstrates how quantum systems can exhibit behaviors that are not immediately apparent from their wave functions' Fourier decompositions.
Mathematical Illustration of Superoscillation
: The authors provide a mathematical example of a superoscillatory function, explaining how it can oscillate at a frequency higher than any of its Fourier components within a certain region. This demonstrates that a superposition of long wavelengths can produce oscillations with much shorter wavelengths in specific regions.
Implications for Conservation Laws
: The existence of superoscillatory regions in quantum wave functions suggests that conservation laws might need to be reinterpreted or extended in quantum mechanics. The paradox highlighted by the authors is not just a mathematical curiosity but has profound implications for our understanding of fundamental physical principles.
No Definitive Resolution Offered
: The paper presents the paradox and different ways to think about conservation laws but does not resolve the paradox. This suggests ongoing discussions and explorations in the field regarding the application and interpretation of conservation laws in quantum systems.
Overall, the article by Aharonov, Popescu, and Rohrlich invites a reconsideration of how conservation laws are understood and applied in quantum mechanics, particularly in light of phenomena like superoscillation that challenge conventional interpretations.

Modular Energy Exchange 
It is interesting to examine further the changes in the energy 
distributions. Since neither the total energy distribution nor the 
opener energy distributions change, it is clear that the average 
energy of the particle cannot change: Indeed, both before the 
interaction and after hHi=hHpi+hH���i;[24] 
since hHi and hH���i are constant, so is hHpi. 
Furthermore, given that both initially and i nally the energy 
distributions of the opener and particle are uncorrelated, and 
that the distributions of total energy and opener energy do not 
change, one can easily derive the fact that all of the moments of 
the particle energy distribution hH 
n 
pi are unchanged. 
We thus arrive at another remarkable conclusion: The energy 
distribution of the particle changes, although none of its 
moments change. 
At i rst, it seems that something must be wrong���indeed, it 
is generally assumed that the moments of a distribution com- 
pletely def i ne it. This, however, is not so. It is actually perfectly 
possible for a distribution to change without any of its moments 
changing. In fact, in quantum mechanics, this behavior charac- 
terizes some of the most basic phenomena [such as momentum 
conservation in the two-slit experiment (9���13)]; and many of 
the ���mysteries��� of quantum mechanics have this mathematical 
effect at their core. This behavior generally stems from deep rea- 
sons connected with causality and nonlocality���as our present 
example illustrates. 
So, if none of the moments of the particle���s energy distribution 
change, what changes? It is the average of observables that we 
call ���modular energies��� (11, 12), as we now show. 
Consider the operator eiH��; we call this operator modular 
energy since it depends only on the energy modulo 2��/��. Each �� 
def i nes a different modular energy. 
Since H is a conserved operator, so are its associated modular 
energies:

heiH��ii=heiH��if.[25] 
As noted in The Standard Energy Conservation, long before 
the interaction and long afterward, we can replace the full 
Hamiltonian by the free part, so that 
hei(Hp+H���)��ii=hei(Hp+H���)��if.[26] 
Since there are no correlations between the states of the particle 
and the opener either before the interaction or after it, from 26, 
we obtain that heiHp��iiheiH�����ii=heiHp��ifheiH�����if.[27] 
And since the energy distribution of the opener doesn���t change, 
the averages of its modular energy for every �� don���t change 
either���i.e., heiH�����ii=heiH�����if. 
Hence, the only changes in the 
energy distributions of the particle are those of averages of 
the modular energy corresponding to those values of �� for which 
the average of the corresponding modular energy of the opener 
is zero. (This statement is just Eq. 23 stated differently.) Here, in 
particular, we have heiH�����i=0[28] 
for every �� >T. This means that for �� >T, the modular energy 
of the particle may change. 
Note the interesting way in which the conservation of modular 
energy works. The total modular energy is conserved, so if one of 
two interacting systems changes its modular energy, this must be 
accompanied by changes in the modular energy of the other, yet 
the average modular energy of the particle (for some ��) changes, 
while the corresponding modular energy of the opener doesn���t. 
This is possible due to the fact that, as opposed to energy, which 
is an additive conserved quantity, its modular part is nonadditive 
but multiplicative, and the modular energy of one of the sys- 
tems, namely, the opener, is completely uncertain, which makes 
its average zero. 
In concluding this section, we would like to emphasize that the 
wholeissueofexchangeofmodularenergy(ormomentum)with- 
out any (signif i cant) exchange of any of its moments (or where 
the exchange of the moments plays a trivial role) is a general 
characteristic of phenomena in which a localized probe inter- 
acts with a system in an extended wave function. At the same 
time, the particular phenomena described in this paper (the high 
energy of the particle that emerges from the box) depend on the 
particular form 1 of the extended wave function. The possibil- 
ity of exchange of modular energy without changes in any of the 
moments of the energy distribution simply opens a window of 
opportunity, through which the phenomena described here can 
manifest themselves. In other words, the exchange of modular 
energy without changes in the moments of the energy distribu- 
tion is just a necessary, but not a suff i cient, condition for the 
phenomena we describe here. 
Discussion 
To summarize, in our paper, we present an effect that raises 
questions about what we actually mean by conservation laws. 
The standard approach is statistical, and it is good as far as it 
goes. However, our effect begs the question of what happens 
in individual cases. A particle, prepared in a superposition of 
low-energy states and with no high-energy component whatso- 
ever, comes out of a box with great energy. It is legitimate to 
ask where the energy comes from. We showed that the mecha- 
nism used for extracting the particle���the only other system in 
the problem���did not provide this energy, so we are left with 
a puzzle. 
Our example concerned energy conservation. It is, however, 
clear that one can construct examples involving conservation 
of other quantities such as momentum or angular momentum 
(SI Appendix, section 5). The phenomenon is, therefore, a gen- 
eral one. Thus, we argue that the conservation laws of quantum 
mechanics must be revisited and extended. Without doing this, 
we will be missing a large part of the message that quantum 
mechanics is telling us.

The excerpt from the article "On conservation laws in quantum mechanics" by Aharonov, Popescu, and Rohrlich delves into the concept of "modular energy exchange" in quantum systems. Here's an analysis of the key points:
Modular Energy Exchange and Conservation Laws
: The authors discuss how the energy distribution of a quantum particle changes without altering its average energy or any moments of its energy distribution. This is counterintuitive since moments of a distribution are generally thought to define it completely.
Superoscillation and Quantum Mechanics
: The discussion is framed in the context of superoscillation, where a quantum particle in a superposition of low-energy states can exhibit high energy in specific situations.
Example of a Particle and an Opener
: The article describes an interaction between a particle and an "opener" (a device or system interacting with the particle). Even though the energy distribution of the particle changes during this interaction, the average energy and the moments of the energy distribution remain unchanged.
Modular Energy Operators
: Modular energy is introduced as an observable dependent on energy modulo a certain value (2��/��). The modular energy is conserved, but it behaves differently from typical conserved quantities like total energy.
Non-Additive Nature of Modular Energy
: Unlike energy, which is additive, modular energy is nonadditive and multiplicative. This means that changes in modular energy in one system (the particle) can occur without corresponding changes in the interacting system (the opener), especially when the average modular energy of the opener is zero.
Conservation of Modular Energy
: The total modular energy is conserved, but its distribution can change in ways not reflected by changes in the moments of the energy distribution. This is a key point in understanding the paradox presented in the paper.
Implications for Conservation Laws
: The phenomenon described challenges traditional notions of conservation laws in quantum mechanics, suggesting that these laws need to be revisited and extended. It indicates that understanding conservation in individual quantum events may differ from statistical averages.
General Phenomenon in Quantum Mechanics
: The authors note that similar considerations could apply to other conserved quantities like momentum or angular momentum. This indicates a more general characteristic of quantum mechanics, where localized interactions with extended wave functions lead to unexpected conservation behaviors.
In summary, the article highlights a unique aspect of quantum mechanics where conservation laws, as traditionally understood, might not fully capture the behavior of quantum systems. The concept of modular energy and its peculiar conservation properties in quantum mechanics suggest a need to rethink how conservation laws are applied and interpreted in the quantum realm.

Certainly, let's delve deeper into the concepts presented in the article regarding modular energy exchange and conservation laws in quantum mechanics:
Challenge to Traditional Conservation Laws
: In quantum mechanics, conservation laws like energy, momentum, and angular momentum are foundational. However, the authors present a scenario where these laws are seemingly not conserved in the usual sense. This challenges our conventional understanding of these laws in quantum contexts.
The Paradox of Superoscillation
: The concept of superoscillation is crucial here. It's a phenomenon where a wave (or a quantum particle described by a wave function) exhibits oscillations at a frequency higher than its highest frequency component. In quantum mechanics, this translates to a particle having energy characteristics that aren't evident in its standard energy spectrum.
Interaction between Particle and Opener
: The authors discuss a thought experiment involving a particle interacting with an opener. Despite this interaction causing changes in the energy distribution of the particle, its average energy and the moments (statistical averages like mean, variance, etc.) of its energy distribution remain unchanged. This is unusual because, typically, the moments of a distribution give a comprehensive description of it.
Concept of Modular Energy
: Modular energy is introduced as an important concept. It's defined in relation to the energy modulo a certain value. While total energy in quantum mechanics is conserved and additive, modular energy behaves differently. It's multiplicative and non-additive, meaning changes in modular energy can happen in ways that don't align with our standard understanding of energy conservation.
Conservation of Modular Energy
: The conservation of modular energy is not straightforward. The particle's modular energy can change even when there's no corresponding change in the opener's modular energy. This happens because modular energy is not a directly additive quantity, unlike standard energy. It's akin to a multiplicative property, where even if one system's modular energy changes, it doesn't necessarily imply a direct and equal change in another interacting system.
Quantum Mechanics and Nonlocality
: The authors link these observations to the nonlocal nature of quantum mechanics. In quantum systems, properties like energy are not always localized but can be extended over the entire wave function. This nonlocality plays a role in how energy (and modular energy) is conserved and perceived in quantum interactions.
Implications and Generalization
: The observed phenomenon raises questions about how conservation laws are defined and understood in quantum mechanics. The authors suggest that these laws need to be revisited and perhaps extended to account for phenomena like superoscillation and the peculiarities of modular energy. This idea could also extend beyond energy to other conserved quantities in quantum mechanics.
In essence, the article proposes that in the quantum realm, conservation laws might operate under principles that differ from classical physics. This includes the possibility of conservation laws being upheld in an average sense across many events, but not necessarily in each individual event. The concept of modular energy adds a layer of complexity to this understanding, demonstrating how quantum mechanics continues to challenge and expand our understanding of fundamental physical laws.

The Standard Energy Conservation 
As we discussed before, for any time-independent Hamiltonian, 
energy is always conserved in the standard sense���that is, the 
probability distribution of the total energy is time-independent. 
Since this is a theorem, it holds in our case as well; our paradox 
appears only at the level of individual cases. Yet, it is worth look- 
ing in more detail at the standard account of energy conservation 
as it applies in our case. As our case has interesting characteris- 
tics, the standard account of energy conservation turns out to be 
interesting as well. 
The total Hamiltonian is 
H =Hp+H���+Hint[13] 
where Hpand H���represent the free Hamiltonians of the particle 
and opener, respectively, and Hintis the interaction Hamiltonian. 
Energy conservation, strictly speaking, refers to the distribu- 
tion of the eigenvalues E of H, which includes the interaction 
term. However, although the interaction Hamiltonian is present 
at all times, the system is prepared such that the particle and 
the opener interact only for a i nite time. Indeed, they evolve 
essentially free, then interact for a i nite time, and then continue 
the free evolution. Hence, long before the interaction and long 
afterward, we can ignore Hintand say that the probability distri- 
bution of the free Hamiltonian, Hp+H���, is conserved. That is, 
the distributions of the total energies Hp+H���long before the 
interaction, and long after, must be the same. 
The total energy long before the interaction and long after it 
is simply the sum of the free energies, E =Ep+E���. With this 
def i nition, the standard energy-conservation relation is 
Ptot 
i (E)=Ptot 
f (E)[14] 
where Ptotdenotes the probability distribution of the total 
energy, and the indices i and f stand for ���initial��� and ���f i nal.��� 
Note that all of the probability distributions discussed here are 
over the entire ensemble, including both the cases in which the 
particle emerged out of the box and the cases when it didn���t. 
Before the interaction, there is no correlation between the 
energies of the particle and opener���i.e., the initial joint prob- 
ability Pp,��� 
i (Ep,E���) of their energies is the product of their 
respective individual probability distributions 
Pp,��� 
i (EpE���)=Pp 
i(Ep)P 
��� 
i(E���). [15] 
Correspondingly, the initial total energy distribution is given by 
Ptot 
i (E)= Z 
Pp 
i(E 0)P��� 
i(E ���E 
0)dE0. [16] 
After the interaction, it is again the case that the probability 
distributions of the particle and opener are uncorrelated. More 
precisely, as discussed in The Experiment and Explicit Model, the 
truncation of the emerging wave packet leads to some correla- 
tions between the energy of the particle and the opener (both

The main feature of our experiment is that the energy distribu- 
tion of the opener doesn���t change. Indeed, this feature remains 
also when we look separately at the cases in which the particle 
remains in the box and the ones in which the particle is emitted. 
The particle remains in the box if originally it was far from the 
central region; in this case, it doesn���t hit the mirror, so the mir- 
ror (and its entire moving mechanism) doesn���t change energy. 
On the other hand, when the particle is in the central region, 
it collides with the mirror. However, as we emphasized when 
we analyzed the paradox, the mirror-energy distribution cannot 
change its energy distribution because, by causality, it must act 
identically to the case in which a true high-energy particle was 
in the box; just as the high-energy particle just emerges with- 
out changing its energy, and thus leaving the mirror���s energy 
unchanged, so must the fake high-energy particle. Hence, 
P��� 
i(E)=P

f(E). [19] 
On the other hand, the i nal probability distribution for the 
energy of the particle is different from the initial distribution, 
Pp 
f 6=Pp 
i. Indeed, initially the particle was in a superposition of 
energy eigenstates all smaller than 1 (Fig. 2). After the interac- 
tion, however, there are cases when the particle emerges from 
the box and has high energy, much higher than 1, while in other 
cases, it remains inside the box and has low energies, and the low 
energies average to something less than the original average in 
order to conserve the total energy average. 
All this leads to a surprising situation: The distribution of the 
energy of the particle changes without being accompanied by a 
corresponding change in the distribution of the energy of the 
opener, yet the distribution of the total energy is conserved. 
Although the above situation is surprising, it is mathematically 
consistent, and it has remarkable implications. Denoting the con- 
served distributions Ptot

f (E)=Ptot(E) and P���

To understand the signif i cance of the above results, we i rst 
note the general meaning of the Fourier transform of the energy 
distribution. Consider a particle prepared in the state |��(t)i 
and evolving according to a Hamiltonian H. Then (SI Appendix, 
section 4), 
�� 
P(��)=h��(t)|��(t +��)i.[22] 
Note that since the Hamiltonian is time-independent, �� 
P(��) is 
independent of t; indeed, h��(t)|��(t +��)i is independent of t. 
In our case, we want the opener���particle interaction to take 
place only for a i nite time: The box must be opened, the mirror 
inserted, then extracted, and the box closed, all before informa- 
tion from remote places in the box can reach the opening. In our 
explicit model, the opener must, thus, move from far away, going 
from an initial state in which there is no interaction to an orthog- 
onal state in which there is interaction, and then again to a state 
with no interaction. This is accomplished by moving through a 
long sequence of orthogonal states both before and after the 
interaction (as one can explicitly see in the model). Hence, since 
the interaction should only take a i nite time T, it must be 
the case that the wave function �� of the opener, as it evolves, 
must obey h��(t)|��(t +��)i=0[23] 
for any time �� >T. Since 23 is independent of t, we can take 
t to be far in the past, when the opener evolved under its free 
Hamiltonian H���. Hence, the fact that the interaction takes only 
a i nite amount of time implies that �� 
P���(��)=0 for �� >T, and 
this enables the strange behavior of the energy distributions that 
characterizes our problem. 
Note that the opener has the role of a catalyst: Its energy dis- 
tribution doesn���t change, yet, without it, the particle���s energy 
distribution could not change, because the energy of the parti- 
cle would then be the total energy, and changing its distribution 
would violate the standard energy-conservation law.

The excerpt you've provided from the article "On conservation laws in quantum mechanics" by Aharonov, Popescu, and Rohrlich further elaborates on the concept of energy conservation in quantum mechanics, particularly in the context of their thought experiment. Let's break down the key points for a clearer understanding:
Standard Energy Conservation in Quantum Mechanics
: In quantum systems with a time-independent Hamiltonian, energy is conserved in the standard sense, meaning the probability distribution of the total energy remains constant over time.
Total Hamiltonian and Interaction
: The total Hamiltonian
H

is described as the sum of the free Hamiltonians of the particle (

). While energy conservation typically refers to the eigenvalues of
H
H
H
, including the interaction term, the interaction between the particle and opener is finite. Outside this interaction period, the system evolves freely, and the interaction Hamiltonian can be disregarded for energy considerations.
Probability Distribution of Energy
: Before and after the interaction, there's no correlation between the energies of the particle and opener. The joint probability distribution of their energies is the product of their individual distributions. The total energy distribution, a sum of the particle's and opener's energies, remains the same before and after the interaction.
Change in Particle's Energy Distribution Without Opener's Change
: The intriguing aspect of the experiment is that while the energy distribution of the opener remains constant, the energy distribution of the particle changes. The particle, initially in a superposition of low-energy states, can have high energy after interaction, while the opener's energy distribution remains unaffected.
Mathematical Consistency and Fourier Transform
: Mathematically, this situation is expressed using the Fourier transform of the energy distributions. The conservation of the total energy distribution is shown through an equation involving the Fourier transforms of the particle and opener���s energy distributions.
Significance of Fourier Transform of Energy Distribution
: The Fourier transform of the energy distribution relates to the probability amplitude of the state at two different times. The interaction between the particle and opener is designed to occur within a finite time, leading to specific conditions on the Fourier transform of the opener's energy distribution.
Catalytic Role of the Opener
: The opener acts as a catalyst. It facilitates a change in the particle's energy distribution without altering its own energy distribution. This interaction allows for the particle���s energy distribution to change in a way that conserves the total energy.
Implications for Conservation Laws
: This scenario challenges the conventional understanding of energy conservation in quantum mechanics, particularly in individual events. It suggests that while the overall statistical framework of energy conservation is upheld, individual interactions can exhibit non-intuitive energy distribution changes.
In summary, the article discusses how, in quantum mechanics, energy conservation can manifest in complex ways, especially in systems where interactions are finite and involve entities like particles and openers with different roles. This challenges and extends our understanding of energy conservation in quantum contexts, particularly at the level of individual events.

with the maximal energy Emax=1. On the other hand, we also 
know that in the region |x|���L=O(N 
1 2���?), around the center 
of the box, the wave function of the photon resembles that of a 
monochromatic photon with wave number ��, hence, of energy 
E =��?Emax=1.[8] 
In other words, in the box, we have a low-energy photon, which 
in the center of the box looks like a high-energy photon. 
Suppose now that a mechanism that we will call the ���opener��� 
opens the box in the center and inserts a mirror, such that if the 
photon hits the mirror, it comes out of the box (as in Fig. 1). The 
mirror is left inside for a time T, then it is extracted out of the 
box, and the box is closed. The photon could come out of the box 
only if initially is situated at a distance not larger than T from 
the mirror; otherwise, it cannot get there while the box is open. 
The probability for this to happen is at most RT

shape of the wave function is not accurate, but simply illustrative; the true 
wave function is exponentially larger away from the center and has a more 
complicated shape. 
that at the end of the experiment, we i nd the photon out of the 
box. What is its energy? 
Naively, we would think that the emerging photon must have 
one of the energies En=|2n/N ���1|���1 that it had originally in 
the box���after all, ref l ection from a mirror doesn���t change the 
spectrum of light. On second thought, however, we realize that 
this cannot be so. Indeed, the box was open only for a time T. 
Because any signal propagates, at most, with velocity of light, 
only information about the wave function in a region, at most, 
of distance T from the origin can inf l uence what happens at the 
origin. But we took T <L, i.e., smaller than the region where 
the wave function behaves essentially indistinguishably from a 
plane wave of high energy E. Hence, the photon that emerges 
from the box must be in a state which is identical to that in 
which a genuine photon of energy E would emerge from the 
box. Indeed, if this would not be so, we would know that the 
function far away is different from that of the genuine pho- 
ton and contradict special relativity. But for a genuine photon 
of energy E, it is trivial to see what happens: The mirror just 
ref l ects the photon out of the box, but it doesn���t signif i cantly 
change its frequency and energy. All that happens to the wave 
function of the genuine energy E photon is that its wave func- 
tion is chopped into a wave-train of length T by our closing the

box after time T. Hence, if a genuine photon of energy E =�� 
emerged from the box, its energy spectrum would have a peak 
at energy �� and a spread in energy of 1/T. By increasing N, we 
can increase T and, hence, reduce by as much as we want the 
disturbance produced by the i nite opening time of box; the pho- 
ton thus emerges as close as we want to its initial energy E. We 
thus conclude that when our ���fake high-energy��� photon emerges 
from the box, it must have energy E exactly as the genuine 
high-energy photon, and not the low energies it originally had 
(Figs. 2 and 3). 
To summarize, when the photon emerges from the box, it has 
much higher energy than it initially had. Where did the extra 
energy come from? This is the question that concerns us in 
this paper. 
The Paradox 
Inside the box, the photon was in a superposition of different 
energy eigenstates, all smaller than one, and out it emerges with 
the much higher energy ��. Where does the extra energy come 
from? A i rst guess is that the energy comes from the mecha- 
nism used for extracting the photon. Indeed, we need to open 
the box, insert the mirror, and then take out the mirror and close 
the box. This mechanism, which we call opener, effectively sub- 
jects the photon to a time-dependent Hamiltonian, and such a 
Hamiltonian need not conserve energy. 
To put it differently, we can look at the total Hamiltonian, 
describing the photon and the opener. The total Hamiltonian 
is time-independent, since it describes the total system, with no 
partsleftoutside;thetimedependenceseenbythephotoncomes 
from the time evolution of the opener and its interaction with 
the photon. The total energy is conserved for time-independent 
Hamiltonians. Thus, we are tempted to say, all that happens is 
that the opener and the photon exchange energy: When the pho- 
ton emerges from the box, and, as we proved, has higher energy 
than it had inside the box, the opener must have lost the same 
amount���a trivial case of energy exchange. 
Fig. 2.The initial and i nal distributions of the energy of the photon. Ini- 
tially, it was a superposition of low energies and strictly no energy higher 
than one. Finally, a peak at energy �� appears, which corresponds to the 
extracted photons. 
We now arrive at the crux of the problem. Although this expla- 
nation is the most natural, it is wrong: The photon could not have 
gotten its energy from the opener. The reason is again causality, 
as we shall now see. 
Consider the case of a monochromatic high-energy photon of 
energy ��. When this photon emerges from the box, its energy 
is unchanged (up to l uctuations of order 1/T). Hence, in this 
case, the opener does not give it any energy. But then the opener 
cannot give energy to the fake photon, either. 
Indeed, recall that the entire difference between the high- 
energyphoton ofenergy �� andour speciallyprepared low-energy 
photon lies in regions situated further from the center than L; 
this information cannot arrive at the opener during the time of 
the experiment, T <L. Immediately after the experiment is over, 
we can measure the energy of the opener. Since the opener is 
localized in a small region (around the center of the box), we 
have immediate access to it and can measure its energy in a 
short time; the measurement can be i nished long before infor- 
mation from |x|���L can arrive. If by measuring the opener, we 
could determine whether the box contained the original low- 
energy photon or the monochromatic high-energy photon, we 
would violate relativistic causality. Thus, since the opener didn���t 
lose energy when the box contained a high-energy photon, it can- 
not lose energy in the case of the low-energy photon either! We 
must therefore conclude that the extra energy did not come from 
the opener. 
This is the paradox. The photon emerged from the box with 
energy much higher than it had inside, but the energy did not 
come from the opener, the only other system in the problem. 
Energy seems not to be conserved. 
Energy Conservation 
Faced with this paradox, one can respond in various ways. The 
conventional response is that there is no problem whatsoever, 
and there cannot ever be. In quantum mechanics, the standard 
formulation of a conservation law is that the probability dis- 
tribution of the conserved variable over the entire ensemble 
should not change. This law applies to any time-independent 
Hamiltonian. On this basis, there should be absolutely no energy 
nonconservation in our example, either. And, of course, from 
this point of view, there is none. Indeed, in the preceding sec- 
tions, we focused on what happens when the photon emerges 
from the box. But it is also possible (and actually far more prob- 
able) that the photon does not emerge from the box. It happens, 
because the wave function of the photon extends all over the 
box, so the photon has a nonzero (and, in fact, quite large) prob- 
ability to be far from the central region. If so, it cannot reach 
the opening while the box is open; therefore, it cannot leave the 
box. To see standard energy conservation at work, we must con- 
sider these cases as well. What we i nd in these cases is that, 
again, the opener didn���t lose any energy (since it did not collide 
with the photon), but the photon remains in the box with lower 
energy (as the wave function loses its superoscillatory piece)��� 
again, a paradox. Considering these cases as well, we i nd that, as 
expected, the probability distribution of the total energy (photon 
plus opener) did not change. 
But���and this is the main point of our paper���we would like to 
argue that the standard formulation of conservation laws, though 
absolutely correct as far as it goes, is simply not enough. The 
standard conservation law is statistical and says nothing about 
individual cases. We would like to argue, however, that it is legit- 
imate to ask what happened in a particular individual case. In 
our example, suppose we have in the box a photon of energy 
of order 1 eV (more precisely, a photon in a superposition of 
various energies, but absolutely none of them larger than 1 eV). 
Yet, when we open the box, the photon emerges with energy of 
order of 1 GeV. We should def i nitely be entitled to ask where 
the energy came from.

The passage you've provided delves deeper into the paradoxical situation regarding energy conservation in quantum mechanics, as presented by Aharonov, Popescu, and Rohrlich. Let's explore the key points to understand their argument better:
Standard Energy Conservation in Quantum Mechanics
: The authors begin by reaffirming that for any time-independent Hamiltonian, energy conservation is upheld in the traditional sense ��� the probability distribution of the total energy remains constant over time.
Total Hamiltonian and Interaction Dynamics
: They describe the total Hamiltonian (
H

). This interaction Hamiltonian is only significant for a finite period during which the particle and the opener interact.
Photon Energy Paradox
: The paradox arises when a low-energy photon in a box, which appears as a high-energy photon in the center due to superoscillation, interacts with a mechanism (the opener) that inserts a mirror into the box for a finite time. If the photon hits the mirror, it exits the box. The authors argue that the photon that emerges should have high energy (
E

��
E = \alpha
E
=

) despite originally being a low-energy photon.
Causality and Energy Transfer
: The authors use causality to argue that the energy of the emerging photon could not have come from the opener. If it had, this would imply a violation of relativistic causality, as the opener's energy state should be the same regardless of whether the photon inside the box is of high or low energy.
Energy Conservation and Quantum Mechanics
: The authors address a common response that quantum mechanics only requires the conservation of energy across an entire ensemble of systems, not necessarily within individual cases. While this perspective holds true statistically, they suggest it does not provide a satisfactory explanation for individual events where energy seems not to be conserved.
The Statistical vs. Individual Case Argument
: They emphasize that while the overall statistical framework of quantum mechanics may not show energy non-conservation, individual cases like their thought experiment raise legitimate questions. For instance, how can a photon initially with an energy of 1 eV emerge from the box with an energy of 1 GeV?
Revisiting Quantum Conservation Laws
: The main point of the paper is to challenge the standard formulation of conservation laws in quantum mechanics. The authors argue that while these laws are statistically valid, they might not fully capture the dynamics of individual quantum events, especially in complex interactions involving mechanisms like superoscillation.
In summary, the paper presents a thought-provoking scenario that pushes the boundaries of our understanding of conservation laws in quantum mechanics. It suggests that while energy conservation holds on a statistical level, individual quantum events might exhibit behaviors that challenge traditional interpretations of these laws. This calls for a deeper exploration and potentially a redefinition or extension of conservation laws in the quantum realm.

I wonder if there are any analogies or metaphors to help explain it?

Certainly, explaining complex quantum phenomena like the one described in Aharonov, Popescu, and Rohrlich's paper can be aided by analogies or metaphors. Here's an attempt to convey the essence of their ideas through a more relatable scenario:
Metaphor: The Magic Theater
Imagine a theater where a magical play is being performed. The theater represents the quantum system, including the particle (a photon in the original example) and the opener (the mechanism that opens the box).
Standard Play Script vs. Improvisation (Standard Energy Conservation vs. Quantum Superposition)
:
In a regular play, actors follow a script, much like particles in classical physics adhere to predictable, well-defined paths and energy states. This script-following represents standard energy conservation.
In our magic theater, however, actors sometimes improvise, deviating from the script. These improvisations are akin to a quantum particle being in a superposition of states, where it doesn't have a single, defined energy level but rather a range of possibilities.
The Magic Curtain (The Quantum Superoscillatory Region)
:
Consider a part of the stage covered by a magic curtain. When actors perform behind this curtain, they appear to the audience as different characters. This is similar to the superoscillatory region in the quantum box, where the photon seems to have higher energy.
Even though the actor (photon) hasn't fundamentally changed, the audience's perception is altered by the magic curtain, just as the photon appears to have high energy when observed in the superoscillatory region.
The Revealing Act (Interaction with the Mirror/Opener)
:
At a certain point in the play, the magic curtain is temporarily removed (similar to the mirror being inserted and then removed in the quantum box). If an actor is right behind the curtain at that moment, they step forward, revealing their true character to the audience.
In the quantum analogy, this is the moment the photon interacts with the opener and is observed. Despite its appearance as a high-energy photon in the superoscillatory region, its true energy state is revealed during this interaction.
The Puzzle of the Disappearing Props (The Paradox of Energy Source)
:
Now, here's the twist: even though the actor appears as a high-energy character, the props and sets (representing the opener's energy) haven't changed or contributed to this transformation. This baffles the audience, as they expected that
the change in the actor's character would somehow involve a change in the props or set design. In the quantum scenario, this reflects the paradox where the photon emerges with seemingly higher energy, but this energy doesn't come from the opener.
A Play of Many Acts (Statistical vs. Individual Energy Conservation)
:
If one considers the entire run of the play, including all the performances (akin to the ensemble of quantum systems), the overall script (total energy distribution) seems to be followed. This aligns with the statistical view of energy conservation in quantum mechanics.
However, in individual performances (single quantum events), peculiar improvisations occur (like the photon emerging with higher energy), which seem to contradict the script. This raises questions about how we understand and interpret the play's narrative (conservation laws) at the level of individual performances.
The Director's Dilemma (Revisiting Quantum Conservation Laws)
:
The director (physicist) is then left with a dilemma. While the overall play runs as expected, the individual improvisations suggest there might be more to the story than the script alone can tell. This metaphorically represents the challenge posed by individual quantum events that don't seem to align with traditional conservation laws, suggesting a need to revisit and possibly extend our understanding of these laws.
In this metaphor, the magic theater and its unique performances capture the essence of the quantum paradox presented by Aharonov, Popescu, and Rohrlich. It illustrates how individual events in quantum mechanics can exhibit behaviors that challenge our traditional understanding of conservation laws, much like unexpected improvisations in a play that defy the standard script.

being 2��, can, in the region |x|���O(N 
1 2���?), oscillate with the 
much shorter wavelength 2��/��. Furthermore, the region of 
these superoscilations can be made arbitrarily large and include 
arbitrarily many wavelengths by taking N suff i ciently large. 
Note that there is no contradiction with the Fourier theorem, 
since the region where this function is (almost) identical to an 
oscillation of a frequency not contained by its Fourier decompo- 
sition does not extend over the entire region where the function 
is def i ned. 
Although it is not essential for our present paper, it is inter- 
esting to note that outside the superoscillatory region, f (x) 
increases exponentially. This is a generic property of functions 
with superoscillatory regions. 
The Experiment 
The type of effect we describe here is common for all conserved 
quantities that depend on the shape of the wave function all over 
the space, including energy, momentum, and angular momen- 
tum. Here, we will focus on energy, for which the proof is more 
intuitive. 
Here, we start by presenting the idea intuitively, in terms of 
a relativistic model, where the arguments are simpler. However, 
since relativistic quantum-f i eld theory has well-known technical 
diff i culties, we will in subsequent sections formulate a standard 
nonrelativistic quantum model and do all of the calculations 
there. 
Consider a box of length 2��Na (where a is some unit length) 
that contains a single photon in the state ��(x) 
��(x)= 
i N (f (x/a)���f 
���(x/a)) [5] 
with f (x) def i ned in Eq. 4 and ��?1. Here, N is a normaliza- 
tion factor. ��(x) has properties similar to f , but it obeys the 
boundary conditions ��(�����Na)=��(��Na)=0 at the walls of the 
box (Fig. 1). 
From now on, however, for simplicity, we take a =1, and we 
work in the usual units ~=c =1. 
Given the relation between wavelength, frequency and energy 
for the photon, the decomposition 2 shows that the photon is in a 
superposition of different energy eigenstates with wave numbers 
kn=(2n/N ���1)[6] 
all smaller than or equal to one (in absolute value), correspond- 
ing to energy eigenvalues En=|kn|[7] 
with the maximal energy Emax=1. On the other hand, we also 
know that in the region |x|���L=O(N 
1 2���?), around the center 
of the box, the wave function of the photon resembles that of a 
monochromatic photon with wave number ��, hence, of energy 
E =��?Emax=1.[8] 
In other words, in the box, we have a low-energy photon, which 
in the center of the box looks like a high-energy photon. 
Suppose now that a mechanism that we will call the ���opener��� 
opens the box in the center and inserts a mirror, such that if the 
photon hits the mirror, it comes out of the box (as in Fig. 1). The 
mirror is left inside for a time T, then it is extracted out of the 
box, and the box is closed. The photon could come out of the box 
only if initially is situated at a distance not larger than T from 
the mirror; otherwise, it cannot get there while the box is open. 
The probability for this to happen is at most RT 
���T |��(x)|2dx. 
Let now the time T be smaller (in units of speed of light c =1) 
than L, the length of the region of superoscillations, and suppose

by, it opens the box and extracts the photon, if the photon is there. The 
shape of the wave function is not accurate, but simply illustrative; the true 
wave function is exponentially larger away from the center and has a more 
complicated shape. 
that at the end of the experiment, we i nd the photon out of the 
box. What is its energy? 
Naively, we would think that the emerging photon must have 
one of the energies En=|2n/N ���1|���1 that it had originally in 
the box���after all, ref l ection from a mirror doesn���t change the 
spectrum of light. On second thought, however, we realize that 
this cannot be so. Indeed, the box was open only for a time T. 
Because any signal propagates, at most, with velocity of light, 
only information about the wave function in a region, at most, 
of distance T from the origin can inf l uence what happens at the 
origin. But we took T <L, i.e., smaller than the region where 
the wave function behaves essentially indistinguishably from a 
plane wave of high energy E. Hence, the photon that emerges 
from the box must be in a state which is identical to that in 
which a genuine photon of energy E would emerge from the 
box. Indeed, if this would not be so, we would know that the 
function far away is different from that of the genuine pho- 
ton and contradict special relativity. But for a genuine photon 
of energy E, it is trivial to see what happens: The mirror just 
ref l ects the photon out of the box, but it doesn���t signif i cantly 
change its frequency and energy. All that happens to the wave 
function of the genuine energy E photon is that its wave func- 
tion is chopped into a wave-train of length T by our closing the

box after time T. Hence, if a genuine photon of energy E =�� 
emerged from the box, its energy spectrum would have a peak 
at energy �� and a spread in energy of 1/T. By increasing N, we 
can increase T and, hence, reduce by as much as we want the 
disturbance produced by the i nite opening time of box; the pho- 
ton thus emerges as close as we want to its initial energy E. We 
thus conclude that when our ���fake high-energy��� photon emerges 
from the box, it must have energy E exactly as the genuine 
high-energy photon, and not the low energies it originally had 
(Figs. 2 and 3). 
To summarize, when the photon emerges from the box, it has 
much higher energy than it initially had. Where did the extra 
energy come from? This is the question that concerns us in 
this paper.

To explain the quantum scenario described in the article using an analogy, let's use the metaphor of a "Magic Art Gallery."
Metaphor: The Magic Art Gallery
The Gallery (The Quantum Box)
:
Imagine an art gallery with a special room. This room is like the quantum box containing the photon. The paintings in this room are like the wave function of the photon.
The Special Painting (Superoscillatory Region)
:
Among the paintings, there's one special painting that, when viewed from a certain angle (the superoscillatory region), appears completely different, exhibiting features (high energy) not present in the rest of the paintings (the photon's normal energy states).
The Magic Viewer (The Opener)
:
A special device, the Magic Viewer (the opener), can selectively remove paintings (mirror interaction) for a brief moment. If a painting is in the right position (photon near the mirror), it can be viewed outside the room.
The Illusion of Change (Energy Paradox)
:
When a painting is viewed outside through the Magic Viewer, it appears as if it has changed - the special painting seems to have the extraordinary features (high energy) it only exhibited under specific conditions inside the room. This is the paradox - the painting (photon) seems to have gained something (energy) it didn't originally possess.
The Limitation of Information (Causality and Finite Interaction)
:
The Magic Viewer can only remove paintings within its reach (the photon can only interact with the mirror for a time
T
T
T
). This limitation is akin to the finite interaction time in the quantum box. The viewer can't know about paintings (parts of the wave function) further away.
The Emerging Mystery (Where Does the Energy Come From?)
:
When the special painting is viewed outside, it displays features that it seemed not to have inside the room under normal conditions. This raises a question similar to the one in the quantum scenario:
Where did these extraordinary features (the photon's high energy) come from if the Magic Viewer (opener) didn't add anything to it?
The Paradox of Perception (Quantum Paradox)
:
This scenario creates a paradox similar to the quantum one. In the art gallery, the painting seems to have properties that it shouldn't have based on its original state inside the room. Similarly, in the quantum box, the photon emerges with an energy that contradicts its initial energy states.
The Conservation of Art (Energy Conservation)
:
In the gallery, no actual paintings are being changed or moved permanently. It's all about perception from a specific viewpoint (similar to the conservation of total energy in the quantum scenario). When the painting is viewed under the special conditions created by the Magic Viewer, it appears transformed, but the gallery's overall collection remains unchanged.
The Question of Source (Seeking the Source of Extra Energy)
:
Just like in the quantum paradox, where the extra energy of the photon doesn't seem to come from the opener, in the gallery, the extraordinary features of the special painting don't come from the Magic Viewer. This challenges our understanding of how the painting (photon) acquired these features (energy).
Revisiting the Rules of Art (Quantum Mechanics)
:
This analogy leads to a situation where we must reconsider how we understand the 'rules of art' in the gallery (the laws of quantum mechanics in the box). It suggests that our conventional understanding might be insufficient to explain individual, peculiar occurrences, even if it works well for the overall collection (ensemble of quantum systems).
In summary, the "Magic Art Gallery" metaphor illustrates the key aspects of the quantum paradox described by Aharonov, Popescu, and Rohrlich. It captures the essence of superoscillation, the finite interaction with the opener, and the resulting energy paradox, all within a more accessible and visual context.
