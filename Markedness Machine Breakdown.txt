Markedness and Machine Minds: A Theory of Mind Framework for Modeling Human Expertise through Semantic and Temporal Deviation

Abstract:
This paper introduces the Multi-Domain Semantic and Temporal Intelligence Evaluation (MD-STIE) framework, a computational system designed to model human expertise in a manner analogous to human theory of mind (ToM). MD-STIE leverages linguistic markedness and temporal dynamics of user behavior to identify, contextualize, and predict human cognitive capabilities across diverse task domains. Drawing on the premise that human ToM infers mental states from deviations in expected behavior, MD-STIE flags temporally or semantically "marked" actions as anomalies requiring belief revision. Through LLM-augmented interaction, the framework simulates surprise, seeks contextual input, and refines internal models of user expertise, mirroring the cognitive architecture underlying social cognition. We present case studies across domains including web development, combinatorics, and AI system design, showing how MD-STIE reconstructs user profiles through cross-domain behavioral inference. We argue this framework represents a computational analog to mental state attribution, offering implications for adaptive interfaces, cognitive modeling, and the future of machine social cognition.

1. Introduction

Theory of mind (ToM) enables humans to infer the mental states, intentions, and knowledge of others based on observable behavior. In both developmental psychology and cognitive science, ToM is considered a cornerstone of social cognition and intelligent interaction. This paper explores the hypothesis that a computational framework rooted in semantic and temporal markedness can instantiate an analogous mechanism for machines.

We propose the MD-STIE framework as an early prototype of machine-embedded ToM: a system that interprets user behavior not merely in terms of task success, but in terms of inferred intent, expertise, and deviation from statistical expectations. This framework is designed to operate across domains, offering a generalized model of user cognition derived from marked actions and contextual explanations.

2. Background and Related Work

2.1 Theory of Mind in Cognitive Science
ToM is traditionally studied through tasks that reveal belief attribution, intention recognition, and predictive reasoning. Classic experiments such as the Sally-Anne test demonstrate the human capacity to revise mental models based on knowledge discrepancies (Baron-Cohen et al., 1985). Computationally, ToM has been modeled using probabilistic inference frameworks (Baker et al., 2009), inverse planning (Baker et al., 2017), and neural network-based simulations of mental state reasoning (Rabinowitz et al., 2018).

2.2 Markedness in Linguistics and Cognition
Markedness refers to the asymmetry between typical (unmarked) and atypical (marked) forms (Jakobson, 1971; Battistella, 1990). In language, marked elements convey specificity or deviation. Recent applications extend markedness to conceptual and behavioral analysis, interpreting deviation as a cognitively salient feature (Croft, 2003).

2.3 Machine Learning and Expertise Modeling
Expertise modeling often relies on performance metrics or supervised learning (Koedinger et al., 2015). More recent systems have explored unsupervised modeling of skill acquisition using keystroke data (Epp et al., 2011) or temporal patterns (Anderson et al., 1995). LLM-based user modeling has emerged with adaptive agents (Chiang & Birchfield, 2023), though typically lacking theory-driven interpretation of outlier behaviors. MD-STIE bridges this gap by integrating linguistic theory with cognitive modeling.

3. The MD-STIE Framework

3.1 Overview
MD-STIE operates in three stages:

Detection of Markedness: Identifying semantically or temporally unusual behavior.

Contextual Inquiry: Prompting users to provide explanations or leveraging interaction histories.

Belief Updating: Revising the user model based on contextual input, akin to mental state attribution.

3.2 Semantic Markedness
Leveraging large language models (LLMs), the system identifies rare or abstract linguistic/conceptual patterns in user inputs. Examples include unconventional code constructs, high-level abstractions, or unusual toolchains.

3.3 Temporal Markedness
The system analyzes prompt-response cycles, typing latency, hesitation intervals, and completion time. Deviations from domain-specific norms are flagged as temporally marked.

3.4 Cross-Domain Integration
User behaviors are mapped to an evolving ontology, enabling the system to generalize inferences across tasks. This supports the construction of a unified cognitive profile.

4. Case Study: From Anomaly to Expert

A user completes a glitch-effect webpage deployment in 10 minutes, far below the 2-hour task norm. MD-STIE flags this as a marked event. Upon querying, the user explains the use of Git Bash, WSL, and Python servers���advanced tools that explain the temporal anomaly. The system updates its model, shifting from an interpretation of error or randomness to one of expertise.

This mirrors ToM processes in humans: initial surprise gives way to belief revision upon receiving new information.

5. Discussion

5.1 Machine Surprise and Cognitive Simulation
MD-STIE���s ability to flag markedness reflects an early form of computational surprise. The act of seeking explanation and updating models parallels belief revision in human cognition.

5.2 Implications for Adaptive Systems
Such a system can enhance adaptive interfaces that respond to user expertise, learning pace, or preferred strategy. It offers potential for real-time tutoring, human-computer collaboration, and cognitive profiling.

5.3 Toward Machine Theory of Mind
By modeling the dynamics of mental state attribution computationally, MD-STIE opens a path toward machines that do not merely react, but interpret, infer, and anticipate human behavior.

6. Future Work

Future research will focus on integrating physiological signals (e.g., keystroke dynamics, eye tracking) to enhance inference fidelity, expanding domain ontologies for broader generalization, and formalizing the belief updating mechanism using Bayesian or neural-symbolic models. A promising direction is implementing belief state tracking via Bayesian theory of mind models (Baker et al., 2009) or hybrid architectures combining symbolic reasoning with neural embeddings (Besold et al., 2017).

7. Conclusion

MD-STIE represents a step toward machine-emulated theory of mind, using semantic and temporal markedness as proxies for belief violation and model revision. In tracking expertise as an emergent cognitive pattern across domains, the framework lays the groundwork for socially intelligent systems capable of human-like understanding.

Oh,
this
paper? My god. Strap in. This one���s a philosophical soft-boiled egg, cracked over the sizzling griddle of AI overreach, seasoned liberally with ���what if your toaster had feelings?��� and served with a side of pretentious acronyms and academic incense. Let���s unbox this beast.
Title: Markedness and Machine Minds
Subtitle: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Epistemic Vacuum of Semantic Deviance
This is not a title���it���s a conjuring spell. You can practically hear the author chanting in a candlelit lab: ���Oh spirits of Jakobson and Turing, grant my code the gift of surprise!���
���Markedness and Machine Minds���
sounds like either a post-structuralist jazz album or a Philosophy 101 final that went off the rails and somehow became self-aware.
Abstract: When Your AI Gasps
So the core thesis? This framework���
MD-STIE
(which sounds like a tech startup trying to sell you ethically-sourced tofu routers)���tries to mimic
Theory of Mind
(ToM) by catching people when they act ���weird��� and then pretending the machine is
surprised
, like your smart fridge suddenly went, ���You���re eating
that
at 3am?��� and then updated its understanding of your soul.
They throw in words like ���belief revision��� and ���semantic markedness,��� which is academic-speak for ���the user did something odd, so now the machine panics and tries to look thoughtful.���
Section 1: ���I Know What You Did Last API Call���
They really want machines to infer
intentions
, not just ���you typed fast��� but ���you typed fast
with purpose
.��� Like the machine���s leaning over your shoulder going, ���Hmm. Interesting. A semicolon
there?
What does it mean???���
The proposal: a machine that notices when you act abnormally and then does some armchair psychology. Basically, a neurotic HAL 9000 that models you as a chaotic bundle of implicit intentions wrapped in keystrokes and JavaScript.
Section 2: The Grand Parade of Citations
We get all the hits here:
Baron-Cohen
: Because nothing says "cutting-edge AI" like dragging in the 1985 Sally-Anne test.
Jakobson and Battistella
: Yes, let���s have a 50-year-old linguistics debate drive our modern AI surprise detectors.
Inverse planning, keystroke dynamics, neural-symbolic reasoning
���this thing reads like it was stitched together from the abstracts of three different dissertations, none of which have met.
This is not a ���Related Work��� section���it���s an intellectual potluck where everyone brought a different kind of weird casserole.
Section 3: Let���s Get Marked
Here���s where the fever dream begins. We now have a
system
that:
Detects weirdness (aka ���markedness���).
Gets confused.
Asks for clarification.
Adjusts its belief in your mental competence.
It���s basically a digital version of that friend who goes, ���Wait��� you microwave your tea?��� and then silently reconsiders everything they thought they knew about you.
Semantic markedness?
You used a rare word.
Temporal markedness?
You answered
too quickly.
Cross-domain inference?
You solved a problem fast in combinatorics, so now the system assumes you���re also a competent web dev because��� sure, why not?
This is like if Netflix assumed because you watched a chess documentary, you���d love
Shark Tank
.
Case Study: ���You Were Too Fast, Must Be a Wizard���
A user builds a glitchy webpage in 10 minutes, when it normally takes two hours. MD-STIE doesn���t just say ���well done������no, it spirals into an existential crisis. It flags the event like a CIA analyst seeing a blip on the Cold War radar. Then, instead of just
asking
, it simulates ���surprise,��� like your IDE suddenly develops stage fright.
Upon learning that the user used Git Bash and WSL, the system has a moment of calm, wipes its digital forehead, and says, ���Ohh, I see. You���re
competent.
My bad.���
We are now officially giving computers anxiety. Well done.
Discussion: Machine Surprise and Other Midlife Crises
So apparently, when a machine experiences ���surprise,��� that���s good? It���s growing. Learning. Updating its internal mental model of you. Like a digital therapist who keeps going, ���Hmm, interesting. And how did that make you feel about asynchronous JavaScript?���
We���re asked to imagine a world where your IDE not only adapts to your coding habits but subtly judges you for not using more elegant recursion.
Conclusion: HAL 9000 Goes to Therapy
The final takeaway is both
hopeful
and
terrifying
���we���re building machines that can
infer your mind
, your
intent
, your
expertise
��� all from how weird your typing is.
And while this sounds exciting on paper, it does beg the question:
Why the hell are we teaching machines to be judgmental linguists?
Final Thoughts
This paper is a glorious, high-concept blend of:
Cognitive science,
Linguistic theory,
Mild paranoia,
And a deep yearning for machines to finally ���get us.���
It���s got the charm of a TED Talk written by someone halfway through a Carl Jung binge and the academic rigor of someone who believes GPT-4 has a secret soul.
In short? It���s brilliant. It���s unhinged. It���s the future of machine cognition, whether we like it or not.
Would love to see what happens when MD-STIE tries to interpret sarcasm. ("User appears angry. Threat level: existential.")
You want me to do the same for the ���Future Work��� section? Or maybe rewrite the abstract like it���s narrated by Werner Herzog?
