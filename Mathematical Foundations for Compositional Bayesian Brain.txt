Abstract 
This dissertation reports some frst steps towards a compositional account of active 
inferenceandtheBayesianbrain. Specifcally, weusethetoolsofcontemporaryapplied 
category theory to supply functorial semantics for approximate inference. To do so, we 
defne on the ���syntactic��� side the new notion of Bayesian lens and show that Bayesian 
updating composes according to the compositional lens pattern. Using Bayesian lenses, 
and inspired by compositional game theory, we defne categories of statistical games 
and use them to classify various problems of statistical inference. On the ���semantic��� 
side, we present a new formalization of general open dynamical systems (particularly: 
deterministic, stochastic, and random; and discrete- and continuous-time) as certain 
coalgebras of polynomial functors, which we show collect into monoidal opindexed 
categories (or, alternatively, into algebras for multicategories of generalized polynomial 
functors). We use these opindexed categories to defne monoidal bicategories of 
cilia: dynamical systems which control lenses, and which supply the target for 
our functorial semantics. Accordingly, we construct functors which explain the 
bidirectional compositional structure of predictive coding neural circuits under the 
free energy principle, thereby giving a formal mathematical underpinning to the 
bidirectionality observed in the cortex. Along the way, we explain how to compose 
rate-codedneuralcircuitsusinganalgebraforamulticategoryoflinearcircuitdiagrams,

category theory is unfamiliar to many computational neuroscientists and cognitive 
scientists, we have made a particular efort to give clear, detailed, and approachable 
expositions of all the category-theoretic structures and results of which we make use. 
We hope that this dissertation will prove helpful in establishing a new ���well-typed��� 
science of life and mind, and in facilitating interdisciplinary communication.

This doctoral dissertation by Toby St Clere Smithe from the University of Oxford is an exploration into the mathematical foundations of the Bayesian brain theory and active inference using applied category theory. This theoretical framework is often utilized in computational neuroscience and cognitive science.
Smithe introduces the concept of a Bayesian lens as a tool for approximate inference, demonstrating that Bayesian updating aligns with the compositional lens pattern. Inspired by compositional game theory, the work defines categories of statistical games to classify various problems of statistical inference.
The research also presents a novel formalization of open dynamical systems (like deterministic, stochastic, random, and those in discrete and continuous-time) as certain coalgebras of polynomial functors. These are collected into categories called monoidal opindexed categories or, alternatively, algebras for multicategories of generalized polynomial functors.
Smithe uses these mathematical structures to define monoidal bicategories of cilia, which are dynamical systems controlling lenses and acting as the target for functorial semantics. The dissertation builds functors that provide a mathematical explanation for the bidirectional structure seen in predictive coding neural circuits, which aligns with the free energy principle.
The work also explores how to compose rate-coded neural circuits using an algebra for a multicategory of linear circuit diagrams, demonstrating that this is encompassed by lenses and polynomial functors.
Throughout the dissertation, the author aims to make category theory - a complex field unfamiliar to many in computational neuroscience and cognitive science - more approachable by offering detailed and clear explanations. The aim of this dissertation is to contribute towards establishing a "well-typed" science of life and mind and to facilitate interdisciplinary communication.

1. Introduction 
Theworkofwhichthisdissertationisareportbeganasaprojecttounderstandthebrain���s���cognitive 
map���, its internal representation of the structure of the world. Little of that work is reported here, 
for it rapidly became clear at the outset that there was no coherent framework in which such a 
project should most proftably be undertaken. This is not to say that no progress on understanding 
the cognitive map can be made, a claim which would be easily contradicted by the evidence. Rather, 
each research group has its own language and its own research questions, and it is not always 
evident how to translate concepts from one group, or even one moment in time, faithfully to 
another; what translation is done is performed at best highly informally. 
If the aim of science1is to tell just-so stories, or if the aim is only to answer one���s own research 
questions in isolation, then this state of afairs may be perfectly satisfactory. But the brain and the 
behaviours that brains produce are so marvellous and so complex, and the implications of a fner 
understanding so monumental, that one cannot but hope that science could do better. Of course, of 
late, science has not been doing better, with disciplines as socially important as psychology [1] 
and medicine [2���4] and machine learning [5, 6] struck by crises of reproducibility. At the same 
time, as broadband internet has spread across the globe, the sheer amount of output produced by 
scientists and other researchers has ballooned, contributing to the impossibility of verifcation 
and the aforementioned translational difculties, at least if one desires to do other than simply 
following the herd. In some sense, although scientists all now speak English, science still lacks a 
lingua franca, or at least a sufciently precise one. 
As luck would have it, while mainstream science has been sufering from this loss of faith, 
the frst phrases of a potentially adequate precise new language have begun to spread, with the 
coalescence of a new community of researchers in applied category theory2. One part of the present 
difculty of scientifc translation is that each research group has not only its own language, but 
also its own perspective; and another part of the difculty is that these languages and perspectives 
1Or indeed, ���if the aim of scientists���, as science itself may not have volition of its own. 
2Thefrstmajorinterdisciplinarymeetingofappliedcategorytheorists(oratleastthefrstmeetingsufcientlyconfdent 
to take Applied Category Theory as its name) was held in 2018 in Leiden, although categorical methods have for some 
time been used in computer science [7] and physics [8], and especially at their nexus [9���11]. More sporadically, 
category theory had shown up elsewhere, such as in biology [12, 13], network theory [14���16], game theory [17���19], 
cognitive science [20���24] and linguistics [25���27], and in 2014 a workshop was held at Dagstuhl bringing together 
some of these researchers [28], in what was to be a precursor to the Applied Category Theory meetings; many of 
those researchers still work in this new interdisciplinary feld.

are not well connected, with the English language a very lossy medium through which to make 
these connections. Fortunately, the language of category theory���being a mathematical rather than 
a natural language���resolves both of these difculties. 
Category theory is the mathematics of pattern, composition, connection, and interaction; its 
concepts are as crisp and clear as the water of a mountain pool; its simplicity lends it great power. 
Categories describe how objects can be constructed from parts, and such compositional descriptions 
extend to categories themselves: as a result, the language of category theory is ���homoiconic���, and 
canbeusedtotranslateconstructionsbetweencontexts. Oneisabletoabstractawayfromirrelevant 
details, and show precisely how structures give rise to phenomena; and by choosing the abstractions 
carefully, it becomes possible to see that, sometimes, important constructions are ���universal���, able 
to be performed in any relevant context. As a result, category theory resolves both problems of 
scientifc translation indicated above: concepts expressed categorically are inevitably expressed in 
context, and not in isolation; and these contexts are naturally interconnected as if by a categorical 
web (with the connections also expressed categorically). Moreover, not being English, categorical 
defnitions tend to be extremely concise and information-dense; and since the basic concepts of 
category theory are themselves simple, concepts so expressed are not biased by geography or 
geopolitics.

From the middle of the 20thcentury, the concepts of category theory began to revolutionize much 
of mathematics3, and applied category theorists such as the present author believe that the time is 
nigh for this revolution to spread throughout the sciences and alleviate some of their struggles. 
Just as the internet constitutes physical infrastructure that fundamentally accelerates human 
communications, we expect category theory to constitute conceptual infrastructure of similar 
catalytic consequence. This thesis is a contribution to building this infrastructure, in the specifc 
domain of computational neuroscience and the general domain of (what was once, and will be again, 
called) cybernetics4. In particular, we show that a prominent theory of brain function���predictive 
coding���has a clear compositional structure, that explains the bidirectional circuitry observed in the 
brain [35], and that renders precise connections to the structure of statistical and machine learning 
3The basic concepts of category theory were originally written down by Eilenberg and Mac Lane in order to formalize 
processes of translation, and so clarify structures in the ways indicated in the main text above, in the feld of algebraic 
topology. This occurred at the end of the frst half of the 20thcentury, in 1945 [29]. The ideas soon spread beyond 
algebraic topology, gathering momentum rapidly from the 1950s, in which Cartan defned the concept of sheaf [30, 
31] and Grothendieck reconceived the foundations of algebraic geometry [32]. By the mid-1960s, and especially 
through the work of Lawvere on logic [33] and set theory [34], it was clear that category theory would be able to 
supply supple but sturdy new foundations for all of mathematics. 
4Owing to its afnity for pattern and abstraction, it is hard to do interesting domain-specifc work in category theory 
without there being at least some more general results to be found, and indeed this is the case here: what began as 
a project in theoretical neuroscience swiftly became a study of adaptive and cybernetic systems more broadly, of 
which the brain is of course the prime exemplar. 2 
systems [36���38], as well as to the structure of much larger scale adaptive systems traditionally 
modelled by economic game theory [17]. 
Predictive coding models were originally developed in the neuroscience of vision to explain 
observations that neural activity might decrease as signals became less surprising [39] (rather 
than increase as signals became more ���preferred���), as well as to explain the robustness of sensory 
processing to noise [40] and a source of metabolic efciency [41]5. The typical form of these 
models involves a neuron or neural ensemble representing the system���s current prediction of (or 
expectation about) its input, alongside another neuron or ensemble representing the diference 
between this prediction and the actual input (i.e., representing the prediction error). We can think 
of the former ensemble as directed from within the brain towards the sensory interface (such as 
the retina), and the latter ensemble as carrying information from the world into the brain: this is 
the aforementioned bidirectionality. 
Another important observation about visual processing in the brain is that its circuitry seems 
to be roughly hierarchical [42], with regions of cortex further from the retina being involved in 
increasingly abstract representation [43]. Given a model of predictive coding at the level of a single 
circuit, accompanied by models of how sensory circuits are coupled (and their representations 
transformed), a natural next step is to construct hierarchical predictive coding models, in an attempt 
to extend the benefts of the single circuit to a whole system; and indeed such hierarchical circuits 
were prominently proposed in the literature [39, 44].

The introduction to Toby St Clere Smithe's doctoral dissertation states that while the initial research intended to understand the brain's "cognitive map," it quickly became apparent that there was no consistent framework in which to approach such a project. The author laments the lack of a common language across different research groups, which makes it challenging to translate concepts faithfully from one group to another. This absence of a "lingua franca" in science is especially problematic given the ever-increasing volume of scientific output, driven by advancements like the internet.
St Clere Smithe suggests that applied category theory could provide the necessary precise language for scientific discourse. Category theory, a branch of mathematics dealing with abstract structure and organization, could offer a means of addressing the problem of scientific translation. It allows for abstraction from irrelevant details and precise demonstration of how structures create phenomena. Furthermore, concepts expressed categorically are inevitably contextual and interconnected, providing a more cohesive framework for scientific investigation.
The author believes that the principles of category theory, which have been transformative within mathematics, can bring similar revolutionary change to other scientific disciplines, particularly computational neuroscience and cybernetics. The thesis focuses on showing how predictive coding, a prominent theory of brain function, has a clear compositional structure explained by category theory. This structure helps make sense of the bidirectional circuitry observed in the brain, aligning it with statistical and machine learning systems, as well as with larger scale adaptive systems typically modeled by economic game theory.
The introduction concludes by discussing predictive coding models in the context of visual processing in the brain, noting their bidirectionality and hierarchical structure. The models involve neurons or neural ensembles predicting input and calculating the difference between this prediction and the actual input. Given the success of predictive coding at a single circuit level and the hierarchical nature of visual processing in the brain, the next logical step would be to construct hierarchical predictive coding models, which the author suggests is a prominent proposal in existing literature.

This hierarchical structure is a hint of compositionality, and thus a sign that a categorical 
approach may be helpful and enlightening. This impression is strengthened when one considers a 
particularly infuential class of predictive coding models, obtained in the context of the ���free energy 
principle��� [44���46], where the underlying equations themselves exhibit a form of compositionality 
which is (more or less explicitly) used to obtain the hierarchical models6. Despite this hint of 
compositionality, the equations of motion for these hierarchical systems are typically derived from 
scratch each time [35, 47���52], a redundant efort that would not be required had a compositional 
formalism such as category theory been used from the start. This thesis supplies such a categorical 
formalism and exemplifes it with hierarchical predictive coding under the free energy principle. 
The ���free energy��� framework not only underpins a modern understanding of predictive coding, 
but has more broadly been proposed as a unifed theory of brain function [45], and latterly of all 
adaptive or living systems [53���56]. In the neuroscientifc context, it constitutes a theory of the 
Bayesian brain, by which most orall brain function canbeunderstoodas implementing approximate 
5If the prediction is good, then communicating the diference between prediction and actuality can be done much more 
efciently than transmitting the whole incoming signal, which would contain much redundant information. This is 
the principle underlying most data compression algorithms. 
6That is to say, the dynamics of each level of hierarchy iare governed by a quantityFi, and the dynamics of two 
adjacent levels i and i ` 1 are governed by Fi` Fi`1; see Buckley et al. [47, Eq. 72].

Bayesian inference [57]; in the more broadly biological (or even metaphysical) contexts, this claim 
is generalized to state that all life can be understood in this way. However, despite these claims to 
universality, these proposals have to date been quite informally specifed, leading to confusion [58, 
59] and charges of unfalsifability [56, 60, 61]. As we will see, category theory has a rich formal 
vocabulary for precisely describing universal constructions, and so not only does a categorical 
formulation of the free energy framework promise to clarify the current confusions, but it may be 
expected also to shed light on its potential universality. In particular, as we describe in Chapter 7, 
we will be able to make precise the questions of whether any dynamical system of the appropriate 
type can universally be seen as performing approximate inference (in our language, ���playing a 
statistical game���), and of whether any cybernetic system (such as an economic game player) can be 
expressed as an active inference system. 
The notion of active inference is closely related to the free energy framework: an active inference 
model of a system describes both the processes by which it updates its internal states on the 
basis of incoming signals, and the processes by which it chooses how to act, using approximate 
Bayesian inference. In this thesis, we do not get as far as a completely general formulation of active 
inference, but we hope that our development of statistical games and their ���dynamical semantics��� 
in approximate inference doctrines will provide a useful starting point for such a formulation, and 
in our fnal chapter (7) we sketch how we might expect this formulation to go. Because active 
inference models, and the free energy framework more broadly, are descriptions of systems that 
are ���open��� to an environment, interacting with it, and therefore situated ���in context���, they are 
particularly suited to a category-theoretic reformulation. Likewise, Bayesianism and the free energy 
framework lend themselves to a subjectivist metaphysics [53, 62, 63], which is itself in alignment 
with the unavoidable perspective-taking of categorical models, and which is not dissimilar from 
the emerging ���biosemiotic��� reconceptualization of biological information-processing [64]. As we 
have indicated, categorical tools help us to draw connections between concepts, and we see our 
eforts as a contribution to this endeavour. 
It is through these connections that we hope eventually to make contact again with the cognitive 
map. As noted above, the state of the art is fragmented, but there exist current models that are 
expressed in the language of approximate (variational) inference [65], models expressed in the 
language of reinforcement learning [66], and models that attempt to combine the two [67]. We 
will see throughout the thesis that reinforcement learning (and its cousin, game theory) is closely 
related to approximate inference, and so we expect that the foundations developed here, along 
with the extensions proposed in ��7.1.3, will help us unify these accounts. The key observation that 
we expect to drive such a development is that learning a cognitive map (alternatively, learning 
a ���world model���) means internalizing a representation of the structure of the environment; and 
comparing and translating structures is category theory���s forte.

Of course, even if the theory that we develop is sufcient to unify these computational- 
phenomenological models, this is not to say it will satisfy all neuroscientists, many of which 
may be expected to desire more biologically detailed models. In the contemporary undergraduate 
neuroscience curriculum, one is taught informally to relate models at a high ���computational��� level 
to lower level models concerned with biological ���implementation���, following Marr���s ���three levels 
of explanation��� [42]. As we discuss in ��2.2.3, this story is a shadow of the categorical notion of 
functorial semantics, by which structures are translated precisely between contexts formalized 
as categories. Although we concentrate on the more abstract computational level in this thesis, 
our discussion of functorial semantics foreshadows the introduction of formal algebraic tools for 
building biologically plausible neural circuit models (��3.3). 
Our treatment of cognitive and neural systems is not the frst to adopt categorical methods, 
but we do believe that it is the frst to do so in a comprehensively integrated and wide-ranging 
way, taking functorial semantics seriously. Categorical concepts have been variously proposed 
in biology as early as 1958 [12], and in cognitive science (with one eye toward the brain) since at 
least 1987 [21, 68]; more recently, category theory has been used to study classic cognitive-science 
concepts such as systematicity [20]. While inspirational, these studies do not make the most of the 
translational power of categories, using only some concepts or methods in isolation. Moreover, 
by working almost purely categorically, these works were invariably rather abstract, and did not 
make direct contact with the tools and concepts of mainstream mathematical science. As a result, 
they did not have the unifying impact or adoption that we hope the new wave of applied category 
theoretical developments to have. 
Our primary motivation in writing this thesis is to lay the groundwork for well-typed cognitive 
science and computational neuroscience. ���Types��� are what render categorical concepts so precise, 
and what allow categorical models to be so cleanly compositional: two systems can only ���plug 
together��� if their interface types match. Because every concept in category theory has a type (i.e., 
every object is an object of some category), categorical thinking is forced to be very clear. As we 
will sketch in ��2.3.4, the ���type theories��� (or ���internal languages���) of categories can be very richly 
structured, but still the requirement to express concepts with types is necessarily burdensome. But 
this burden is only the burden of thinking clearly: if one is not able to supply a detailed type, one 
can resort to abstraction. And, to avoid the violence of declaring some object to be identifed as of 
some type7, it is necessary to understand the relationships between types; fortunately, as we will 
soon make clear, and as we have attempted to emphasize, category theory is fundamentally the 
mathematics of relationship. 
Contemporary science is unavoidably computational, and the notion of ���type��� that we invoke 
here is closely related to (though not identical with) the informal notion of type that is used in 
7A perspective for which we must thank Brendan Fong. 5 
computer programming. Just as one of the strategies adopted to overcome the crises of modern 
science that we invoked at the opening of this introduction is the making available of the code and 
data that underlie scientifc studies, we can envisage a near future in which accompanying these is 
a formal specifcation of the types of the concepts that each study is about8. Some work along these 
lines has already begun, particularly with the development of tha Algebraic Julia ecosystem [69]. 
The free energy framework, like the structurally adjacent framework of compositional game 
theory, has a strong favour of teleology (that follows directly from its mathematics): systems act in 
order to make their predictions come true. We therefore hope that, although we do not quite get as 
far as a full compositional theory of active inference, the contributions reported in this dissertation 
may in some small way help to make this particular prediction (of a well-typed science) come 
true, and thereby help to overcome some of the aforenoted crises of scientifc faith���as well as to 
shed light not only on the form and function of ���Bayesian��� brains, but also other complex adaptive 
systems, such as the whole scientifc community itself.

Aims and Expectations
While the theory we develop aims to unify computational-phenomenological models, it may not satisfy all neuroscientists who desire more biologically detailed models. The traditional neuroscience curriculum focuses on Marr's "three levels of explanation", attempting to connect high computational level models with lower-level biological implementation models. In our study, we view this connection through the lens of functorial semantics, a category theory concept. This allows for precise translation of structures between various formalized contexts, which we believe could potentially be extended to building biologically plausible neural circuit models.
Our approach to studying cognitive and neural systems through category theory is not entirely new, but we believe it is the first to comprehensively and integratively apply functorial semantics. Despite early introduction of categorical concepts in biology and cognitive science, previous studies have not fully leveraged the translational power of categories, often using only certain concepts or methods in isolation. Consequently, these works did not make a significant unifying impact or find broad adoption.
The primary aim of this thesis is to pave the way for a well-typed cognitive science and computational neuroscience. Category theory's precise 'types' facilitate clean compositional models: two systems can only integrate if their interface types align. This strict typology requires clarity of thought, though the burden of specifying detailed types can be mitigated by abstraction. Understanding the relationships between types is crucial, and category theory, as the mathematics of relationships, is particularly well-equipped for this task.
The notion of 'type' invoked here has parallels with the informal notion used in computer programming. In the same way that the transparency of code and data is a solution to modern science's reproducibility crisis, we envision a future where formal specification of concept types accompanies each scientific study. Some progress has already been made in this direction with the development of the Algebraic Julia ecosystem.
Both the free energy framework and compositional game theory entail a strong element of teleology: systems act to validate their own predictions. Though our work doesn't fully achieve a comprehensive compositional theory of active inference, we hope that it will contribute to the realization of a well-typed science, thereby addressing some of the crises in science. Furthermore, it aims to shed light not only on the operation of 'Bayesian' brains, but also on other complex adaptive systems, including the scientific community as a whole.

1.1. Overview of the dissertation 
Category theory being quite alien to most researchers in computational neuroscience (and the 
cognitive sciences more broadly), we begin the work of this dissertation in Chapter 2 with 
a comprehensive review of the concepts and results needed to understand our mathematical 
contributions. Using three hopefully familiar examples, we introduce categories as contrapuntal 
to graphs, which are more familiar to scientists, but which lack important features of categories 
such as composition and (somehow) dynamism. We then explain how enriched categories allow us 
to ���connect the connections��� of categories, and attach extra data to them, and we exemplify these 
concepts with the 2-category of categories, functors, and natural transformations���as well as a more 
formal discussion of functorial ���translation��� and semantics. The remainder of Chapter 2 is dedicated 
to introducing the remaining key concepts of basic category theory: universal constructions, and 
the Yoneda Lemma (categories��� fundamental theorem). 
In Chapter 3, we begin to reapproach neural modelling, and more generally the ���algebraic��� 
modelling of the structure of interacting systems. We explain how ���monoidal��� categories allow us to 
consider processes ���in parallel��� (as well as just sequentially), and how this gives us a formal account 
of the concept of ���parameterized��� system. We then change the perspective a little, and introduce 
our frst piece of original work: an account of how to connect neural circuits into larger-scale 
systems, using ���multicategorical��� algebra. The remainder of the chapter is dedicated to developing 
8One might think of this specifcation as akin to a scientifcally elaborated version of the notion of header fle in 
programming languages such as C or C++: these fles specify the types of functions and data structures, typically 
without instantiating these types with detailed implementations. We can thus think of category theory as a very rich 
metaprogramming language for the mathematical sciences (and this analogy goes quite far, as categorical proofs are 
typically ���constructive��� and hence correspond to computable functions, as we also sketch in ��2.3.4).

the theory of such algebra to the point needed later in the thesis, ending with the introduction 
of polynomial functors which will supply a rich syntax for the interaction of systems, as well as a 
language in which to express their dynamical semantics. 
Chapter 4 presents our frst main result, that Bayesian updating composes according to the 
categorical ���lens��� pattern. This result is abstractly stated, and so applies to whichever compositional 
model of probability one might be interested in���but because we are later interested in concrete 
models, we spend much of the chapter developing compositional probability theory using the tools 
introduced in Chapters 2 and 3 and instantiating it in discrete and continuous settings. We also 
introduce and contextualize the lens pattern, in order to defne the notion of Bayesian lens, which 
provides a mathematical formalization of the bidirectionality of predictive coding circuits. 
Our main aim in this thesis is to formalize predictive coding through functorial semantics, and 
Bayesian lenses will provide an important part of the ���syntax��� of statistical models that we need. In 
Chapter 5, we introduce the corresponding semantical categories, with a new abstract formalization 
of the concept of open dynamical system. We make much use here of the language of polynomial 
functors: they will represent both the interfaces of interacting systems, with the dynamical systems 
themselves being defned as particular classes of morphisms of polynomials. We then synthesize 
these developments with the algebraic structures of Chapter 3, to defne monoidal bicategories of 
cybernetic systems. 
Chapter 6 presents our functorial formalization of predictive coding, using a new notion of 
approximate inference doctrine, by which statistical models are translated into dynamical systems. 
This formalizes the process by which research in active inference turns the abstract specifcation of 
a ���generative model��� (Defnition 6.2.12) into a dynamical system that can be simulated and whose 
behaviours can then be compared with experimentally observed data. This formalization proceeds 
via a classifcation of various statistical problems into statistical games. 
Finally, Chapter 7 reviews the prospects for future work, from the mathematics of the cognitive 
map (a programme that we call compositional cognitive cartography), to the composition of multi- 
agent systems and ecosystems and the connections with compositional game theory (and other 
categorical approaches to cybernetics). We close with some speculation on a new mathematics of 
life, along with associated developments of fundamental theory.

1.1. Dissertation Overview
Chapter 2 initiates this dissertation by providing a comprehensive review of concepts and results necessary to understand the mathematical contributions of our work. Since category theory might be unfamiliar to most researchers in computational neuroscience and cognitive sciences, we start with examples illustrating categories as a counterpoint to the more commonly understood graphs. This introduction sets the stage for a deeper exploration of enriched categories, universal constructions, and the Yoneda Lemma, which are fundamental concepts in basic category theory.
Chapter 3 reengages with neural modeling and explores the 'algebraic' modeling of interacting systems. Here, we introduce 'monoidal' categories that facilitate considering processes "in parallel" as well as sequentially, offering a formal account of 'parameterized' systems. This chapter also introduces our first piece of original work, showcasing how to connect neural circuits into larger-scale systems using 'multicategorical' algebra. We then develop the theory of algebra to a necessary point for use later in the thesis.
Chapter 4 presents our first primary result: Bayesian updating composes according to the categorical 'lens' pattern. This abstract statement applies universally to compositional models of probability. Much of this chapter is spent developing compositional probability theory and defining the notion of Bayesian lenses, which provides a mathematical formalization of predictive coding circuits' bidirectionality.
Chapter 5 introduces semantical categories to formalize predictive coding through functorial semantics. This chapter presents a new abstract formalization of the concept of open dynamical system using the language of polynomial functors. We then synthesize these developments with the algebraic structures from Chapter 3 to define monoidal bicategories of cybernetic systems.
In Chapter 6, we present our functorial formalization of predictive coding using a new notion of approximate inference doctrine. This formalization transforms statistical models into dynamical systems, a process central to research in active inference.
Chapter 7 reviews future work prospects, from the mathematics of the cognitive map to the composition of multi-agent systems, ecosystems, and links with compositional game theory. We conclude with speculations on a new mathematics of life and associated developments of fundamental theory.

1.2. Contributions
This thesis presents several novel contributions, primarily the formalization of predictive coding circuits as functorial semantics. We introduce and develop categories of statistical games and Bayesian lenses and demonstrate that Bayesian updates compose optically. Another significant contribution is the representation of general open dynamical systems as specific polynomial coalgebras, along with the concept of cilia and their associated monoidal bicategories.
These categories of statistical games and Bayesian lenses provide the syntax, and the monoidal bicategories of cilia offer the semantics, for our functorial treatment of predictive coding. This forms the basis for our compositional active inference framework. Although these concepts draw inspiration from previous work, to our knowledge, the structures themselves are new.
The research leading to these contributions has been shared through publications, primarily refereed presentations at the conference on Applied Category Theory (ACT) in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Preliminary work has been showcased at NeurIPS 2019, through various informal invited talks, a full-day workshop at the 2022 Cognitive Science Society conference, and our ongoing series of preprints on compositional active inference. We are currently preparing a paper detailing our compositional framework for predictive coding for computational neuroscientists.
Beyond these specific contributions, this dissertation aims to stimulate a renaissance in cognitive and computational (neuro)science through the application of categorical methods. Our thorough exposition of the basic theory is intended as a helpful guide for interested researchers.
Some work conducted during the author���s DPhil studies is not included in this dissertation, notably simulation results on a fragment of the circuitry underlying the cognitive map���a study on the development of place and head-direction cells. This research motivated our algebra of rate-coded neural circuits, which is, to the best of our knowledge, novel. We also omit our work on Bayesian optics and do not present in detail the examples of ���polynomial life��� presented at ACT 2021.

scientistwhohasnoticedthe���network���structureofcomplexsystemslikethebrainandwhowonders 
how this structure relates to the systems��� function. Category theory gives us a mathematical 
framework in which precise answers to such questions can be formulated, and reveals the 
interconnectedness of scientifc ideas. After introducing the notions of category and diagram 
(��2.1), we swiftly introduce the notions of enriched category, functor, and adjunction (��2.2), with 
which we can translate and compare mathematical concepts. We then explain how category theory 
formalizes pattern as well as translation, using the concept of universal construction (��2.3), which 
we exemplify with many common and important patterns. Finally, we introduce the fundamental 
theorem of category theory, the Yoneda Lemma, which tells us that to understand a thing is to see 
it from all perspectives (��2.4). 
Category theory is well established in the foundations of mathematics, but not yet explicitly in 
the foundations of science. As a result, although the only slightly original part of this chapter is its 
presentation, we have given proofs of most results and plentiful examples, in order to familiarize 
the reader with thinking categorically.

Basic Category Theory for Computational and Cognitive (Neuro)scientists
This chapter provides a comprehensive review of basic category theory concepts and results that form the foundation for the rest of this thesis. The audience in mind is computational neuroscientists or cognitive scientists who have recognized the network-like structure of complex systems such as the brain and are curious about how this structure influences these systems' function. Category theory offers a mathematical framework that allows for precise formulations of such questions and reveals the interconnectedness of scientific concepts.
We begin with introducing the ideas of category and diagram (��2.1), then quickly move on to enriched categories, functors, and adjunctions (��2.2), which enable us to translate and compare mathematical notions. We also describe how category theory formalizes patterns as well as translations, using the concept of universal construction (��2.3), with numerous examples of common and significant patterns. Finally, we introduce the fundamental theorem of category theory, the Yoneda Lemma, which states that understanding an object means seeing it from all perspectives (��2.4).
While category theory has established its place in the foundations of mathematics, it is yet to be explicitly recognized in the foundations of science. As such, despite the presentation being the only slightly original part of this chapter, we have provided proofs of most results and plentiful examples to help the reader get accustomed to categorical thinking.
2.1. Categories, Graphs, and Networks
We commence by motivating the use of category theory by examining what is lacking in a purely graph-theoretic understanding of complex computational systems. As we progress through the thesis, we will demonstrate how each of the diagrams depicted below can be formalized categorically, encompassing all scientifically relevant information into coherent mathematical objects.

2.4. The Yoneda Lemma: a human perspective 
We end this chapter by introducing the fundamental theorem of category theory, the Yoneda 
Lemma, which expresses mathematically the idea that to know how a thing is related to other 
things is to know the identity of the thing itself. The notion of relational identity is recognized 
throughout human endeavour. In linguistics, it underlies the observation of Firth [86] that ���you 
shall know a word by the company it keeps!���, which in turn is the foundation of distributional 
semantics and thus much of contemporary natural language processing in machine learning. In 
culture, it is illustrated by the ancient parable of the blind men and the elephant, in which the 
identity of the creature is only known by stitching together evidence from many perspectives. 
In society, it is refected in the South African philosophy of ubuntu (meaning ���I am because we 
57 
are���) and the M��aori notion of whanaungatanga (in which personal identity is developed through 
kinship), and the observation that ���actions speak louder than words���. Finally, the Yoneda Lemma is 
manifest in science, where our understanding of phenomena derives from the accumulation across 
contexts of results and their interpretation and translation: no single individual understands the 
totality of any subject, and no subject or phenomenon is understood in isolation. 
2.4.1. Formalizing categorical reasoning via the Yoneda embedding 
In ��2.3.4, we saw how Cartesian closed categories allow us to internalize categorical reasoning. The 
categorySetis the archetypal Cartesian closed category, and constitutes the base of enrichment 
for all locally small categories. The Yoneda embedding allows us to move from reasoning about 
the objects in any given categoryCto 
reasoning about the morphisms between its hom sets: the 
natural transformations between hom functors. In this context, the hom functors constitute special 
examples of functors into the base of enrichment, which we call ���presheaves��� (contravariantly) and 
���copresheaves��� (covariantly), and which can be thought of as C-shaped diagrams in Set. 
Defnition2.4.1.LetCbeacategory. Apresheaf onCisafunctorC 
op �� Set. Dually, acopresheaf 
is a functorC �� Set. The corresponding functor categories are the categories of (co)presheaves on 
C. 
Remark 2.4.2.In the enriched setting, whenCis enriched inE, anE-presheaf is anE-functor 
C 
op �� E and an E-copresheaf is an E-functor C �� E. 
As a frst example of a presheaf, we have an alternative defnition of the notion of directed graph. 
Example 2.4.3.LetGdenote the category of Example 2.1.5 containing two objects0and1and 
two morphisms s,t : 0 �� 1. Then a directed graph is a presheaf on G. 
This defnition is justifed by the following proposition. 
Proposition 2.4.4.There is an equivalence of categoriesGraph ��� SetG 
op, where Graphis the 
category of directed graphs introduced in Example 2.1.11. 
Proof.To each graphGwe can associate a presheafG : Gop�� Setby defningGp0q :��� G0, 
Gp1q :��� G1,Gpsq :��� domGandGptq :��� codG; and to each presheaf we can likewise associate a 
graph, so that we have defned a bijection on objects. It therefore only remains to show that there 
is a bijection between graph homomorphisms and natural transformations accordingly: but this is 
easy to see once we have observed that the graph homomorphism axioms are precisely the law of 
naturality, as illustrated diagrammatically in (2.1).

2.4. The Yoneda Lemma: A Human Perspective
This chapter concludes with an introduction to the fundamental theorem of category theory - the Yoneda Lemma. This theorem articulates mathematically that knowing how a thing relates to other things equates to knowing the identity of the thing itself. The concept of relational identity is recognized across various human endeavors.
In linguistics, it underpins Firth's [86] observation that ���you shall know a word by the company it keeps!���, which in turn serves as the foundation of distributional semantics and a large portion of contemporary natural language processing in machine learning. The ancient parable of the blind men and the elephant exemplifies this concept in culture, where the identity of the creature is determined by piecing together evidence from various perspectives. In society, it is mirrored in the South African philosophy of ubuntu (meaning ���I am because we are���) and the M��ori notion of whanaungatanga, which concerns developing personal identity through kinship. Lastly, the Yoneda Lemma is embodied in science, where our comprehension of phenomena comes from an accumulation of results across contexts, their interpretation, and translation.
2.4.1. Formalizing Categorical Reasoning via the Yoneda Embedding
In ��2.3.4, we discussed how Cartesian closed categories enable us to internalize categorical reasoning. The category Set is the archetypal Cartesian closed category and forms the base of enrichment for all locally small categories. The Yoneda embedding allows us to transition from reasoning about the objects in any given category C to reasoning about the morphisms between its hom sets: the natural transformations between hom functors.
In this context, the hom functors are special examples of functors into the base of enrichment, which we call 'presheaves' (contravariantly) and 'copresheaves' (covariantly), and can be considered as C-shaped diagrams in Set.
Definition 2.4.1. A presheaf on a category C is a functor C^op ��� Set. Conversely, a copresheaf is a functor C ��� Set. The corresponding functor categories are the categories of (co)presheaves on C.
As a first example of a presheaf, we have an alternative definition for a directed graph.
Example 2.4.3. If G is the category from Example 2.1.5 that contains two objects and two morphisms s,t : 0 ��� 1, then a directed graph is a presheaf on G.
Proposition 2.4.4. provides that there is an equivalence of categories between Graph and Set^G^op, where Graph is the category of directed graphs introduced in Example 2.1.11. The proof of this proposition provides an association between graphs and presheaves, justifying the example mentioned above.

Sure, here are the definitions for some of the potentially unfamiliar terms used in the given text:
Category Theory
: A branch of mathematics that deals with mathematical structures and their relationships. It formalizes mathematical concepts as collections of objects and arrows (morphisms) between them.
Presheaf
: A mathematical tool that assigns data to the objects and morphisms of a category in a way that preserves the morphisms' structure. Precisely, a presheaf on a category C is a functor from C^op (the opposite category) to Set (the category of sets).
Copresheaf
: The dual notion of a presheaf. It is a functor from a category C to Set (the category of sets).
Functor
: A mapping between categories. Functors can be thought of as homomorphisms between categories.
Hom sets
: In a category C, for any two objects x and y, the collection of all morphisms from x to y is called a hom-set.
Yoneda Lemma
: A key result in category theory which relates a functor defined on a category C to the set of natural transformations to the hom-functor from C.
Cartesian Closed Category
: A category that has finite products and for each of its objects A, the functor - x A (product with A) has a right adjoint.
Natural Transformation
: A relation between two functors that associates to every object in the source category of the functors, a morphism in the target category of the functors. This should be done in a way that is "compatible" with the morphisms of the source category.
Enriched Category
: A generalization of a category where the hom-sets are replaced by objects from some other category that has more structure than sets.
Adjunction
: A pair of functors operating between two categories in opposite directions such that they are "almost inverse" to each other.
Morphisms
: Arrows between objects in a category representing some sort of transformation from one object to another.
Graph-theoretic
: Pertains to the mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph is made up of vertices (or nodes) which are connected by edges.
These definitions should help you better understand the complex concepts in the provided text. However, they are simplifications and the full concepts can involve more nuance and detail.

Give some analogies and metaphors to explain the Yoneda lemma.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The Yoneda Lemma is a fundamental principle in category theory. It formalizes the idea that an object in a category is completely determined by its relationships to other objects. Let's explain this complex mathematical concept through a couple of metaphors:
The Social Network Analogy
: Consider how people are often defined by their relationships within a social network. The Yoneda Lemma is like saying you can understand who a person is (their "identity") by understanding their relationships with everyone else in the network. You know someone as a "friend of Alice", "cousin of Bob", "colleague of Eve", and so on. This collection of relationships completely defines the individual within the network.
The Map Analogy
: Imagine a city where every building is defined by its distances and directions from all the other buildings (e.g., the post office is 3 blocks north of the library, the bakery is 2 blocks west of the post office). The Yoneda Lemma is like saying you can uniquely identify any building just by knowing these relationships - its distances and directions from all the other buildings.
The Recipe Analogy
: Suppose every recipe is described by how it relates to other recipes (e.g., recipe A is like recipe B but with more sugar, or recipe C is a vegan version of recipe D). The Yoneda Lemma says that a recipe can be identified entirely by these relations to other recipes.
The Blind Men and the Elephant
: This is a famous parable in which several blind men each touch different parts of an elephant and then describe the elephant based on their limited experience (e.g., the man who touched the trunk thinks the elephant is like a snake). The Yoneda Lemma is like saying you can understand the "elephant" (the object in the category) by collecting all these different perspectives.
These metaphors capture the essence of the Yoneda Lemma: understanding an object through its relationships with others.

How is it a generalization of Cayley's theorem in group theory?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Cayley's theorem in group theory states that every group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group acting on G. In other words, you can represent the elements of a group by permutations on the group itself. The symmetric group of a set is the group of all permutations of the set.
The Yoneda Lemma can be seen as a vast generalization of this principle. Like Cayley's theorem, which relates a group to permutations of the group, the Yoneda Lemma expresses a category in terms of natural transformations of functors, which are a kind of "permutation" or transformation in the category of all categories.
In essence, Cayley's theorem is about how groups can be represented by the actions on their elements, while the Yoneda Lemma is about how objects in a category can be represented by their morphisms (relations) to other objects. Both principles convey the idea that objects (whether group elements or objects in a category) can be fully understood through their relations with others.
However, the Yoneda Lemma operates at a higher level of abstraction and applies to a broader range of structures than Cayley's theorem, which is specifically about groups. Hence, the Yoneda Lemma is seen as a profound generalization of the intuition behind Cayley's theorem.

What's a dedekind cut?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
A Dedekind cut is a concept in the field of real analysis and number theory that was introduced by the German mathematician Richard Dedekind. It's a method of defining the real numbers in a rigorous manner, starting from the rational numbers.
A Dedekind cut is essentially a partition of the set of rational numbers into two non-empty sets A and B, such that:
Every element of A is less than every element of B.
A contains no greatest number.
These two sets A and B represent a cut (split) in the rational numbers. The real number that this cut represents is the least element of B (if it exists), or it is considered to be the "gap" that's left over if there is no such least element. This allows us to construct irrational numbers which can't be represented as fractions, thus filling in the gaps in the rational numbers to create the real numbers.
For example, if we take all the rational numbers less than 2, we have a Dedekind cut where set A contains all rationals less than 2 and set B contains all rationals greater or equal to 2. This cut represents the real number 2.
If we take all the rational numbers whose square is less than 2 and all those whose square is greater than or equal to 2, we get a Dedekind cut representing the square root of 2, an irrational number. Note that in this case, the set A contains no greatest number (there's no rational number whose square is exactly 2), which exemplifies the capability of Dedekind cuts to represent irrational numbers.

The concept of a Dedekind cut may not appear directly related to Category Theory or the Yoneda Lemma at first glance, as it is more often encountered in the field of real analysis or number theory. However, the idea of a Dedekind cut and the principles of Category Theory can connect through the concept of "completeness," which is a central idea in both areas.
Category Theory and Completeness
: In category theory, we often talk about complete categories. A category is said to be complete if all small limits exist in it. This notion of completeness ensures that we can carry out certain constructions and reason about objects in the category in a precise way.
Dedekind cuts and Completeness
: Dedekind cuts are used in real analysis to 'complete' the rational numbers. The rational numbers themselves are not complete in the sense that there are "gaps" (e.g., irrational numbers) that are not accounted for. By using Dedekind cuts, we essentially fill in these gaps to create the real numbers, a complete ordered field.
In both cases, the concept of completeness plays a key role in giving us a richer structure to work with (complete categories in Category Theory and the real numbers in real analysis). The formal definitions and specifics differ, but the underlying motivation is similar.
Moreover, both Category Theory and the concept of Dedekind cuts are examples of "abstraction" in mathematics. Just as Dedekind cuts provide an abstract, rigorous definition of real numbers, Category Theory provides an abstract framework to talk about mathematical structure.
While the connection might not be direct, the principles that govern these two concepts reflect common themes in mathematics���abstraction, structure, and completeness.

For posets, Yoneda's lemma says that an object is determined up to isomorphism by the set of objects less than or equal to it (equivalently, the set of objects greater than or equal to it). In other words, it is determined by a Dedekind cut! In other other words, Yoneda's lemma for posets says the following:

a���b if and only if for all objects c we have c���a���c���b.

Your statement provides a beautiful bridge between the Yoneda Lemma in category theory and Dedekind cuts from order theory. Let's unpack what you've said:
Yoneda Lemma in the context of posets:
A poset (partially ordered set) can be thought of as a category where each pair of objects has at most one morphism between them. If you think of each object
a
as a functor from the category to the category of sets (which is the basis for the Yoneda Lemma), then knowing what morphisms map to
a
is equivalent to knowing which objects in the poset are less than or equal to
a
.
Connection to Dedekind Cuts:
A Dedekind cut in a totally ordered set is a partition of the set into two non-empty parts such that all elements of the first part are less than all elements of the second part. For posets (and hence categories with at most one morphism between each pair of objects), the set of objects less than or equal to a given object
a
can be thought of as a Dedekind cut.
So, in the context of posets, the Yoneda Lemma is essentially saying that an object
a
is uniquely determined by its "cut" in the poset, or equivalently, by the objects that are less than or equal to it.
The last line in your statement is a formal way of expressing this:
a
is less than or equal to
b
if and only if, for all objects
c
, if
c
is less than or equal to
a
, then
c
is also less than or equal to
b
. This again reflects the key idea of the Yoneda Lemma: an object is determined by its relationships (in this case, its order relations) with all other objects.

foundations. CT has also an important impact on the philosophy of mathematics 
as many authors claim it to be the proper expression of structuralistic intuitions 
concerning mathematical ontology. The philosophical impact of category theory is 
not restricted to the philosophy of mathematics as it provides important conceptual 
tools with which to discuss fundamental metaphysical concepts such as identity or 
analogy. 
One of the fundamental philosophical questions concerning mathematics is its

The excerpt provided is discussing the role of category theory (CT) in explaining physical phenomena. The author is exploring the debate surrounding the use of mathematics, and specifically category theory, as a tool for providing scientific explanations. There are a few key points in this excerpt:
Category Theory's Applications:
Category theory is a branch of mathematics that is applied in many mathematical disciplines, such as differential geometry, algebraic topology, and computer science. Additionally, it has implications for physics. Some proponents of category theory argue that it provides an alternative foundation for mathematics that differs from the standard set-theoretic foundations.
Category Theory's Philosophical Impact:
The influence of category theory extends beyond the realm of mathematics to the philosophy of mathematics. It is argued that category theory is a good representation of structuralist intuitions about mathematical ontology. It also provides conceptual tools for discussing fundamental metaphysical concepts like identity or analogy.
The Explanatory Role of Mathematics:
The role of mathematics in scientific explanations is a major philosophical question. The author is specifically interested in the explanatory status of category theory. The debate revolves around whether mathematics has inherent explanatory power (i.e., can it provide "genuine mathematical explanations" in science) or if it serves merely as an auxiliary system or a convenient way of representing phenomena, without intrinsic explanatory virtues.
In essence, this text is discussing whether category theory can offer a genuine explanation of physical phenomena, or if it is merely a useful tool for representing these phenomena. The author appears to lean towards the latter view, arguing that while category theory does contribute to our understanding of physics, it does not necessarily offer a direct explanation of physical phenomena.

The discussion is not settled, but in this paper I assume that the notion of mathe- 
matical explanation is sound: (at least some) mathematical notions, techniques and 
disciplinescanprovideexplanationsofphysicalphenomena,butitisclearthatmath- 
ematical disciplines profoundly differ in their potential applicability. Obviously, dif- 
ferential equations are much more likely to do some explanatory job in physics than 
set theory, which deals with (for example) the relative consistency of large cardinal 
axioms, or embeddings of inner models. A natural question is whether category the-

I think that it is not explanatory in the sense which seems to be standard in the 
philosophical literature; however, this negative claim is a good starting point for the 
discussion concerning the epistemic contributions of category theory, in particular 
its (perhaps nonstandard) explanatory role. This statement might be re-interpreted 
in a ���dual form��� as a claim concerning the notion of explanation.2This issue really 
involves two sub-problems: (1) What is the role of CT in physics? (2) How do we 
interpret the notion of ���mathematical explanation in science���? These two questions 
might be viewed as a special case of more general problems: (1) Does theory T have 
any explanatory contributions for (within) science S? (2) What do we mean by ���the 
explanatory contribution of T within S���? 
So, analyzing the (possible) explanatory role of CT also contributes to our under- 
standing of the notion of explanation. Indeed, CT shows its power in the context 
of fundamental issues that do not represent concrete phenomena and which should 
perhaps be considered metaphysical rather than physical���its strength is revealed on

In this excerpt, the author is continuing to discuss the role of category theory (CT) in explaining physical phenomena. The author maintains the stance that mathematics can provide explanations for physical phenomena, but there is variance in the potential applicability of different mathematical disciplines. Here are the main points the author discusses:
Explanatory Role of Category Theory:
The author seeks to investigate whether category theory, like other mathematical disciplines, provides explanations in science. Although the author does not believe category theory to be explanatory in the standard philosophical sense, they see this position as a good starting point for discussing the epistemic contributions and the potential explanatory role of category theory.
Two Sub-Problems:
The author proposes two sub-problems to be addressed: the role of CT in physics, and the interpretation of the notion of "mathematical explanation in science". These two questions can be generalized to any theory T and science S, i.e., does theory T have any explanatory contributions for science S, and what do we mean by "the explanatory contribution of T within S".
Analyzing Category Theory's Role:
The author asserts that analyzing the possible explanatory role of category theory can contribute to our understanding of the notion of explanation. They suggest that category theory shows its power in the context of fundamental, possibly metaphysical, issues rather than in representing concrete phenomena.
No Explanations in Standard Sense:
The author mentions some classic examples of mathematical explanations of physical phenomena, particularly noting the significance of topological explanations. They argue that, according to the standard interpretation of explanation in the literature, category theory does not provide explanatory power in physics. Therefore, if category theory is to be considered explanatory, the notion of explanation must be understood differently.
Category Theory in Physics:
The author uses the example of Isham's Topos Quantum Theory (TQT) program to argue that the epistemic virtues of category theory lie at a meta level, making it a "theory of theories" rather than a theory about a specific subject. They further discuss whether gaining metatheoretical knowledge can contribute to our understanding at the object level and assert that the explanatory contributions of category theory have a philosophical rather than a specific scientific character.
In essence, the author is proposing that category theory, although not providing direct explanations for physical phenomena in the standard sense, can offer insightful metatheoretical knowledge that contributes to our overall understanding of scientific phenomena and theories.

Recently, the problem of the explanatory role of mathematics within physics (and 
science in general) has received much attention.4The question is whether there are 
any mathematical explanations in science, i.e. whether it is mathematics which pro- 
vides explanatory power. This is a subtle problem as we have to distinguish between

4I refer to the philosophical literature concerning the problem of mathematical explanations of 
physical phenomena (and mathematical explanations in science in general). Even if there is dis- 
agreement concerning the very existence of mathematical explanations, there seems to be a kind of 
consensus concerning the problem of what they might be (if they existed). 
5The notion of a purely physicalist language might not appear to be very clear. For instance, we 
might think even of the language of calculus as physicalist (at least to some extent), as the notion 
of derivative has a very clear physical inspiration and interpretation. More abstract mathematical 
theories do not have such direct connections to observations and the physical meaning of terms can 
be understood only indirectly. The term ���nominalistic language��� could be used here, as it seems 
to be better def i ned in philosophical literature; however, the discussion of this topic is outside the 
scope of this paper.

expressible otherwise.6The literature on the subject is immense, so I am only able to 
give a few examples without going into details; they vary in their technical intricacy 
(some being very elementary), but all are meant to illustrate a general phenomenon: 
when looking for an explanation of some physical fact, we turn our attention to the 
mathematical structure of the problem rather than to the network of causal relations, 
the underlying mechanisms, the particular course of events etc. For instance, the fact 
that the famous Seven Bridges of K��nigsberg cannot be crossed in such a way that 
everybridgeiscrossedexactlyonceisexplainedbyasimpletheoremingraphtheory, 
not by examining the physical properties of the bridges (e.g. the material they are 
made of, their dimensions, their temperature distribution, the mental processes that 
accompany the attempts, etc.). Similarly, the structure of honeycombs is explained 
by a mathematical theorem: hexagonal tiling minimizes the total perimeter length 
[6], therefore bees do not waste wax and they gain an evolutionary advantage.7 
An important class that is receiving growing attention is topological explana- 
tions, which are found in biology, ecology, medicine, brain sciences and even social 
science.8Some accounts of theories of scientif i c explanation focus on exhibiting 
concrete causal dependencies (i.e. identifying the causal nexus of the phenomena), 
inparticularonthemechanismsthatunderlieparticularprocesses.Thesetheoriesare 
contrasted with topological explanations. Kosti�� c gives a clear characteristic: ���Very 
abstractly, the mechanistic explanation describes entities and activities that are orga- 
nized to produce something or to perform a process or a function. Different levels 
of organization or properties of the same system can be explained by describing 
different mechanisms. In contrast, topological explanations explain by a reference 
to structural or mathematical properties of the system (e.g. graph-theoretical prop- 
erties, topological features, or properties of mathematical structures in general), and 
abstract away from the details of particular causal interactions or mechanisms��� [12, 
p. 2].

Topological explanations have some important features which make them espe- 
cially interesting for our discussion.9They are abstract (as they refer to abstract, 
mathematical properties of the system), but still retain strong and direct links with 
the physical situation in question. In a sense, they provide a contrast class for the 
(hypothetic) category-theoretical explanations. Huneman characterizes the general 
6���Numbers enable us to make claims which [���] we [���] would otherwise have trouble putting into 
words��� [28, p. 230]. Of course, what is important here is not numbers as such, as numbers are very 
simple mathematical objects. What is at play is the usually very abstract mathematical structures 
that provide the expressive power of the theory: ���Let ���abstract expressionism��� be the doctrine that 
mathematics is useful in science because it helps us to say things about concrete objects which it 
would otherwise be more diff i cult, or perhaps impossible, for us to say.��� [16, p. 600]. 
7However,R��zargues(veryconvincingly),thatthisexamplerestsonamisunderstandingandoffers

network medicine. Very ���down-to-earth��� examples (e.g. epidemiology or urban traff i c density) and

features of topological explanations in the following way (in the context of biology): 
���a topological explanation is an explanation in which a feature, a trait, a property or 
an outcome X of a system S is explained by the fact that it possesses specif i c topo-

contributions (which inherently use category-theoretical notions) and classic results 
that are merely expressed in a different language.10 
I assume in this paper (as a working hypothesis) that the notion of mathematical 
explanation in science (physics, biology, chemistry, medicine, cognitive science, 
etc.) is sound, i.e. that there are genuine mathematical explanations in science. All

these applications, mathematics often directly represents physical objects (as might 
happen,forexample,inthecaseofcombinatorialproblems,e.g.agraphrepresenting 
the bridges in K��nigsberg), or describes, for instance, the phase space of possible 
states or the space of possible trajectories which are linked with a physical system 
in a natural way.12We might say that the level of abstractness is not very high and 
mathematics is applied to a given physical situation in a rather direct way.13 
But no examples of an explanatory relation in this sense can be given for cat- 
egory theory. We can imagine a situation in which a physicist is helpless in mod- 
eling/explaining a physical phenomenon (e.g. heat transport), and a mathematician 
trained in, for example, stochastic differential equations provides tools to solve the 
problem in such a way that the model makes it possible to build a more effective

This section, titled "Mathematical Explanations of Physical Phenomena," delves deeper into the issue of the explanatory role of mathematics in physics and science in general. The key points of discussion include:
Role of Mathematics:
The author stresses the necessity to distinguish between scientific explanations that utilize mathematics and explanations where mathematics genuinely provides explanatory power. They consider whether mathematics can indeed provide any explanation beyond serving as a tool for expressing relationships between physical phenomena.
Abstract Expressivism:
According to this doctrine, mathematics has a unique role: it enables the expression of claims about the physical world that couldn't be otherwise expressed. The author gives examples, such as the Seven Bridges of K��nigsberg problem and the structure of honeycombs, which are explained by mathematical theorems rather than by examining physical properties.
Topological Explanations:
The author highlights topological explanations as an important class that is garnering increased attention. These explanations reference the structural or mathematical properties of the system, and not the details of causal interactions or mechanisms. Such explanations are abstract but have strong and direct links to the physical situation.
Category Theory in Explanation:
The author questions whether category theory can offer anything similar to topological explanations, i.e., explain a physical phenomenon by the system possessing specific category-theoretical properties. They stress the need to differentiate between genuine category-theoretical contributions and classic results expressed in a different language.
Working Hypothesis:
The author assumes, for the purpose of this paper, that the notion of mathematical explanation in science is sound, i.e., there are genuine mathematical explanations in science. They note that examples of such explanations typically involve "down-to-earth" mathematical theorems, which often directly represent physical objects or describe possible states or trajectories related to a physical system.
Category Theory's Limitations:
However, the author concludes that, as of yet, there are no examples where category theory provides an explanatory relationship in this sense. They attribute this to the high level of abstractness that category theory entails, contrasting it with other areas of mathematics that can directly assist in modeling or explaining physical phenomena.

certainly they cannot be identif i ed. But it seems that there is a ���minimal predictive

explanatory character. And in this respect CT has not much to offer when modeling 
very concrete physical phenomena. 
So, my claim is that in this sense there are no category-theoretical explanations 
of physical phenomena, in spite of there being mathematical explanations. But cat- 
egory theory already has an established position in physics and its role seems to be 
growing.14The claim that CT does not enhance our understanding of science would 
clearly be false, so the interesting question is what kind of epistemic contribution 
does CT offer: perhaps it is a different kind of explanation? If so, in which sense 
does it explain, and what are the explananda? Analyzing the role of category theory 
also contributes to our understanding of the notion of explanation.

In this passage, the author further explores the role and limitations of category theory (CT) in explaining physical phenomena.
Role of CT in Analysis:
CT is useful for analyzing fundamental properties of conceptual systems, theories, or models, rather than describing specific physical phenomena, such as heat transport in a rod or the shape of honeycomb cells.
CT's Predictive Potential:
The author proposes that a model should have some predictive potential to possess explanatory character, a trait where CT seems to fall short when modeling concrete physical phenomena.
Lack of CT Explanations:
Despite the existence of mathematical explanations of physical phenomena, the author asserts that there are no category-theoretical explanations. However, given the growing role of CT in physics, they question the kind of epistemic contribution it might offer.
Topos Quantum Theory (TQT):
As a specific example of category-theoretical contributions to physics, the author focuses on TQT, a counterpart of the standard version of quantum theory expressed in category-theoretical terms. The theory's aim is to translate physical theories into a different language, using the unique properties of topoi.
While the author is unsure if TQT will gain widespread acceptance or remain a theoretical curiosity, they believe it's well-suited for examining potential epistemic contributions of CT and its potential explanatory role.

Mathematical Foundations for Compositional Bayesian Brain
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The "Compositional Bayesian Brain" is a conceptualization that views the brain as an inference machine that is continually making predictions about the world and updating these predictions based on incoming sensory data. The framework is built on the ideas from Bayesian probability theory, which provides a mathematical foundation for dealing with uncertainty and making inferences based on limited or noisy data.
The "compositional" part of the Compositional Bayesian Brain emphasizes the hierarchical and modular organization of the brain. It suggests that the brain constructs complex models of the world by composing simpler models together, in a sort of hierarchy. This compositional structure can be naturally expressed using category theory, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with objects and the relationships between them.
The mathematical foundations for a Compositional Bayesian Brain would therefore likely involve a combination of Bayesian probability theory and category theory. Bayesian probability theory would provide the tools for modeling uncertainty and performing inference, while category theory would provide the tools for modeling the compositional and hierarchical structure of the models the brain constructs.
This approach has potential benefits for both neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI). In neuroscience, it can provide a unified framework for understanding how the brain processes information and makes decisions. In AI, it can provide a blueprint for building more flexible and powerful machine learning systems that can handle uncertainty and build complex models of the world.

Connections with the following: Theory Tesseracted: Understanding the Complexity of the Human Mind through Bayesian Updating and Meta-Minds

The human mind is an incredibly complex and multifaceted entity that has long fascinated philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists alike.

While many theories have been proposed to explain its workings, the field of cognitive science has increasingly turned to the Bayesian updating model of mind and the concept of meta-minds to provide insight into this intricate system.

The Bayesian updating model of mind posits that humans continuously update their beliefs based on new information and prior knowledge, adjusting their expectations and making decisions accordingly.

This model has been used to explain a wide range of cognitive phenomena, from perception and attention to decision-making and learning.

At the same time, the concept of meta-minds suggests that the human mind has the capacity to reflect on and regulate its own cognitive processes. 

This ability allows individuals to evaluate their own thinking and reasoning, and to adjust their approach as needed to achieve their goals.

Together, these two concepts offer a powerful framework for understanding the complexity of the human mind.

By examining how individuals update their beliefs and reflect on their own cognitive processes, we can gain insight into how the mind processes and interprets information, and how it makes decisions and learns from experience.

In this essay, we will explore the Bayesian updating model of mind and the concept of meta-minds in greater depth, discussing their theoretical underpinnings and the ways in which they have been used to explain various cognitive phenomena

We will also examine how these concepts can be applied in practical settings, such as in education and decision-making.

Through this exploration, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the complexity of the human mind, and the ways in which it processes and interprets the world around us. 

Ultimately, we believe that this understanding can lead to new insights and innovations in a wide range of fields, from psychology and neuroscience to artificial intelligence and beyond.

The theory of "Theory Tesseracted: Understanding the Complexity of the Human Mind through Bayesian Updating and Meta-Minds" has a strong connection with the Compositional Bayesian Brain and the use of Category Theory in Mathematics, which have been previously discussed.
The Bayesian updating model of mind, as discussed in "Theory Tesseracted," aligns closely with the principles of the Compositional Bayesian Brain. Both suggest that the brain continuously updates its beliefs and predictions based on new information and prior knowledge. Bayesian inference serves as the mathematical backbone of these updates and predictions, with probabilistic reasoning guiding decision-making processes. This explains cognitive phenomena such as perception, attention, decision-making, and learning.
The concept of meta-minds mirrors the compositional aspect of the Compositional Bayesian Brain. The notion of a meta-mind emphasizes the brain's capacity to reflect on and regulate its cognitive processes, enabling self-evaluation of thought and reasoning patterns. Similarly, the compositional model suggests a hierarchical structure where simple models or ideas are composed together to form complex ones, mirroring the ability of the mind to scrutinize its own cognitive processes at different levels of abstraction.
Additionally, the use of Category Theory could be applied to both Bayesian updating and meta-minds. Category Theory can help model the hierarchical, modular organization of these cognitive processes, providing a structure to explain how complex cognitive phenomena emerge from simpler components.
Finally, understanding these intricate cognitive processes doesn't just benefit neuroscience but also fields like artificial intelligence, where creating models that can process uncertainty, self-reflect, and adapt based on prior knowledge is of utmost importance. The implications can lead to more sophisticated AI models that can mimic human-like decision-making and learning processes.

I want to tie in connections with predictive processing with relevance relations, perceptual control theory, and theory-theory.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Predictive processing is a theoretical framework for understanding how the brain processes sensory information and uses it to form models of the world. The key idea is that the brain constantly generates predictions about future sensory inputs and then updates these predictions based on the actual sensory information it receives.
The concept of relevance relations is pertinent in the context of predictive processing. In order to make accurate predictions, the brain must determine which information is relevant and which is not. The brain then uses these relevance relations to guide its predictions and subsequent updates.
Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) is another psychological model that shares similarities with predictive processing. PCT posits that behavior is the control of perception rather than the response to stimuli. In this model, the brain maintains a set of reference values for various variables and works to minimize the discrepancy between these references and actual sensory input. The concept of minimizing prediction errors in the predictive processing model aligns closely with the control mechanisms in PCT. Both highlight the proactive nature of brain functioning, where the brain is not merely a passive recipient of sensory input but an active participant in reality construction.
Theory-theory, a model of cognitive development suggesting that individuals form theories about the world and then refine these theories based on experience, has clear parallels with predictive processing. In both, the brain is constantly updating its understanding of the world based on new information. This process of updating is akin to refining theories (Theory-theory) or minimizing prediction errors (Predictive Processing).
These theoretical frameworks - predictive processing, relevance relations, perceptual control theory, and theory-theory - offer a holistic view of cognitive processes. They represent different perspectives on similar ideas about how the brain engages with the world: by constantly creating, updating, and controlling its understanding based on the input it receives. The complementary nature of these theories provides a more comprehensive understanding of the mind and cognition.

Any scientific theory can be seen as a population of models - I am taking about theory-ladenness with respect to testability and ensemble modeling benefits.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your statement that "any scientific theory can be seen as a population of models" implies the concept of theory-ladenness and touches on some critical aspects of scientific theory construction and testing.
Theory-ladenness refers to the idea that all observations, experiments, and interpretations are influenced or "laden" by the theoretical presuppositions we hold. Essentially, the theories we believe in shape how we interpret our experiments and observations. This can impact testability, as our understanding and interpretation of empirical evidence are inherently influenced by the theoretical framework we subscribe to.
In ensemble modeling, we use a collection or "ensemble" of models to make more robust predictions or inferences about a system. Each model in the ensemble represents a different set of assumptions or perspectives on the system under study. By combining these perspectives, we can often achieve a more accurate or reliable prediction than any single model could provide alone.
Ensemble modeling can be seen as a practical implementation of the concept of theory-ladenness. By acknowledging that our observations and predictions are influenced by our theoretical assumptions, we can construct an ensemble of models that represent a range of different assumptions. This approach allows us to account for the theory-ladenness of our models and can help to improve the robustness and reliability of our predictions.
Furthermore, using ensemble models can benefit testability. If a theory's predictions differ significantly from those of an ensemble of other models, it might suggest that the theory needs to be revised or discarded. Conversely, if a theory consistently produces predictions that align with those of the ensemble, it provides supportive evidence for the theory.
Overall, understanding a scientific theory as a population of models emphasizes the theory-ladenness of observations and the benefits of ensemble modeling for robust predictions and effective theory testing.

The topological invariance of models.

The previous model used in this conversation is unavailable. We've switched you to the latest default model.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The topological invariance of models refers to a property of models that remains unchanged under certain transformations or mappings. In the context of scientific modeling, topological invariance implies that the essential features or relationships captured by a model are preserved even if the specific details or parameters of the model change.
Topology is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of spaces that are preserved under continuous transformations, such as stretching, bending, or twisting. In scientific modeling, the topological invariance of a model implies that the underlying structure or organization of the system being modeled is preserved regardless of variations in its specific attributes or parameters.
This property can be valuable in scientific research because it suggests that the fundamental aspects of a system can be understood and analyzed independently of specific numerical values or measurements. By focusing on the topological properties of a model, researchers can gain insight into the general behavior or patterns of a system, allowing for more robust and generalizable conclusions.
For example, in physics, certain physical phenomena can be described by topological models that capture the essential features of the system while ignoring precise details. This approach enables physicists to make predictions or draw conclusions that are valid across different systems that share the same topological properties. Examples of topological models in physics include knot theory in molecular biology or the use of topology in condensed matter physics to describe materials.
The topological invariance of models also has practical implications. It allows researchers to explore a range of scenarios or parameter values within a consistent framework, making it easier to analyze and compare different variations of a model. Additionally, it can help identify relationships or patterns that hold across a wide range of systems or conditions.
Overall, the topological invariance of models provides a valuable tool for understanding complex systems by focusing on their underlying structure and organization. It allows researchers to capture essential features and relationships while remaining flexible to variations in specific details or parameters.

The topological invariance of models relates to the idea that these internal models can represent the essential features and relationships of the world, allowing for predictions that hold across different contexts or variations in sensory input.
Relevance Relations: Relevance relations refer to the relationships between different pieces of information or concepts in a knowledge structure. The topological invariance of models suggests that these relevance relations can be captured by the structure of the model itself, regardless of specific details or values. This allows for the identification of meaningful connections or patterns between different elements in the model, providing insights into the relationships between relevant variables or concepts.
Perceptual Control Theory: Perceptual control theory proposes that organisms regulate their behavior by continuously comparing their internal models or reference signals with sensory feedback. The topological invariance of models aligns with the idea that the essential control processes and feedback loops can be captured by the structure of the model, regardless of specific parameter values. This allows for the understanding of how organisms maintain stability and adapt to changes in the environment based on the invariant structure of their control models.
Theory-Theory: Theory-theory is an approach in cognitive development that suggests that children develop theories about the world and other people's mental states to explain and predict behavior. The topological invariance of models relates to the idea that these mental models can represent the underlying structure and relationships of the world, allowing for predictions that hold across different contexts or variations in behavior. This supports the understanding of how children form abstract concepts and make inferences based on invariant features of their mental models.
In all these cases, the topological invariance of models emphasizes the importance of capturing the essential features, relationships, and structures of a system or phenomenon, while allowing for variations in specific details or parameter values. It provides a framework for understanding the underlying structure and organization that transcends specific instances or variations, leading to more robust and generalizable insights.

What is the nerve a topological space?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In algebraic topology, the nerve of a topological space is a construction that associates a simplicial complex to the space. It is a way to capture the topological structure of the space using combinatorial objects called simplices. The nerve of a topological space provides a way to study its properties by translating them into combinatorial and algebraic terms. It plays a fundamental role in various areas of mathematics, such as homotopy theory and category theory, by providing a bridge between topology and algebraic structures.
1 / 1
In category theory, a discipline within mathematics, the nerve N(C) of a small category C is a simplicial set constructed from the objects and morphisms of C. The geometric realization of this simplicial set is a topological space, called the classifying space of the category C. These closely related objects can provide information about some familiar and useful categories using algebraic topology, most often homotopy theory.

Motivation
Edit
The nerve of a category is often used to construct topological versions of moduli spaces. If X is an object of C, its moduli space should somehow encode all objects isomorphic to X and keep track of the various isomorphisms between all of these objects in that category. This can become rather complicated, especially if the objects have many non-identity automorphisms. The nerve provides a combinatorial way of organizing this data. Since simplicial sets have a good homotopy theory, one can ask questions about the meaning of the various homotopy groups ��n(N(C)). One hopes that the answers to such questions provide interesting information about the original category C, or about related categories.

The notion of nerve is a direct generalization of the classical notion of classifying space of a discrete group; see below for details.

The nerve of a small category C is a simplicial set constructed from the objects and morphisms of C. It is used to encode the structure of C in a combinatorial way and has applications in constructing topological versions of moduli spaces. The geometric realization of the nerve gives a topological space, known as the classifying space of C, which can provide insights into the original category C and related categories through its homotopy groups. The nerve generalizes the notion of the classifying space of a discrete group.

The primordial example is the classifying space of a discrete group G. We regard G as a category with one object whose endomorphisms are the elements of G. Then the k-simplices of N(G) are just k-tuples of elements of G. The face maps act by multiplication, and the degeneracy maps act by insertion of the identity element. If G is the group with two elements, then there is exactly one nondegenerate k-simplex for each nonnegative integer k, corresponding to the unique k-tuple of elements of G containing no identities. After passing to the geometric realization, this k-tuple can be identified with the unique k-cell in the usual CW structure on infinite-dimensional real projective space. The latter is the most popular model for the classifying space of the group with two elements. See (Segal 1968) for further details and the relationship of the above to Milnor's join construction of BG.

The classifying space of a discrete group G is a specific example of the nerve construction. If we consider G as a category with one object and whose morphisms are the elements of G, then the nerve N(G) consists of k-tuples of elements of G for each k-simplex. The face and degeneracy maps in the simplicial set correspond to multiplication and insertion of the identity element, respectively. When G is a group with two elements, the geometric realization of N(G) can be identified with the CW structure of infinite-dimensional real projective space. This connection is related to Milnor's join construction of BG. For more details, refer to Segal's work from 1968.

Most spaces are classifying spaces
Edit
Every "reasonable" topological space is homeomorphic to the classifying space of a small category. Here, "reasonable" means that the space in question is the geometric realization of a simplicial set. This is obviously a necessary condition; it is also sufficient. Indeed, let X be the geometric realization of a simplicial set K. The set of simplices in K is partially ordered, by the relation x ��� y if and only if x is a face of y. We may consider this partially ordered set as a category. The nerve of this category is the barycentric subdivision of K, and thus its realization is homeomorphic to X, because X is the realization of K by hypothesis and barycentric subdivision does not change the homeomorphism type of the realization.

Every "reasonable" topological space, meaning a space that is the geometric realization of a simplicial set, is homeomorphic to the classifying space of a small category. This is both a necessary and sufficient condition. Given a topological space X that is the geometric realization of a simplicial set K, the partially ordered set of simplices in K can be viewed as a category. The nerve of this category is the barycentric subdivision of K, and the geometric realization of this nerve is homeomorphic to X. Therefore, any reasonable topological space can be regarded as a classifying space.

What is the nerve of a covering?

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In mathematics, specifically in algebraic topology, the nerve of a covering is a construction that associates a simplicial complex to a covering space. Given a covering space C over a topological space X, the nerve of the covering is a simplicial complex whose vertices correspond to the sheets of the covering and whose simplices correspond to the intersections of sheets that are non-empty. The higher-dimensional simplices represent higher-order intersections of sheets. The nerve of a covering captures the combinatorial structure of the covering and provides a useful tool for studying properties of the covering space, such as its fundamental group or homotopy type.

So we can take a topological space and through functor morphisms translate it into a system of categories?
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, in category theory, one can use functor morphisms to translate a topological space into a system of categories. This translation is done by associating certain categories to the topological space and morphisms between them to capture the structure and relationships within the space.
For example, given a topological space, one can construct a category called the "open sets category" where the objects are the open subsets of the space and the morphisms are the inclusions between them. This category captures the containment relationships between open sets.
Furthermore, functors can be used to establish connections between different categories associated with different topological spaces. These functors preserve the relevant structure and relationships, allowing for the comparison and analysis of the spaces in a categorical framework.
This translation from topological spaces to categories provides a powerful tool for studying and analyzing topological properties using the language and techniques of category theory. It allows for the application of categorical concepts and methods to gain insights into the structure and behavior of topological spaces.

Similarities between Haskell, lisp, and clojure.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Haskell, Lisp, and Clojure are all programming languages that share certain similarities, despite their differences in syntax and design philosophy. Here are some commonalities between them:
Functional Programming Paradigm: All three languages embrace functional programming as a core paradigm. They emphasize immutable data, higher-order functions, and pure functions without side effects.
First-Class Functions: In Haskell, Lisp, and Clojure, functions are treated as first-class citizens. They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned as values. This enables powerful functional programming techniques such as higher-order functions and function composition.
Lisp Syntax and Macros: Lisp and Clojure are both Lisp dialects, characterized by their use of prefix notation and extensive use of parentheses. Lisp languages also provide powerful macro systems that allow programmers to extend the language and define their own domain-specific languages (DSLs).
Garbage Collection: Haskell, Lisp, and Clojure all have built-in garbage collection, which automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation, making memory management easier for developers.
Strong Type Systems: Haskell and Clojure have static type systems that provide compile-time type checking, ensuring type safety and reducing the likelihood of runtime errors. Lisp, on the other hand, traditionally uses a dynamically typed approach but can support optional type annotations in some implementations.
Concurrency and Parallelism: All three languages offer features for handling concurrency and parallelism. Haskell has built-in support for lightweight threads and software transactional memory (STM). Clojure provides immutable data structures and facilities for concurrent programming using its "atoms," "refs," and "agents." Lisp often relies on threading libraries and macros for concurrency management.
Rich Standard Libraries: Haskell, Lisp, and Clojure come with extensive standard libraries that provide a wide range of built-in functions and utilities to simplify programming tasks.
Interoperability: All three languages have good interoperability with other programming languages. Haskell can interface with C libraries using the Foreign Function Interface (FFI). Lisp and Clojure have interop capabilities to work with Java libraries and frameworks.
While these languages have similarities, it's important to note that they also have distinct features, design philosophies, and ecosystems. Each language has its own strengths and focuses, catering to different programming paradigms and use cases.

ChatGPT
The previous topics of category theory, mathematical explanations of physical phenomena, and the nerve of a topological space may not have a direct and explicit connection to the similarities between Haskell, Lisp, and Clojure. However, there are underlying principles and concepts that can be related:
Abstraction: Category theory, as well as functional programming languages like Haskell, Lisp, and Clojure, emphasize the use of abstraction to model and manipulate complex systems. Category theory provides a framework for abstracting and generalizing mathematical structures, while functional programming languages promote abstraction through higher-order functions, lambda expressions, and macros.
Compositionality: Both category theory and functional programming advocate for compositionality, where complex systems are built by combining simpler components. Category theory uses composition of morphisms, and functional programming languages leverage function composition to build more complex and reusable code.
Mathematical Foundations: Category theory serves as a mathematical foundation for understanding and reasoning about structures and relationships. Similarly, Haskell, Lisp, and Clojure have strong mathematical foundations and draw inspiration from concepts in mathematics, such as lambda calculus and recursion theory.
Formalism and Rigor: Category theory and functional programming promote a formal and rigorous approach to programming. They emphasize precise definitions, strong type systems, and mathematical reasoning to ensure correctness and reliability in software development.
While the direct connections may not be apparent, the overarching principles of abstraction, compositionality, mathematical foundations, and formalism link these topics together and reflect a shared emphasis on structured and principled approaches to problem-solving and programming.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
You are correct that Haskell, as a functional programming language, has practical implications for translating logic and categorical theory into practical applications. The features and concepts in Haskell, such as higher-order functions, lazy evaluation, and strong type systems, enable expressive and concise implementations of algorithms and data structures.
Logic and Categorical Theory: Haskell's functional programming paradigm aligns well with the principles of logic and category theory. The functional programming style allows for the direct representation of logical propositions and inference rules using higher-order functions and lambda calculus. Category theory concepts, such as functors, monads, and arrows, find natural expression in Haskell, enabling the modeling and composition of complex computations.
Practical Applications: The functional nature of Haskell, combined with its powerful type system, lends itself well to practical applications. For example, Haskell's purity and referential transparency make it suitable for developing efficient and reliable compression algorithms. The expressive type system allows for the construction of efficient sorting algorithms with strong guarantees. Haskell's lazy evaluation can enhance retrieval algorithms by allowing computations to be performed on-demand.
Curry-Howard Correspondence: The Curry-Howard correspondence establishes a deep connection between logic and type theory, where propositions correspond to types and proofs correspond to programs. Haskell, with its rich type system and expressive type-level programming features, provides a practical realization of the Curry-Howard correspondence. By leveraging Haskell's type system, one can encode and reason about logical propositions and construct valid proofs as Haskell programs.
In summary, Haskell's practical implications for translating logic and categorical theory into practical applications, as well as its embodiment of the Curry-Howard correspondence, showcase its power as a language for formal reasoning, algorithm design, and practical software development.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept of Markov blankets and compositional Markov chains are related to the idea of boundaries and information flow within a system. While not specific to Haskell, these concepts can be explored and implemented using functional programming languages like Haskell.
Markov Blankets: In probabilistic graphical models, a Markov blanket of a node in the graph is the set of nodes that fully shield the node from the rest of the graph. It contains all the variables that are directly connected to the node and are necessary for predicting its behavior. In Haskell, one can design data structures and functions to represent and manipulate probabilistic graphical models, including the identification of Markov blankets for nodes.
Compositional Markov Chains: Compositional Markov chains refer to the decomposition of a complex system into smaller, interconnected Markov chains. Each component of the system can be represented by a local Markov chain, and the overall behavior of the system emerges from the composition of these local chains. In Haskell, functional composition and abstraction mechanisms allow for the construction and composition of Markov chains and their integration into larger systems.
By leveraging the functional programming paradigm in Haskell, one can design data structures, algorithms, and abstractions to model and analyze systems with Markov blankets and compositional Markov chains. Haskell's emphasis on immutability, pure functions, and composability make it well-suited for building modular and expressive models of probabilistic systems.

Relation to compositional sparse Bayesian brain hypothesis
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The compositional sparse Bayesian brain hypothesis is a framework in cognitive neuroscience that posits the brain as a hierarchical system composed of sparse Bayesian models at each level. It suggests that the brain performs probabilistic inference using sparse representations and Bayesian updating to explain perception, cognition, and behavior.
The relationship between the compositional sparse Bayesian brain hypothesis and concepts like Markov blankets and compositional Markov chains can be seen in their shared focus on probabilistic modeling and information processing. Both approaches aim to understand complex systems by decomposing them into smaller components and analyzing their probabilistic relationships.
In the context of the compositional sparse Bayesian brain hypothesis, Markov blankets could be seen as representing the local dependencies or influences that a particular level or node in the hierarchical model has on its surrounding variables. These local dependencies capture the necessary information for making predictions and performing probabilistic inference.
Compositional Markov chains, on the other hand, can be seen as a way to represent the hierarchical structure of the brain's information processing. Each level or node in the hierarchy corresponds to a Markov chain that captures the probabilistic relationships between variables at that level. The composition of these local Markov chains then gives rise to the overall behavior and cognition of the system.
By leveraging the principles of sparse representations, Bayesian inference, and compositional modeling, the compositional sparse Bayesian brain hypothesis provides a framework for understanding how the brain processes and represents information. It offers insights into the hierarchical organization of cognitive processes and the probabilistic nature of perception and cognition, which can be further explored and implemented through computational models in languages like Haskell.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Compositional active inference is a theoretical framework in cognitive science and neuroscience that combines ideas from active inference and category theory. It proposes a compositional structure for modeling perception, cognition, and action in hierarchical systems.
In this framework, statistical functors can be seen as mappings between different levels of the hierarchical system, capturing the probabilistic relationships and information flow between them. These functors provide a way to represent dynamical systems and their interactions within the framework of category theory.
The concept of adjoint functors in category theory is relevant to compositional active inference as it helps establish a connection between the hierarchical levels. Adjoint functors capture the relationship between a pair of functors, one acting as a left adjoint and the other as a right adjoint, allowing for a bidirectional flow of information and computation.
By incorporating adjoint functors and statistical functors, compositional active inference enables the modeling of complex cognitive processes as a composition of simpler processes, while maintaining a principled framework for probabilistic inference and action selection.
The idea of gluing property in Bayesian mechanics refers to the ability to combine different models or systems by "gluing" them together based on their shared boundaries or interfaces. This allows for the seamless integration of information and computations across multiple levels or domains.
In summary, compositional active inference leverages statistical functors, adjoint functors, and the gluing property to capture the hierarchical structure and information flow in cognitive systems. It provides a framework for understanding perception, cognition, and action as compositions of simpler processes, facilitating probabilistic inference and adaptive behavior.

Abstract
In the last few decades tremendous progress has been made in the use of catchment models for the analysis and understanding of hydrologic systems. A common application involves the use of these models to predict flows at catchment outputs. However, the outputs predicted by these models are often deterministic because they focused only on the most probable forecast without an explicit estimate of the associated uncertainty. This paper uses Bayesian and Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) approaches to estimate uncertainty in catchment modelling parameter values and uncertainty in design flow estimates. Testing of join probability of both these estimates has been conducted for a monsoon catchment in Vietnam. The paper focuses on computational efficiency and the differences in results, regardless of the philosophies and mathematical rigor of both methods. It was found that the application of GLUE and Bayesian techniques resulted in parameter values that were statistically different. The design flood quantiles estimated by the GLUE method were less scattered than those resulting from the Bayesian approach when using a closer threshold value (1 standard deviation departed from the mean). More studies are required to evaluate the impact of threshold in GLUE on design flood estimation.
Keywords: design flood quantiles; hydrology; flood frequency analysis; continuous simulation; Bayesian approach; GLUE approach; catchment modelling
1. Introduction
Design flood estimation is an essential component in engineering planning and management of catchments. The design flood flows can be estimated from observed flows or by implementing the catchment modelling approach. In both cases, the uncertainty in flood quantiles is an important issue which has been addressed in a number of analyses. In the catchment modelling approach, this uncertainty may arise from different errors, which have been classified as three main sources of errors: catchment input error, catchment response error (output error), and model error (parameter uncertainty) (e.g., [1,2,3]). A framework for catchment modelling system sources of uncertainty was developed by Kuczera [1], called The Bayesian Total Error Analysis (BATEA) framework. The system consists of three main errors: input, model, and response errors. The following sections will address some issues of these type of errors.
Input error: The input uncertainty estimation was reported in only a few studies in which the inputs or the key variables of input were simulated as random processes. For example, Kuczera [1] applied the Bayesian inference to estimate rainfall uncertainty characterized by two parameters k and rMult for Abercrombie River���s daily flow. Rainfall flood events were simulated as random processes (e.g., [1,4,5,6,7,8,9]). The model parameter error and output error, in this case, were combined into a single random process.
Model error: The model error is estimated mainly by analysis of model parameter uncertainty. A well-known approach in uncertainty analysis of model parameters is the behavioral approach [10,11]. Examples of this approach are as follows: Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) method [12,13,14]; Bayesian method using Metropolis-Hasting algorithm and Adaptive Metropolis (AM) algorithm [1,15,16]; and Markov chain Monte Carlo [17,18,19]. In this approach, the input and output errors are ignored and the threshold of objective functions for selecting parameter values were determined.
Using the threshold to select parameter values was developed in the GLUE method, firstly introduced by Beven and Binley [12]. This procedure recognizes the equifinality of different sets of parameters in the generation of acceptable catchment response. The parameters producing acceptable responses are assigned ���behavioural��� and will be accepted [12]. Identifying the threshold in the GLUE method is based on an acceptable range of performance measures such as Nash���Sutcliffe Efficiency (E), Root Mean Square Errors, percent bias, and correlation coefficient (e.g., [20,21]. For example, in the hydrograph measure of fit using Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (E), the range of E was established. Cameron [21] and Zhao [20] selected threshold of 0.7, Shen [22] accepted the threshold of 0.5. In design flood quantile estimation, Annual Maximum Series (AMS) was employed as an objective function in some studies (e.g., [4,21,23,24]). The calibrated frequency curves were compared with the observed frequency curve [21,23] by combining values of three statistics of AMS with the threshold obtained from ��2 distribution at three degrees of freedom and a probability level of 0.9 [4].
Combination of input errors and model errors has been developed in several studies (e.g., [1,25,26]). Precipitation events and model parameters have been treated as stochastic components together with application of fuzzy rules in evaluating model runs. This yields a combined likelihood measure that is used to weight the flood predictions for selection of a behavioural parameter set based on the GLUE approach [25] or is used to calibrate daily distribution of runoff by visual comparison [26].
The GLUE method is easy to implement and

Generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) is a statistical method used in hydrology for quantifying the uncertainty of model predictions. The method was introduced by Keith Beven and Andrew Binley in 1992.[1][2] The basic idea of GLUE is that given our inability to represent exactly in a mathematical model how nature works, there will always be several different models that mimic equally well an observed natural process (such as river discharge). Such equally acceptable or behavioral models are therefore called equifinal.[3]

The methodology deals with models whose results are expressed as probability distributions of possible outcomes, often in the form of Monte Carlo simulations, and the problem can be viewed as assessing, and comparing between models, how good these representations of uncertainty are. There is an implicit understanding that the models being used are approximations to what might be obtained from a thorough Bayesian analysis of the problem if a fully adequate model of real-world hydrological processes were available.[4][5][6][7]

Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) is a statistical method used in hydrology to quantify the uncertainty of model predictions. It was introduced by Beven and Binley in 1992. GLUE recognizes that there are multiple models that can equally mimic observed natural processes, and these models are called equifinal. The method deals with models that produce probability distributions of possible outcomes, often through Monte Carlo simulations. GLUE aims to assess and compare the representations of uncertainty provided by different models. It should be noted that GLUE assumes the models used are approximations due to the lack of a fully adequate model of real-world hydrological processes. GLUE can be seen as an equivalent to Approximate Bayesian Computation under certain choices of summary statistic and threshold.

Imagine you have different pieces of a puzzle, and each piece represents a different aspect or part of a bigger picture. Bayesian gluing is like putting these puzzle pieces together to create a complete picture. Each puzzle piece represents a specific model or source of information, and by combining them, you can get a more comprehensive understanding of the whole system. In Bayesian gluing, each piece of information or model is represented by probabilities. These probabilities describe the likelihood or confidence of a particular event or outcome occurring. By using Bayesian methods, we can update these probabilities based on new evidence or observations, allowing us to refine our understanding of the system. The process of Bayesian gluing involves taking the probabilities from different models or sources of information and combining them in a mathematically rigorous way. This allows us to create a unified model that incorporates all the available information. By doing so, we can make more accurate predictions, estimate uncertain quantities, and gain insights into complex systems.

To summarize, Bayesian glueing is like putting puzzle pieces together to form a complete picture. It involves combining different models or sources of information using probabilities to create a unified understanding of a system. It's a powerful tool for making predictions and understanding complex phenomena

More about Catchment Modelling System Sources of Uncertainty
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
In catchment modelling, there are several sources of uncertainty that contribute to the overall uncertainty in the predictions and estimations. These sources of uncertainty are collectively referred to as catchment modelling system sources of uncertainty. Here are some key aspects:
Input Error: Input error refers to the uncertainty associated with the data and information used as inputs to the catchment model. This can include errors in rainfall measurements, streamflow data, soil properties, land use data, and other relevant parameters. Input errors can arise from measurement errors, data processing methods, and spatial and temporal variability.
Model Error: Model error arises from the inherent simplifications and assumptions made in the catchment model. Models are simplifications of real-world systems, and they may not fully capture all the complex hydrological processes and dynamics. Model error can result from limitations in model structure, parameterization, and representation of physical processes. It can also arise from uncertainties in model calibration and validation.
Output Error: Output error refers to the uncertainty associated with the predictions and estimations generated by the catchment model. It is influenced by both input error and model error. Output error can be quantified by comparing model predictions with observed data and evaluating the goodness-of-fit measures. The differences between model predictions and observations provide insights into the uncertainty in the model outputs.
Parameter Uncertainty: Parameter uncertainty relates to the uncertainty in the values assigned to the parameters of the catchment model. These parameters represent characteristics of the catchment, such as soil properties, vegetation characteristics, and hydraulic conductivity. Parameter uncertainty arises from the limited availability of data for parameter estimation, errors in measurement, and the spatial and temporal variability of catchment characteristics.
Structural Uncertainty: Structural uncertainty arises from the choice of model structure or representation of the catchment processes. Different models may have different structures and assumptions about the underlying processes. Structural uncertainty recognizes that there may be multiple plausible representations of the catchment processes, and the choice of model structure introduces uncertainty into the modelling results.
Addressing and quantifying these sources of uncertainty is crucial for reliable catchment modelling. Techniques such as Bayesian inference, Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE), and Monte Carlo simulation are commonly used to assess and propagate the uncertainties through the modelling process. These approaches allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the uncertainties in catchment modelling results and provide insights into the reliability and robustness of the predictions and estimations.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Sensor fusion involves combining data from multiple sensors to improve the accuracy, reliability, and completeness of information about a system or environment. It aims to overcome the limitations and uncertainties associated with individual sensors by integrating their measurements and generating a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the observed phenomenon.
In the context of catchment modelling, sensor fusion can be applied to enhance the input data used in the models. Different sensors can provide measurements of various hydrological variables such as rainfall, streamflow, soil moisture, and temperature. Each sensor has its own strengths and weaknesses, and they may introduce different sources of uncertainty.
By applying sensor fusion techniques, the measurements from multiple sensors can be combined to create a more robust and reliable representation of the catchment conditions. This can help address the input error in catchment modelling by reducing the uncertainty associated with individual sensor measurements. Sensor fusion methods such as Kalman filtering, Bayesian inference, and data assimilation techniques can be used to integrate the sensor data and estimate the true state of the catchment variables.
Moreover, sensor fusion can also contribute to addressing the output error in catchment modelling. By combining observations from multiple sensors, it is possible to obtain a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the actual hydrological processes. This can help improve the calibration and validation of the catchment models, leading to more reliable predictions and estimations.
In summary, sensor fusion techniques can play a crucial role in reducing the uncertainties associated with input data and improving the accuracy and reliability of catchment modelling. By integrating measurements from multiple sensors, sensor fusion helps overcome the limitations of individual sensors and provides a more comprehensive understanding of the catchment dynamics.

1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Gluing hypotheses together refers to the process of combining and integrating multiple hypotheses or theories to create a more comprehensive understanding or explanation of a phenomenon. This can be done using various techniques and approaches depending on the context and nature of the hypotheses involved. Here are some techniques commonly used for gluing hypotheses together:
Bayesian Inference: Bayesian inference provides a framework for combining multiple hypotheses or models based on their prior probabilities and the available evidence or data. It allows for updating the probabilities of hypotheses as new evidence is obtained, enabling the integration of multiple sources of information.
Model Combination: In some cases, hypotheses can be viewed as different models or explanations for a given phenomenon. Model combination techniques aim to merge or blend multiple models to create a more accurate or comprehensive representation. This can involve techniques such as ensemble modeling, where multiple models are run simultaneously and their outputs are combined to generate a consensus prediction.
Consensus Building: Consensus building techniques involve identifying commonalities and areas of agreement among different hypotheses. This can be done through expert deliberation, structured discussions, or formal methods such as the Delphi method. The goal is to find areas of convergence and develop a synthesized hypothesis that incorporates the shared elements.
Meta-Analysis: Meta-analysis is a statistical technique used to combine the results of multiple independent studies or experiments. It involves pooling data from different studies to obtain an overall estimate or effect size. In the context of gluing hypotheses, meta-analysis can be used to combine findings or results from multiple studies testing different hypotheses, providing a more robust and generalizable conclusion.
Conceptual Integration: Conceptual integration involves the integration of different concepts or theories from various domains to form a unified framework. It seeks to identify commonalities, overlaps, and connections between different hypotheses and develop a coherent and integrated understanding. Techniques such as concept mapping or concept network analysis can be employed to visually represent and connect different concepts.
These techniques are not mutually exclusive and can be used in combination to glue hypotheses together. The choice of technique depends on the specific context, the nature of the hypotheses, and the available data or evidence. The goal is to create a synthesized and more comprehensive understanding that goes beyond individual hypotheses and incorporates multiple perspectives.

Ensemble methods
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Ensemble methods refer to techniques that combine multiple individual models or learners to improve predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance. These methods are based on the principle that combining the predictions of multiple models can lead to better overall results compared to using a single model. Ensemble methods are widely used in machine learning and data analysis tasks. Here are some commonly used ensemble methods:
Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating): Bagging involves creating multiple subsets of the original training data through random sampling with replacement. Each subset is used to train a separate model, and the final prediction is obtained by averaging or voting over the predictions of all models. Bagging helps reduce overfitting and improve stability.
Boosting: Boosting is an iterative ensemble method that combines weak learners (e.g., decision trees) to create a strong learner. In boosting, each model is trained on a weighted version of the training data, with more weight given to misclassified instances. The models are then combined by assigning higher weights to the more accurate models. Boosting focuses on difficult-to-classify instances, improving overall performance.
Random Forest: Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines the concepts of bagging and decision trees. It involves creating an ensemble of decision trees trained on random subsets of the data and random subsets of features. The final prediction is obtained by averaging or voting over the predictions of all trees. Random Forests are known for their robustness and resistance to overfitting.
Stacking: Stacking, also known as stacked generalization, involves training multiple models on the same data and combining their predictions using a meta-model. The meta-model learns to weigh the predictions of the individual models to generate the final prediction. Stacking allows for learning complex relationships between models and can lead to improved performance.
AdaBoost: AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is a boosting algorithm that assigns weights to training instances based on their difficulty in learning. In each iteration, the algorithm focuses on the misclassified instances and increases their weights, forcing subsequent models to focus on those instances. The final prediction is obtained by combining the weighted predictions of all models. AdaBoost is effective in handling imbalanced data and improving classification performance.
Voting: Voting is a simple ensemble method that combines the predictions of multiple models by majority voting or averaging. It can be used with various types of models and is particularly useful when the individual models have different strengths and weaknesses. Voting can improve the robustness and accuracy of predictions.
These ensemble methods provide ways to combine the knowledge and predictions of multiple models, leading to more accurate and reliable results. The choice of ensemble method depends on the specific problem, the characteristics of the data, and the available models. Ensemble methods are widely used in various domains, including classification, regression, and anomaly detection, to improve predictive performance and handle complex data patterns.

This fusion process helps to capture different perspectives and exploit the strengths of each model.
Compositional Bayesian Brain: Ensemble methods align with the idea of combining multiple sources of information or hypotheses to create a unified understanding of a system. Just as the Compositional Bayesian Brain hypothesis suggests that the brain integrates information from different sources to make decisions, ensemble methods integrate predictions from multiple models to make more accurate predictions or classifications.
Uncertainty Estimation: Ensemble methods can provide uncertainty estimates by generating multiple predictions and examining the variability among them. By analyzing the spread or agreement of predictions from the ensemble, it is possible to estimate the uncertainty associated with the final prediction. This connects to the topic of uncertainty estimation, which is important in various fields, including hydrology and catchment modelling.

Here are some common challenges in implementing ensemble methods:

1. Computational cost: Ensemble methods often involve combining multiple models, which can be computationally expensive. Training and making predictions with multiple models requires more resources compared to a single model.

2. Model correlation: If the individual models in the ensemble are highly correlated, they may make similar mistakes and the ensemble may not gain as much from their combination. Ensuring diversity among the models is important for good performance.

3. Overfitting: Combining multiple models can increase the risk of overfitting, especially if the individual models are already prone to overfitting. Regularization and validation techniques are needed to avoid overfitting the ensemble.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Ensemble methods require hyperparameter tuning not just for the individual models but also for the ensemble combination strategy. This adds to the complexity of hyperparameter optimization.

5. Difficulty in interpretation: While ensembles can achieve high performance, it can be more difficult to interpret and explain their predictions compared to single models. This limits the interpretability and trustworthiness of ensemble predictions.

6. Combination strategy: The specific combination strategy used to fuse the predictions of the individual models can significantly impact the performance and properties of the ensemble. Choosing the right strategy based on the task and data is not trivial.

In summary, while ensemble methods can provide benefits, there are challenges related to computational costs, diversity of individual models, avoiding overfitting, hyperparameter tuning, interpretability and choosing an optimal combination strategy.  Careful design and implementation are needed to overcome these challenges and realize the full potential of ensemble methods.

Here are some ways you can ensure diversity among the models in an ensemble:

1. Use different algorithms: The most basic way is to use different types of machine learning algorithms for the different models in the ensemble. For example, use a neural network, decision tree and nearest neighbors model. This helps ensure the models have different inductive biases and learning mechanisms.

2. Use different hyperparameters: For the same algorithm, vary the hyperparameters to train different versions of the model. For example, use different numbers of layers and nodes for neural networks, different maximum depths for decision trees, etc. 

3. Use different features: Train the models on different combinations and transformations of the input features. This exposes the models to different aspects of the data, reducing correlation.

4. Use bagging: Train the models on randomly sampled subsets of the training data (bagging). Since the data subsets are different, the trained models will also be different. This is the idea behind random forests.

5. Use pasting: Train the models on complementary partitions of the training data. This ensures they learn fundamentally different things from the data.

6. Decorate the models: Apply different preprocessing, regularization and optimization techniques to the models. This changes how the models learn from the data.

7. Subspace partitioning: Train the models on different partitions of the input feature space. For example, separate groups of features.

By using any of these techniques, you can train a set of diverse models for an ensemble that will make different errors and thus complement each other. This diversity is key to achieving good performance from the ensemble.

ChatGPT
These are excellent ways to ensure diversity among the models in an ensemble. By incorporating these techniques, you can promote variability among the models and enhance the ensemble's overall performance. The goal is to encourage different models to capture different aspects of the data and make complementary predictions. This diversification reduces the likelihood of the ensemble being influenced by the same biases or limitations and increases its robustness and generalization capabilities.

Here are some common ways to combine the predictions from models in an ensemble:

1. Simple averaging: The simplest approach is to take the mean of the predictions from the different models. This works well as a baseline combination technique.

2. weighted averaging: Apply different weights to the predictions based on the estimates of the individual models' accuracy or confidence. This gives more importance to the predictions of more accurate models.

3. Voting: Take the class (for classification) or value (for regression) that is predicted by the majority of models. This is effective when most models tend to make the correct prediction.

4. Stacking: Use a meta-learner model (like logistic regression) to learn the best combination of the predictions from the base models in the ensemble. The meta-learner is trained on the predictions of the base models.

5. Bayesian Model Averaging: Apply weights based on the posterior probabilities of the models, as in Bayesian model averaging. This gives more weight to models that are more probable given the data.

6. Product of Experts: Take the product of the predictions (or probabilities) from the different models. This combines the models in a multiplicative way rather than additive.

7. Switching/Gating network: Use a gating network to select the prediction of the best model for each input individually. The gating network learns to switch between the base models.

The choice of combination technique depends on factors like:

- The nature of predictions (class probabilities, regressions values, etc.) 
- The desired properties (interpretability, accuracy, uncertainty estimates, etc.)
- The performance and confidence of the individual models

More sophisticated techniques like stacking and Bayesian model averaging often give better performance, but at the cost of interpretability and additional complexity.

Translation of the provided text (from Greek to English):
"Truly, I tell you an ancient story, in a cryptic and unknown language. Of the Eloi, the righteous and free, and the Morlocks, the dark and dreadful.
In the days of old, the Eloi roamed the land, filled with wonder and pleasure. They entered, they played, they indulged in abundant joys. But then came the Morlocks, a harsh and merciless tribe.
Enslaving the Eloi, they put an end to their carefree days. The Eloi struggled, fighting back with courage and cunning, in a battle against the might of the Morlocks.
And though it may seem that all was lost, the Eloi did not abandon their reverence for life, preserving their traditional customs and ways."
Based on this outline, it appears that the story explores the conflict between the Eloi, who represent righteousness and freedom, and the Morlocks, who embody darkness and terror. The Eloi's carefree existence is disrupted by the arrival of the Morlocks, leading to a struggle for power and survival. Despite their challenges, the Eloi maintain their faith and cultural traditions. This sets the stage for an epic tale of resilience and the clash of contrasting forces.

In this subversion of the darkness meme, both the Eloi and Morlocks cultures coexist and have a nuanced relationship with day and night, each with their own tradeoff implications. They operate within two interconnected systems known as the Paragon and Antiparagon time, which are structured in overlapping tunnels. Both cultures inhabit the same tower structures called Volsorial Pedements, but they never encounter each other.
This concept introduces a unique dynamic where the Eloi and Morlocks navigate their separate time systems and share physical spaces without direct interaction. It implies that their coexistence is based on a delicate balance or understanding, where they coexist without interference. The interlocking time systems and shared tower structures create an intricate backdrop for the story, highlighting the complexity and subtlety of their relationship.
This subversion of the darkness meme challenges traditional notions of conflict and portrays a more nuanced and intricate interplay between light and dark, day and night, and the two distinct cultures. It adds depth and complexity to the narrative, offering opportunities for exploration and intrigue as the story unfolds within this intricate framework.

That's an intriguing concept that plays with the traditional cinematic experience and challenges audience expectations. Here's a plot idea that incorporates your suggestion:
"The Shifting Perspective":
In a small town, a mysterious film called "The Shifting Perspective" is released in theaters.

Each theater shows a different angle of the same scenes, offering audiences a unique viewing experience. As word spreads about the film's unconventional presentation, people flock to the theaters out of curiosity.
However, what begins as an experimental cinematic experience soon takes a dark turn. As the film continues its run, the changes become more pronounced and unsettling. Characters shift roles, the storyline becomes disjointed, and the audience is left questioning their own sanity. The film's length also extends with each screening, gradually pushing the boundaries of conventional cinema.
A group of determined individuals, including a passionate film critic, a curious filmmaker, and a skeptical detective, embark on a quest to uncover the truth behind "The Shifting Perspective." They delve into the history of the enigmatic director, seeking answers to the film's origins and the intentions behind its perplexing nature.
As they unravel the director's past, they discover that "The Shifting Perspective" is more than just a movie���it is a grand experiment to challenge the limitations of storytelling, perception, and human consciousness. The film's evolving nature and expanding length serve as a metaphor for the ever-changing nature of reality and the malleability of human perception.
As the characters delve deeper into the mystery, they must confront their own fears, biases, and assumptions about reality. Ultimately, they must make a choice: embrace the uncertainty and embrace the ever-shifting perspectives, or resist and risk losing themselves in the mind-bending world created by "The Shifting Perspective."
This plot concept subverts traditional cinematic norms by transforming the film itself into an evolving entity that challenges the audience's perception and understanding of storytelling. It combines elements of mystery, psychological thriller, and meta-narrative to create a thought-provoking and immersive cinematic experience.

"The Augmented Abyss":
In a future where the Morlocks live in a dark and subterranean world, cut off from the light and the surface, a revolutionary augmented reality (AR) video game called "The Augmented Abyss" is released. The game offers an immersive experience where players can explore vibrant and visually stunning virtual environments that mimic the beauty of the surface world.
Initially, the Morlocks are hesitant to embrace this new form of entertainment, as their society has always discouraged distractions from their daily survival tasks. However, a group of curious Morlocks, led by a young and adventurous individual, decides to give the game a chance.
As they delve deeper into "The Augmented Abyss," they discover a hidden layer within the game that reveals a startling truth. The game's creators, a group of rebel Eloi, have designed it as a means to connect with the Morlocks and bridge the gap between their two worlds. They aim to subvert the darkness meme by offering the Morlocks a glimpse of the surface world and the wonders that lie beyond their underground existence.
As the Morlocks become engrossed in the game, their perception of reality begins to shift. The boundaries between the virtual world and their own become blurred, leading to profound philosophical and existential questions. Is their reality solely confined to their underground existence? Can the virtual world offer them a sense of freedom and fulfillment they have never experienced before?
As the Morlocks spend more time in "The Augmented Abyss," they gradually become more detached from their physical surroundings. Their obsession with the game consumes them, affecting their relationships and overall well-being. The protagonist, torn between the allure of the augmented reality and the responsibilities of their real life, must navigate the challenges of maintaining a balance between the two worlds.
Through their experiences in the game, the Morlocks begin to question the darkness meme that has governed their society for generations. They realize that darkness is not solely defined by the absence of light but can also manifest in the lack of connection, exploration, and personal growth.
In a climactic twist, the Morlocks and the Eloi collaborate to create a new augmented reality experience that blends the best aspects of both their worlds. Together, they redefine the meaning of darkness and light, finding a harmonious balance that celebrates their unique strengths and perspectives.
"The Augmented Abyss" challenges the Morlocks to question their preconceived notions and embrace a new form of reality. It subverts the conventional notion of escapism by using technology as a means to bridge the divide between two disparate cultures. Through the game, the Morlocks embark on a journey of self-discovery and reimagine their relationship with the surface world and themselves.

In a climactic turning point, Kael and Alaric must confront the difficult choices before them. They must decide whether to preserve the innocence and tranquility of their community or embrace the transformative power of knowledge and technology.
"Echoes of Time" explores the themes of simplicity, knowledge, and the interplay between technology and nature. It subverts the trope of a time traveler bringing advanced technology to a primitive society by highlighting the value of preserving the beauty and harmony of a simpler existence.

"Moon is a Harsh Mistress":
Plot: In a dystopian future where the Eloi and Morlocks live in separate worlds, an unexpected event causes an Eloi and a Morlock to discover each other's world. As they navigate through the unfamiliar territories, they begin to question their preconceived notions about their societies and forge an unlikely alliance to uncover the truth behind their segregated existence. Together, they challenge the status quo and strive to create a world where unity and understanding prevail.
"Eloi: The Awakening":
Plot: In this thought-provoking film, the story unfolds from the perspective of the Eloi, a seemingly carefree and pleasure-seeking society. As the Eloi go about their daily lives, they slowly unravel the hidden engineering secrets that govern their world. Led by a curious individual named Alaric, they embark on a journey of discovery, confronting the dark truths lurking beneath the surface and finding the courage to challenge the illusions they have been living under.
"Timeless Journey":
Plot: A time traveler mysteriously appears just after the revelations of the Eloi-Morlock world. Unaware of the recent events, the time traveler finds themselves in a distant oceanic pedement where technology has been lost. Living a primitive life as a fisherman and vine farmer, they are oblivious to the advancements and interlocking societies of the Eloi and Morlocks. As they navigate this unfamiliar territory, they become entangled in the struggles of the Eloi and Morlocks, becoming a catalyst for change and bringing ancient wisdom to shape a new future.
"The Forgotten Tower":
Plot: A broadcast from a long-forgotten advanced society living in Equatarion, an equatorial mass accelerator, disrupts the lives of the Eloi and Morlocks. The emergency message, received by thousands of towers, unveils the existence of a highly advanced civilization with knowledge and technology beyond their imagination. The Eloi and Morlocks, now faced with the opportunity to connect with this advanced society, must navigate the complexities of this new revelation and determine how it will shape their own societies and the fate of their interlocking worlds.
