This is a mechanical circuit which is to say it's a collection of mechanical components
that together are a really robust analogy for electric circuits.
You've got resistors, transistors, capacitors, amateurs, batteries, inductors.
It's really incredible what you can build with this thing and for me it's really interesting
to see my intuitions about electrical circuits in physical form like I can feel voltages and
C currents. It's called spin-tronics. There's a link in the description. They're not paying me
at all to make this video. I want to be clear about that but when I saw the Kickstarter I just
knew I had to make a video about it because I love an analogy. Let's have a look at a really
simple circuit. So this is the battery and this is a resistor and the two are joined together by a
chain. When I charge up the battery by pulling this string the battery then discharges its energy
into the resistor. What's really cool is you can feel the resistance like this one which is 100 ohms
has a certain amount of resistance. This one which is 200 ohms has twice that resistance. You can feel
it in your hands and look when you put the 200 in there the chain moves at half the speed of when
the 100 was in there. So the speed of the chain is like the amps of a circuit. You can connect two
resistors in series like this and the chain moves even more slowly. You can also connect resistors
in series like this. That's a bit counterintuitive at first because it kind of looks like they're
in parallel but this is what series looks like in a spin-tronic circuit. It's a bit like the
analogy of water flowing through pipes that you often hear when talking about electronic circuits
but instead of water being pushed through pipes it's a chain that's being pulled and it's pulling
on different components. This is probably a good time to address the veritasium shaped elephant in
the room. You probably saw his video where he talks about how electronic circuits really work.
It's the one about the circuit that's a light second in length. It's a really important video,
actually two videos because he did a follow-up that I recommend you watch if you haven't already
because he clears a few things up. They're important videos because it's important to keep in mind
what's really going on beneath the models that we have in our heads of how things work. In the
videos he explains that the energy in a circuit is carried by the electric and magnetic fields
that hug the wires and components of the circuit and that kind of puts the lie to the hydrodynamic
model doesn't it because if you only have that you know water flowing through pipes image in your
head then you're thinking okay so I push water at this end of the pipe which pushes on the water
next to it which pushes on the water next to it which pushes on the water next to it until this
bit of water falls out the other end of the pipe and that bit of water can be used to do work
and if that's the only model that you have then you might think well it's the same with electrons
and pushing the electrons with a voltage through this end of the wire which pushes on the electrons
in front of it which pushes on the electrons in front of it until eventually these electrons at the
end they could be pushed out of the wire and do work but that's not how it works. The energy is
carried by the electric and magnetic fields though to be fair to the electrons those electric and
magnetic fields belong to the electrons so it is kind of fair to say that it's the electrons that
are carrying the energy it's just that they're not pushing on each other in the way that the
water in a pipe model might lead you to believe but to make a broader philosophical point like
everything we know in science is just models even quantum mechanics is just a model and it's
wrong in the sense that we know it's not a true description of the universe because it doesn't play
well with relativity but we still use quantum mechanics because it's insanely accurate under
most circumstances so you might have the water in a pipe model of electric circuits in your head
but it's important to know that underneath that it's the electric and magnetic fields that are
carrying the energy but even that's a model right I mean it's models all the way down but the point
is when you're doing science you pick the model that is most appropriate for the thing that you're
doing this mechanical circuit model is good for intuition as well so let's explore some of those
this is the spin tronics equivalent of a capacitor the more you try and turn it the harder it gets to
turn in the same way that the more you try and shove charge into an actual capacitor the harder
it gets and look you can even see there's numbers on the dial so you can see how charged up it is
actually this doubles as a voltmeter so the numbers here are in volts a quick note on units
actually this says 100 ohms but actually it's 100 spin ohms and this is spin volts what's really
nice is they're all analogous to the real things like if we say that 10 meters of this chain is
equivalent to one coulomb of charge then all these other values like spin ohms and spin volts and stuff
down here they're all equivalent then to the real thing look what happens if I connect a resistor and
a capacitor to the battery you might think that these are in parallel but look once the capacitor
is charged up the current stops flowing through both the capacitor and the resistor that's because
this is actually a series circuit so how do you achieve parallel circuits with spin tronics well
you need junctions and actually junctions are more complicated with spin tronics than they are in
electric circuits well that's because they're incredibly simple in electric circuits look
here's a junction but this is a junction in spin tronics it's actually like a differential gear
in a car if I hold this still these two things move if I hold this one still these two move
if I hold this one still these two move that means whatever voltage you apply to the bottom
sprocket will actually come out of the top two sprockets and vice versa for any pair so remember
when I had these two resistors in series they span at the same rate just like an electric circuit the
current through two resistors in series will be the same but look when I put them in parallel
the smaller resistor spins much more quickly and that's as we would expect we expect a greater
current to flow through the lower resistor remember these capacitors are also volt meters
so if I put a volt meter in parallel with this resistor then I'm measuring the voltage across
the resistor that's pretty cool isn't it one thing that's nice about a junction is you can feel the
voltage like if I hold the top sprocket of the junction with my fingers I can feel it pushing
against me that's the voltage another cool thing about junctions is that you can use them as a
transformer in this circuit this resistor is attached to the junction twice and this free spinning
component is attached to the remaining sprocket powering this with my hand I only feel half the
resistance but the resistor turns up half the speed that's mechanical advantage so transforming
voltages in spintronics is actually a lot easier than in regular circuits you can easily do it with
DC whereas with electrical circuits you need alternating current there's even something
analogous to an ammeter a device that indicates the amps in a circuit how much current is flowing
it doesn't give you a reading instead it gives you a pitch all along this rim there are these
serrations look if I scrape it with my nail you can kind of hear it under here there's a ridge
that is connected to this gramophone amplifier so the faster this thing turns the higher the pitch
if I add it to this circuit here that gives you a sense of what the current is like
if I put it against this smaller resistor the pitch goes up in series with a capacitor when
I turn the switch on you can hear how current flows quickly into the capacitor but slows down
as it gets full with this setup I can charge and discharge the capacitor with these two switches
this is probably my favorite component it's an inductor this is what an electrical inductor looks
like it's a coil of wire and how does one of these things behave for me it was one of those things
that wasn't super easy to get an intuition for like an inductor resists the buildup of current
but once there is a current it resists the reduction of current it's all mediated by magnetic fields
but with this spin tronics analogy it's all about inertia and momentum which is really intuitive
because of these weights around here it's hard to get the thing spinning and once it's spinning
it's hard to stop it connecting an inductor to a capacitor really gives a nice intuition about
both of these components and how they might behave in a circuit because it's hard to stop
current flowing through an inductor it can cause damage to your circuit if it's not designed well
in fact the same thing happens with spin tronics circuits this is a switch here and when I turn
it on the inductor receives power it eventually spins up and then watch what happens when I turn
the switch off it destroys the switch if you have a problem like that in a circuit then you add a
resistor in parallel so now when I turn the switch off the inductor can dump its energy through the
resistor by the way if there's nothing connected to the battery it spins like crazy which is exactly
what happens if you connect the two ends of a battery together the battery will overheat because
of the immense flow of current through it there's a little seatbelt type break inside to prevent
damage to the spin tronics battery if there isn't anything connected or if you make a circuit
like this and you realize that there's nothing attached to this part of the junction actually
that illustrates something quite quirky about spin tronics which is that components are by default
closed circuits like if you charge up a regular capacitor and then remove it from the circuit
it holds its charge but look if I charge up this spin tronics capacitor and then let go it discharges
so unless a spin tronics component is connected to something else it's probably connected to itself
this is really cool it's a transistor look no current can flow through this bottom sprocket
because of these clamps clamping down on that rubber ring but if I apply a small voltage to the top
sprocket it opens up these clamps and the bottom sprocket can spin you might know that you can use
a transistor as an amplifier so a small voltage applied up here can lead to a large current flowing
down here here it is in a circuit this capacitor that's acting as a voltmeter here is showing the
small change in voltage that i'm supplying with my fingers this capacitor slash voltmeter
is showing the much bigger amplified voltage across the load you can even make a diode by
connecting a transistor to itself via a junction look it will spin one way but not the other
just like a diode so let's see if we can build some interesting circuits this is a peak voltage
detector so I can apply a voltage manually with my hand and this capacitor slash voltmeter is showing
me that voltage but this capacitor slash voltmeter is showing me the peak voltage because this pair
of components acts as a diode the capacitor won't discharge when I let go over here what's brilliant
about all this is I can feel it as it happens it's really intuitive spin electronics actually comes
with a dedicated diode component so look here's a simplified version of the circuit the diode works
by a simple ratchet mechanism you can turn it in one direction but not in the other this is a high
pass filter so I can send a voltage signal into the circuit with my hand by spinning this thing
I can do it at high frequency I can do it at low frequency and a high pass filter will filter out
the low frequency signals leaving the high frequency signals but how does it do that well
this is an inductor and it's in parallel you can think of an inductor as a short circuit for
low frequencies and dc after all dc is just very low frequency so if I try and turn this thing with
a constant force once the inductor spins up then it's basically a short circuit and none of that
dc signal will get through to the ammeter an inductor is a bit like a circuit break for high
frequency signals so if I move this thing back and forth quickly then we do hear it at the ammeter
because it doesn't have much in effect on the inductor to make a low pass filter you replace
the inductor with a capacitor a capacitor is like a short circuit for high frequencies but a
circuit break for low frequencies this is an oscillating circuit if you ever need ac for something
in your spintronics world here's a fun story when I was 18 I wrote a scientific paper and got it
published in a journal that sounds more impressive than it actually is at the time my physics teacher
Mr Parkinson said something like you know that idea you had I could probably get it published
in physics education journal they have this section for like student submissions so that's
what it was but I still like to tell people that I got a paper published when I was 18 but the idea
was this if you get a charged capacitor and you connect it directly to an equivalent uncharged
capacitor then half the charge will leave the charge capacitor and end up in the uncharged
capacitor they reach equilibrium with each other what's surprising is if you calculate the energy
of those two capacitors after you connect them you have exactly half the energy you had before
but where does that energy go I had this idea that instead of thinking about capacitors think
about tanks of water so you have one tank of water that's full and another that's empty and it's
connected at the bottom with a pipe when you open that pipe water will flow from the full tank
to the empty tank until they're equal but actually because of momentum there will be an
overshoot and the second tank will go slightly above halfway and then it will relax down again
and it will oscillate backwards and forwards until they have an equal amount of water in both
but every time the water sloshes backwards and forwards it loses energy through friction and
that's where the energy goes electrons in a circuit don't have momentum in a meaningful way
but the wires between the capacitors do have stray inductance so I wanted to see if the same
thing would happen with spintronics if I charge up one capacitor and connect it to another will
they oscillate backwards and forwards until they both have half the charge and will it work with
just the stray inductance in spintronics and look there they go they do oscillate backwards and
forwards not for long because there's a decent amount of stray resistance in spintronics as well
but it's nice to have my paper from 1997 validated what about a full bridge rectifier can we make
one of those a full bridge rectifier converts ac to dc with four diodes as you can see here
as I supply ac here you get dc at the load here it's not very smooth but you can fix that with a
couple of capacitors I only have two diodes which is why I'm showing you this in simulation but
luckily with spintronics you can make a full bridge rectifier with just two diodes the reason you
can do it with spintronics but not with regular electric circuits is because with spintronics
it's really easy to change the direction of current which isn't in normal circuits depending on how
you chain up a junction you can flip the direction of current flow what about computation can we use
this to build a computer of some kind well look here's a flip-flop when I turn this switch on it
registers at this voltmeter but when I switch it off the voltmeter stays on this switch puts the
voltmeter back to zero and so I can flip-flop between the two this is an xor logic gate if switch
one is on we get a reading at the ammeter if switch two is on we get a reading at the ammeter
but if both switches are on we don't so maybe we could use this stuff to build a binary adder
like I did with my water computer video if I ever get that working I'll make a follow-up but in the
meantime is there anything I've missed is there a really cool circuit that you would like to see
built with spintronics let me know in the comments thanks to paul from spintronics for all his help
with this video and thanks to mr parkinson for being just a brilliant physics teacher
vpns can be really useful I recommend the one I use private internet access they're sponsoring
this video a vpn encrypts your web traffic and hides your ip address without a vpn your internet
service provider network administrator and potentially your government depending on where you live
can see and record the websites you visit probably not the content of the websites you visit because
that's encrypted with ssl usually but typically they can see the domain names and build up a
profile of you with private internet access none of that can happen and so your digital life
is safer and more private here's another use case I was in Spain at the end of summer and
we wanted to keep watching a show on a streaming service that is notoriously difficult to get
working abroad even with a vpn and it worked flawlessly with private internet access one thing
I found quite annoying when I was in Spain was trying to do any kind of home-based admin like
trying to buy something to be delivered to the uk for example was really hard because websites were
always redirecting me to the Spanish version I can't speak or read Spanish like if you have any
kind of home admin to do while traveling it can be insanely useful to trick your device
into thinking you are at home when you connect your device to a vpn you can choose which country
it appears to be in and with private internet access you can choose from over 83 countries
and every single us state they also have a no-log policy that's been tested in court
and recently verified by an independent audit but the reason I choose pia is because all their
software is open source like I'm not suggesting that everyone who uses private internet access
should audit the software on github but it is out there so people have audited it
it's a level of transparency that I value the deal on this one's really good if you go to my
