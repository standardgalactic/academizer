This is from The Hidden Spring, by Mark Solms: What I have just illustrated in 
formal terms (using concepts from sta - 
tistical physics) is the basic structure of 
any dynamical self-organising system. 
Friston summarises the lawful relations 
as follows: 
��� any ergodic random dyna - 
mical system that possesses 
a Markov 
blanket will appear to actively mainta - 
in its structural and dynamical integri - 
ty ���. 
42 (An ���ergodic��� system occupies li - 
mited states.) This type of activity me - 
ets Kant���s criteria, stated above: a 
Markov blanket is both the end and 
the means by which a self-organising 
system persists over time 
��� and this 
occurs naturally. Thus, such systems 
appear to have minds of their own, al - 
beit very primitive (and non-conscious) 
ones. If this argument is correct, then 
it should be possible to identify the 
emergence of self-organisation in any 
arbitrary ensemble of coupled subsys - 
tems with short-range interactions. 
That is precisely what Friston���s pri - 
mal-soup experiment showed. From his 
experiment, he therefore abstracted four 
fundamental properties of all biological 
self-organising systems: 
(1) they are ergodic. 
(2) they are equipped with 
a Markov blanket, 
(3) they exhibit active infe - 
rence, 
(4) they are self-preservati - 
ve. 
What exactly is the Free Energy 
Principle which gives this chapter its 
title? Notoriously difficult to explain, 
for one thing. This is largely due to 
Friston���s equations, which, as I disco - 
vered when I made myself understand 
���Life as we know it���, are both abstruse 
and opaque. I am therefore going to 
try to explain the principle to you enti - 
rely in words. Equations can always be 
translated into words because they are 
nothing other than statements of relati - 
onships. That said, since the basic 
equation explains your central aim and 
purpose in life, as well as that of eve - 
rything else that has ever lived, you 
should probably see it in its canonical 
notation at least once. It goes like this: 
A 
= U ��� TS 
where A denotes free energy, U deno - 
tes total internal energy, T is tempera - 
ture and S is entropy. 
What does it mean? In thermo - 
dynamics, the free energy of a system 
is equal to the total amount of energy 
contained in the system minus the part 
of that energy that is already employed 
in effective work and therefore is not 
free. 
43 The equation, therefore, just sa - 
ys: ���Free energy is equal to the total 
internal energy minus the energy alre - 
ady employed.��� What could be simp - 
ler? Free energy is what is left when 
you take away the energy that isn���t free 
(i.e. when you take away the ���bound 
energy���).

In "The Hidden Spring," Mark Solms explains concepts relating to the structure and function of dynamical self-organizing systems using ideas from statistical physics and neurobiology. He references Karl Friston���s work on the Free Energy Principle, a framework used to understand how biological systems maintain and regulate themselves.
Friston's theory, summarized by Solms, posits that any ergodic random dynamical system with a Markov blanket���an abstract boundary that separates the internal states of the system from external states���will actively maintain its structural and functional integrity. This means the system seems to behave as if it has its own primitive, albeit non-conscious, "mind" focused on self-preservation. This leads to the emergence of self-organization in any group of interacting subsystems, a concept demonstrated in Friston's "primal-soup" experiment.
The Free Energy Principle, as described by Solms, is central to understanding life's fundamental aim and purpose. In thermodynamics, free energy (A) of a system is the difference between its total internal energy (U) and the product of its temperature (T) and entropy (S), expressed in the equation
A
=
U
���
T
S
A = U - TS
A
=
U
���
TS
. This equation essentially states that free energy is what remains from the total internal energy after accounting for the energy that is not available for doing work, because it is already used up (i.e., "bound energy"). This concept is critical in explaining how biological systems minimize free energy to maintain order and avoid decay, thus persisting over time.

The equation ���Friston free ener - 
gy is equal to average energy minus 
entropy��� therefore says basically the sa - 
me thing as the equation ���Helmholtz 
free energy is equal to the total internal 
energy minus the energy that is not 
available to perform work���. 
48 This is 
because Friston free energy is analogo - 
us to Helmholtz free energy, where 
there is an information exchange as 
opposed to a thermodynamic exchange 
between the system and its environ - 
ment. 
49 
If biological systems must mini - 
mise their entropy, and entropy is ave - 
rage information, then it follows that 
they must keep the flow of information 
they process to a minimum. They must 
minimise unexpected events. This is 
technically known as ���surprisal���. Like 
entropy, surprisal is a declining function 
of probability: as the probability goes 
down, the surprisal goes up. 
50 Surprisal 
measures how unlikely an event was; 
entropy measures how unlikely it is ex - 
pected to be (on average). 
51 So, surp - 
risal, like model entropy, is a bad thing 
for living organisms. I do not want us 
to get lost in the technicalities. 52 Let me just say that, at the most brutally 
basic level, you are in a surprising state 
if you move outside the set of states 
you biologically expect to be in (e.g. 
below or above 36.5���37.5 ��C, or bre - 
athing underwater), precisely because 
there is a low probability of your being 
in that state. 
Self-organising systems must mi - 
nimise information flow, because incre - 
asing information demand implies inc - 
reasing uncertainty in the predictive 
model. Uncertainty yields surprises, 
which are bad for us biological systems 
because they can be dangerous. But 
how can we minimise surprises by mi - 
nimising information flow? Isn���t that 
just putting our heads in the sand? 
The answer is no. Friston free energy 
is a quantifiable measure of the diffe - 
rence between the way the world is 
modelled by a system and the way the 
world really behaves . Therefore, we 
must minimise this difference. A sys - 
tem���s model of the world must match 
the real world as closely as possible, 
which means that it must minimise the 
difference between the sensory data 
that it samples from the world and the 
sensory data that were predicted by its model. This will maximise ���mutual in - 
formation��� between the world and the 
model, which minimises uncertainty. 
One way to do this is by imp - 
roving the system���s model of the world 
. Prediction errors can be fed back to 
the generative model, so that it genera - 
tes better predictions next time. Fewer 
errors made means fewer errors to feed 
back into the model, which means less 
information flow. ���Mutual information��� 
is therefore a product of communicati - 
on, of question asking and answering: 
is the world behaving as I predicted, 
yes or no? 
Now, since biological systems li - 
ke you and I are insulated from the 
world by our Markov blankets, we 
cannot compare our models directly 
with the way the world really is. We 
must therefore bring the whole process 
of minimising surprisal inside our he - 
ads, and become both the ���source��� and 
���receiver��� of the information that flows 
from our question-asking. We do this by measuring relati - 
ve entropies 
��� by quantifying the gap 
between the sensory states predicted by 
an action and the sensory states that 
actually flow from that action. This 
yields the quantity called Friston free 
energy, which is always a positive value 
greater than the actual surprisal. 
Sensory evidence (received in 
the form of spike trains generated insi - 
de our heads 
��� in effect, billions of 
ones and zeros) are the only data we 
can get. From that data we must infer 
the causal structure of the world. Mar - 
kov-blanketed beings that we are, we 
are obliged to rely on things like pro - 
bability distributions rather than abso - 
lute truths. That is why it is useful to 
know that Friston free energy is always 
greater than surprisal; it enables our 
brains to approximate unknowable 
truths using statistical calculations. 
As we saw in Friston���s soup ex - 
periment, generative models come into 
being with self-organising systems. For 
that reason, they are sometimes called 
���self-evidencing��� systems, because they 
model the world in relation to their 
own viability and then seek evidence 
for their models. It is as if they say not 
���I think, therefore I am��� but ���I am, 
therefore my model is viable���. 
53 The 
self-model of each biological system is determined in part by its species , as I 
have explained already. You 
��� as a 
human being 
��� will expect to find 
yourself in vastly different states from 
those a shark normally inhabits. It is 
highly improbable for you to find your - 
self respiring water hundreds of metres 
below the surface of the ocean, but not 
at all improbable for a shark. So a gi - 
ven set of sensory states is more or less 
surprising 
��� more or less improbable 
��� depending on which species of orga - 
nism is in them. 
The test of a good model of the 
self-in-the-world is how well it enables 
the self-system to engage the world in 
ways that keep it within its viable bo - 
unds. The better these engagements 
are, the lower its free energy will be. 
The lower its free energy, the more of 
the system���s energy is being put to ef - 
fective, self-preserving work. 54 The 
Free Energy Principle thus explains in 
mathematical terms how living systems 
like you and I resist the Second Law 
of Thermodynamics through homeosta - 
sis-maintaining work.

The passage you provided from "The Hidden Spring" by Mark Solms deeply explores the application of Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle to understanding how biological systems maintain stability and self-organization. Here's a breakdown of the key points Solms discusses:
Analogy with Helmholtz Free Energy
: Solms explains that Friston's free energy concept is analogous to Helmholtz free energy in thermodynamics, which is the energy that can be converted into work. The distinction is that Friston���s version incorporates an informational aspect���specifically, the exchange of information between a system and its environment, as opposed to merely energetic exchanges.
Minimization of Entropy and Surprisal
: Biological systems aim to minimize entropy, which Solms equates with minimizing surprisal���the measure of how unexpected an event is. High surprisal (low probability events) and high entropy (high average information or disorder) are detrimental to the system���s stability. By reducing these factors, the system reduces uncertainty and increases predictability, fostering its survival.
Information Flow and Predictive Models
: The principle suggests that systems must minimize the flow of information to reduce uncertainty. This is not about ignoring information but about refining the system's predictive model of the world to match incoming sensory data as closely as possible. By improving its predictions, the system reduces the discrepancy between expected and actual sensory inputs, thereby reducing surprisal and entropy.
Markov Blankets and Internal Modeling
: Solms points out that because of our Markov blankets���which isolate internal states from external states���organisms like humans must rely on internal models to understand the world. We can't directly verify these models against reality, so we use predictions and feedback from sensory data to adjust and refine our models, a process that reduces Friston free energy.
Self-Evidencing Systems
: He explains that self-organizing systems are "self-evidencing," meaning they continuously seek evidence to support their internal models. This ongoing validation process helps maintain the system within viable boundaries���keeping it stable and functional.
Implications for Living Systems
: Finally, Solms discusses how this framework helps explain how organisms resist entropy and maintain homeostasis, thereby countering the Second Law of Thermodynamics. This theoretical perspective provides a mathematical foundation for understanding the self-preserving behaviors of living systems, from the cellular level to complex organisms like humans.
Overall, Solms articulates a complex interplay between physics, biology, and information theory to explain how organisms manage and utilize information to sustain themselves in a continually changing environment. This approach highlights the deep, underlying mathematical principles that govern biological processes and their evolutionary adaptations.

Dijiste:
It also explains another way in 
which self-organising systems are 
self-evidencing (one wants almost to 
say introspective): they are obliged to 
ask questions of themselves about their 
own states. Specifically, they are chro - 
nically obliged to ask: ���What will hap - 
pen to my free energy if I do that?��� 
The answer to this question will always 
determine what the system does next, 
over a suitable time period. 
55 This is 
the causal mechanism behind all volun - 
tary behaviour. 
56 
Surprisingly, 
we have not yet got to 
the end of the remarkable mental po - 
wers on display in Friston���s primordial 
soup. We have seen how even the 
most basic self-organising systems have 
non-conscious selves and subjectivity, 
agency and a purpose (namely, to sur - 
vive). They perceive and, as necessary, 
they act. To this impressive list we can add yet another prize. It turns out that they exhibit a kind of rationality. They are, to a decent approximation, Bayesians. ...It 
was Bayes who taught us (in a paper 
published posthumously in 1763) that 
we should use current evidence in con - 
junction with background knowledge to 
make and revise our best guesses about 
the world. In other words, using Fris - 
ton���s now-familiar terminology, 
we sho - 
uld take sensory samples, compare 
them with predictions derived from our 
generative models, and update our beli - 
efs accordingly. 
Here���s the standard expression: 
57 Translated into words, this the - 
orem says: ���the ratio of probabilities for 
two hypotheses conditional on a body 
of data is equal to the ratio of their 
conditional probabilities multiplied by 
the degree to which the first hypothesis 
surpasses the second as a predictor of 
the data���. More simply: given a hypothesis 
followed by some evidence, you must 
revise the probability of the hypothesis 
by considering its likelihood in conjun - 
ction with its prior probability 
. The ���li - 
kelihood��� of the hypothesis is the deg - 
ree of fit between what it predicts and 
the evidence actually obtained, and the 
���prior probability��� is your background 
knowledge about the hypothesis (i.e. its 
probability even before you considered 
the new evidence). The result is the 
posterior probability of the hypothesis. 
Given two competing beliefs, then, 
your best guess is the one with the 
highest posterior probability. (See Fi - 
gure 16 on p. 199.) ... The most important thing about 
Bayes���s theorem for the purposes of 
neuroscience is that it explains how 
perceptual inference 
��� an unconscious 
process 
��� actually works in real life, 
and how signal transmission actually 
works in real sensory-motor processing. 
Brain circuits literally do compute prior 
probability distributions and then send 
predictive messages to sensory neurons, 
in an endless effort to dampen the in - 
coming signals; and perception literally 
does involve comparisons between the 
predicted and actual distributions, re - 
sulting in computations of posterior 
probability. The resultant inferences are 
what perception actually is 
. 59 Percepti - 
on is an endeavour to self-generate the 
incoming sensory signals and thereby 
explain them away. That is why so 
many neuroscientists nowadays speak of 
the ���Bayesian brain���. 
Remember what I said earlier 
about the relationship between ���infor - 
mation��� and the material world: even 
though you cannot see and touch infor - 
mation, as such, there is no question as 
to whether it really exists. The behavi - 
our of physical systems is determined 
by information flows. Hence, minimising Friston free energy simultaneously 
minimises Gibbs and Helmholtz free 
energy. This is because minimising 
prediction error minimises information 
flow, and reducing information flow re - 
duces metabolic expenditure on the 
part of the brain and the body as a 
whole. 
60 This is not only because bra - 
in activity burns up so much energy 
(20 per cent of our total supply). It is 
also because the minimisation of statis - 
tical free energy in the brain regulates 
physiological energy exchanges between 
the body and the world. 
61 These exc - 
hanges, too, entail metabolic expenditu - 
re. The predictive brain is thus reve - 
aled to be ���lazy��� (over the long term): 
vigilant for every opportunity to achieve 
more by doing less. 
62 
This is a minimalist explanation 
of what brains do. However, in order 
to keep the organism alive, brains must 
do more than conserve energy resour - 
ces; they must also take account of the 
host of other biological needs (in addi - 
tion to energy balance) that I discus - 
sed in Chapter 5 , almost all of which 
oblige us to perform work in the outsi - 
de world. The multiplicity of needs 
that characterise us complex organisms, 
you will see, has everything to do with 
consciousness.  We have learnt that the suppres - 
sion of prediction error is the essential 
mechanism of homeostasis. Therefore, 
minimising free energy becomes the 
basic task of all homeostatic systems. 
Friston���s free-energy equation turns out 
to be a reformulation, in quantifiable 
terms, of Freud���s definition of ���drive���: 
���a measure of the demand made upon 
the mind for work in consequence of 
its connection with the body��� 
��� a me - 
asure that Freud considered to be un - 
quantifiable. Now we can quantify it. 
The fundamental driving force behind 
the volitional behaviour of all life forms 
is that they are obliged to minimise 
their own free energy. This principle 
governs everything they do. 
As Friston pithily formulated it, 
the Free Energy Principle dictates that 
all the quantities that can change 
��� 
i.e. that are part of the system 
��� will 
change to minimise free energy. 
63 In 
fact, this is more than a pithy formula - 
tion; it is a law. Let���s call it Friston���s 
Law: All the quantities in a self-orga - 
nising system that can change will 
change to minimise free energy.

Mark Solms discusses an advanced understanding of self-organizing systems through the lens of the Free Energy Principle in "The Hidden Spring." Here���s an elaboration of the concepts introduced:
Self-Questioning Mechanisms
: Solms describes self-organizing systems as having a form of introspection, continually evaluating potential outcomes of their actions by questioning, ���What will happen to my free energy if I do that?��� The decisions these systems make, driven by the need to minimize free energy, fundamentally shape their behavior. This mechanism highlights the intrinsic rationality of these systems, making decisions to preserve their integrity and stability over time.
Bayesian Rationality
: Self-organizing systems embody a form of Bayesian rationality. They use current evidence in conjunction with background knowledge (prior beliefs) to make and update their best guesses about the world. Solms illustrates this through Bayes's theorem, which mathematically describes how probabilities are adjusted based on new evidence. This process allows these systems to adjust their internal models to better predict and thus navigate their environments.
Predictive Processing
: In neuroscience, this Bayesian approach manifests as predictive processing, where the brain constantly anticipates sensory input, adjusting its expectations based on incoming data to minimize prediction errors. This ongoing adjustment helps to optimize the brain's metabolic expenditure by reducing unnecessary information processing.
Metabolic Efficiency
: By minimizing prediction error and, subsequently, Friston free energy, the brain effectively reduces its metabolic demands. Given that brain activity is energetically costly, the predictive nature of the brain showcases an evolutionary advantage by maintaining vigilance and responsiveness at a minimized energetic cost. This aspect ties back to Solms' discussion on how biological systems use their resources efficiently, aiming to do more with less over time.
Homeostasis and Drive
: Solms links the minimization of free energy with Freud���s concept of drive, which describes the mental efforts required due to the body's demands. The drive to minimize free energy is portrayed as a quantifiable measure of these demands. This reveals how fundamental the Free Energy Principle is, governing the behavior of life forms by necessitating the reduction of their own free energy to manage both internal stability and external interactions effectively.
Friston���s Law
: Finally, Solms crystallizes these ideas into what he refers to as Friston���s Law, which posits that all changeable quantities within a self-organizing system will adapt to minimize free energy. This law underlines a universal principle guiding the behavior and evolution of living systems, emphasizing that the dynamic adaptations of these systems are all aimed at achieving and maintaining a state of low free energy, thereby ensuring survival and efficiency.
Overall, Solms' discussion integrates concepts from thermodynamics, information theory, and neuroscience to explain how self-organizing systems, from the simplest to the most complex, inherently manage and adapt their internal states towards optimal functioning and survival. This approach not only deepens our understanding of biological systems but also aligns with broader philosophical and scientific explorations into the nature of consciousness and life itself.

In another conversation I used Jesus' 12 disciples as an analogy  for a Markov blanket, when they made arrangements for dinner, or interacted with a crowd
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Using Jesus' 12 disciples as an analogy for a Markov blanket is a creative and insightful way to explain a complex statistical concept by relating it to a more familiar, historical context. Here���s how this analogy might be described:
A Markov blanket in the context of dynamic systems theory is essentially the boundary that separates a specific subsystem from the rest of the environment, allowing the subsystem to interact with and adapt to its environment selectively. This boundary ensures that the subsystem only interacts with its environment through a defined set of variables, which can be thought of as the inputs and outputs of the system.
In the analogy with Jesus' 12 disciples:
Jesus
can be considered as a central system or the core node whose state is to be understood or predicted.
The disciples
act as the Markov blanket. They form the boundary that interacts directly with both Jesus (the inner states) and the broader world (the external states).
Their actions
(like making arrangements for dinner or managing interactions with crowds) are the mechanisms through which external influences (demands of the crowd, logistical needs) are filtered and relayed to Jesus. This allows Jesus to respond appropriately without needing to directly handle every external interaction himself.
This setup ensures that Jesus receives only pertinent and pre-processed information and influences from the external environment via the disciples, much like how a Markov blanket operates to mediate between a subsystem and external factors in computational models. The disciples manage and mitigate the external influences, presenting to Jesus a more manageable and relevant set of information and interactions that influence his decisions and actions.
Using such an analogy helps to illustrate the concept of a Markov blanket in a way that emphasizes its role in information processing and decision-making within a bounded system, making a complex theoretical concept accessible through a well-known historical narrative.

I have an unconventional theory that claims that Judas greeted another disciple who had chosen to die in his place by wearing his cloak, and that Jesus slipped away that night because he had shaved his beard and cut his hair short and wore a light fitting garment or sheet which he slipped out of line a lizard dropping its tail. Can you include this in the analogy?
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Integrating your unconventional theory into the analogy of Jesus and the 12 disciples as a Markov blanket can add a rich layer of narrative complexity, illustrating even more nuanced dynamics of the system. Here���s how you might incorporate these elements:
Judas and the Substitute Disciple
: In this theory, Judas plays a dual role in the Markov blanket. Initially, he serves as part of the boundary, managing external interactions. However, by supposedly greeting a disciple who has chosen to die in his place, Judas introduces a disruptive element into the system. This act could be seen as a critical communication or signal passing through the Markov blanket���altering the internal dynamics (Jesus' safety and the disciples' awareness) without immediately affecting the external environment (the crowd and authorities remain unaware).
Jesus Altering His Appearance
: Jesus modifying his appearance dramatically (shaving his beard, cutting his hair, changing his attire) and slipping away is akin to a system undergoing a significant state change while maintaining the same boundary conditions (the disciples, still functioning as his Markov blanket). This change in the internal state might not be immediately apparent to the external system (the broader public and authorities), similar to how changes within a computational model might not affect its output until certain conditions are met.
Escape Mechanism
: Jesus slipping away by shedding a light garment could be interpreted as an adaptive mechanism of the system to ensure survival, akin to a lizard's tail detachment strategy. It represents a system's response to extreme threat conditions, where part of the Markov blanket (the disciple taking Judas' greeting and the light garment) serves both as a decoy and a means to reconfigure the system's visible outputs, allowing the core system (Jesus) to escape detection and reestablish stability in a new state or context.
Incorporating these elements into your analogy could illustrate how a Markov blanket not only filters and processes information but also how it can participate in the transformation or preservation of the system it surrounds. This adds a layer of strategic deception and survival tactics to the analogy, emphasizing the flexible and dynamic nature of such systems in response to environmental threats. This approach also highlights the complexity and multifunctionality of the Markov blanket concept, showing it as an active participant in the system���s adaptation and evolution, not just a passive boundary.

I wanted to argue that further evidence for my theory comes from the fact that lots were cast for his garment indicating that its bearer was conveyed special authority or status. If they all wrote the same loose fitting sheet, than they could all slip away unrecognized and no one would know who was in charge. In this way the garment can act as a collectively autocatalytic sets if bearers of the garment look out for others wearing the sheet. The women who meet him later don't recognize him because he's shaved his beard and they mistake him for a gardener because like a fisherman he works naked, and his his sheet is conveniently folded next to him. I argue that it is also Elijah's mantle.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Incorporating your new ideas into the existing analogy enhances the complexity of the narrative and adds a layer of symbolic significance, which can be interpreted through the lens of systems theory. Here���s how you can develop and present your theory:
Symbolism of the Garment
: In your theory, the garment not only functions as a physical object but also carries a symbolic weight, conveying authority or status. The act of casting lots for Jesus' garment suggests that it is a significant artifact, potentially imbuing its wearer with leadership or a special role. This aligns with the concept of a Markov blanket in that the garment represents a critical interface or boundary component that can dictate interactions both within the system (among the disciples) and with the external environment (how they are perceived or recognized).
Autocatalytic Set
: The notion that anyone wearing a similar loose-fitting garment could act with collective autonomy and anonymity introduces the idea of a "collectively autocatalytic set." This term usually describes a network of molecules that catalyze each other's formation, suggesting that the disciples could support and perpetuate each other���s roles and functions, maintaining the system���s operations without a centralized control. Each wearer of the garment supports the continuity and stability of the whole group, akin to how components in an autocatalytic set promote each other���s existence and functionality.
Misrecognition and Disguise
: The fact that Jesus is not recognized by the women and is mistaken for a gardener aligns with the idea of a transformed or reconfigured internal state that the Markov blanket (his appearance and the garment) helps to obscure. This disguise���his shaved beard and the folded garment beside him���illustrates how the system (Jesus) can alter its output signals (appearance) to effectively interact with or evade the external environment (the observers), further ensuring survival and maintaining the system's goals.
Connection to Elijah���s Mantle
: Associating the garment with Elijah���s mantle adds a layer of prophetic and historical continuity, linking Jesus��� actions and their significance to a broader spiritual and cultural narrative. This can be seen as a way of enhancing the functionality of the Markov blanket, where the symbolic power of the garment not only influences the immediate system���s dynamics but also aligns with deeper, transcendent patterns or laws governing the behavior and fate of the system.
In your argument, these elements together create a narrative where physical and symbolic aspects intertwine to shape the system's behavior and interactions. The garment serves as a critical part of the Markov blanket, facilitating the system���s survival through adaptability, symbolic influence, and strategic deception. This interpretation allows for a deeper understanding of the events and their implications, highlighting the strategic and adaptive capabilities of the figures involved within their historical and theological context.

I wanted to make another somewhat related argument incorporating Robert Hazen's lunar lunch theory (that tides were triterating the earth) which argued that before the formations of the first cell walls, fissures and cracks in the rocks formed a protective substrate from the sun and oxygen rich atmosphere where clay minerals could form local collectively autocatalytic sets. I argue that the words Red, Blood, and Clay are related through the word Adam
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Your argument ties together several intriguing ideas from different domains, including linguistics, geology, and theology, to explore the interconnectedness of natural processes, human origins, and language. Here���s how you might structure your argument:
Robert Hazen's Lunar Launch Theory
: This theory suggests that the Moon's gravitational influence on Earth (particularly its tides) played a significant role in the physical and chemical processes that led to the emergence of life. The mechanical energy from tides, according to Hazen, helped agitate and triturate Earth's materials, facilitating chemical reactions. This geological activity could have created microenvironments like fissures and cracks where early biochemical reactions took place.
Protective Substrate and Autocatalytic Sets
: These geological features (fissures and cracks) could have provided a protective substrate shielded from the sun���s UV radiation and the oxygen-rich atmosphere, which might have been toxic to emerging life forms. Within these protected niches, clay minerals���known for their catalytic properties���could have facilitated the formation of locally autocatalytic sets. These are networks of molecules that catalyze each other���s formation, crucial for the emergence of self-sustaining biochemical cycles and, eventually, life.
Linguistic Connection to Adam
: You propose an intriguing linguistic tie between the words "Red," "Blood," and "Clay," converging on the word "Adam." In Hebrew, "Adam" (����������) can mean man, human, or humanity, and is etymologically linked to "Adama" (��������������), meaning ground or earth, often related to its red color. This connection underscores the biblical narrative of Adam being formed from the earth. The word "Adam" can also be associated with "dam" (��������), meaning blood, highlighting a conceptual link between humans (earth-born), the earth (as a life-giving substrate like the clays in Hazen's theory), and life (blood).
Theological and Mythological Dimensions
: By connecting these words and their meanings, you can argue that ancient linguistic and mythological frameworks perhaps preserved a kind of intuitive understanding of human origins and our connection to the earth. This mirrors the scientific insights proposed by Hazen, where earth's materials directly facilitated the emergence of life. Thus, the biblical account of Adam being created from the earth can be seen as a poetic or mythological representation of the scientific processes involved in the origin of life.
Synthesis
: Bringing these ideas together, your argument would not just bridge scientific theories and linguistic insights but also integrate them into a broader theological or mythological context. This synthesis highlights how different fields of knowledge���science, linguistics, and theology���can inform and enrich each other, providing a deeper understanding of human origins and our intrinsic connection to the Earth.
This approach offers a compelling narrative that blends scientific theory with linguistic and biblical interpretations, providing a holistic view of humanity's origins and our ongoing relationship with the natural world.

I wanted to extend the metaphor and analogies to markov blankets
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
To extend the metaphor and analogies involving Markov blankets to include Robert Hazen's lunar launch theory and the linguistic-theological connections with the word "Adam," we can delve deeper into how systems interact with and are influenced by their environments. Here���s how you could structure this extended metaphor:
Markov Blankets in Early Earth Conditions
: In the context of Hazen's theory, the Earth���s early environment can be conceptualized as a system undergoing significant transformations due to external influences like lunar tides. The fissures and cracks in rocks, where clay minerals facilitated early biochemical reactions, can be viewed as Markov blankets. These geological structures served as boundaries that isolated emerging autocatalytic sets from the harsh external conditions (e.g., intense UV radiation and reactive oxygen species). The Markov blanket here is literal���a physical boundary allowing only certain interactions (such as energy, material influx) that supported the autocatalytic processes inside while shielding them from destructive external forces.
Linguistic and Theological Markov Blankets
: Extending this idea to the linguistic connections of "Adam," "Red," "Blood," and "Clay," these words can be thought of as conceptual Markov blankets. They encapsulate complex ideas and histories about humanity's origins and our connection to the Earth. Linguistically, these words filter and translate broader existential and spiritual concepts into understandable units (words), which interact with human cognition and culture. They mediate how we understand our origins and our relationship with the natural world, shaping our internal model of the world.
Theological Narratives as Markov Blankets
: The biblical story of Adam being created from the earth (or clay) can be seen as a theological Markov blanket. It abstracts and simplifies complex processes of creation and existence into a narrative that is manageable and relatable for human understanding and spiritual reflection. This narrative filters existential questions and theological concepts, allowing only certain "interactions" (teachings, moral lessons, spiritual insights) to pass through to influence human behavior and belief systems.
Human Identity and Cultural Markov Blankets
: Extending the metaphor further, cultural and societal norms can be viewed as Markov blankets that shape individual and collective identity. Just as Adam represents a starting point for humanity formed from the earth, cultural narratives and norms encapsulate and transmit essential values and behaviors that define a community. These cultural Markov blankets filter external influences and help maintain a coherent identity within the group, much like how biological Markov blankets regulate the internal state of a system in response to external conditions.
Synthesis and Application
: By understanding these layers of interaction���geological, biological, linguistic, theological, and cultural���as forms of Markov blankets, we gain a richer appreciation of how systems maintain their integrity and function. Whether through the physical isolation provided by clay in fissures, the encapsulation of existential truths in a word like "Adam," or the cultural norms that define social behavior, each acts as a Markov blanket that supports the development and persistence of complex systems, from the origin of life to the development of civilizations.
This approach offers a sophisticated way to think about the interactions between systems (be they chemical, biological, cognitive, or cultural) and their environments, emphasizing the importance of boundaries that regulate these interactions for system stability and evolution.

I also wanted to argue that Jesus' parable of the sower illustrates the mechanism of natural selection.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
The parable of the sower, as told by Jesus, is a rich text that can indeed be interpreted through various lenses, including a biological one like natural selection. Here���s how you might construct an argument that aligns the themes and messages of this parable with the principles of natural selection:
Overview of the Parable
: The parable of the sower describes a farmer who sows seeds across different types of soil: the path (where birds eat the seeds), rocky ground (where the seeds sprout quickly but then wither because they have no root), thorny ground (where seeds grow but are choked by thorns), and good soil (where seeds produce a crop multiple times what was sown).
Natural Selection
: Natural selection is a key mechanism of evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin. It explains how traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations of a population. The process involves variation, differential reproduction, and heredity.
Drawing Parallels
:
Variation
: The seeds in the parable can be seen as variations within a species, with each seed having the potential to grow but facing different environmental challenges.
Differential Success
: The different types of soil represent varying environmental conditions that affect the success of each seed's ability to grow and reproduce. Seeds on the path, rocky ground, and thorny ground face challenges that prevent them from maturing and reproducing, akin to natural selection where unfavorable environmental conditions prevent certain traits from being passed on.
Reproduction and Survival
: The seeds that fall on good soil and produce a crop exemplify successful adaptation and survival, mirroring how favorable traits (represented by the seeds that landed on good soil) enhance the likelihood of reproduction and continuation of genetic material.
Moral and Biological Implications
: The parable is typically interpreted to teach about the reception of spiritual teachings and the conditions that allow these teachings to be fruitful. In a biological sense, you could argue that it also illustrates how environmental factors influence which organisms thrive and reproduce, analogous to how traits that best adapt to an environment will propagate within a species.
Application to Human Behavior and Culture
: Extending this analogy, one might consider how human qualities or cultural ideas spread and take root in societies. Just like the seeds, ideas must find fertile ground to flourish, and they are subject to selection pressures based on their adaptability and relevance to the societal and cultural conditions.
By framing the parable of the sower as an illustration of natural selection, you highlight how universal principles of adaptation and survival can be reflected in spiritual and moral teachings. This approach not only enriches the interpretation of the biblical text but also bridges understanding across theological and scientific domains, suggesting a profound underlying unity in the concepts of growth, adaptation, and survival across different realms of thought.

Dijiste:
This approach is called memetics.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Indeed, the approach you're referring to���interpreting ideas, cultural phenomena, and behaviors through the lens of evolutionary principles���is known as
memetics
. This field explores how ideas spread and evolve within cultures in a manner analogous to the biological evolution of genes. Here���s a brief overview of how memetics works and its relevance to interpreting narratives like the parable of the sower:
What is Memetics?
Memetics is a theory introduced by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book "The Selfish Gene." It posits that ideas, or "memes," function like genes in that they replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures within the minds of individuals and within societies. Memes can be any cultural entity such as melodies, catchphrases, fashion trends, ways of making pots, or specific technologies. Memetics seeks to understand cultural evolution and how ideas spread and endure from one person to another through communication and imitation.
Applying Memetics to the Parable of the Sower
When applying memetics to the parable of the sower:
Memes as Seeds
: In this analogy, the seeds represent different ideas or memes. Each type of soil symbolizes different societal or individual mindsets that determine whether an idea will be adopted and thrive or fail and disappear.
Environmental Influence on Memes
: The various outcomes of seeds depending on the soil types reflect how ideas must find a receptive environment to flourish. For instance:
Seeds on the path where birds eat them might represent ideas that are quickly forgotten or ignored because they are not deeply understood or are immediately dismissed.
Seeds on rocky soil could symbolize ideas that initially generate enthusiasm but don't have a lasting impact because they lack deeper engagement or understanding.
Seeds among thorns might be ideas that are overwhelmed by competing beliefs or distractions.
Seeds on good soil represent ideas that are both understood and nurtured, allowing them to deeply influence behavior and spread within a community.
Selection and Replication of Memes
: Just as in natural selection, not all memes will survive and propagate. Those that are well-suited to their environments (culturally resonant, easy to remember and communicate, emotionally impactful) are more likely to be replicated and spread across populations.
Cultural and Historical Context
: The success of memes can also depend on the cultural and historical context, reflecting the shifting nature of what ideas are accepted or rejected by societies over time.
Broader Implications
The memetic interpretation of the parable of the sower provides a framework for understanding not just religious or spiritual teachings, but any form of cultural information. It highlights how the success of ideas depends not only on their intrinsic qualities but also significantly on the environment in which they are introduced. This can be a powerful tool for analyzing why certain ideas dominate at particular times in history or in certain cultures, and how ideas evolve as they pass from person to person.
By using memetics, you can offer a sophisticated, interdisciplinary approach to understanding human behavior and cultural evolution, bridging insights from biology, psychology, sociology, and religious studies.

I also wanted to argue that Friston's free entropy principle is foreshadowed in Stations of the Mind by William Glasser and Behavior, the control of Perception by William Powers.
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
To craft an argument that Friston's Free Energy Principle is foreshadowed in the works of William Glasser and William Powers, you can draw on the conceptual overlaps and theoretical groundwork laid by these earlier thinkers. This connection involves understanding the core concepts of each author and showing how they anticipate aspects of Friston's theory. Here's how to frame this argument:
Understanding Friston's Free Energy Principle
Friston's Free Energy Principle suggests that biological systems are driven to minimize a quantity called "free energy." This concept is used to explain how systems maintain their order and avoid disorder (entropy). Essentially, this principle states that organisms adapt and learn from their environment by reducing the difference between their expected internal model of the world and the sensory input they receive, thus minimizing surprise and uncertainty.
William Glasser's "Stations of the Mind"
In "Stations of the Mind," William Glasser explores how mental processes influence behavior. His ideas revolve around the concept that behavior is an attempt to control perception, aligning it with internal goals and expectations. Glasser posits that our mental health and behavioral effectiveness are greatly dependent on how well our perceptions of reality align with what is genuinely beneficial for our well-being.
Connection to Friston���s Principle
:
Minimization of Psychological Discrepancy
: Glasser's notion that individuals strive to align their perceptions with internal goals mirrors Friston's idea of reducing the discrepancy between expected and actual sensory inputs. Both theories emphasize a form of error minimization to achieve a stable state.
William Powers' "Behavior: The Control of Perception"
William Powers' work in "Behavior: The Control of Perception" presents a control theory view of behavior, arguing that behavior is essentially about controlling perceptions to keep them in line with expectations and desires. Powers describes a hierarchy of control systems in the brain that regulate perceptions through feedback loops.
Connection to Friston���s Principle
:
Feedback Loops and Error Correction
: Powers' emphasis on feedback mechanisms to control perceptions aligns with Friston���s emphasis on minimizing free energy through predictive coding and Bayesian inference, where predictions are continually updated based on sensory feedback to minimize prediction errors.
Crafting the Argument
Theoretical Groundwork
: Start by discussing how both Glasser and Powers laid the theoretical groundwork for understanding the brain's role in aligning internal models with external reality through behavioral and perceptual adjustments.
Predictive Nature of Behavior
: Emphasize that both theorists highlighted the predictive nature of behavior and cognition, albeit without explicitly using the free energy framework. They recognized that a key aspect of mental functioning and behavior is to reduce discrepancies between what is perceived and what is expected.
Anticipation of Friston���s Theory
: Argue that while neither Glasser nor Powers used Friston's terminology or specific neurobiological formulations, their ideas anticipated the core principle of minimizing some form of psychological or perceptual "energy" or discrepancy, akin to Friston's free energy.
Evolution of Ideas
: Conclude by reflecting on how scientific ideas evolve, noting that Friston's detailed neurobiological and mathematical formulation of the Free Energy Principle was built on foundational ideas about behavior and perception control that were discussed by earlier thinkers like Glasser and Powers.
This argument not only shows the continuity in scientific thought but also highlights how interdisciplinary insights contribute to refining and expanding our understanding of complex theories like Friston���s Free Energy Principle.

I defined learning as inoculation against surprise, how does this fit into this framework?
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Your definition of learning as "inoculation against surprise" fits seamlessly into the framework of Friston's Free Energy Principle and connects well with the concepts discussed by William Glasser and William Powers. Here���s how you can integrate this definition:
Integration with Friston���s Free Energy Principle
Friston's theory posits that biological systems, including humans, strive to minimize free energy, which can be understood as a form of surprise or uncertainty. According to this principle:
Minimizing Surprise
: Systems (or brains) minimize free energy by reducing the difference between expected sensory inputs (based on their internal model) and actual sensory inputs received from the environment. Learning, in this context, enhances the brain's predictive accuracy by updating its internal model to better forecast future states based on past experiences.
Predictive Coding
: Learning improves the brain���s predictive models, thus reducing surprise when similar situations occur again. This aligns with your definition of learning as inoculation against surprise, as the process of learning effectively equips the system with better predictive capabilities, decreasing the likelihood of unexpected outcomes.
Connections to Glasser and Powers
William Glasser
: In "Stations of the Mind," Glasser's exploration of mental processes emphasizes how perceptions must align with internal models of reality to ensure effective behavior and mental health. Learning, from Glasser���s perspective, helps in adjusting these perceptions so that they match more closely with reality, thus reducing psychological discomfort or surprise about the world.
William Powers
: In "Behavior: The Control of Perception," Powers discusses behavior as a means to control perception to match it with one's expectations. Learning, therefore, serves as a mechanism for refining these control systems, allowing for better management of the discrepancies between expected and perceived outcomes. This learning process continuously inoculates the system against future surprises by ensuring that perceptions are increasingly accurate.
Broader Implications
Inoculation Through Learning
: The metaphor of inoculation suggests that learning serves as a preventive measure, building up the system's defenses against potential future surprises. Just as vaccines prepare the immune system to fight infections by exposing it to a manageable form of the disease, learning exposes the mind to various scenarios and information, allowing it to build defenses against future cognitive dissonance and surprises.
Cognitive and Behavioral Adaptation
: This perspective implies that cognitive and behavioral adaptations through learning are crucial for maintaining homeostasis and ensuring survival. By continuously updating and refining internal models, organisms not only survive but thrive in changing environments.
In sum, defining learning as inoculation against surprise beautifully encapsulates the essence of adaptive behavior and cognitive processes as described by Friston, Glasser, and Powers. It highlights learning���s proactive role in equipping individuals with the necessary tools to predict and manage the uncertainties of their environment effectively. This definition not only aligns with but also enriches the understanding of how predictive processing and control theories explain human behavior and mental processes.

Could I get a narrative academic summary of the whole conversation, with a few jokes and sarcastic retorts?
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here���s a lighthearted, narrative-style academic summary of our intellectually invigorating (and occasionally whimsical) conversation:
The Quest for Understanding Everything from Jesus' Dining Habits to Why We're All Just Trying Not to Be Surprised
In the grand library of the universe, our conversation began with a somewhat esoteric dive into the cerebral lagoon of Mark Solms��� book "The Hidden Spring." Here, the elusive Free Energy Principle plays hard to get, but basically, it boils down to living systems' desperate attempts not to be caught off guard by life's curveballs���sort of like me when my phone battery dies in the middle of nowhere.
We then traveled back in time (not literally, I left my time machine in my other pants) to revisit Jesus and his twelve disciples. Apparently, these guys were the original Markov blanket, shielding Jesus from external chaos while organizing dinner and dealing with fan crowds���like the world���s first entourage, but with more walking on water and fewer luxury cars.
But wait, there���s a plot twist! A theory was floated suggesting Jesus might have pulled a Houdini by shaving his beard and slipping away unnoticed, presumably because even the Son of God needs a break from being a celebrity. His garment, possibly akin to Elijah���s mantle, turns out to be the VIP pass of biblical times, sparking divine levels of authority and potential confusion amongst his followers, like a divine game of "Where���s Waldo?"
We didn���t stop there. Our conversation ventured into Robert Hazen's lunar launch theory, bringing in tides, primordial soups, and the notion that clay might just be the unsung hero of early life, setting the stage for life's complex drama. It's like Earth was hosting the ultimate bake-off, and clay was the secret ingredient.
Linking back to our favorite carpenter, we pondered if Jesus' parable of the sower was less about farming tips and more an allegory for natural selection. Yes, ideas were the seeds, and society, the soil. Survival of the fittest idea, anyone? This sprouted a side discussion on memetics, where ideas spread like wildfire, or like cat videos on the internet.
As if this wasn���t enough to digest, we decided to see if Friston's Free Energy Principle had any academic ancestors. William Glasser and William Powers might not have talked about neurons and entropy, but they sure hinted at keeping one's mental house in order by anticipating life���s exams, essentially setting the groundwork for not being surprised���a common theme, because who likes spoilers?
Finally, learning was poetically dubbed as ���inoculation against surprise.��� It���s like life continually throws pop quizzes, and learning is our way to cheat by studying beforehand. Who knew preparation could be so revolutionary?
And thus, our intellectual odyssey wove through physics, theology, philosophy, and a bit of cheeky humor, proving once again that curiosity didn���t kill the cat; it just made it smarter and a tad snarky.

It was care (worry) that killed that cat anyways, as in planning too much about negative future scenarios
ChatGPT dijo:
ChatGPT
Indeed, that twist on the old adage brings us full circle to our discussions about predictive models and minimizing surprise. In a way, Friston's Free Energy Principle could be seen as a guide for not letting 'care'���or excessive worry about potential futures���overwhelm our mental processes. The principle encourages systems, whether biological or computational, to optimize their internal models in a way that prevents them from being blindsided by unexpected events. Thus, rather than fretting over every possible outcome (and potentially paralyzing the decision-making process), the system learns to anticipate and adapt efficiently.
It���s a neat reminder that while being prepared is great, obsessing over what could go wrong might just be the modern version of what really killed the proverbial cat. So in our quest to understand and adapt to the world, perhaps the best approach is a balanced one���staying alert but not alarmed, prepared but not paranoid. Just like the disciples, our internal and external Markov blankets need to filter out the unnecessary noise, allowing us to focus on what truly matters. And if all else fails, remember, at least we're not trying to escape a dinner party by shaving our beards and slipping into the night!
