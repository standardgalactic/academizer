Abstract 
We introduce meta-prompting, an ef f ective scaf f olding technique designed to enhance 
the functionality of language models (LMs). This approach transforms a single LM into a 
multi-faceted conductor, adept at managing and integrating multiple independent LM 
queries. By employing high-level instructions, meta-prompting guides the LM to break 
down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks. These subtasks are then 
handled by distinct ���expert��� instances of the same LM, each operating under specif i c, 
tailored instructions. Central to this process is the LM itself, in its role as the conductor, 
whichensuresseamlesscommunicationandef f ectiveintegrationoftheoutputsfromthese 
expert models. It additionally employs its inherent critical thinking and robust verif i cation 
processes to ref i ne and authenticate the end result. This collaborative prompting approach 
empowers a single LM to simultaneously act as a comprehensive orchestrator and a panel 
of diverse experts, signif i cantly enhancing its performance across a wide array of tasks. 
The zero-shot, task-agnostic nature of meta-prompting greatly simplif i es user interaction 
by obviating the need for detailed, task-specif i c instructions. Furthermore, our research 
demonstrates the seamless integration of external tools, such as a Python interpreter, into 
the meta-prompting framework, thereby broadening its applicability and utility. Through 
rigorous experimentation with GPT-4, we establish the superiority of meta-prompting 
over conventional scaf f olding methods: When averaged across all tasks, including the 
Game of 24, Checkmate-in-One, and Python Programming Puzzles, meta-prompting��� 
augmented with a Python interpreter functionality���surpasses standard prompting by 
17.1%, expert (dynamic) prompting by 17.3%, and multipersona prompting by 15.2%.1

The concept of "meta-prompting," as described, appears to be a novel method for enhancing the capabilities of language models like GPT-4. The essence of meta-prompting lies in its ability to transform a single language model into a versatile 'conductor' that can manage and integrate multiple independent queries or tasks. This is achieved through high-level instructions that guide the language model to divide complex tasks into simpler subtasks. Each subtask is then assigned to specialized instances of the same model, functioning under specific instructions.
The central element in this approach is the language model in its role as a conductor. It ensures smooth communication and effective integration of outputs from these expert models. Additionally, it applies its inherent capabilities for critical thinking and robust verification to refine and authenticate the final result. This collaborative prompting strategy allows a single language model to act both as an all-encompassing orchestrator and a panel of diverse experts, significantly boosting its effectiveness across various tasks.
A key advantage of meta-prompting is its zero-shot, task-agnostic nature, simplifying user interaction by reducing the need for detailed, task-specific instructions. The research also highlights the integration of external tools, like Python interpreters, into the meta-prompting framework, further extending its practicality and usefulness.
In terms of performance, the research demonstrates that meta-prompting, especially when combined with a Python interpreter, significantly outperforms traditional scaffolding methods. It surpasses standard prompting by 17.1%, expert (dynamic) prompting by 17.3%, and multipersona prompting by 15.2% across a range of tasks, including the Game of 24, Checkmate-in-One, and Python Programming Puzzles.
This approach opens up exciting possibilities for the future of language models, offering a more dynamic and integrated way to handle complex, multifaceted tasks.

1Introduction 
The latest generation of language models (LMs)���notably, GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), PaLM (Anil et al., 2023), 
and LLaMa (Touvron et al., 2023)���have expanded the boundaries of natural-language processing and 
generation. These large-scale models can tackle a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from writing Shake- 
spearean sonnets about hedgehogs to summarizing intricate medical reports and solving competition-level 
programming puzzles. Despite their versatility, these models are not infallible; they sometimes generate 
responses that are inaccurate, misleading, or conf l icting. As the operational costs of these models become 
more af f ordable, it becomes natural to ask whether one might use scaf f olding systems and leverage multiple 
LM queries to not only ref i ne but also to enhance the accuracy and robustness of these model outputs. 
In this work, we introduce a new technique for enhancing the functionality and performance of LMs, called 
meta-prompting. It involves constructing a high-level ���meta��� prompt that instructs an LM to: (i) break down 
complex tasks or problems into smaller, manageable pieces; (ii) assign these pieces to specialized ���expert��� 
models with proper and detailed natural-language instructions; (iii) oversee the communication between 
these expert models; and (iv) apply its own critical thinking, reasoning, and verif i cation skills throughout 
the process. When presented with a query, the LM, ef f ectively prompted under meta-prompting, serves 
as a conductor. It produces a message history���a narrative, if you will���comprising the responses from 
various expert models. The LM is originally responsible for generating the conductor���s portion of this history, 
which includes the selection of experts and the formulation of specif i c instructions for them. However, the 
same LM doubles itself as these independent experts as well, generating outputs based on the expertise and 
information chosen by the conductor for each particular query. 
This approach allows for a single, uniform LM to maintain a coherent line of reasoning while also tapping 
into a variety of expert roles. The use of dynamically selected contexts for prompting these experts introduces 
fresh perspectives into the process, while the conductor model retains a bird���s-eye view of the entire history 
and coordination. This method, therefore, enables a single black-box LM to function ef f ectively as both a 
central conductor and a diverse panel of experts to produce more accurate, reliable, and coherent responses. 
Our proposed meta-prompting technique combines and expands upon various prompting ideas introduced 
by recent studies���including, high-level planning and decision-making (Yao et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023; Hao 
et al., 2023a), dynamic persona assignment (Xu et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023), multi-agent debating (Du et al., 
2023; Zhuge et al., 2023), self-debugging and self-ref l ection (Schick et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2023a; Gou et al., 2023; 
Madaan et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023). A key aspect of meta-prompting is its task-agnostic nature. Unlike 
traditional scaf f olding methods that require specif i c instructions or examples tailored to each task, meta- 
prompting employs the same set of high-level instructions across various tasks and inputs. This universality 
is particularly benef i cial for users who might i nd it cumbersome to provide detailed examples or specif i c 
guidance for every distinct task. For instance, in responding to a one-of f request like ���Write a Shakespearean 
sonnet about self i es,��� the user would not need to supply examples of high-quality neoclassical poems. The 
meta-prompting approach elevates the utility of language models by of f ering a broad, l exible framework 
without compromising on specif i city or relevance. Additionally, to demonstrate the versatility and integration 
capabilities of meta-prompting, we have enhanced our system with the functionality to invoke a Python 
interpreter. This allows for an even more dynamic and comprehensive application of the technique, further 
extending its potential to address a wide array of tasks and queries ef f ectively. 
We provide an illustrative visualization of a meta-prompting session in Figure 2. It depicts how the Meta 
Model���our technical term for the central controlling LM (a.k.a. the conductor)���intersperses its own output 
with inputs and outputs from various specialized expert models or code executions. Such a conf i guration 
makes meta-prompting a nearly universal tool. It allows for the consolidation of various LM interactions and 
computations into a single, coherent narrative. What sets meta-prompting apart is that it leaves the decision 
of which prompts to use and which code snippets to execute to the discretion of the LM itself.

The introduction to this paper on "meta-prompting" presents a fascinating advancement in the field of language models (LMs) like GPT-4, PaLM, and LLaMa. These state-of-the-art models have already pushed the limits of natural language processing and generation, capable of performing a diverse array of tasks from creative writing to solving complex programming problems. However, the paper acknowledges the limitations of these models, such as producing inaccurate or misleading responses.
To address these challenges, the paper introduces "meta-prompting," a technique that significantly enhances the functionality and performance of LMs. This technique involves:
Breaking Down Complex Tasks
: The LM divides complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.
Assigning Tasks to Expert Models
: These pieces are assigned to "expert" models, each receiving specific, detailed instructions in natural language.
Overseeing Communication
: The LM oversees the interaction between these expert models.
Applying Critical Thinking and Verification
: Throughout the process, the LM employs its reasoning and verification abilities.
The LM under meta-prompting acts as a conductor, creating a narrative comprising responses from various expert models. It's responsible for generating both the conductor's portion of this narrative and the outputs of the independent expert models.
This method enables a single LM to maintain a coherent line of reasoning while accessing a variety of expert roles. By dynamically selecting contexts for these expert prompts, the system introduces new perspectives, while the conductor model retains an overarching view for coordination. This approach effectively allows a single, unified LM to function as both a central conductor and a diverse panel of experts, leading to more accurate, reliable, and coherent responses.
Meta-prompting combines various prompting techniques from recent studies, including high-level planning, dynamic persona assignment, multi-agent debating, and self-reflection. A significant advantage of this technique is its task-agnostic nature, removing the need for task-specific instructions or examples for each new task.
To further demonstrate the versatility and integration capabilities of meta-prompting, the system is enhanced with the functionality to invoke a Python interpreter. This integration allows for a broader and more comprehensive application of the technique.
An illustrative visualization (Figure 2 in the paper) shows how the Meta Model (the conductor) integrates its output with inputs and outputs from specialized expert models and code executions. This makes meta-prompting a nearly universal tool, consolidating various LM interactions and computations into a single, coherent narrative. A key feature of meta-prompting is that it leaves the decision of which prompts to use and which code snippets to execute to the discretion of the LM itself.

2Meta Prompting 
Intuition and Abstract Overview. The modus operandi of meta-prompting is to use a model2to coordinate 
and execute multiple independent inquiries and subsequently synthesize their responses to render a i nal 
response. This mechanism, in principle, endorses an ensemble approach, drawing from the strength and 
diversity of independent specialized models to collaboratively address and tackle multifaceted tasks or 
problems. We posit that while a single, general-purpose model might deliver valuable and useful insights 
into generic queries, combining the perspectives and conclusions of multiple domain-specif i c models (which 
we also refer to as experts) has the potential to yield more comprehensive, robust, and accurate solutions. 
2Our use of the term model refers to the application of an LM with certain prompt templates to play a specif i ed ���role.��� We typically 
only use a single LM (e.g., GPT-4) to implement all the models in an execution. 
3 
Centraltoourmeta-promptingstrategyisitsshallowhierarchicalconf i guration, whereasinglemodel���called 
the ���Meta Model������emerges as the principal entity of authority. This prompting structure is reminiscent of 
an orchestra, wherein the conductor���s role is mirrored by the Meta Model and each musician corresponds 
to a distinct domain-specif i c model. Just as a conductor harmonizes multiple musical elements to craft a 
beautiful melody, the Meta Model combines solutions and insights from a range of models to provide an 
accurate and comprehensive answer to an intricate problem or task. 
Conceptually, a domain-specif i c expert within our framework can take diverse forms, such as a i netuned LM 
tailored to perform a particular task, a specialized API equipped to handle specif i c domain-related inquiries, 
or even computational tools like calculators or a Python interpreter that can perform arithmetic calculations 
or write and execute code. These experts, despite their varying functionalities, are directed and unif i ed under 
the supervision of the Meta Model. 
Under our setup, experts can be called only by the Meta Model. They cannot directly interact or communicate 
with each other, though the Meta Model can choose to share some text from or combine the insights of 
various experts when interacting with a new expert. This restriction is made to simplify the communication 
between the experts and to put the Meta Model at the center of the operation. 
Notation and Terminology. Before we delve into the specif i c steps involved in meta-prompting, we establish 
some notation and terminology. We letSdenote the set of i nite strings, with���representing the empty string. 
We usex ��� Sto refer to a test-time query, which can be a task or a problem described in natural language. A 
crucial element of meta-prompting is the i xed language model, denoted asLM, which operates fromStoS. 
This model, like GPT-4, takes an input text (a prompt history that may include a list of previous messages, 
symbolized byH) and produces a corresponding output (i.e., response). We also introduce specif i c template 
functions:tinit,tmid,andtexp, each mapping fromStoS; each takes a string input and formats it according to a 
predef i ned template. Specif i cally,tinitandtmidare used to format text for the history given to the Meta Model, 
whiletexpwraps the output of the Meta Model in a prompt suitable for an expert model. Furthermore, we 
have two string extractors,eexpanderet, each mapping fromStoS. These extractors are designed to retrieve 
a substring that is enclosed within specif i c delimiters, returning the i rst matching segment in cases where 
multiple segments are present. The symbol���is used to represent string concatenation. Lastly, we introduce 
a specif i c string referred to as error ��� S, which is designed to denote an error message in the process. 
Algorithmic Procedure. Algorithm 1 provides pseudocode of our proposed meta-prompting approach. We 
further provide a conceptual overview of the procedure below:

2. Loop Iteration: 4 
(a)Prompting the Meta Model: The current message list, namelyHt, guides the Meta Model���s next 
action���either directly addressing the query or consulting a domain-specif i c expert. 
(b)Engaging Domain-Specif i c Expert Models: If the Meta Model does not return a result, it can 
conjure any expert and give it instructions, which are extracted from its output usingeexp. This 
process is isolated though: Each expert only sees what the Meta Model chooses to share with 
them, and responds accordingly. For instance, if a problem pertains to mathematics and history, 
the Meta Model might consult a mathematics expert for a calculation and a history expert for 
historical context. The output of the expert is extracted and additional instructions are appended, 
all using the tmid template.

(c)Returning the Final Response: If the Meta Model���s response contains a i nal answer (highlighted 
by distinct special markers), the solution is extracted using eretand returned. 
(d)Error Handling: In cases where the model responseytcontains neither a i nal answer nor a call 
to an expert model, an error message appended to the message listHt. This ensures that our 
procedure is robust and can handle unexpected outputs. 
Meta and Expert Model Specif i cations. In our setup, we employ the same LM, such as GPT-4, to function in 
both Meta and Expert capacities. Their roles are distinguished by their respective model instructions in their 
prompts, with the Meta Model adhering to a set of instructions provided in Figure 3, and the expert models 
following separate instructions dynamically determined by the Meta Model at inference time .

The section titled "Meta Prompting" provides a detailed overview of the concept and operational framework of meta-prompting, a technique aimed at enhancing the functionality of language models (LMs). Here are the key points from this section:
Intuition and Abstract Overview
: Meta-prompting leverages the strength of ensemble approaches by coordinating multiple independent inquiries (or expert models) and synthesizing their responses to generate a final response. This approach is based on the idea that a combination of perspectives from domain-specific models can yield more comprehensive and accurate solutions than a single, general-purpose model.
Role of the Meta Model
: The Meta Model acts like a conductor in an orchestra, orchestrating the output of various domain-specific models. These domain-specific models or experts can range from fine-tuned LMs to specialized APIs or computational tools like calculators or Python interpreters.
Communication and Coordination
: Experts are only called upon by the Meta Model and do not interact directly with each other. The Meta Model can share or combine insights from various experts when interacting with a new one.
Notation and Terminology
: The paper establishes specific notation and terminology for understanding meta-prompting. Key elements include the Meta Model (LM), string extractors (eexp and eret), and specific template functions (tinit, tmid, texp).
Algorithmic Procedure
: The paper presents a pseudocode (Algorithm 1) to describe the meta-prompting process, which includes transforming the input, looping iterations for prompting the Meta Model, engaging domain-specific experts, returning the final response, and error handling.
Meta and Expert Model Specifications
: The same LM (like GPT-4) functions in both Meta and Expert capacities, distinguished by the specific instructions in their prompts. The Meta Model follows a set of instructions, while expert models have separate instructions dynamically determined by the Meta Model.
From these points, we can derive that meta-prompting is a sophisticated method for enhancing the capabilities of LMs by effectively combining the strengths of various specialized models or tools under the coordination of a central Meta Model. This approach allows for tackling complex tasks more comprehensively and accurately, as it draws on the expertise of multiple domain-specific entities. The use of a single LM to embody both the Meta and Expert roles simplifies the implementation while maintaining the versatility and depth of the approach.

This section seeks to contextualize our proposed meta-prompting approach amidst recent advancements 
in prompting strategies and scaf f olding techniques. We provide a brief overview of these developments, 
highlighting their relevance and connections to our work. 
Enhancing Reasoning in Language Models through Prompting. Recent ef f orts in LM scaf f olding and 
prompting methods have signif i cantly boosted the arithmetic and commonsense reasoning capabilities of 
LMs. The chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2022b) and its variants���including least-to-most 
(Zhou et al., 2023), zero-shot CoT (Kojima et al., 2022), self-ask (Press et al., 2022), ask-me-anything (Arora 
et al., 2023), decomposed prompting (Khot et al., 2023), and auto-CoT (Zhang et al., 2023d)���have marked a 
paradigm shift in how LMs process complex queries. These methods encourage LMs to adopt human-like, 
sequential thinking processes, breaking down intricate questions into simpler subtasks and systematically 
solving them before presenting a i nal answer. Multiple studies (Wei et al., 2022a; Madaan and Yazdanbakhsh, 
2022; Shi et al., 2023; Drozdov et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023b; Suzgun et al., 2023b, inter alia) have shown the 
ef i cacy of these prompting methods across a broad set of tasks and benchmarks. More recent innovations 
such Tree-of-Thought (Yao et al., 2023a), Graph-of-Thought (Besta et al., 2023), Program-of-Thought (Chen 
et al., 2023d), and Skeleton-of-Thought (Ning et al., 2023), have further enriched this domain; these explore 
dynamic, non-linear reasoning pathways, broadening the computational and heuristic capabilities of LMs. 
However, they come with increased resource demands and greater time complexity, require multiple manual 
prompt crafting, and are often specialized for particular types of tasks. 
Iterative Self-Feedback and Ref i nement Mechanisms. Recent instruction-following techniques and data- 
collection ef f orts have expanded the capabilities of LMs to follow instructions, emulate certain aspects of 
human behavior, and assist in tasks such as annotation and evaluation (Haluptzok et al., 2022; Aher et al., 
13 
2023). LMs such as GPT-4, PaLM, and Llama are now capable of ef f ectively integrating self-feedback and 
ref i nement mechanisms through prompting and can leverage their own natural-language outputs to guide 
their behaviour and improve decision-making. SayCan (Ahn et al., 2022) and Inner Monologue (Huang 
et al., 2023) are early examples showcasing the benef i ts of inner dialogues in a closed-loop system for robotic 
control and action planning. Ref l exion (Shinn et al., 2023) builds upon these studies and focuses on natural- 
language generation and reasoning tasks. It functions as a policy optimization mechanism through natural 
language feedback, using self-feedback and self-ref l ection to inf l uence and correct behaviors in LMs, and 
has shown considerable success in preliminary experiments. In a more innovative vein, the Self-Taught 
Reasoner approach (STaR; Zelikman et al., 2022) iteratively trains an LM on its own outputs to ref i ne initial 
rationales for more accurate solutions, leading to enhanced reasoning skills. Other notable methods such as 
Critic (Gou et al., 2023), Iterative Ref i nement (Chen et al., 2023b), RCI (Kim et al., 2023), Re3(Yang et al., 
2022), Ref i ner (Paul et al., 2023), Self-Critique (Saunders et al., 2022), Self-Correction (Welleck et al., 2023), 
Self-Eval, Self-Debug (Chen et al., 2023c), Self-Edit (Zhang et al., 2023a), Self-Evolve (Jiang et al., 2023b), 
Self-Taught Optimizer (SToP; Zelikman et al., 2023), and so forth, illustrate how verbal feedback, both internal 
and external, can signif i cantly improve the accuracy, quality, and robustness of model outputs across various 
tasks and setups. 
Exploring Role-Playing in Language Models. The integration of role-playing and self-collaboration concepts 
intoLMs, groundedincognitivepsychologyanddevelopmentaleducationprinciples, hasemergedasauseful 
method for augmenting LMs��� problem-solving capabilities and optimizing their internal domain-specif i c 
knowledge and expertise. Recent studies (Park et al., 2022, 2023; Li et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023a; 
Deshpande et al., 2023) have shown that endowing instruction-following LMs with ���expert��� personas or 
roles enhances the quality and accuracy of their output. In particular, approaches like CAMEL (Li et al., 2023) 
and Expert Prompting (Xu et al., 2023), which involve dynamically assigning personas to a single LM, have 
been shown to yield higher quality and more reliable responses than models without designated personas. 
Further investigations (Chen et al., 2023a,e; Du et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023b; Liang et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023b; 
Jiang et al., 2023a; Xiong et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023c) demonstrate that assigning multiple expert identities 
or roles to a single LM, tailored to specif i c tasks or problems, and prompting it to conduct multi-round 
internal dialogues���similar to a team of experts discussing and ref i ning ideas���amplif i es the reliability and 
comprehensiveness of the LM���s analysis; this leads to more well-rounded and thorough solutions. These 
studies advocate a complementary approach wherein multiple instances of an LM propose, debate, and ref i ne 
their individual responses and reasoning in successive rounds, culminating in a unif i ed i nal answer. This 
role-playing concept has shown to signif i cantly improve mathematical and strategic reasoning across various 
tasks. Moreover, it improves the factual accuracy of the generated content, thereby reducing erroneous or 
fabricated responses. 
Autonomous Decision-Making and Execution in Multi-Agent LM Systems. There has been a growing 
interest in using LMs for autonomous decision-making and task execution. Open-source projects like Auto- 
GPT, Agent-GPT, Baby-AGI, and LangChain are notable ef f orts developing agent protocols that are capable 
of planning, decision-making, and executing tasks end-to-end, with minimal or no human intervention. 
These systems highlight the potential and risks of LMs, which go beyond performing predef i ned tasks to 
adapting, learning, and autonomously executing decisions in real time. As discussed by Masa (2023), those 
autonomous models might be exploited by individuals with malicious intents and pose threats to humanity. 
There is also the dilemma of accountability: who bears responsibility when an LM-driven autonomous agent 
produces an inappropriate or criminal action? Ensuring safety and security with these agents is crucial, given 
its potential for mishaps or exploitation by malicious actors, and its vulnerability to cyber-attacks. 
Integration of External Tools and APIs into Language Models. As LMs continue to evolve, the integration 
of external tools is becoming increasingly important. This tool-use integration, often achieved through 
in-context learning (e.g., Cai et al., 2023) or i netuning (e.g., Schick et al., 2023a), allows LMs to ef f ectively 
engage with real-world scenarios and tackle a diverse range of dynamic tasks. Recent advancements (Cai 
et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2023; Gou et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023c; Khattab et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2023; Qiao 
et al., 2023; Paranjape et al., 2023; Patil et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023a; Yang et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023) 
have enabled LMs to perform accurate calculations, retrieve up-to-date information from search engines 
or databases, and interact with APIs, making them crucial for complex, multimodal real-world problems.

Can you explain the algorithm discussed earlier?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! The algorithm discussed in the paper for the meta-prompting approach is designed to enhance the functionality of language models (LMs). Here's a breakdown of the key steps and concepts:
Input Preparation (Transformation of the Input)
:
The algorithm begins with an input query
x
and an initial setup, including an error string
error
and a number of iterations
T
.
The input
x
is first transformed using a function
tinit
to format it into a suitable template. This formatted input, now
H1
, serves as the initial instruction to the Meta Model.
Loop Iteration
:
The algorithm runs for a specified number of iterations
T
.
Each iteration consists of prompting the Meta Model with the current message list
Ht
.
Prompting the Meta Model
:
The Meta Model analyzes the current message list
Ht
and decides on the next action. This could be directly addressing the query or consulting a domain-specific expert.
Engaging Domain-Specific Expert Models
:
If the Meta Model does not return a final result, it can instruct a domain-specific expert model to handle a part of the task.
The instructions for the expert model are extracted from the Meta Model's output using a function
eexp
.
The expert model, prompted with these instructions, generates a response
zt
.
The output
zt
is then added to the message history
Ht
using a template function
tmid
, resulting in the updated message list
Ht+1
.
Returning the Final Response
:
If the Meta Model���s response contains a final answer (indicated by special markers), this solution is extracted using a function
eret
and returned.
Error Handling
:
If the Meta Model's response contains neither a final answer nor a call to an expert model, an error message is appended to the message list
Ht
. This ensures robustness in handling unexpected outputs.
Meta and Expert Model Specifications
:
Both the Meta Model and the expert models are instances of the same LM (e.g., GPT-4) but are distinguished by their specific instructions in their prompts.
The Meta Model follows a set of general instructions for overall task management, while expert models receive specific, tailored instructions dynamically determined by the Meta Model.
In essence, the algorithm effectively uses a single LM in multiple roles: as a central conductor (Meta Model) that manages the overall process and as domain-specific experts that handle specific aspects of a task. This multi-faceted approach allows for complex task decomposition, specialized handling of subtasks, and integration of diverse outputs, enhancing the LM's overall performance and capabilities.
You
Can you give some metaphors and analogies to help explain it?
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Certainly! Using metaphors and analogies can be a great way to understand the concept of meta-prompting and its algorithm. Here are a few:
Orchestra and Conductor
:
Think of the meta-prompting system as an orchestra. The Meta Model is the conductor, and the expert models are the musicians. Each musician (expert model) specializes in a different instrument (specific task or domain). The conductor (Meta Model) doesn't play an instrument but coordinates all the musicians, ensuring they play in harmony and contribute to the overall performance (the final task solution). The conductor decides when each musician should play and how their contributions fit into the larger piece.
Construction Manager and Specialists
:
Imagine a construction project. The Meta Model is like the construction manager, overseeing the entire project. The expert models are various specialists (electricians, plumbers, architects). The construction manager doesn't do the specialist work but knows what needs to be done and when. They direct the specialists to specific tasks based on their expertise, ensuring all parts of the project come together seamlessly to build the structure (complete the task).
Head Chef in a Kitchen
:
The Meta Model is like a head chef in a restaurant kitchen, and the expert models are the sous-chefs and line cooks, each skilled in preparing certain types of dishes. The head chef doesn't cook every dish but oversees the kitchen, deciding which cook should prepare each component of the meal and how to combine these components to create the final dish that is served to the customer.
Movie Director and Crew
:
Consider the Meta Model as a movie director and the expert models as the film crew (camera operators, sound technicians, editors). The director doesn't operate the cameras or edit the footage but guides the crew, deciding what each member should do to contribute to the final movie. The director's vision and coordination bring together the crew's individual contributions into a cohesive film.
Team Coach and Players
:
The Meta Model is like a coach of a sports team, and the expert models are the players. Each player has a specific role and skill set (defense, offense, goalkeeping). The coach doesn't play the game but decides the strategy, positions the players, and makes substitutions, orchestrating the team's efforts to win the match.
These metaphors illustrate the central idea of meta-prompting: a single entity (Meta Model) coordinates and integrates the efforts of various specialized entities (expert models) to achieve a complex, multifaceted goal.

Abstract 
This paper presents a comprehensive study of Meta Prompting, an innovative technique reshaping 
the utilization of large language models (LLMs), multi-modal foundation models, and AI systems 
in problem-solving and data interpretation. Grounded in type theory and category theory, Meta 
Prompting emphasizes the structure and syntax of information over traditional content-centric 
methods. The paper explores the formal def i nitions of Meta Prompting (MP), sets it apart from 
Few-Shot Prompting, and underlines its ef f ectiveness in various AI applications. A key focus is on 
extending Meta Prompting to complex reasoning tasks, showing how it ef f ectively deconstructs 
intricate problems into simpler sub-problems, enhancing token ef i ciency and enabling more 
equitable problem-solving comparisons, especially against few-shot example methods. Additionally, 
the paper introduces Meta Prompting for Prompting Tasks, allowing LLMs to self-generate new 
promptsinaniterative, metaprogramming-likemanner. Thisinnovativeapproachmarksasignif i cant 
leap in AI���s autonomous and adaptive capabilities. The paper also pioneers the integration of Meta 
Prompting into multi-modal foundation model settings, tackling the challenges and opportunities 
of incorporating varied data types such as images, audio, and video within the structured Meta 
Prompting framework���. 
1Introduction 
The emergence of foundation models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), has revolutionized the 
i eld of artif i cial intelligence. These models, exemplif i ed by their extensive training data and capacity for 
generalization, have dramatically expanded the horizons of computational linguistics, text understanding, 
and problem-solving [2,5,25���28]. However, a critical challenge faced by LLMs is their limited ef i cacy in 
executing complex reasoning tasks, particularly in areas requiring deep, abstract thought such as advanced 
mathematics [18]. This limitation points towards a need for enhanced methodologies that can augment LLMs��� 
reasoning faculties. 
The root of this challenge lies in the fundamental architecture of LLMs, which is predominantly oriented 
towards auto-regressive token prediction. While ef i cient for a broad spectrum of tasks, this approach lacks 
the necessary framework to support the depth and sophistication of human-like analytical thinking. This 
discrepancy is highlighted by the dual-process theory of cognitive psychology, articulated by Kahneman 
[15], which dif f erentiates the fast, intuitive responses of System 1 thinking from the slower, more deliberate 
reasoning of System 2 thinking. LLMs, in their typical operations, mirror System 1 processes and thus encounter dif i culties with tasks that require the more deliberate, structured approach characteristic of System 
2 thinking. 
Attempts to bridge this gap have led to the development of innovative methodologies such as Chain-of-Thought 
(CoT) [33], Tree-of-Thought (ToT) [21,38], and Cumulative Reasoning [40], which guide LLMs in articulating 
intermediate steps in reasoning tasks. These methods, although valuable, have not fully realized the depth and 
l exibility of human cognitive processes in an abstract sense. 
In response to these challenges, we introduce the theoretical framework of Meta Prompting (MP), a novel 
approach that represents a signif i cant advance in the i eld of LLM reasoning. Meta Prompting extends beyond 
existing methods by abstracting and generalizing key principles for enhanced cognitive processing. Unlike its 
predecessors, Meta Prompting shifts the focus from content-driven reasoning to a more structure-oriented 
perspective. This method draws inspiration from category theory and type theory, establishing a functorial 
relationship between tasks and their corresponding prompts. This categorical approach allows for a more 
systematic and adaptable framework, capable of addressing a wide range of cognitive tasks with the depth and 
nuance akin to human reasoning. 
Furthermore, a pivotal aspect of Meta Prompting is its application to Meta Prompting for Prompting Tasks 
(MP-PT) in an in-context and iterative way utilizing the functorial and compositional properties of Meta 
Prompting. This concept, akin to metaprogramming in programming language theory, involves using LLMs 
to design new prompts autonomously. The functorial nature of Meta Prompting allows for this advanced 
capability, where LLMs can not only solve problems but also generate the structures to solve them. This 
self-referential and recursive ability marks a signif i cant leap in LLMs��� autonomy and adaptability. 
Meta Prompting, in its essence, prioritizes the format and pattern of problems and solutions, moving away 
from the specif i cs of content. This shift enables LLMs to overcome their inherent limitations, facilitating 
a more sophisticated and adaptable reasoning capability. The methodology is designed to enhance LLMs��� 
performance in complex problem-solving scenarios, emphasizing a structured and systematic approach to 
cognitive tasks. 
In this paper, we will explore the principles and applications of Meta Prompting, illustrating how it leverages 
categorical and functorial concepts to transform the capabilities of LLMs. Our aim is to demonstrate how Meta 
Prompting stands as a groundbreaking development in AI, setting a new course for the evolution of intelligent, 
adaptable, and human-like reasoning systems in foundation models.

Reasoning with AI systems. Historically, ef f orts in enhancing AI reasoning have centered on augmenting 
neural networks with the ability to generate intermediate steps, a paradigm widely acknowledged for boosting 
reasoning across diverse domains [11,34,35,37,39,42]. These studies, while signif i cant, often relied on 
content-focused enhancements. In contrast, our approach, Meta Prompting, diverges by emphasizing the 
structure and format of reasoning processes, representing a paradigm shift from content to form. 
Symbolic systems such as code environments and knowledge graphs ([1, 3, 3, 6, 8���10, 14, 16, 19, 23, 24, 30, 
31,36]) have also been explored for reasoning enhancement. However, these approaches, while innovative, do 
not leverage the abstract categorical mappings central to Meta Prompting. 
Chain-of-Thought Prompting and Its Evolution.Chain-of-thought reasoning proposed by Wei et al. 
[33]marked a signif i cant advance, underscoring multi-step reasoning paths. This development, although 
19 
groundbreaking, did not fully explore the syntactical and structural dimensions of reasoning that Meta 
Prompting captures. Following works, including Wang et al.[32]���s self-consistency strategy and Zhou et al. 
[42]���s complexity handling, introduced sophisticated decoding and problem-tackling strategies but remained 
within the scope of content-based reasoning enhancement. 
The approaches by Li et al.[17], Yao et al.[38], Zheng et al.[41], and Feng et al.[7]exhibit a gradual shift 
towards more intricate reasoning strategies, yet they fall short of adopting the categorical and functorial 
perspectives integral to Meta Prompting. Zhang et al.[40]���s Cumulative Reasoning, while innovative in its use 
of multiple AI agents, does not focus on the structural and syntactical aspects that are the cornerstone of our 
method. 
Prompt Programming and Metaprompt.The concept of prompt programming and metaprompt, as 
proposed by Reynolds & McDonell[29], marks a signif i cant step towards system instruction via natural 
language, an approach that aligns with the foundation of Meta Prompting. However, their focus on un-typed 
natural language contrasts with our emphasis on typed language (including natural, programming, visual, and 
multi-modal languages) and structured syntax-oriented prompts, which bridges the gap between natural and 
programming languages and make language models can interact with peripheral computation and physical 
environment seamlessly. MetaPrompting by Hou et al.[13]leverage model-agnostic meta-learning for prompt 
initialization and learning better prompts. However, it does not fully explore the potential of a functorial 
relationship between problems and prompts, especially the endo-functorial and monadic part (iterative and 
self-referential), an exploration at the heart of our work that may pave the way towards AI systems beyond 
human beings, or in short, AGI systems. 
In summary, while previous works have signif i cantly advanced the i eld of reasoning with AI, our approach, 
Meta Prompting, introduces a novel perspective that emphasizes the structural and syntactical aspects of 
problem-solving. By adopting a categorical and functorial approach, Meta Prompting transcends the limitations 
of content-focused enhancements, of f ering a more versatile and systematic methodology for enhancing AI 
reasoning.

ABSTRACT 
Remarkable progress has been made on automated problem solving through so- 
cieties of agents based on large language models (LLMs). Existing LLM-based 
multi-agent systems can already solve simple dialogue tasks. Solutions to more 
complex tasks, however, are complicated through logic inconsistencies due to 
cascading hallucinations caused by naively chaining LLMs. Here we introduce 
MetaGPT, an innovative meta-programming framework incorporating eff i cient 
human workf l ows into LLM-based multi-agent collaborations.MetaGPT en- 
codes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompt sequences for more 
streamlined workf l ows, thus allowing agents with human-like domain expertise 
to verify intermediate results and reduce errors. MetaGPT utilizes an assembly 
line paradigm to assign diverse roles to various agents, eff i ciently breaking down 
complex tasks into subtasks involving many agents working together. On col- 
laborative software engineering benchmarks, MetaGPT generates more coherent 
solutions than previous chat-based multi-agent systems. Our project can be found

1INTRODUCTION 
Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities to en- 
hance and replicate human workf l ows. In real-world applications, however, existing systems (Park 
et al., 2023; Zhuge et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023c; Li et al., 2023; Du et al., 2023; 
Liang et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023) tend to oversimplify the complexities. They struggle to achieve 
effective, coherent, and accurate problem-solving processes, particularly when there is a need for 
meaningful collaborative interaction (Zhang et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Qian 
et al., 2023). 
Through extensive collaborative practice, humans have developed widely accepted Standardized 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) across various domains (Belbin, 2012; Manifesto, 2001; DeMarco & 
Lister, 2013). These SOPs play a critical role in supporting task decomposition and effective coor- 
dination. Furthermore, SOPs outline the responsibilities of each team member, while establishing 
standards for intermediate outputs. Well-def i ned SOPs improve the consistent and accurate exe- 
cution of tasks that align with def i ned roles and quality standards (Belbin, 2012; Manifesto, 2001; 
DeMarco & Lister, 2013; Wooldridge & Jennings, 1998). For instance, in a software company, 
Product Managers analyze competition and user needs to create Product Requirements Documents 
(PRDs) using a standardized structure, to guide the developmental process. 
Inspired by such ideas, we design a promising GPT-based Meta-Programming framework called 
MetaGPT that signif i cantly benef i ts from SOPs. Unlike other works (Li et al., 2023; Qian et al., 
2023), MetaGPT requires agents to generate structured outputs, such as high-quality requirements

their handovers must comply with certain established standards. This reduces the risk of hallucina- 
tions caused by idle chatter between LLMs, particularly in role-playing frameworks, like: ���Hi, hello
