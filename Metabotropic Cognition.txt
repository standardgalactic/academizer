Adaptive control systems and self-organization dynamics play important roles in the emergence of order in biological systems:

- Adaptive control systems operate via nested feedback loops that allow coordination across different scales (e.g. cells, organs, organism). Higher levels impose constraints/goals that lower levels must achieve.

- This hierarchical structure enables complex multicellular bodies to maintain homeostasis and functional integrity despite continual changes internally and in their environments.

- Self-organization relies on local interactions between components that are sensitive/responsive to each other and their surroundings. 

- Through distributed feedback without centralized control, patterns spontaneously emerge across populations of interacting agents. 

- Examples include flocks, swarms, neural networks, the immune system - their coordinated group behaviors are an emergent property.

- In biological systems, self-organized dynamics like gene regulation networks, metabolic pathways, embryonic development produce highly ordered forms and functions.

- Selective pressures shaped evolutionary adaptations that harness self-organization and feedback to structures bodies/brains for robust functioning.

- This allows emergent order on larger scales while retaining flexibility/adaptability on smaller scales through decentralized control.

So in summary, adaptive control systems and self-organization combine to produce the hierarchical multi-scale order we see in living things, balancing stability/coordination with adaptability/complexity. Their local rules successfully "compile" into coherent global phenomena.

See if you can explain practopoeisis.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Practopoiesis is a theory about how adaptive systems, especially biological brains, organize their operations across multiple levels to generate intelligent behavior. The term "practopoiesis" is derived from "praxis" (doing, acting) and "poiesis" (creation, production), which reflects the theory's focus on action-oriented knowledge creation.
Here's a concise overview:
Multi-Level Organization
: Practopoiesis posits that intelligent systems operate across multiple nested levels, where each level provides guidelines or constraints for the level below it.
Tries (Levels)
: The theory typically describes three operational levels, known as "tries":
T1 (Anapoietic Try)
: This is the lowest level and is responsible for basic operations, like neuronal activations in the brain. It deals with immediate and specific sensory inputs and motor outputs.
T2 (Adapto-poietic Try)
: This level adjusts the operations of T1 based on learning from experience. In the context of the brain, this could be seen as synaptic plasticity.
T3 (Practopoietic Try)
: The highest level, it modifies the learning mechanisms of T2 based on overarching goals or strategies. It's akin to metacognition or thinking about one's thinking and learning patterns.
Adaptive Feedback
: The higher levels provide feedback to the lower levels, ensuring that the system is always tuned to its environment and can swiftly adjust to changes.
Action-Oriented
: Practopoiesis emphasizes that knowledge and understanding are deeply tied to action. Systems don't just passively receive information; they actively engage with and shape their environment.
Implications for AI
: The theory suggests that truly intelligent artificial systems would need to have similar multi-level, feedback-driven architectures that are geared towards action in the real world.
In essence, practopoiesis provides a framework for understanding how complex adaptive systems, like the brain, achieve flexible, intelligent behavior through layered operations and constant feedback across these layers.

1 / 1
Here are some key points about practopoiesis in Danko Nikoli��'s work:

- Practopoiesis refers to the generation of practice or patterns of viable sensory-motor coordination through an autonomous agent's adaptive coupling with its environment.

- It is seen as a precursor to more advanced forms of cognition like representation and symbolic thought. Even basic living cells exhibit a rudimentary form of practopoiesis to uptake nutrients and maintain homeostasis.

- For Nikoli��, practice or patterns of interaction are primary to theory or internal representation. An autonomous entity first structures its operational coupling with the world and only secondarily builds representations, if at all.

- Practices are genuinely productive - they shape the ontology of an autonomous system by defining its operational coherences and viable ways of engaging with its niche. 

- Through practopoiesis, cognitive boundaries and structural identity emerge for an agent as it enacts circular processes that selectively integrate some aspects of the environment within itself.

- Successful practices are retained and expanded in a process of qualitative novelty, leading to increasing homeostasis and adaptability over time through circularly-produced phenotypic changes.

- For Nikoli��, practopoiesis highlights the fundamentally practical, precognitive roots of experiential domains and structural couplings that make both biological and engineered cognition possible.

- It serves as a framework for understanding the dynamics of autonomous self-generation through adaptive interaction, prior to more complex cognitive capabilities.

About me
Danko Nikoli��
Getting the kick out of practopoiesis.
The main motive for my studies is the explanatory gap between the brain and the mind. My interest is in how the physical world of neuronal activity produces the mental world of perception and cognition. I spent many years at the Max-Planck Institute for Brain Research, and I am currently associated with Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, and the University of Zagreb.

I approach the problem of explanatory gap from both sides, bottom-up and top-down. The bottom-up approach investigates brain physiology. The top-down approach investigates the behavior and experiences. Each of the two approaches led me to develop a theory: The work on behavior and experiences led me to discover the phenomenon of ideasthesia (meaning "sensing concepts"). The work on physiology resulted in the theory of practopoiesis (meaning "creation of actions").

The empirical work in the background of those theories involved simultaneous recordings of activity of 100+ neurons in the visual cortex (extracellular recordings), behavioral and imaging studies in visual cognition (attention, working memory, long-term memory), and empirical investigations of phenomenal experiences (synesthesia).

The ultimate goal of my studies is twofold. First, I would like to achieve conceptual understanding of how the dynamics of physical processes creates the mental ones. I believe that the work on practopoiesis presents an important step in this direction and that it will help us eventually address the hard problem of consciousness and the mind-body problem in general. Second, I would like to use this theoretical knowledge to create artificial systems that are biologically-like intelligent and adaptive (see AI-Kindergarten).

I think that this paper could turn out to be my most important contribution to neuroscience so far. Finers crossed that the proposed hypothesis turns out correct.

A reason why one would be interested in studying the brain in the first place is described here: Why brain?

: Nikoli��'s focus on bridging the explanatory gap between the brain and the mind is akin to the active inference framework and the enactive approach to cognition. Both emphasize the embodied nature of cognition and the importance of an agent's active engagement with its environment.
Bottom-up and Top-down Approaches
: The dual strategy Nikoli�� employs - investigating both brain physiology (bottom-up) and behavior/experiences (top-down) - reflects the comprehensive nature of studying cognitive systems. It mirrors how both internal structural constraints and external environmental interactions shape cognition.
Ideasthesia and Practopoiesis
: While ideasthesia highlights the concept of "sensing concepts" (which can be related to the emergence of symbolic meaning in the enactive approach to language/communication), practopoiesis underscores the creation of actions. This aligns with the active inference framework, where agents actively sample their world to match top-level predictions.
Empirical Work
: Nikoli��'s empirical work, particularly the simultaneous recording of neuron activity, complements the idea of adaptive control systems and self-organization. The coordinated responses and emergent behaviors in neural networks resonate with the self-organized dynamics we discussed earlier.
AI-Kindergarten
: Nikoli��'s goal to use theoretical knowledge to design biologically-like intelligent and adaptive systems is directly connected to the previous discussions on cognitive robotics and machine autonomy. His approach suggests a more holistic and biologically-inspired path for AI development.
Neuroscience Contribution
: The paper Nikoli�� references, which he believes could be a significant contribution, likely resonates with the themes of emergence, embodiment, mutual constitution, and structural influences on autonomy/intelligence.
"Why brain?"
: This question encapsulates the overarching connection between all topics. It emphasizes the interdisciplinary effort required to understand the brain, bridging biology, cognition, history, structure, and potentially AI.
In conclusion, Danko Nikoli��'s work offers a multifaceted approach to understanding cognition, blending empirical studies with theoretical advancements, all aimed at bridging the deep mysteries of the brain and the mind. His goals and methods align seamlessly with the various topics we've explored.

Ideasthesia (alternative spelling ideaesthesia) is a neuropsychological phenomenon in which activations of concepts (inducers) evoke perception-like sensory experiences (concurrents). The name comes from the Ancient Greek ��������� (id��a) and ����������������� (a��sth��sis), meaning 'sensing concepts' or 'sensing ideas'. The notion was introduced by neuroscientist Danko Nikoli�� as an alternative explanation for a set of phenomena traditionally covered by synesthesia.[1]


Example of associations between graphemes and colors that are described more accurately as ideasthesia than as synesthesia
While synesthesia meaning 'union of senses' implies the association of two sensory elements with little connection to the cognitive level, empirical evidence indicated that most phenomena linked to synesthesia are in fact induced by semantic representations. That is, the linguistic meaning of the stimulus is what is important rather than its sensory properties. In other words, while synesthesia presumes that both the trigger (inducer) and the resulting experience (concurrent) are of sensory nature, ideasthesia presumes that only the resulting experience is of sensory nature while the trigger is semantic.[2][3][4][5][6][7]

Research has later extended the concept to topics other than synesthesia, and since it turned out to be applicable to everyday perception, the concept has developed into a theory of how we perceive. For example ideasthesia has been applied to the theory of art and could bear important implications in explaining human conscious experience, which, according to ideasthesia, is grounded in how we activate concepts.[8]

ChatGPT
Danko Nikoli��'s concept of ideasthesia offers an alternative perspective to traditional understanding of synesthesia, extending the scope of how we consider the interplay between concepts and sensory experiences. To relate ideasthesia back to the previously discussed topics:
Cognition and Perception
: At the heart of ideasthesia is a refined understanding of cognition. Unlike synesthesia, which focuses on a direct sensory-to-sensory correspondence, ideasthesia emphasizes the primacy of cognitive or conceptual associations in eliciting sensory experiences. This complements the active inference and enactive approach to cognition, where meaning, perception, and action are tightly interwoven.
Embodied and Enactive Approaches
: The idea that sensory experiences can be evoked by conceptual activations aligns with the enactive approach's emphasis on the importance of embodied interaction with the environment and the derived meanings from such interactions.
Structural Constraints and Decision-Making
: In ideasthesia, the semantic representation or meaning of a stimulus takes precedence over its sensory properties. This can be likened to how structural constraints shape decision-making processes, where the underlying meaning or significance of information, rather than just its superficial presentation, influences choices.
Language and Communication
: Ideasthesia underlines how words and concepts have perceptual effects, tying into the enactive approach's perspective on language. Words derive significance not just from internal representations but from their role in shaping sensory experiences and engagements with the environment.
Art, Consciousness, and Perception
: The application of ideasthesia to art theory and human conscious experience speaks to the broader implications of the concept. Art often blurs the lines between sensory experience and meaning, and ideasthesia provides a framework for understanding how conceptual activations play into our aesthetic and conscious experiences.
Adaptive Control Systems and Self-Organization
: Ideasthesia could be seen as a manifestation of the brain's adaptive control systems. The brain organizes sensory experiences based on conceptual frameworks, underscoring the self-organized dynamics of cognition.
Artificial Intelligence
: When thinking about the implications for AI, ideasthesia offers insights into how machines might one day process sensory data not just in isolation but in the context of a broader semantic understanding.
In summary, ideasthesia provides a nuanced perspective on the interplay between cognition and perception, reinforcing the themes of embodied interaction, meaning-making, and the deep entanglement of the conceptual and the sensory.

That was from wikipedia but it might be from his work

Ideasthesia is congruent with the theory of brain functioning known as practopoiesis.[34] According to that theory, concepts are not an emergent property of highly developed, specialized neuronal networks in the brain, as is usually assumed; rather, concepts are proposed to be fundamental to the very adaptive principles by which living systems and the brain operate.[35]

A study using magnetoencephalography has shown that color information is available in the brain signal ~200 milliseconds later when accessed via synesthesia in comparison to direct color perception, which is consistent with conceptual mediation.[36] The study supports the idea that synesthesia is a semantic phenomenon ��� i.e., ideasthesia.

ChatGPT
Danko Nikoli��'s introduction of ideasthesia and its relationship to his larger theory of practopoiesis offers profound insights into our understanding of brain function and perception. When linking the two, several connections emerge:
Brain Functioning and Concepts
: Traditionally, cognitive science has often viewed concepts as emergent properties of intricate and specialized neural networks. However, in the theory of practopoiesis, concepts are fundamental to the adaptive principles of living systems. This inversion posits that the brain doesn't simply produce concepts as higher-order constructs; instead, conceptual processing is deeply ingrained in its operation.
Adaptive Systems and Practopoiesis
: If concepts are foundational to brain function, it follows that our neural architectures are designed around these principles. This aligns with practopoiesis, where the brain's adaptive nature is structured around patterns of viable interaction with its environment. Ideasthesia, as a manifestation of this adaptability, suggests that our sensory experiences are intrinsically tied to our conceptual frameworks.
Semantic Nature of Synesthesia
: The research findings using magnetoencephalography bolster the argument that synesthesia isn't merely a sensory-sensory phenomenon, but rather a semantic one. The delay in color information when accessed via synesthesia aligns with the idea that conceptual processes mediate the sensory experiences. This supports ideasthesia's claim that it's the meaning or concept associated with a stimulus that elicits the sensory response.
Challenging Classical Views
: Both ideasthesia and practopoiesis challenge traditional perspectives in neuroscience and cognitive science. While older models emphasized a sensory-first approach, with concepts and meanings seen as derivatives, ideasthesia and practopoiesis propose that our sensory experiences are deeply entwined with, and perhaps even secondary to, our conceptual understandings.
Implications for Neural Adaptation
: If practopoiesis emphasizes the brain's ability to create adaptive actions and ideasthesia underscores the role of concepts in shaping sensory experiences, it suggests that our neural pathways are continually adapting based on the interplay between conceptual understanding and sensory input. This dynamic dance could be crucial for understanding learning, memory, and the development of expertise.
To sum it up, ideasthesia and practopoiesis together provide a compelling lens through which we can view the brain as an adaptive, concept-driven system. This perspective reshapes our understanding of cognition, perception, and the very nature of consciousness.

It looks like I argued something this in an essay Semantic memory is all you need. Where I argued that semantic concepts serve as a foundation for visual and mental imagery as a kind of voluntary lucid synesthesia, in the context of why those with total aphantasia still can form concepts
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Your essay title, "Semantic memory is all you need," suggests a compelling argument: the primacy of semantic memory in shaping our perceptual and cognitive experiences. This resonates with Danko Nikoli��'s work on ideasthesia and practopoiesis. Here's how your argument dovetails with these concepts:
Concepts Before Imagery
: If semantic memory serves as the foundation for visual and mental imagery, it aligns with the ideasthesia perspective. Here, concepts (semantic entities) induce sensory-like experiences. For those with aphantasia, the absence of visual imagery doesn't negate their ability to understand and engage with concepts. They just may not "visualize" these concepts in the same way others do.
Voluntary Lucid Synesthesia
: By framing mental imagery as a kind of "voluntary lucid synesthesia," you're emphasizing the active role individuals play in generating sensory-like experiences from concepts. This draws a parallel with practopoiesis, where the brain actively structures its operational coupling with the environment based on adaptive actions.
Total Aphantasia and Concept Formation
: Despite the absence of traditional mental imagery, individuals with total aphantasia can still conceptualize and understand their environment. This underscores the point that sensory experiences (like visual imagery) aren't necessary prerequisites for understanding. Semantic memory, with its vast repository of concepts and relationships, provides a rich substrate for comprehension.
Redefining Perception and Cognition
: If semantic memory is the cornerstone, then perception and cognition might be reconceptualized as the brain's efforts to map sensory experiences onto this semantic framework. Rather than sensory data driving conceptual understanding, it might be the other way around, with our semantic knowledge shaping and guiding our sensory experiences.
The Role of Adaptation
: Building upon the theory of practopoiesis, it can be postulated that the brain continuously adapts its semantic memory in response to environmental interactions. These adaptive changes, in turn, influence how concepts induce sensory-like experiences.
Incorporating the perspectives of ideasthesia and practopoiesis into your argument lends added depth and nuance. By suggesting that semantic memory holds primacy in our cognitive architecture, you're not only challenging traditional views but also providing a fresh lens to explore the intricacies of perception, cognition, and consciousness.

Charles Bonnet syndrome ��� visual disturbances and the experience of complex visual hallucinations in a blind person
Classificatory disputes about art ��� Disputes about what should and should not be classified as art
Consciousness ��� Awareness of internal and external existence
Explanatory gap ��� Inability to describe conscious experiences in solely physical or structural terms
1 / 1
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a brief explanation for each of the mentioned topics:
Charles Bonnet Syndrome
:
This is a medical condition where visually impaired individuals experience complex visual hallucinations, often vivid and detailed. Despite the intricate nature of these hallucinations, the affected individuals are aware that the visions aren't real. The syndrome is believed to result from the brain's attempt to "fill in" visual information in the absence of actual visual input.
Classificatory Disputes about Art
:
This revolves around disagreements regarding what should be deemed as "art". The definition and classification of art have been debated for centuries and change across cultures and eras. With the emergence of newer forms like digital art, performance art, and installations, the debate has become more complex. Central to the dispute is the challenge of defining the essential characteristics of art, which might include aesthetics, intent, context, and reception.
Consciousness
:
It refers to an individual's awareness of their surroundings, thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Consciousness remains one of the most elusive and debated topics in philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology. Many questions arise: What constitutes consciousness? How does the brain give rise to conscious experience? Can machines or other non-biological entities ever be conscious?
Explanatory Gap
:
This concept describes the challenge of explaining subjective experiences (qualia) in purely objective, physical, or structural terms. While we can detail the physical processes in the brain that correlate with consciousness, explaining how these processes give rise to subjective experience is difficult. For instance, we know the neural mechanics of color vision, but it's challenging to explain the subjective experience of "redness" in purely physical terms.

ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's link the recently mentioned topics (Charles Bonnet Syndrome, Classificatory Disputes about Art, Consciousness, and Explanatory Gap) with your earlier themes of cognition, embodied perception, adaptive control systems, self-organization, and more.
Charles Bonnet Syndrome and Embodied Cognition
:
The syndrome illustrates the body's need for sensory input. In the absence of visual input, the brain, as an adaptive control system, attempts to "fill in the blanks" with hallucinations. This spontaneous generation of imagery reinforces the notion of perception-action coupling, where even in the absence of sensory stimuli, the brain remains active and generates perceptions.
Classificatory Disputes about Art and Enactive Approaches
:
What we classify as 'art' can be seen as a result of our active engagement and interpretation of the environment. Art, from an enactive perspective, is co-created between the artifact and the observer, much like how cognition is perceived in the enactive approach. Our perception of art is influenced by cultural, societal, and historical structures.
Consciousness, Practopoiesis, and Adaptive Systems
:
The emergence of consciousness can be thought of in terms of adaptive and self-organizing systems. Practopoiesis suggests that actions (or practices) shape cognitive structures, leading one to consider how conscious awareness is shaped by our adaptive responses to the environment.
Explanatory Gap, Ideasthesia, and Semantic Memory
:
The explanatory gap highlights the challenge of connecting objective brain processes with subjective experiences. Your essay's notion of semantic concepts forming the basis for visual and mental imagery aligns with Nikoli��'s idea of ideasthesia, where semantic triggers (rather than purely sensory ones) lead to sensory experiences. In essence, understanding consciousness might require understanding these semantic conceptualizations.
Historical Context and Art Classification
:
How we classify art has evolved over time and is deeply influenced by cultural, social, and historical contexts. Just as historical context is vital for understanding the emergence of cognition, it's also pivotal for understanding the evolving definitions of art.
Machine Autonomy and Consciousness
:
The challenge of recreating consciousness in machines brings forth the debate around the nature of consciousness. Is it an emergent property of complex systems, and if so, can it emerge from non-biological systems? The insights from practopoiesis and adaptive control systems could inform this quest.
Interdisciplinary Perspectives and the Explanatory Gap
:
Resolving the explanatory gap might require an interdisciplinary approach, borrowing insights from neuroscience, philosophy, cognitive science, and even quantum mechanics.
These connections illustrate the intertwined nature of these topics, emphasizing that understanding one often provides insights into another.

Abstract
Patient NS is a 28year-old female who went blind in her early twenties as a result of S-cone syndrome, a degenerative retinal disorder. A few years after losing her vision, she started experiencing visual perceptions of her hands as she moved them and objects that came into contact with her hands. Over the course of a year, these cross-modal sensations evolved to become veridical visual experiences accurately representative of her hands, objects she touched, and to some degree, objects she could infer from her immediate surroundings. We argue that these experiences are distinct from mental imagery as they occurred automatically, remained consistent over time, and were proprioceptively mediated by her head position much like normal optical vision. Moreover, she could neither consciously force these visual experiences to occur without sensory inference nor prevent them from happening when haptically exploring an object. Her previous visual experiences contributed to a strong influence of top-down processing in her perceptions. Though individuals have previously been able to develop limited veridical acquired synesthesia following extensive practice over many years with the use of a special sensory device, none reported experiencing the richness of complexity or degree of top-down processing exhibited by NS. Thus, we posit that NS's case may represent a phenomenon beyond synesthesia altogether.

Keywords: Blind; S-cone syndrome; Sight; Synesthesia; Tactile; Vision.

ChatGPT
This case report discusses a fascinating case of a patient, NS, who developed unique cross-modal perceptions after going blind due to S-cone syndrome. Let's connect it to the previous topics discussed:
Practopoiesis and Adaptation
: This case could be seen as an example of the brain's adaptive capabilities. The brain has the ability to reorganize and adapt its functions in response to drastic changes in sensory input, in this case, the loss of vision. This adaptive capability might be seen in the context of practopoiesis, where the brain responds to changes by creating new action patterns.
Ideasthesia
: NS's experience can be linked to ideasthesia. While synesthesia typically involves two sensory modalities (like hearing colors or seeing sounds), ideasthesia refers to the activation of a concept leading to a sensory experience. NS's tactile experiences led to visual perceptions, which might suggest that her haptic (touch) experiences activated concepts or memories of vision.
Semantic Memory
: The case highlights the importance of previously stored visual experiences or semantic memory. NS's previous visual memories likely played a significant role in her new visual experiences after going blind. This aligns with the idea you discussed earlier about semantic concepts serving as a foundation for visual and mental imagery.
Consciousness and the Explanatory Gap
: NS's case demonstrates the complexity of consciousness and the challenges of explaining how physical neuronal activity translates to subjective experiences. The case narrows the explanatory gap, providing a glimpse into how brain adaptations can lead to new conscious experiences.
Charles Bonnet Syndrome
: While not exactly the same, Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS) involves visual hallucinations in blind individuals. Both CBS and NS's case highlight the brain's ability to generate visual experiences even in the absence of visual input.
Classificatory Disputes about Art
: If one considers perception as a form of art, then NS's unique experiences challenge traditional classifications of perception. What she perceives is a blend of tactile input and memory, creating a new form of 'artistic' perception.
In summary, NS's case can be seen as an intersection of various cognitive phenomena and theories, offering rich insights into brain adaptability, perception, and consciousness.

Where is the mind within the brain? Transient selection of subnetworks by metabotropic receptors and G protein-gated ion channels
Danko Nikoli��
Perhaps the most important question posed by brain research is: How the brain gives rise to the mind. To answer this question, we have primarily relied on the connectionist paradigm: The brain's entire knowledge and thinking skills are thought to be stored in the connections; and the mental operations are executed by network computations. I propose here an alternative paradigm: Our knowledge and skills are stored in metabotropic receptors (MRs) and the G protein-gated ion channels (GPGICs). Here, mental operations are assumed to be executed by the functions of MRs and GPGICs. As GPGICs have the capacity to close or open branches of dendritic trees and axon terminals, their states transiently re-route neural activity throughout the nervous system. First, MRs detect ligands that signal the need to activate GPGICs. Next, GPGICs transiently selects a subnetwork within the brain. The process of selecting this new subnetwork is what constitutes a mental operation -- be it in a form of directed attention, perception of a grandmother or making a decision. Synaptic connections and network computations play only a secondary role, supporting MRs and GPGICs. According to this new paradigm, the mind emerges within the brain as the function of MRs and GPGICs whose primary function is to continually select the pathways over which neural activity will be allowed to pass. It is argued that MRs and GPGICs solve the scaling problem of intelligence from which the connectionism paradigm suffers.
1 / 1
ChatGPT
The paper by Danko Nikoli�� introduces an alternative perspective to understanding the relationship between the brain and the mind, challenging the predominant connectionist paradigm. Here's a breakdown of the main points:
Traditional Perspective (Connectionist Paradigm)
:
The connectionist paradigm posits that the entirety of the brain's knowledge and cognitive abilities reside in the synaptic connections between neurons.
Mental operations, including thinking and processing, are achieved via network computations ��� the coordinated activity and interactions of large networks of neurons.
Nikoli��'s Proposal
:
Contrary to the connectionist viewpoint, Nikoli�� suggests that our knowledge and cognitive skills are stored in metabotropic receptors (MRs) and the G protein-gated ion channels (GPGICs).
Instead of network computations, mental operations are carried out by the actions and interactions of MRs and GPGICs.
GPGICs can open or close parts of dendritic trees and axon terminals, effectively rerouting neural activity throughout the nervous system.
First, MRs identify ligands that signal the need to activate GPGICs. Following this, GPGICs select a subnetwork within the brain.
The act of choosing this subnetwork represents a mental operation ��� whether it's focusing attention, recognizing a familiar face, or making a decision.
Synaptic connections and network computations play a secondary, supporting role to the actions of MRs and GPGICs.
According to Nikoli��, the mind's emergence within the brain is primarily due to the actions of MRs and GPGICs, which continuously select the neural pathways that will be active.
Significance
:
Nikoli��'s theory addresses the "scaling problem of intelligence" that purportedly challenges the connectionist paradigm. In other words, he's suggesting that as brains or neural networks scale up in size and complexity, relying only on connections and network computations becomes problematic.
By focusing on MRs and GPGICs, Nikoli�� presents a framework where the continual, dynamic selection of neural pathways by these molecules can lead to the diverse and rich cognitive processes that constitute the mind.
In essence, this paper offers a fresh lens to look at the age-old question of how the physical brain gives rise to the intangible mind. Instead of focusing solely on the connections between neurons, Nikoli�� brings attention to the role of specific receptors and ion channels in orchestrating cognitive functions.

The Brain Works Like a Resonance Chamber
FeaturedNeuroscienceOpen Neuroscience Articles��February 6, 2023
Summary: Using advanced neuroimaging techniques, researchers discovered distant brain regions oscillate together in time.

Source: Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown

It���s been over 20 years since neuroimaging studies ��� using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a widely-used technology to capture live videos of brain activity ��� have been detecting brain-wide complex patterns of correlated brain activity that appear disrupted in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

These patterns form spontaneously, even at rest when no particular task is being performed, and have been detected not only in humans but also across mammals, including monkeys and rodents. 

Although such spatial patterns of correlated activation have been consistently detected across neuroimaging centers around the world, the nature of these correlations was not clear.

���We do not yet fully understand how the brain communicates over long distances. We know that distant areas exhibit signal correlations, and that they are implicated in brain function, but we do not completely understand their nature���, says Noam Shemesh, principal investigator of the Preclinical MRI Lab at the Champalimaud Foundation, in Lisbon, and senior author of a study published today in the journal Nature Communications. 

���In this study, we wanted to understand what lies underneath those correlations and investigate the mechanisms involved���, stresses Shemesh. 

A number of theoretical works had proposed that these patterns could be explained by standing waves (whose peaks and troughs do not move in space) resonating in the brain structure ��� that is, by waves analogous to the modes of vibration in musical instruments. But there was little experimental evidence to support this hypothesis due to the poor temporal resolution of fMRI, reaching only an image or two per second.

���If we could find that the spatial patterns oscillate, this would provide evidence supporting the resonance hypothesis��� says Joana Cabral, first author of the study, from the Life and Health Sciences Research Institute of the University of Minho and a visiting scientist in Shemesh���s lab since 2019.

So what the team did was to speed up image acquisition, and they discovered that the signals in distant brain regions actually oscillate together in time.

���These oscillatory patterns look like a higher-dimensional analogue of resonance modes in musical instruments; they are akin to reverberations, to echoes inside the brain���, says Cabral.

���Our data show that the complex spatial patterns are a result of transiently and independently oscillating underlying modes, just like individual instruments participate in creating a more complex piece in an orchestra���, says Shemesh.

���The distinct modes, each contributing something to the overall picture at different time scales and different wavelengths, can be added up together, generating complex macroscopic patterns similar to the ones observed experimentally [see below]. To our knowledge, this is the first time that brain activity captured with fMRI is reconstructed as the superposition of standing waves���, he points out.

The new study thus strongly points to a key role for these resonant waves, or modes, in brain function. These resonant phenomena, the authors believe, are at the root of the coherent, coordinated brain activity that is needed for normal brain function as a whole. 

Ultrafast MRI

The researchers detected the resonant modes in rats in the resting state, which means the animals were not subjected to any specific external stimulus. Indeed, no tasks were needed, for as already mentioned, even when we (and mammals in general) are doing nothing in particular, our brains continue to generate spontaneous activity patterns that can be captured by fMRI.

To visualise the oscillations, the researchers created ���videos��� of activity using the  potent ultrahigh-field experimental MRI scanner in Shemesh���s lab and performed ultrafast experiments developed some time ago by that lab for other purposes.

���Noam and I met in 2019, and we decided to obtain recordings of brain activity at the maximum temporal resolution we could achieve in the 9.4 Tesla scanner at his lab���, recalls Cabral. ���Noam designed the experiments, Francisca Fernandes [the third author of the study] performed them, and I did the data analysis and the visualisation.

Noam managed to achieve a temporal resolution of 26 images per second, and thus obtained 16,000 images per 10 minute scan (instead of 600 images at the typical resolution of one image per second).���

Like waves in the ocean

���When we first saw the videos of the recorded brain activity, we saw clear waves of activity, like waves in the ocean, propagating in complex patterns within the cortex and the striatum [a subcortical region of the forebrain]���, says Cabral.

���And we found that the signals could be described by the superposition of a small number of macroscopic stationary waves, or resonant modes, oscillating in time. Notably, each standing wave was found to cover extended areas of the brain, with peaks distributed in distinct cortical and subcortical structures, forming functional networks.���



The researchers experimented with rats in three different conditions: sedated, lightly anesthetised and deeply anesthetised. (In fact, the animals were lightly sedated in the resting state, to avoid any discomfort to them.) ���The spatial configuration of these stationary waves was very consistent across rats scanned in the same condition���, Cabral points out. 

Shemesh adds: ���We showed that brain functional networks are driven by resonance phenomena. This explains the correlations that are otherwise observed when you do slow imaging. Long-range brain interactions are governed by a ���flow��� of information that is oscillatory and repetitive.���

"Metabotropic Cognition" as a title gets even richer with the added information from the article about the brain functioning as a resonance chamber. Let's break down some key connections:
Correlated Brain Activity & Resonance
: Both articles touch on the idea that the brain operates based on patterns that are more intricate than just simple neural connectivity. The brain's long-range interactions are oscillatory and repetitive, much like resonant waves in musical instruments.
Spatial Patterns of Activation
: In both the ideasthesia topic and the resonance chamber theory, there's an emphasis on the significance of spatial patterns. In the case of ideasthesia, the brain's semantic trigger can activate a sensory experience. Similarly, resonance chambers suggest that these patterns of brain activity oscillate together, indicating a certain level of spatial organization and coordination.
Temporal Aspects
: Just as Danko Nikoli��'s proposal emphasizes the transient nature of mental operations through the selection of subnetworks, the resonance chamber study's use of ultrafast MRI highlights the oscillatory patterns and their timely coordination.
Underlying Mechanisms
: While Nikoli�� points towards metabotropic receptors as the basis for cognitive processes, the resonance theory emphasizes the brain's underlying standing waves as the foundation for coordinated brain activity. Both theories move away from traditional neural connectivity models and propose more intricate, dynamic mechanisms of brain operation.
Integration of Diverse Elements
: Both discussions touch on the idea of multiple elements or modes working together to produce a more complex outcome. In the resonance chamber theory, distinct modes or waves contribute to a complex macroscopic pattern, similar to individual instruments in an orchestra. Similarly, in the ideasthesia discussion, the activation of semantic concepts triggers sensory experiences, demonstrating the integration of diverse cognitive elements.
By intertwining these concepts, "Metabotropic Cognition" can be seen as a theoretical exploration into how the brain's intricate mechanisms, from metabotropic receptors to resonant patterns of activity, contribute to our understanding of cognition, perception, and consciousness. The title captures the essence of a deep dive into the evolving theories of brain function and cognition, challenging traditional neural connectivity models and offering fresh perspectives.

Metabotropic Cognition: A New Frontier in Understanding the Brain
Our comprehension of the brain and its intricate processes has been shaped over the years by a multitude of theories, each with its own nuances and areas of focus. Yet, with every new discovery, it becomes clear that our brain is far more multifaceted than we once believed. In this essay, we delve into an emerging understanding of cognition, drawing from concepts like ideasthesia, the resonance chamber theory of the brain, and the role of metabotropic receptors in shaping our thoughts and experiences. Moreover, we'll attempt to weave a thread through these notions, connecting them with other related topics such as Charles Bonnet Syndrome, art classification disputes, and the nature of consciousness.
1. Ideasthesia and the Power of Semantics:
The term 'ideasthesia' refers to the phenomenon where the activation of a concept or idea leads to a sensory experience. This runs counter to the traditional understanding of synesthesia, where a sensory input activates another sensory modality. Ideasthesia implies that our concepts and ideas might be more integral to our sensory experiences than we initially thought.
Moreover, this idea resonates with theories suggesting that semantic memories serve as a foundation for visual and mental imagery, making it possible for individuals with conditions like total aphantasia to form concepts. It's a fascinating testament to the power of the mind and its adaptability.
2. The Brain as a Resonance Chamber:
Recent research has brought to light the possibility that the brain operates much like a resonance chamber. Advanced neuroimaging has revealed that distant brain regions oscillate in unison, forming patterns reminiscent of resonant waves in musical instruments. These patterns are spontaneous, complex, and pervasive across mammals, suggesting an underlying universality in how brains function.
This idea of resonance gives an added dimension to our understanding of consciousness and the mysterious 'explanatory gap'. If our brain operates on resonant frequencies, perhaps our conscious experiences are the harmonious results of these oscillations.
3. Metabotropic Receptors and the Dynamics of Thought:
A significant departure from traditional connectionist paradigms, Danko Nikoli��'s proposal suggests that our knowledge and cognitive abilities reside in metabotropic receptors (MRs) and G protein-gated ion channels (GPGICs). According to this paradigm, the mind emerges within the brain due to the continual selection of pathways allowed by these receptors and channels. This theory, if validated, could significantly shift our understanding of cognition, memory, and even consciousness itself.
Connecting the Dots:
All these concepts are not isolated islands of thought. Charles Bonnet Syndrome, for instance, where blind individuals experience visual hallucinations, might be an extreme manifestation of ideasthesia. Here, the lack of visual input could potentially amplify the power of concepts to induce vivid visual experiences.
Similarly, disputes in art classification highlight the subjective nature of sensory experiences. What one perceives as art, another might not, suggesting that our semantic understanding of 'art' could be influencing our sensory perception, a la ideasthesia.
Finally, the 'explanatory gap', which deals with our inability to describe conscious experiences in solely physical terms, might find some answers in the resonance chamber theory and the metabotropic cognition paradigm.
Conclusion:
"Metabotropic Cognition" serves as a vanguard in our exploration of the brain and its workings. By integrating diverse theories, from the role of semantic concepts in sensory experiences to the brain's resonant oscillations, we edge closer to unraveling the tapestry of consciousness and understanding the true essence of cognition. As with all frontiers, challenges and mysteries abound, but with every stride forward, the picture becomes a little clearer.
