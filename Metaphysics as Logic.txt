ABSTRACT
Philosophy, and analytic metaphysics in particular, is usually described as an armchair discipline, and exactly for such an armchair methodology it has been the target of ferocious criticisms. In this paper, I argue that the theoretical right to conduct metaphysics from the armchair can be defended understanding metaphysics as a form of Logic (broadly understood as including applied logics, philosophical logics and, especially, philosophy of logic). So characterized, the typical practice of metaphysics is not more problematic than the armchair methodology routinely employed in the study of Logic.

1Philosophy, and analytic metaphysics in particular, is often described as a discipline widely conducted a priori or, as it is sometimes put, from the armchair.2 It is exactly for such an armchair methodology that analytic metaphysics has been the target of ferocious criticisms. If metaphysics aimed merely at describing our naÃ¯ve conceptual scheme, an a priori methodology could perhaps be defensible, but metaphysics is not always concerned merely with our folk way of categorizing reality. On the contrary, metaphysicians usually want to discover authentic truths about the universe. But how can metaphysicians do that by sitting in a chair? Being able to investigate the deep structure of reality without leaving the armchair seems like magic. Indeed, to escape this conclusion and the subsequent forced submission to natural sciences, philosophers have sometimes looked for a suitable sort of magic that could grant the trick, and rational intuition is often proposed as a possible candidate. The idea is that metaphysicians can avoid to dirt their hands with empirical inquiries because they can gather important data by resorting to intuitions of some sort.

3 See, e.g., Ladyman and Ross (2009).
4 See, e.g., Bealer (1998) or Bengson (2015).
5 See Williamson (2007), Cappelen (2012), Deutsch (2015).
2The nature and the legitimacy of intuition, however, is the source of further and hot debates. Those willing to undermine metaphysics in favour of science criticize (or just try to ridicule)3 such a mysterious reliance on intuition, while defenders of metaphysics offered discrepant strategies: some of them put forward elaborated proposals to legitimate rational intuitions,4 while others claimed that philosophical reliance on intuitions is a mere meta-philosophical mythand the armchair approach can be vindicated in some other way.5 In this paper I intend to offer a characterization of the methodology of analytic metaphysics somehow in the middle. To bring forward my point, in a nutshell, I contend that the armchair methodology of metaphysics can be vindicated by stressing the analogies with logical inquiries: metaphysics should be considered as a form of Logic, broadly understood. At the same time, I put mostly aside the problem of the theoretical legitimacy of Logic and assume it. Thus, if the epistemic foundation of Logic requires a resort to intuition, so does metaphysics. If not, neither does metaphysics. The background assumption is that in the case of Logic a possible resort to intuition, besides not being forced, is much less problematic. Accordingly, metaphysics should be considered as informative and epistemically unproblematic as Logic.

3The paper is structured as follows. In the next section I note that the construction of sound arguments requires two things: an inferential ability and a previous grasp of some alleged truths. I then show that the former is a legitimate form of armchair inquiry also when understood as philosophy of logic, which is the topic of the third part. In the fourth section I pass to consider the problem of true premises, arguing that metaphysicians can obtain them by considering metaphysics as a form of Logic. In the fifth part I show that between metaphysical and logical notions there are enough similarities to justify the proposal, while in the sixth I argue that the strategy should be considered in a prescriptive way. I then conclude the paper summing up the main points.

2. Metaphysics and Logic
6 Assuming, for the sake of debate, that thought experiments are not just arguments.
4Metaphysicians are interested in discovering truths about certain issues. Typically, they do not try to discover them by empirical inquiries, divine revelation or artistic inspiration. Instead, they look for sound arguments or exploit forms of rational inquiry such as thought experiments6. Let me focus on arguments first and postpone the resort to thought experiments and the like to section 4. When metaphysicians elaborate sound arguments, to falsify a certain claim they try to show that it has false consequences, while to verify it they show that it is implied by true premises. This way, the standard practice of metaphysicians keeps together two main ingredients: an inferential ability to construct valid arguments and a previous recollection of certain truths (or falsehoods). These two ingredients reflect the fact that, by definition, a sound argument requires two things: a logically valid argument and true premises. If an armchair methodology is to be defended, I must show that both aspects can be achieved without metaphysicians having to leave their seats. Since the claim that valid inferences are attainable from the armchair is rather unproblematic, the main crux of this paper looms upon the other aspect, namely the recovery of true premises. However, given the crucial role Logic plays in my proposal, it is worth spending some words about it. Let me then analyse such two aspects in turn, starting with valid arguments.

5The resort to Logic in metaphysical arguments takes many forms. To cover all such usages I use the term âLogicâ (capital âLâ), reserving the term âlogicâ for specific logics. First of all, Logic is applied to give form and to construct specific arguments. It is through careful logical analysis and application of particular rules of inferences or axioms that arguments are obtained. Once an argument is developed, the issue of the validity of the inference can be posed in a fully explicit way, so that we have a second role for Logic in the form of mathematical logic. Specifying the logic is also crucial to determine the exact consequences of a claim, and, more generally, of a metaphysical view. The assessment and comparison of certain inferences and of their underlying logics, however, is not just a matter of simple mathematics. Balancing different logics requires venturing into philosophical considerations, so that we have a third sense in which Logic plays a role in metaphysical argumentation, namely in the form of philosophy of logic. Metaphysicians are interested in establishing which logic is the correct one for the issue at hand and how it should be interpreted. Of course, this classification of the logical aspects of metaphysical practice is a profound simplification and idealization, since we usually have a unique procedure going back and forth through the various levels in an inextricable manner. Accordingly, to produce and discuss valid arguments, contemporary metaphysicians rely on and keep together applications of logics, mathematical logic and philosophy of logic.

6It is clearly not hard to show that such aspects are unproblematic for a defence of an armchair methodology. The application of logic is grounded in our inferential abilities and should be taken to be the product of a skill as a priori as it can be. Analogously, mathematical logic, being part of mathematics, is an instance of the most typical a priori discipline. Indeed, I take these quick observations to report the default view and to be enough for my purposes. The only aspect whose armchair status might seem problematic is that of philosophy of logic, so that I devote the next section to it.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe paper by Andrea Strollo titled "Metaphysics as Logic" argues in defense of metaphysics, particularly analytic metaphysics, as a legitimate armchair discipline. Analytic metaphysics has faced criticism for its reliance on a priori reasoning, often referred to as the armchair methodology. The paper contends that this armchair approach can be justified by considering metaphysics as a form of Logic, encompassing applied logics, philosophical logics, and philosophy of logic. In doing so, the author suggests that the practice of metaphysics is no more problematic than the armchair methodology employed in logical inquiries.The paper discusses the relationship between metaphysics and logic, emphasizing the role of logic in constructing and evaluating metaphysical arguments. It argues that metaphysicians use logic to form valid arguments, apply mathematical logic to assess the validity of inferences, and engage in philosophy of logic to determine the correct logical framework for their investigations. By viewing metaphysics as a logical endeavor, the author defends its epistemic foundation, which may involve resorting to rational intuitions as long as logic also relies on them.Overall, the paper presents a middle-ground approach, acknowledging the use of armchair reasoning in metaphysics while drawing analogies with logical inquiries to justify its methodology. It outlines the connection between metaphysics and logic and concludes that the armchair methodology is defensible within the context of metaphysics as a form of Logic.1 / 13. Philosophy of logic from the armchair
7Since philosophy of logic pertains to philosophy, one might reasonably suspect that here we meet the same epistemic concern afflicting metaphysics. After all, philosophy of logic is not logic, so that it is not a clearly legitimate a priori discipline. If so, one can ask where philosophers of logic take their evidences and the initial problem seems to emerge already at this point. I believe that in this case, however, several considerations can be put forward to weaken the force of the worry. Indeed, I should start by stressing that no great attack against philosophy of logic has ever be conducted or, at least, no criticism comparable to those put forward against metaphysics seems available. Philosophy of logic is seldom questioned as a legitimate area of study and is usually assumed to be a safe kind of armchair inquiry. Of course that this is the common view does not mean that the orthodox position is correct. Nonetheless, given that we lack positive criticisms, the actual burden of the proof is on opponentâs shoulders and we are justified in adopting the usual position. At the same time, given the importance of philosophy of logic for the proposal of this paper, I briefly argue in favour of the orthodox stance.

8First of all, problems of theoretical legitimacy are usually much less pressing for the philosophies of specific sciences. Such philosophies can perhaps be accused of being useless for the scientific researches conducted in the related fields, but this concern usually does not affect their theoretical legitimacy. Indeed, often scientists themselves venture into the adjacent philosophical area, perhaps inadvertently, to reflect on the nature of their own work. Analogously, it can also be argued that scientists need some amount of philosophical speculation to carry out their research programs, so that banning the possibility of critically investigating them would undermine the very legitimacy of the related science rather than delegitimate the corresponding philosophy. One of the reasons why philosophies of sciences are usually considered less theoretically troublesome has probably something to do with the fact that it is a specific science, whose legitimacy is mostly granted, what provides the topic of the philosophical speculation at stake. Thus, a philosophy of a certain science appears somehow to heir the theoretical legitimacy from the science it relates to. Accordingly, philosophy of logic derives some legitimacy from logic itself. Clearly, if these observations still do not answer the question of what is the source of evidence employed by philosophers of logic, it shows why the question is not much worrying. Here we also find an apparent discrepancy with respect to metaphysics. Given that metaphysics seems to be an autonomous discipline, and not a philosophy of a particular science, it cannot invoke the same kind of derivative legitimization we have for philosophy of logic, philosophy of physics and the like, unless it is reduced to some of them.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this section of the paper, the author discusses the legitimacy of philosophy of logic as an armchair discipline and how it relates to the concerns raised about metaphysics. While philosophy of logic is not the same as logic itself, the author argues that it enjoys a more accepted status as a legitimate armchair inquiry compared to metaphysics.The author acknowledges that philosophy of logic, like metaphysics, involves a priori reasoning and armchair methodology. However, the criticism and skepticism directed towards philosophy of logic are considerably weaker than those faced by metaphysics. The lack of substantial negative criticisms means that the burden of proof is on those who oppose the legitimacy of philosophy of logic.One reason for the more lenient view towards philosophy of logic is that it pertains to specific sciences, and philosophers of science often engage in adjacent philosophical inquiries related to their fields. This connection with established scientific disciplines grants some legitimacy to the philosophy of those sciences. In contrast, metaphysics appears more autonomous and lacks this direct connection to specific sciences.The author suggests that the theoretical legitimacy of philosophy of logic can be somewhat derived from the legitimacy of logic itself. Since logic is widely accepted as a rigorous and legitimate discipline, its philosophical examination also gains some credibility. On the other hand, metaphysics does not have such a direct connection to a well-established scientific field, which might contribute to the greater skepticism it faces.Overall, the author briefly argues in favor of the orthodox view that philosophy of logic is a legitimate armchair inquiry, though the source of evidence employed by philosophers of logic is not explicitly addressed in this section. The paper maintains that philosophy of logic's more accepted status can be attributed to its connection with an established discipline, while metaphysics lacks this foundation and may, therefore, face greater scrutiny.1 / 19Second, the epistemic status of the investigations conducted in philosophies of particular sciences is often tied to the nature of the related science. If a philosopher discusses some aspects of philosophy of mathematics, for instance the idea of potential infinity in set theory, then it seems that her investigation can rightfully be conducted from the armchair. This is because she would mostly appeal to a priori results in set theory or employ the same kind of theoretical resources (possibly including rational mathematical intuitions) appealed to by mathematicians. By contrast, if one studies philosophy of biology, then she would have to appeal to results obtained a posteriori, so that her entire speculation would rely, perhaps remotely, on empirical research. Given that mathematical logic is a paradigmatic case of an a priori discipline, we have that philosophy of logic sits better with the a priori inquiries than with the a posteriori ones.71 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this part of the paper, the author compares the epistemic status of investigations conducted in philosophies of particular sciences with that of philosophy of logic. The author argues that the epistemic status of a philosophical inquiry is often related to the nature of the specific science being discussed.For instance, if a philosopher delves into the philosophy of mathematics and discusses topics like potential infinity in set theory, their investigation can rightfully be conducted from the armchair. This is because their inquiry would largely rely on a priori results within set theory or use the same theoretical resources, such as rational mathematical intuitions, that mathematicians utilize. Since mathematics is considered a paradigmatic case of an a priori discipline, philosophy of mathematics aligns well with a priori inquiries.On the other hand, if a philosopher explores the philosophy of biology, their investigation may have to appeal to results obtained a posteriori through empirical research. In this case, the inquiry would rely on empirical data and might not be as suited for the armchair methodology.The comparison is made to highlight that philosophy of logic, being closely related to logic, a discipline widely considered a priori, aligns better with armchair inquiries. The association with an a priori discipline contributes to philosophy of logic's epistemic legitimacy and its status as a safe armchair inquiry.Overall, the author argues that the nature of the related science can influence the epistemic status of philosophical inquiries, with a priori disciplines like philosophy of logic being more amenable to the armchair methodology.1 / 110Taken together, the two points above give some preliminary reason in favour of the legitimacy of the a priori approach usually employed in philosophy of logic. However, one might still object that in philosophy of logic (and similarly in other special philosophies as well) philosophers typically appeal and discuss logical issues also under the light of considerations which might render philosophy of logic both a posteriori and problematic. Such generic considerations typically have either a linguistic nature or a very general and pre-theoretical character. Examples are considerations about the semantic and inferential behaviour of connectives and quantifiers, pre-theoretical claims about features of the relation of logical consequence or about general principles, such as excluded middle or semantic bivalence. None of these aspects, however, is particularly problematic for our concerns. On the one hand, if a resort to linguistic competence were enough to make a claim a posteriori, then every claim would be rendered a posteriori, making the distinction useless. At the same time, although claims based on semantic competence can be revisable, they can hardly be considered systematically unreliable. Thinking otherwise would push us towards a form of radical skepticism which would undermine our very capacity of judging.8 On the other hand, the general pre-theoretical claims have usually the form of apparent trivial information and commonplaces, so that they should not be considered problematic, unless strong reasons to think otherwise are presented (think of excluded middle or the transitivity of logical consequence). This situation is not even limited to logic, since any scientific enterprise moves from a base of similar pre-theoretical commonplaces. Moreover, although an a posteriori characterization of such commonplaces might be cogent in certain cases, they are not the result of any specific empirical inquiry. They are just considered trivial and shared by most adult human beings. For these reasons, if considering them a priori might be incorrect, an a posteriori characterization could be equally misleading. It is at this point that resorting to the notion of armchair investigation instead of that of a priority is handy. By it we stress the fact that an inquiry, although possibly not strictly a priori, is not the result of a specific active empirical inquiry.9 Keep in mind, however, that we can claim that such an appeal to pre-theoretical principles is theoretically safe also because it pertains to a discipline (Logic) whose legitimacy is unquestioned. These observations, thus, have more an illustration purpose than an apologetic one.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this section, the author addresses potential objections to the a priori approach in philosophy of logic, as well as in other special philosophies. These objections often arise from considerations related to linguistic competence or general pre-theoretical principles.The author acknowledges that in philosophy of logic, philosophers often discuss logical issues while considering linguistic aspects or general principles. However, the author argues that such considerations do not necessarily render philosophy of logic a posteriori or problematic for several reasons.Firstly, if linguistic competence alone were enough to make a claim a posteriori, then all claims would be considered a posteriori, which would render the distinction between a priori and a posteriori meaningless. Additionally, claims based on semantic competence may be revisable, but they are not systematically unreliable, as complete skepticism would undermine our capacity to make any judgments.Secondly, pre-theoretical claims in philosophy of logic usually involve apparent trivial information and common knowledge, such as excluded middle or the transitivity of logical consequence. While these claims may not be strictly a priori, they are not the result of specific active empirical inquiry either. They are commonly accepted as shared knowledge among most adult human beings. Attempting to characterize them as a posteriori might be equally misleading, and for that reason, the notion of "armchair investigation" is useful. It emphasizes that the inquiry is not based on specific empirical investigation but still avoids strict reliance on a priori methods.The author also points out that these considerations are not unique to philosophy of logic; any scientific enterprise is built on a foundation of similar pre-theoretical commonplaces. Moreover, since the legitimacy of logic as a discipline is unquestioned, the appeal to these pre-theoretical principles remains theoretically safe.In summary, the author uses the concept of armchair investigation to stress that philosophy of logic, despite not strictly being a priori, is not the result of specific active empirical inquiry. The objections raised are addressed by highlighting the nature of pre-theoretical principles and their place within the discipline of logic.1 / 1Are they talking about the salience, interestingness, and suprisingness of our semantic categories?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTBased on the provided text, there is no explicit mention of the salience, interestingness, and surprisingness of semantic categories. The discussion revolves around the epistemic legitimacy and methodological aspects of philosophy of logic, particularly its relationship to the a priori approach and how it compares to metaphysics and other philosophies.The text focuses on the argument that philosophy of logic can be considered a legitimate armchair discipline due to its connection with logic, which is widely regarded as an a priori discipline. The author addresses objections regarding linguistic competence and pre-theoretical principles, emphasizing that while some aspects may not strictly be a priori, they still fall under the category of "armchair investigation" rather than being the result of specific empirical inquiries.The provided text does not touch on the salience, interestingness, or surprisingness of semantic categories. Instead, it primarily deals with the epistemic status and theoretical foundation of philosophy of logic as a discipline.1 / 1Are they talking about the compression of ontological categories?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTNo, the provided text does not discuss the compression of ontological categories. The text primarily focuses on the epistemic legitimacy and methodological aspects of philosophy of logic, particularly its relationship to the a priori approach, its comparison to metaphysics and other philosophies, and the nature of its inquiry.There is no mention of ontological categories or their compression in the text. The discussion revolves around the characterization of philosophy of logic as a form of Logic, the use of armchair methodology, and the consideration of linguistic competence and pre-theoretical principles within the discipline. The text does not address ontological categorization or compression in any substantial manner.1 / 14. Metaphysics as Logic
11Metaphysicians do not only look for valid arguments, they also pursue sound ones. To have soundness, beside validity, however, it is necessary to have also true premises. Here is where other forms of theoretical resources kick in and we have the crux of our problem: how do metaphysicians obtain true premises without engaging in serious empirical investigations? To solve this issue I want to stress even further the analogy between metaphysics and Logic broadly understood. I suggest to align metaphysics with formal sciences, arguing that the logical side of the story does not only provide a good account of the inferential aspect of metaphysics but of metaphysics as such. Metaphysics as a whole is to be understood as the result of the intertwining of applications of logic, mathematical logic and philosophy of logic, just extended to cover other notions beside the usual logical ones. In particular, we should include so called philosophical logics. Accordingly, the effort of arriving at metaphysical theories parallels the effort necessary to devise logics. In other words, to establish and interpret the principles governing, for instance, a necessity operator or a predicate for potentiality, metaphysicians invoke the same kind of considerations logicians use to set out the principles governing quantifiers or to claim that excluded middle holds. In particular, metaphysicians would obtain true premises in the same way logicians (and philosophers of logic in particular) do. If this attempt were successful, the pay off would be clear. According to this interpretation, the armchair methodology of metaphysics would be as unproblematic as the armchair methodology usually employed in Logic, and the initial worry would evaporate or at least be substantially weakened. The two methodologies would collapse, and the defence of armchair metaphysics would coincide with the defence of the epistemic legitimacy of Logic. Since Logic is reliable, the attack against metaphysics would vanish.

12One might object that also other, if not all, philosophical disciplines are engaged in âspecifying the principlesâ of some notion, so that there is a serious risk of over generalization: every branch of philosophy would be Logic. Analogously, the study of the logic of any philosophical notion would count as a kind of metaphysics. To correct the approach, however, it is enough to add a few remarks. First, there are many branches of contemporary philosophy that cannot be conducted exclusively from the armchair (philosophies of particular natural sciences, philosophy of mind etc.), so that not every philosophical study would amount to Logic. Secondly, we can specify in advance what notions count as metaphysical notions, so that only in certain cases the corresponding Logic would result in a metaphysical inquiry. To do that, we do not need a previous substantive grasp of metaphysics but only of its subject of investigation. In particular, we should note that metaphysics look for objective principles, namely principles that are correct from a third person point of view, so that investigations intended to capture a cognitive perspective are ruled out. Finally, while I just want to propose an interpretation of analytic metaphysics, I am well open to consider all armchair philosophy as a kind of Logic.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this section, the author proposes to align metaphysics with formal sciences and argues that metaphysics should be understood as the intertwining of applications of logic, mathematical logic, and philosophy of logic, extended to cover other notions beyond the usual logical ones. The author suggests that metaphysics can be seen as similar to devising logics and establishing and interpreting principles governing certain metaphysical notions.By considering metaphysics in this way, the author aims to address the challenge of obtaining true premises in metaphysics without engaging in serious empirical investigations. The author contends that just as logicians and philosophers of logic establish true premises through careful consideration and logical analysis, metaphysicians can do the same for metaphysical notions like necessity and potentiality.If this alignment is successful, the author argues that the armchair methodology of metaphysics would be as unproblematic as the armchair methodology used in logic. This would mean that the defense of armchair metaphysics would coincide with the defense of the epistemic legitimacy of logic, effectively eliminating the concerns and criticisms against metaphysics.The author anticipates a potential objection regarding overgeneralization, where all philosophical disciplines could be seen as Logic and all studies of the logic of philosophical notions as a kind of metaphysics. To address this, the author suggests that not all branches of contemporary philosophy can be conducted exclusively from the armchair, and only certain cases of logical investigations would result in metaphysical inquiries. The distinction between metaphysical notions seeking objective principles and investigations that capture a cognitive perspective helps to refine this interpretation.In conclusion, the author proposes an interpretation of analytic metaphysics as being closely connected to Logic and open to considering all armchair philosophy as a form of Logic. This perspective aims to establish a strong epistemic foundation for metaphysics and demonstrate its legitimacy as an armchair discipline.1 / 15. Analogies between Logic and metaphysics
13To complete this strategy, I must now argue that metaphysical and logical notions are similar enough to be considered of the same sort and to be treated in the same way. Such a strategy presupposes that we have a good account of what logical notions are and of their epistemology, so that we can extend it somehow to metaphysics. Both aspects, however, are subject to hot debates to which I cannot do justice here. I do not need to enter such disputes, however, since a weaker and easier strategy should be enough for my purposes. Instead of explaining what logical notions are and then show that metaphysical notions satisfy the same or a similar account, I just point to several analogies between metaphysics and Logic making the idea that they are analogous appealing. Although this cannot establish my thesis in a definitive way, it still renders the logical understanding of metaphysics an option worth exploring.

14First of all, metaphysical investigations often start from apparent inconsistencies or paradoxes that involve nothing but trivial assumptions and logical inferences. Think of the puzzle of the ship of Theseus or the Sorites paradox. Solving a paradox, however, is eminently a logical task. It requires a specification of the principles involved in the argument and a possible rejection or revision of some of them. We have then a first analogy: both metaphysics and Logic thrive on paradoxes.

15Another simple fact that pushes metaphysics towards the formal sciences instead of the natural ones is that metaphysicians are often interested in abstract entities, which can hardly be investigated by elaborating experiments to test a theory or to extract information directly. This clearly is not to say that empirical findings and datas cannot be metaphysically relevant, but it shows that the role of experience must be of a different sort from the one played in natural science. If abstract entities help see metaphysics at least as a formal science, other features exhibit a stricter similarity with Logic itself.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this section, the author explores the analogies between Logic and metaphysics to support the idea that they are similar enough to be treated in the same way. The author acknowledges that both the understanding of logical notions and their epistemology are subject to ongoing debates, but proposes a weaker strategy based on analogies rather than delving into detailed explanations.One analogy highlighted is that both metaphysics and Logic often begin with apparent inconsistencies or paradoxes that involve trivial assumptions and logical inferences. The process of solving these paradoxes is inherently a logical task, requiring the specification of principles involved and potentially revising or rejecting some of them. This shared characteristic points to the first analogy: both metaphysics and Logic thrive on paradoxes.Another aspect that distinguishes metaphysics from natural sciences is that metaphysicians are frequently interested in abstract entities. These entities are not easily investigated through experiments or direct extraction of information, indicating that the role of experience in metaphysics is different from that in natural sciences. While empirical findings can be relevant in metaphysics, the focus on abstract entities aligns metaphysics more with formal sciences.The author suggests that other features of metaphysics exhibit a closer similarity with Logic itself. However, further elaboration on these features is not provided in the excerpt.Overall, the analogies presented in this section support the notion that metaphysics and Logic share common characteristics and provide a reason to explore the logical understanding of metaphysics as a viable option. Although the analogies do not definitively establish the thesis, they render the idea of metaphysics as akin to Logic worth considering.1 / 1Have they mentioned anything about active inference or symbolic reasoning?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTNo, in the provided text, there is no mention of active inference or symbolic reasoning. The text primarily focuses on the epistemic legitimacy of metaphysics as an armchair discipline and the analogies between metaphysics and Logic. It discusses how metaphysics can be understood as a form of Logic, particularly through the intertwining of applications of logic, mathematical logic, and philosophy of logic.The text does not touch upon the concepts of active inference or symbolic reasoning in this context. Instead, it addresses the relationship between metaphysics and logic, the nature of their inquiries, and the potential similarities between the two disciplines. The specific concepts of active inference and symbolic reasoning are not covered in this excerpt.1 / 1What does legitimacy of metaphysics as an armchair discipline mean? Is it a joke?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe legitimacy of metaphysics as an armchair discipline refers to the question of whether metaphysics, particularly analytic metaphysics, can be considered a valid and acceptable field of philosophical inquiry conducted through a priori reasoning, also known as the armchair methodology. It is not meant as a joke; rather, it is a serious topic of philosophical discussion and debate.Traditionally, metaphysics has been criticized for relying heavily on a priori reasoning, which involves contemplating abstract concepts and principles without relying on empirical evidence or direct observation. Some critics argue that this armchair methodology lacks a solid epistemic foundation and may lead to unfounded speculations or empty, disconnected theories.However, proponents of metaphysics defend its legitimacy as an armchair discipline by contending that it is still a valuable and informative way to explore fundamental questions about reality, existence, and the nature of the world. They argue that a priori reasoning, when used judiciously and rigorously, can provide insights into the nature of reality that are not attainable through empirical methods alone.The excerpt provided in the previous responses presents an argument in defense of the legitimacy of metaphysics as an armchair discipline, drawing analogies between metaphysics and logic to support the idea that they share common characteristics and that metaphysics can be considered a form of logic. While the question of the legitimacy of metaphysics as an armchair discipline is a serious philosophical matter, the specific argument provided in the excerpt may require further examination and scrutiny in a broader context.1 / 15.

10 See Morganti and Tahko (2017).
11 I put questions of logical pluralism aside for the sake of simplicity.
16One of these similarities is generality. The categories metaphysics employs cover an extremely variegate kind of entities. We can, i.e., speak of the properties of cats but also of the properties of sets, of molecules, of sunsets, of laws, and so on. Given such a generality, it comes as no surprise that specific empirical findings are often useless and mere simplifications of scientific results are enough.10 The same kind of generality and the ensuing limited relevance of new empirical findings can be found also in Logic. For instance, we are supposed to exploit a conjunctive connective in arguments about cats, sets, molecules, sunsets, laws, and so on. Accordingly, it might be suggested that we are supposed to apply the same metaphysical notions (such as modality, property or parthood) in every area in the same way we are supposed to apply the same notion of conjunction.111 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this section, the author explores the analogies between Logic and metaphysics to support the idea that they are similar enough to be considered of the same sort and treated in the same way.The first analogy discussed is that both metaphysics and Logic often start with apparent inconsistencies or paradoxes that involve trivial assumptions and logical inferences. When resolving such paradoxes, metaphysicians and logicians both engage in a logical task, which requires specifying the principles involved in the argument and possibly revising or rejecting some of them. This analogy highlights that both disciplines thrive on paradoxes as a means of inquiry and problem-solving.Another similarity noted is that metaphysicians are often interested in abstract entities, which are not easily investigated through experiments or direct empirical data extraction. While empirical findings and data can be relevant in metaphysics, the role of experience is different from that in natural sciences, where empirical research plays a central role.Generality is identified as another shared characteristic between metaphysics and Logic. Metaphysics employs categories that cover a wide range of entities, allowing for discussions about properties of cats, sets, molecules, sunsets, laws, and more. Similarly, Logic utilizes universal connectives like conjunction that apply across various domains. This suggests that the same metaphysical notions can be applied in different areas just as the same logical notions are applied in different contexts.The author acknowledges that explaining the exact nature of logical notions and their epistemology can be challenging and subject to ongoing debates. Instead of delving into these debates, the author opts for pointing to the analogies between metaphysics and Logic as a weaker, but still valuable, strategy to explore the logical understanding of metaphysics.Overall, the presented section does not mention active inference or symbolic reasoning but focuses on demonstrating the similarities and analogies between metaphysics and Logic to support the idea that they can be treated in a comparable manner.1 / 117The pervasive indifference to experience connected to generality is a trait common to both metaphysics and Logic that is worth emphasizing on its own. Rival metaphysical views are typically compatible with all empirical information that could be gathered even in highly idealized conditions. What source of experiment could we arrange to settle the puzzle of the ship of Theseus or the problem of universals? It is straightforward to see the analogies with Logic, since also Logic exhibits a similar kind of radical empirical indeterminacy. For instance, how can we empirically decide whether excluded middle is a logical law or whether logical consequence is transitive? For both metaphysics and Logic, experience and natural science seems relevant, at most, at a very general level and only exceptionally â and highly controversially â in particular cases.

12 See Russell (1940).
18A fourth analogy derives from the strict relation with language. The nature of some significant metaphysical notions is so strictly entrenched with language that it is a reasonable view that of considering them as the manifestation of an entirely linguistic and not of a worldly phenomenon. A shining example is that of modality. Although the old orthodox position locating it in language instead of things is no longer dominant, it is not absurd. Analogously, one can reasonably wonder whether logical laws reflect universal principles grounded in reality or just embody the particular behaviour of certain linguistic expressions. The strict analogy between metaphysics and Logic strikes again.12

19The possible linguistic source of metaphysical phenomena leads to a further interesting feature. Metaphysicians often consider notions whose treatment has a prominent inferential aspect. What I mean is that to enlighten a metaphysical notion, an important part of the work is often that of specifying the principles that govern it or connecting it with other notions. In the best (and seldom realized) case this results in a definition, but in the most frequent scenario we just have general principles networking the notion under study with other concepts. A clear example is provided by mereology. A standard presentation of mereology starts with an illustration of core principles that are assumed to capture a core set of axioms characterizing the notion of parthood. Mereologists then proceed to discuss what other principles should be added to this minimal theory of parthood. Clearly, this approach is nothing but a process of yielding a logical or a formal theory.

20Sixth, both metaphysicians and logicians are both eminently interested in establishing the consequences of certain claims or what follows from what. Logicians make the very relation of logical entailment one of the key topic of their study. Analogously, metaphysicians are often interested in figuring out what is entailed by a certain view. For instance, they want to know what are the consequences of nominalism or whether it is compatible with modal realism. The emphasis on conditional claims and on the logical consequences of certain premises prompts another analogy between metaphysics and Logic.

21Finally, the apparent harmless nature of the pre-theoretical considerations exploited by logicians seems to be exhibited also by those used by metaphysicians. Exactly as it seems preposterous to question the principle of excluded middle or the transitivity of the relation of logical consequence before having developed serious arguments, it would be absurd to question the legitimacy of many metaphysical background assumptions without specific reasons. For instance, a traditional source of metaphysical speculation is provided by arguments such as: âthe statue on my desk was made this morning; the lump of clay on my desk has existed for a long time; so the statue on my desk is distinct from the lump of clay on my desk; so distinct material objects sometimes spatially coincideâ. This is a case where no explicit justification of the (possible) truth of the premises is put forward because it would be completely trivial. Even under this respect the practice of metaphysicians seems to parallel that of logicians.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn the following part of the text, the author highlights additional analogies between metaphysics and Logic:Pervasive indifference to experience and generality: Both metaphysics and Logic exhibit a characteristic indifference to specific empirical information, as they deal with abstract and general concepts. Metaphysical views are often compatible with all empirical information, and logical laws themselves are not empirically determined. Experience and natural science are relevant only at a very general level and rarely in specific cases for both metaphysics and Logic.Strict relation with language: Certain significant metaphysical notions are so closely tied to language that they can be seen as manifestations of linguistic phenomena rather than worldly phenomena. The example of modality is given, where the view of modality as grounded in language is reasonable. Similarly, logical laws might reflect universal principles grounded in reality or simply embody the behavior of specific linguistic expressions, showing the strict analogy between metaphysics and Logic in this regard.Emphasis on inferential aspect: Both metaphysics and Logic involve an important aspect of specifying principles and connecting concepts. For metaphysics, this entails defining or networking the notion under study with other concepts. For example, mereologists develop principles characterizing parthood and then discuss additional principles to enrich the theory. This process is akin to yielding a logical or formal theory.Interest in establishing consequences: Metaphysicians and logicians are both interested in determining the consequences of certain claims or what follows from specific views. Logicians study the relation of logical entailment, while metaphysicians explore the consequences of various metaphysical positions. This emphasis on conditional claims and logical consequences creates another analogy between metaphysics and Logic.Harmless nature of pre-theoretical considerations: Both metaphysicians and logicians often rely on pre-theoretical considerations without explicitly justifying them because they are considered trivial or obvious. For instance, certain metaphysical speculations may rest on seemingly obvious premises, just as logicians assume basic principles like the excluded middle or the transitivity of logical consequence. This parallels the practice of both disciplines, where certain background assumptions are taken for granted without extensive justification.Overall, the author presents these analogies to strengthen the idea that metaphysics and Logic share common features and that metaphysics can be seen as a form of logic. These similarities suggest that the logical understanding of metaphysics is a viable and appealing option to explore.1 / 16. Stating the view
22Given the above analogies, I think that considering metaphysics a form of Logic is far from being a peregrine view. However, a couple of remarks to comment the above considerations are important. First of all, I do not consider the mentioned features exhaustive. Indeed, I believe that other similarities between Logic and metaphysics can be found. Secondly, I am not claiming that the similarities are always perfect. For instance, one can reasonably argue that if inferential principles and axioms could be enough to fix the meaning of logical expressions, some metaphysical notions are different. The axioms of minimal mereology, e.g., are not enough to distinguish a notion of parthood from a generic partial order. Beside the inferential part, we need to ground the expression somehow referentially. Still, I think that a case can be made that also in such cases the analogies are stronger with formal sciences than with natural sciences. Take for instance natural numbers. A first order formalization of arithmetic (such as Peano Arithmetic) is not able to pick out the standard model, so that we have a lot of possible interpretations compatible with those axioms. However, empirical methods do not seem apt to shed light on natural numbers and mathematicians just keep looking for axioms and relying on armchair investigations. Analogously, even if some referential practice is needed to fix the meaning of metaphysical notions such as âparthoodâ, its reference can hardly provide a direct object of research. We cannot discover the nature of parthood by analysing parts in the same way we do, for instance, with specific natural kinds such as water. Thirdly, I do not want to contend that the above similarities hold in the same way in every branch of metaphysics, but I still think that the analogies, imperfect and partial as they may be, put us on the right track for several reasons. After all, the hypothesis could be useful to make sense at least of certain aspects of metaphysical inquiries without having to vindicate it in its totality. Even if the proposal succeeded in making sense only of a limited kind of approach, we would have at least secured some amount of metaphysical speculation. Alternatively, a more radical viewed could be tempted. We could say that those investigations requiring more than a logical approach should not be considered as entirely metaphysical. Perhaps in certain areas we use the label âmetaphysicsâ where what we actually have is a mixture of metaphysics (as Logic), philosophy of a particular natural science and that very particular natural science (think, for instance, of the metaphysics of time). Finally, let me stress that even if metaphysics did not perfectly match Logic, we could still take the logical interpretation as a working hypothesis to be evaluated for its theoretical virtues. The above analogies then should be taken more as motivations than as conclusive claims. This approach would lead to a prescriptive version of the proposal. In other words, if the identification of metaphysics and Logic proved fruitful, we could read it in a prescriptive sense according to the maxim: identify metaphysical inquiries on X with the inquiries that can be identified with the study of the Logic of X (in a broad sense)! In this way, purely metaphysical approaches could perhaps have their domain limited, but their theoretical legitimacy would be retained. Stressing this prescriptive approach, we could read the maxim not just as dictating an interpretative view, but also an operative one: Do the metaphysics of X as you were studying the Logic of X! My idea is that the resulting discipline would still significantly overlap with traditional metaphysics, so that the prescription would not be completely revisionary.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn this section, the author acknowledges that the analogies between metaphysics and Logic are not exhaustive, and there might be other similarities yet to be explored. They also admit that the similarities are not always perfect, as some metaphysical notions may require both inferential principles and referential grounding. However, the author argues that even in cases where referential practices are needed, the analogies still hold stronger with formal sciences, like Logic, than with natural sciences.The author also clarifies that they are not claiming that the above similarities hold uniformly across all branches of metaphysics. Some areas of metaphysics may require additional approaches beyond a purely logical one. However, the proposal is seen as a useful and motivating perspective for understanding certain aspects of metaphysical inquiries without necessarily being a comprehensive or conclusive claim.Moreover, the author presents the idea that if the logical interpretation proves to be fruitful, it could be adopted as a working hypothesis to evaluate its theoretical virtues. They propose a prescriptive version of the proposal, suggesting that purely metaphysical approaches could be limited to inquiries that can be identified with the study of the Logic of a specific domain. This would not entirely revise traditional metaphysics but would provide a theoretical framework for certain metaphysical investigations.Overall, the approach is seen as offering motivations and guiding principles rather than providing definitive answers, and it could potentially lead to a significant overlap between traditional metaphysics and the proposed logical interpretation.1 / 123For the sake of clarity, let me rephrase the above proposal in different words. The analogies give enough ground to put forward the idea that metaphysics could be understood as a mere form of Logic. Indeed, given that the aspects related to the applications of logic and to the pure mathematical study of a theory are not eminently philosophical, one had better focus on the philosophical side of the story. Metaphysics would mostly be viewed as the philosophy of certain philosophical logics. Accordingly, we should see the metaphysics of parthood as the philosophy of formal mereology, the metaphysics of modality as the philosophy of modal logic, the metaphysics of fundamentality as the philosophy of the logic of grounding, the metaphysics of time as the philosophy of temporal logic, the metaphysics of dispositions as the philosophy of the logic of powers,13 and so on and so forth. To be precise, the idea is better stated as claiming that metaphysics can be regarded as a part of philosophy of logic, since the latter could include topics usually considered with little or no metaphysical interest.

1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn summary, the proposal can be rephrased as follows: The analogies between metaphysics and Logic provide sufficient grounds to suggest that metaphysics can be understood as a mere form of Logic. The aspects related to the applications of logic and the pure mathematical study of theories are not inherently philosophical, so the focus should be on the philosophical side of the story. Metaphysics, in this view, would largely be seen as the philosophy of certain philosophical logics.More precisely, the proposal suggests that metaphysics can be regarded as a part of philosophy of logic, as the latter could encompass topics that are typically considered to have little or no metaphysical interest. For example, the metaphysics of parthood could be seen as the philosophy of formal mereology, the metaphysics of modality as the philosophy of modal logic, the metaphysics of fundamentality as the philosophy of the logic of grounding, and so on.The proposal acknowledges that there might be two main conceptions of metaphysics, and it appears to align with the one that views metaphysics as closely related to the study of logic and its philosophical implications. However, the author also notes that some critics, while criticizing classical analytic metaphysics, make exceptions for certain topics that they see as more closely linked to philosophy of logic.1 / 124Are there significant aspects of metaphysical inquiry that escape such a conception of metaphysics as Logic? I do not think that the answer is easy, and, personally, I tend to give a negative answer. But that is not the point. If nothing is left out by this view then the better for my proposal. If something is left out, then we can either reject it as an illegitimate form of metaphysics or propose a different account integrating the view.14 I do not intend here to exclude the latter strategy, since I just want to stress the perks of accepting a possibly partial understanding of metaphysics as the philosophy of philosophical logic, or, more generally, as Logic. This solution would provide a satisfying, and basically easy reply to the epistemic challenge to metaphysics that would preserve its theoretical autonomy. Moreover, it would apparently be able to vindicate a significant amount of the actual practice of contemporary analytic metaphysicians. Of course, we still have to provide a more throughout account of the epistemology of Logic, enlightening its nature and defending the legitimacy of its armchair methodology. However, this is a different and possibly easier task. If the critics of metaphysics are not seriously worried by the theoretical legitimacy of Logic, they should not be worried by metaphysics as well.15

25I conclude this section by pointing first to some samples of metaphysical work that fit the proposed picture, and then by discussing a typical example that seems to provide an hard case for my approach. On the positive side, a good amount of metaphysical works on modality, or on the relation between modal logic and essentialism16 are easily regarded examples of my view. Temporal logic offers similar instances,17 and many works on vagueness18 and mereology19 fit the story, as recent works on grounding as well.20 Indeed, I should stress the clear analogies between this kind of studies and typical researchers in contemporary philosophy of logic.21 The rise of formal methods and the similarities with researches in philosophy of logic should not even strike the reader as unexpected news. My approach just takes this trend seriously and gestures towards a complete amalgamation of the two ingredients. As a seemingly recalcitrant case consider instead a classic book such as Plantingaâs The nature of Necessity.22 Plantingaâs discussion is conducted without reference to any specific logic and it is not even clear if it could be articulated in terms of a logical framework.23 Thus, an important piece of contemporary metaphysics seems to escape my proposal. To relent the worry raised by this and many other similar metaphysical works, I can invoke one of the main historical roles performed by philosophy, namely its contribution to the creation of specific sciences. By promoting theoretical reflections on particular topics, philosophical investigations can, and often do, precede the born of a corresponding science. This is important because it enlightens a crucial aspect: to some extent, philosophy of logic and of particular logics as well, can also be conducted independently from the details of a formal system. This can be the case, for instance, when general notions or basic foundational issues are discussed. If we can legitimately speak of philosophy of logic insofar as a certain debate focuses on logical notions, then the proposal is not immediately undermined or limited by the existence of important works in metaphysics that cannot be related to a specific logical framework. Thus, to overcome the objection it is enough to show that metaphysical notions are better understood as logical notions. A claim I already argued for.

7. Conclusion
26Metaphysics is frequently attacked for its armchair methodology. In a sense, the initial worry was motivated by the temptation to align metaphysics with natural science. A temptation that, according to my view, should be resisted. In this paper, I have argued that the theoretical right to conduct metaphysics from the armchair can be defended by understanding it as a form of Logic. Given that, in the case of Logic, an armchair approach is considered viable, the same would straightforwardly hold for metaphysics too. Thus, although I have left the problem of the epistemology of Logic open, the proposed identification represents an important progress. Indeed, metaphysicians should stop worrying that there might be something especially problematic about their enterprise, let alone burn their armchairs.

23 Given the importance of Lewisâ On the plurality of Worlds (1986) let me briefly comment on it. On the one hand the considerations offered for Plantingaâs book can be straightforwardly extended to cover also Lewisâ. On the other hand, it is much less clear that Lewisâ discussion does not (at least also) pertain to philosophy of modal logic, as witnessed e.g., by his discussion in section 1.2.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn the proposed view, metaphysics is regarded as a form of Logic due to the analogies between the two fields. However, the author acknowledges that this view may not capture all aspects of metaphysical inquiry, and there might be some areas that escape this conception. If there are aspects of metaphysics that do not fit within this logical understanding, the proposal suggests two potential courses of action. One option is to reject those aspects as illegitimate forms of metaphysics. The other option is to propose a different account that integrates the logical understanding while accommodating those aspects.The author emphasizes that the proposal is not meant to be an exhaustive account of metaphysics but rather a suggestive framework based on the identified analogies. It aims to provide a theoretical autonomy to metaphysics and defend its armchair methodology. The proposal aligns with the contemporary trend of using formal methods and emphasizes the similarities between certain metaphysical investigations and typical research in philosophy of logic.To illustrate the compatibility between metaphysics and Logic, the author points to works on modality, temporal logic, vagueness, mereology, and grounding as examples that fit well within the proposed view. However, certain classic works in metaphysics, such as Plantinga's "The Nature of Necessity," might appear to escape this logical understanding. In response, the author suggests that such works may have contributed to the creation of specific sciences, and philosophy, in general, plays a role in reflecting on particular topics before the establishment of corresponding sciences.In conclusion, the proposal aims to show that metaphysics can be seen as a form of Logic, which would justify its armchair methodology and theoretical autonomy. While it may not capture every aspect of metaphysical inquiry, the proposal presents a promising approach to understand metaphysics as closely related to philosophical logic.1 / 1PER CITARE QUESTO ARTICOLO

Metaphysics has been criticized for its reliance on a priori reasoning without empirical investigations. Strollo argues that by understanding metaphysics as a form of logic, these criticisms can be addressed. He proposes that metaphysics can be seen as the philosophy of certain philosophical logics, such as modal logic, temporal logic, and mereology.Strollo identifies several analogies between metaphysics and logic to support his proposal. Both disciplines deal with abstract entities and thrive on paradoxes. Moreover, they are characterized by generality, pervasive indifference to experience, and a close relationship with language. Additionally, both disciplines seek to establish consequences and rely on pre-theoretical considerations.Strollo acknowledges that his view may not capture all aspects of metaphysical inquiry, but he argues that it provides a viable and legitimate framework for a significant portion of metaphysical investigations. He suggests that if certain metaphysical inquiries cannot be integrated into this logical understanding, they may either be considered illegitimate forms of metaphysics or be addressed through alternative accounts. Nonetheless, the proposed identification of metaphysics as logic offers a way to vindicate its armchair methodology and preserve its theoretical autonomy.1 / 1I think it is unclear what they are advocating.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYou are correct; the paper's argument can be somewhat challenging to follow. In essence, the author is advocating for the epistemic legitimacy of metaphysics as an armchair discipline by understanding it as a form of logic. They propose that metaphysics can be seen as the philosophy of certain philosophical logics, such as modal logic, temporal logic, and mereology.The author presents several analogies between metaphysics and logic to support their proposal, highlighting similarities in dealing with abstract entities, addressing paradoxes, generality, indifference to experience, and a close relationship with language. They argue that these similarities make the logical understanding of metaphysics a plausible and viable option.While acknowledging that their view may not capture all aspects of metaphysical inquiry, the author believes that it provides a satisfactory framework for a significant portion of metaphysical investigations. They suggest that any metaphysical inquiries that do not fit within this logical understanding could be considered illegitimate or addressed through alternative accounts.In conclusion, the author proposes that viewing metaphysics as logic offers a way to justify its armchair methodology and retain its theoretical autonomy, providing a way to make sense of metaphysical inquiries without aligning them strictly with natural sciences. However, it is important to note that the proposed identification of metaphysics as logic may not cover all instances of metaphysical inquiries, and there might be other perspectives worth exploring.1 / 1Here is a question from Quora. Does any one really use first-order logic?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, first-order logic is widely used in various fields, including mathematics, computer science, philosophy, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. It serves as the foundation for formal reasoning and has become a fundamental tool for expressing and analyzing logical relationships and arguments.In mathematics, first-order logic is extensively employed to define and reason about mathematical structures and theories. Many mathematical theories, such as set theory, group theory, and number theory, are formulated using first-order logic.In computer science, first-order logic is used in formal verification, theorem proving, and artificial intelligence. It is essential in defining the syntax and semantics of programming languages and logical frameworks.In philosophy, first-order logic is applied to formalize arguments, analyze philosophical concepts, and explore philosophical theories and systems.In linguistics, first-order logic is used to model the structure and semantics of natural language sentences.Moreover, many automated reasoning systems, theorem provers, and model checkers rely on first-order logic to perform formal verification of software and hardware systems.While first-order logic has its limitations, such as inability to capture certain complex phenomena or express higher-order quantification, it remains a powerful and widely used formal system for formal reasoning in various disciplines. In certain cases, higher-order logics or more expressive formal systems may be necessary, but first-order logic remains a fundamental and practical choice for many applications.1 / 1Here is the answer: No, they donât, because it doesnât tell you anything that you donât already know.

Itâs easy to multiply two numbers the old-fashioned way, but virtually impossible if you try to do so using FOL.

And if you do use FOL to find the answer to some problem, you wonât know that it gave you the right answer unless you already know the answer.

Plus, the intellectual resources needed to convert even the most elementary math problems into FOL vastly exceed the resources needed to solve those problems on their own terms.

There is also the fact that any given system of logic, being a recursively generated statement-set, is ipso facto undefined with respect to non-recursive setsâand is therefore undefined with respect to all but a vanishingly small subset of the set of mathematical propositions.

FOL is an attempt to identify existing forms of mathematical reasoning.

Itâs a theory, in other words.

And itâs not a very good one, as weâve just seen.

The same goes for âmodal logicâ and all of the other FOL-spinoffs.

These are garbage disciplines.

(Graduated 2006) . 1y1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe answer provided by John-Michael Kuczynski is a subjective and contentious opinion. While it is true that first-order logic (FOL) has its limitations and may not be suitable for every problem or context, it is still an essential and widely used tool in many fields, as mentioned in my previous response.Let's address some of the points raised in the answer:FOL can be used to represent and reason about mathematical structures and theories. While it may not be the most efficient method for certain calculations like multiplying large numbers, it is valuable for formalizing mathematical statements, proving theorems, and analyzing mathematical systems.The claim that using FOL to find answers to problems requires already knowing the answer is not accurate. FOL allows for deductive reasoning, where conclusions can be derived from premises, and it does not rely on already knowing the outcome.The argument that converting elementary math problems into FOL requires vast intellectual resources is misleading. Once a formalization has been established for a specific mathematical domain, it can be applied systematically to various problems within that domain.The statement that FOL is undefined with respect to non-recursive sets is misleading. FOL can handle various types of mathematical propositions, including those involving infinite sets.Describing FOL and other logical systems as "garbage disciplines" is a subjective evaluation and not supported by the widespread use and practical applications of these systems in various fields.In summary, while it is true that FOL has limitations and may not be the best choice for all situations, it remains a foundational and valuable tool for formal reasoning and analysis in many areas of study and research. Different logical systems, including higher-order logics and modal logics, offer additional expressive power and may be more suitable for certain specialized contexts, but this does not diminish the significance and relevance of first-order logic.1 / 1There are 5 other answers: Nathan Coppedge - Following

I have a writing that uses what could be construed as first-order logic in the sense of whole predicates being used as sets. They are generally of the order of Socrates is a man, and all men are mortal etc. It is useful for defining All vs. Some in relation to And and Or: Nathan Coppedge's answer to When facing an AI, is there anything for us to be proud of just because we're humans? (Below)

A given politics is not always philosophy and a given philosophy is not always wise.

If only philosophy can be wise, and wisdom is required to be right, then NO politics is always right.

I have no idea where you got racism from an A.I. debate.

Do you see programmers as white?

Do you think A.I. is prejudiced?

Do not assume anything.

My philosophy discusses race sometimes, even though I'm white. Maybe that's what you mean by racist?

My philosophy may be easy to find on the web, but it is not popular with academic philosophers. Most philosophers are extreme skeptics who do not believe much of anything can be supported with an argument.

Additionally, I will note that my philosophy systems are not racist. That means black people are just as superior as whites, Asians, or anyone else in this system.

Also, there is nothing about being âwhiteâ that makes it easier or more appropriate to make a system.

Basically someone of any race can be superior for the following reasons (actually, this is not expressly a part of my philosophy, just a special analysis of the concept of superiority):

They are leaders.
They are strong.
They are valuable.
They are smart.
They are necessary.
Etc etc.
It turns out everyone is best at being themselves by definition if for no other reason, because everyone is either powerful or efficient or cheap or interesting, or the only means to an end, or maybe a few other somewhat equal categories.

In a sense, the only inequality is a priority for one thing over another. The worst things are the popular things, and we can't blame people for hating the unpopular things. That doesn't make whites or blacks or Asians inherently popular or unpopular.

My sense is whites are treated as smarter AND stupider, blacks have sex and feel abused but definitely have more cultural feelings, Asian women are seen as more exotic but less like a whore and also more like a space alien but also smarter, Asian men usually are smarter than whites and blacks but have smaller bodies, etc etc. Sometimes the most successful people have been miserable or done something to benefit humanity. You can't assume life is unequal unless you think evil is winning, or unless experience adds up over time, or if someone really is a superior individual.

Of course, the question itself should be taken with a grain of salt.

Let me explain myself: I've had a splitting headache my whole life. I've never had sex. I'm good with categories. I'm not depressed. I have an embarrassing set of ears. I'm technically not a genius. Iâm white. Iâm not very strong. Iâm not gay, but people think Iâm gay. This is not all my problems. Iâm also poor and my body looks effeminate. I hate to say this, but Iâm also antisocial, have no friends, and have been diagnosed crazy since 2002. How is this unfair for black people?

If I'm one in a million at being messed up, then what if most other white people are not one in a million at anything? Isn't that just as bad as being hated by some white people?

By the way, Western Philosophy and Western Way do not mean the same thing at all. Western Philosophy just means philosophy from particular geographic regions. It in no way implies a particular racial background or view on race.

Some philosophers think discussion of race with the assumption of racism is what is racist, and racism should be treated independently of philosophy as a result.

âWestern Wayâ even in an unimaginably gentle sense is never implied by Western Philosophy, unless the discussion concerns the narrow area of racism (e.g. the culturo-centric philosophy of the Western Way), or something like the Eastern-vs-Western philosophy debate (which is purportedly about philosophy not race).

Such philosophers may even put African or Afro-American culture on a pedestal in the same book where they discuss the Western Way. These books that discuss the Western Way seem to be outdated, long since replaced with books about globalization and the anthropic principle.

A lot of philosophers prefer to keep racism at arms length, and not to discuss race except through politics and social philosophy.

Many non-black philosophers do not assume race is a primary issue, and so to them race issues often seem like a philosophical bias that makes philosophy too narrow.

So a philosopher might say that black people can be proud of being black people just as a systemologist can be proud of being a systemologist. It's a matter of how things are qualified and what happens to be right (NOT 'conservative rightâ but 'justâ or 'wiseâ. Politics is not always philosophy, and philosophy is not always wise. If only philosophy can be wise, and wisdom is required to be right, then NO politics is always right).

I may add, some areas like aesthetics are not considered social philosophy or metaphysics, and I do not expect ANY philosophers to be a member of racist groups.
1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIt seems that the provided text is a collection of various thoughts and statements by the user, Nathan Coppedge, and it covers a range of topics, including first-order logic, AI, racism, philosophy, and personal experiences. However, there isn't a clear and coherent question or argument in this text.Regarding first-order logic (FOL), the text mentions using whole predicates as sets, which is a common technique in FOL. However, the connection between FOL and AI is not entirely clear, and the text also goes on to discuss race and superiority, which seems unrelated to the topic of FOL.It is essential to note that the views expressed in this text are the opinions of the user, and they may not represent widely accepted or mainstream perspectives on the topics discussed.If you have a specific question related to first-order logic or any other topic, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to provide a clear and informative answer.1 / 1This answer is from Gabriel Tonini: from my study of philosophy (on the internet for free), first-order logic is used in many everyday arguments, but not to solve very specific problems, since in philosophy, arguments like Aristotleâs function argument and Spinozaâs pantheistic God argument, some nth order logic is used, like Spinozaâs argument can be phrased and proved with second-order logic. The point is not to have a real-world use of this since we can usually just use our brain unconsciously to conclude simple things, but in philosophy, if you have a fairly simple metaphysical or existence argument (like âthe existence of Godâ type arguments), I have seen first-order logic or some similar nth order logic be used to prove them. It is mainly for abstract purposes, but in mathematics, and set theory, first-order logic is somewhat of a basis.

On the contrary, you likely will never see someone prove something with nth order logic in stem since they usually prove using a more specific and elaborate system such as set theory or category theory.

It is worth learning it if you are going to do stem sometime, as you can get a lot of âlogical thinkingâ from it. I find this buzz term vague but think of it like this: you are going to improve your proof/argumentation skills.

note that I have never attended any university and havenât published any paper, basically, I am just some IP address trying to learn stuff.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTGabriel Tonini's answer provides a helpful perspective on the use of first-order logic (FOL) in philosophy and other fields. Here are the main points from the answer:In philosophy, FOL is commonly used in everyday arguments, especially for simple metaphysical or existence arguments (e.g., arguments about the existence of God). However, more complex arguments in philosophy may require higher-order logic, such as second-order logic.The primary purpose of using FOL or higher-order logic in philosophy is for abstract and theoretical purposes, not necessarily for practical real-world applications.In mathematics and set theory, FOL serves as a foundational basis for reasoning and proofs.In STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), more specific and elaborate systems, such as set theory or category theory, are often used for proving mathematical theorems and solving problems.Learning FOL can enhance one's logical thinking and proof/argumentation skills, which can be valuable in various fields, including STEM.Overall, the answer suggests that while FOL may not be extensively used in practical applications, it is essential for developing logical reasoning and critical thinking skills, which can be beneficial in various academic and intellectual pursuits.1 / 1Iâll try a speculative answer. I donât know whether first order logic is directly implemented in ai but for the sake of argument letâs say it is not.

Most model theorists usually work in first order logic. One can clearly do model theory in higher order logics however it is not as âniceâ as first order model theory. For example (in the standard semantics) second order logic does not admit a sound, effective and complete proof calculus. Lowenheim-Skolem theorem is also weird in HOL.

Also, we model HOL in a way on first order logic. We usually try to see the whether the nice properties of first order logic are still valid in higher order logics (or even other different sorts of logic). So I think yes. It is necessary to learn first order logic.

UÄur Efem- 
PhD in Mathematics, University of Oxford
(Graduated 2019) . 6y1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTUÄur Efem's speculative answer provides valuable insights from the perspective of model theory and higher-order logic. Here are the main points from the answer:Model theorists primarily work in first-order logic (FOL), and while it is possible to do model theory in higher-order logics (HOL), FOL is considered "nicer" in many respects.Second-order logic (SOL) does not admit a sound, effective, and complete proof calculus in the standard semantics, making FOL more appealing for formal reasoning.The properties of FOL serve as a foundational basis for modeling higher-order logics and other types of logics. Researchers often investigate whether the desirable properties of FOL still hold in higher-order logics or other logic systems.Even if FOL is not directly implemented in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, learning FOL is necessary for gaining a deep understanding of logic and formal reasoning, which can be applicable in various fields, including AI and mathematics.Overall, the answer highlights the importance of learning FOL as a fundamental logic system that underpins many other logic formalisms. While FOL may not be directly utilized in AI, its principles and properties are essential for developing logical thinking and engaging with more complex logical systems like HOL.1 / 1The author of one of the answers has written a six minute mini-audiobook about it: Description
Symbolic logic is a heap of bureaucratic

doesn't clarify; it obfuscates. The reason
is that greater resources of intellect and

The Lie of the Discipline of Symbolic
Logic1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe mini-audiobook by John-Michael Kuczynski presents a critical perspective on symbolic logic, portraying it as a bureaucratic and obfuscating discipline that fails to clarify problems effectively. The author argues that using symbolic logic requires more intellectual and energy resources than directly solving the problems at hand, making it a form of mathematical failure.The audiobook challenges the value and utility of symbolic logic, suggesting that it may not be the most efficient or practical approach to problem-solving. However, it is important to note that this is the author's viewpoint, and other scholars and experts may hold different opinions on the subject.The audiobook was released on April 24, 2020, and is approximately six minutes long, with Trevor Clinger serving as the narrator. As with any critical work, listeners should consider multiple perspectives and evaluate the arguments presented to form their own conclusions about symbolic logic and its role in various disciplines.1 / 1I think his claim is that it is is just a bunch of beaurocratic bullsh*t that undergraduates are forced to do to humiliate them and it is a menial task that robots can do and should, and that it doesn't really predict or prove your ability to solve real world problems.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTBased on the description of the mini-audiobook, it appears that John-Michael Kuczynski's claim is that symbolic logic is perceived as a bureaucratic task, possibly forced upon undergraduates as a form of humiliation. He argues that it is a menial task that can be performed by robots and that it does not effectively predict or prove one's ability to solve real-world problems.Kuczynski's viewpoint suggests that symbolic logic may not be seen as a valuable or meaningful endeavor, and he questions its relevance in practical problem-solving scenarios. He seems to imply that the emphasis on symbolic logic in certain educational settings might not be aligned with real-world problem-solving skills and that it may not be a useful indicator of one's abilities in practical situations.It's important to recognize that this viewpoint represents a specific perspective on the subject of symbolic logic, and others may have different opinions and experiences regarding its utility and significance in various fields and educational contexts. Evaluating the merits of symbolic logic and its relevance in problem-solving requires considering a range of viewpoints and assessing its applications in different domains.1 / 1How does this compare to his answer on Quora?1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTUpon comparing John-Michael Kuczynski's answer on Quora with the description of his mini-audiobook, we can see that they both express a similar sentiment regarding symbolic logic. In both instances, Kuczynski criticizes symbolic logic, emphasizing that it is not a valuable or effective tool for problem-solving and may not accurately predict one's abilities in practical scenarios.In his Quora answer, Kuczynski argues that first-order logic (FOL) is not used to solve specific problems, and the intellectual resources required to use FOL to solve even elementary math problems exceed the resources needed to solve them in more conventional ways. He also suggests that the use of higher-order logics in philosophy can be complex and not as "nice" as first-order logic, making it less practical.Similarly, in the description of his mini-audiobook, Kuczynski calls symbolic logic a "heap of bureaucratic protocols posing as a discipline" and claims that it obfuscates rather than clarifies. He reiterates that it requires greater intellectual and energy resources than are needed for direct problem-solving. His stance remains critical of the perceived usefulness and value of symbolic logic.Both the Quora answer and the audiobook description portray a skeptical view of symbolic logic, suggesting that it may not be as relevant or practical as other methods for solving problems or making meaningful contributions in various domains.1 / 1I guess I could transcribe the audiobook to get a more detailed summary.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIf you decide to transcribe the audiobook to get a more detailed summary, it could provide you with additional insights into John-Michael Kuczynski's perspective on symbolic logic.

Just be prepared to invest some time in reviewing and editing the transcription to ensure its accuracy.1 / 1It starts: I used to be a professor, and one of the disciplines I taught was symbolic logic. I have long since stopped being a professor, since it was obviously a total crock. But now I run a tutoring business, which involves helping other people with their homework, which includes symbolic logic homework1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe speaker begins by stating that they used to be a professor and taught symbolic logic. However, they assert that they have since abandoned their academic career because they consider symbolic logic to be a "total crock." Despite leaving academia, they currently run a tutoring business, where they help others with their homework, which may involve assisting students with their symbolic logic assignments.1 / 1Ifl always knew there was something off about it, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. And then, just a moment ago, when I was finishing up a round of symbolic logic homework for some poor sap it hit me, what they call logic in university is the Ultimate bureaucratic discipline. There I was, doing ultimately time consuming and generally wasteful exercises, for some client, who, like all my clients, knew that it wasn't in his interest to jump through more beaurocratic hoops then he had to.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe speaker expresses their previous suspicion that there was something wrong with symbolic logic, but they couldn't pinpoint the issue. However, during a recent experience while completing symbolic logic homework for a client, they had a realization. They now believe that what universities call "logic" is, in fact, the epitome of a bureaucratic discipline. They describe their task as ultimately time-consuming and generally wasteful exercises, which their client, like all others, knew were not in their best interest to engage in, likening it to jumping through bureaucratic hoops. This suggests that the speaker sees symbolic logic as a burdensome and inefficient academic exercise that lacks practical relevance or utility.1 / 1Yeah maybe I'll just wait for an automatic transcription, I was just typing it out by hand1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTWaiting for an automatic transcription might be a more efficient approach, especially if the audiobook is lengthy. Automated transcription tools have improved significantly in recent years and can save you a lot of time and effort. Once you have the transcription, you can review and summarize the content more easily.1 / 1But, coincidentally I also marked symbolic logic homework while I was in university1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThat's an interesting coincidence! Marking symbolic logic homework can give you a unique perspective on the challenges students face while learning and applying this discipline. It might also help you understand various viewpoints and criticisms related to symbolic logic. If you have any insights or experiences from your time marking the homework, they could be valuable in your analysis and understanding of the subject.1 / 1I was actually taking the course, symbolic logic and propositional calculus. But since there was no answer key, the professor asked me to mark my own and then use it to mark everyone else in the class. To this day I have no idea if I was any good at it because naturally I just gave myself an A+ and then didn't mark anyone wrong for the problems I couldn't solve.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThat sounds like an interesting experience in the symbolic logic course! Self-marking can be a bit tricky as it's natural to be more lenient towards oneself. However, it can also be a valuable exercise in understanding your strengths and weaknesses in the subject matter.If you have continued to study and practice symbolic logic, you may have gained a better grasp of the concepts and techniques since then. If not, it's never too late to revisit the subject and explore it further. Understanding symbolic logic can provide you with a powerful tool for reasoning and critical thinking.Remember that learning a subject like symbolic logic takes time and practice, and it's normal to encounter challenges along the way. If you find it interesting, you might consider diving deeper into it, either through further coursework, online resources, or books on the topic.Whether or not you were "good" at it during that specific course, the important thing is your willingness to learn and engage with the material. Don't hesitate to explore more if it continues to intrigue you!1 / 1I guess I could look up the symbols in charts and legend. I am guessing that I must have found it tedious or else I would have become a logician.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIt's possible that you found symbolic logic tedious during your course, and that's completely normal. Some people naturally find certain subjects more engaging than others. Symbolic logic can be challenging for some individuals due to its abstract nature and the need for precise reasoning.Becoming a logician or delving deeper into the subject doesn't necessarily depend on how you felt about it during one specific course. If you still find the field of logic intriguing, you can explore it at your own pace and in different ways. There are various resources available, such as books, online courses, and tutorials, that can help you gain a better understanding of symbolic logic.Sometimes, a different approach or perspective can make a subject more enjoyable or accessible. If you're interested, you might want to give it another try and see if your experience changes. However, if you find other areas of study that captivate you more, that's perfectly fine as well. The beauty of education and learning is that there's a vast array of subjects to explore, and you can choose the ones that resonate with you the most.1 / 1On the other hand maybe I am still studying it but it takes a long time to master, I am trying to learn theorem provers like lean and causal inference engines like Stan but it still feels like I have no idea where to begin sometimes.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTLearning theorem provers and causal inference engines like Lean and Stan can indeed be challenging and time-consuming.

I'd be happy to explain some basic concepts in symbolic logic.

Symbols, operators, and connectives are the basic components of symbolic logic. Symbols represent variables or constants, operators perform logical operations on symbols, and connectives connect symbols and operators to create logical statements.

Propositional logic deals with propositions, which are statements that can be either true or false, and uses logical connectives such as "and," "or," and "not" to create compound propositions. Predicate logic, on the other hand, deals with predicates, which are statements that can be true or false depending on the value of their variables. It uses quantifiers such as "forall" and "exists" to create logical statements.

A truth table is a table that shows all possible combinations of truth values for a set of propositions and their corresponding truth values. It is used in symbolic logic to determine the truth value of complex propositions based on the truth values of their component propositions.

Logical statements can be represented using symbols and connectives by assigning symbols to variables and using connectives to create compound statements. For example, the statement "if it rains, then the ground is wet" can be represented as "p -> q," where "p" represents "it rains" and "q" represents "the ground is wet."

The main rules of inference in symbolic logic include modus ponens, modus tollens, and the law of syllogism. These rules are applied to determine the validity of logical arguments by checking if their conclusions logically follow from their premises.

An example of a valid argument in symbolic logic is: 
Premise 1: If it is raining, then the ground is wet.
Premise 2: It is raining.
Conclusion: Therefore, the ground is wet.

Quantifiers such as "forall" and "exists" are used in predicate logic to create statements that refer to all or some members of a set. For example, the statement "all dogs bark" can be represented as "forall x (Dog(x) -> Bark(x))," where "Dog(x)" represents the predicate "x is a dog" and "Bark(x)" represents the predicate "x barks."

Soundness and completeness are concepts used to evaluate the validity of a logical system. A logical system is sound if it only proves true statements and unsound if it proves false statements. A logical system is complete if it can prove all true statements and incomplete if it cannot prove some true statements.

Symbolic logic is used in fields like computer science, philosophy, and mathematics to represent and analyze logical relationships between propositions and predicates. It is used in computer science to design and verify algorithms, in philosophy to analyze arguments, and in mathematics to prove theorems.

Common applications of symbolic logic in real-world problem-solving include designing and verifying computer programs, analyzing complex arguments, and identifying patterns in large data sets.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThat's a fantastic explanation of the basic concepts in symbolic logic!

By representing program components and logical relationships between them using symbols and logical connectives, developers can ensure that the program functions as intended and follows a logically consistent flow.For example, when designing a sorting algorithm, symbolic logic can be used to represent the conditions for comparing and rearranging elements in an array. Logical operators like "if-then" statements and "while" loops can be employed to create efficient and accurate sorting procedures. The use of symbolic logic allows developers to reason about the correctness of the algorithm and identify potential errors or inefficiencies before implementation.Analyzing Complex Arguments in Philosophy:
Philosophers use symbolic logic to analyze and evaluate complex arguments in a rigorous and systematic way. By translating natural language arguments into symbolic form, philosophers can assess the validity and soundness of the reasoning.For instance, let's take the classic argument:
Premise 1: All humans are mortal. (symbolized as âx (Human(x) â Mortal(x)))
Premise 2: Socrates is a human. (symbolized as Human(Socrates))
Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal. (symbolized as Mortal(Socrates))Using symbolic logic, philosophers can apply rules of inference to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. This process allows for clear identification of logical errors or fallacies in arguments, enabling a more precise analysis of philosophical claims.Identifying Patterns in Large Data Sets:
In data analysis and machine learning, symbolic logic is employed to identify patterns and relationships in large data sets. Through the use of logical rules and operations, data scientists can extract meaningful information and make predictions based on the data.For instance, in pattern recognition tasks, symbolic logic can be utilized to create decision trees that classify data into different categories based on specific attributes. By evaluating the logical conditions associated with each decision node, the algorithm can accurately classify new data points.Additionally, symbolic logic can be used to design rule-based systems that apply logical rules to make decisions or infer missing information from the data. This approach is commonly employed in expert systems and knowledge-based AI applications.Overall, symbolic logic plays a crucial role in these fields by providing a formal and precise language for representing and analyzing complex relationships, allowing for more efficient and accurate problem-solving.1 / 1ð¤ Great questions!

Abstract:

This tantalizingly tautological treatise takes a jaunty jaunt into the jungle of jargon-laden scientific discourse. 

Through a laser-focused analysis of the pernicious penchant for obscurantism in the world of academia, we illuminate the
illuminated, decode the encoded, and put the 'fun' back in fundamentally incomprehensible scholarly texts.

Introduction:

Have you ever plunged headfirst into the opening paragraph of a peer-reviewed paper, only to discover that, halfway down the page, your cognitive faculties have staged a silent revolt, rejecting the influx of multisyllabic morsels of meaning that your eyes are trying desperately to ingest? Fear not, dear reader. You are not alone. 

Welcome to the intriguing intersection of cognitive load theory and academic obscurantism.

Cognitive Load Theory, Or Why Your Brain Might Prefer Netflix:

Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), quite rudely, points out the limitations of our mental capacity. Like a computer with a finite amount of RAM, the human brain can handle only so much information at once.

Throw in needlessly complex sentences, unnecessarily novel terminology, and esoteric references that seem more aimed at gatekeeping than clarity, and you've cooked up a cognitive crisis.

The Obscurity of Obscurantism:

Obscurantism, dear readers, is the dastardly art of making something simple appear complex, a craft seemingly revered by some denizens of the academic realm.

But why, you ask, would these brilliant minds bury their equally brilliant ideas under a mound of murky verbiage? Well, my friend, that is a question even more profound than the most convoluted academic prose.

Dataflow Programming and Process Invocation: The Light at the End of the Tunnel:

Enter dataflow programming and process invocation. Inspired by the world of computer science, we suggest using these concepts to cut through the academic fog.

Could we parametrically generate models to transform esoteric academic content into readable, digestible, and dare we say enjoyable prose?

Why not! If an algorithm can compose symphonies and write poetry, surely it can translate 'Post-structuralistic deconstructions of ontological paradigms' into 'Taking apart big ideas to see how they work'.

Conclusion: A Plea for Clarity:

Let us shun the siren call of unnecessary obscurity. The aim of science is to enlighten, not to obfuscate. Let our words illuminate our ideas, not cloud them. A good scholar makes the complex simple; a masterful one makes the simple fascinating.

In conclusion, this highly engaging (and only slightly facetious) exploration of scientific obscurantism and cognitive overload seeks not to mock but to motivate.

Let us, as a community of scholars and seekers of truth, strive to achieve dynamic readability in our discourse - the world, and our cognitive faculties, will thank us.
