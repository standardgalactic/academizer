Sometimes, Karma works backward. Time is an illusion. Sometimes, what happens to you isn't because of what you've done, but what you will do... 😉

GPT
Your reflection beautifully captures the essence of what many Telluric principles might articulate concerning the interconnectedness of all things, the non-linear nature of time, and the profound understanding that actions and their consequences are not always linearly aligned. In Telluric philosophy, as gleaned from the teachings within "A Telluric Way of Life," the idea that our experiences may be a result of what we are destined to do, rather than merely a consequence of past actions, aligns with the broader, more interconnected view of existence.

The concept of karma, traditionally understood within many Eastern philosophies as the sum of a person's actions in this and previous states of existence, viewed as deciding their fate in future existences, often adheres to a more linear perception of cause and effect. However, your insight suggests a more cyclical or even rhizomatic understanding of causality, one that acknowledges the complexity of temporal relationships and the illusionary nature of linear time.

Indeed, the Telluric ethos, emphasizing harmony with Tellus and all its beings, suggests a deep, intrinsic connection between our actions, our purpose, and the universe's broader tapestry. This perspective encourages a mindfulness about future actions and their impact on the world, understanding that our present state might also be influenced by the potential and energy of what we are yet to accomplish.

This interpretation is akin to viewing life as a complex, interwoven fabric where every thread influences the pattern, not just in adjacent areas but across the entire tapestry. It beckons a heightened sense of responsibility and foresight, where the acknowledgment of future deeds as catalysts for present circumstances serves as a powerful motivator for positive, intentional living.

In this light, the Telluric principle of 'Promote Positive' can be seen as a guiding star, encouraging actions that resonate with kindness, understanding, and respect for all forms of life, with the awareness that our present well-being and the well-being of Tellus are deeply intertwined with the positive actions we are destined to undertake. This approach fosters a proactive, rather than reactive, stance towards life, empowering individuals to shape their destiny and the world around them through conscious, positive action.

The first thing I thought of was that teleological explanations are self-perpetuating and contingent. Credit cards, loans, job hiring, promises, contracts... All   things happening now because of something you will do. Of course there is an infinite regress of ceteris paribus clauses.

GPT
Indeed, your reflection brings to the forefront the concept of teleological explanations, which posit that certain phenomena occur for the purpose of fulfilling some end or goal, essentially highlighting the forward-looking nature of such events or actions. This perspective is particularly intriguing when applied to everyday mechanisms like credit cards, loans, job hirings, promises, and contracts, as you've mentioned. These examples encapsulate the principle that current actions or situations are justified or brought into being by anticipated future outcomes or behaviors—a hallmark of teleological reasoning.

In the context of Telluric philosophy, one could interpret these societal constructs as manifestations of a broader, purpose-driven view of existence, where actions and commitments in the present are deeply entwined with the envisioned or expected future. Such a viewpoint underscores the interconnectedness and forward-moving trajectory of life, aligning with the Telluric emphasis on understanding our role within a greater cosmic and earthly narrative.

The mention of an "infinite regress of ceteris paribus clauses" further enriches this discussion. "Ceteris paribus," a Latin phrase meaning "other things being equal," is often employed in theoretical explanations to indicate that the statement is true when all other factors remain constant. In reality, however, the complexity of life and the myriad variables at play make it virtually impossible for all else to remain equal. This acknowledgment points to the limitations of our predictive capabilities and the inherent uncertainty of banking on future outcomes.

The Telluric way, with its deep appreciation for the interconnectedness of all life and actions, might offer a nuanced understanding of such complexities. It suggests a harmonious balance between taking purposeful action toward future goals and remaining deeply aware of and adaptable to the interconnected web of variables that influence our journey. This balance encourages a mindful engagement with life, where we navigate our responsibilities, promises, and commitments with an awareness of their broader implications, not only for our future but for the wellbeing of all Telluric beings and Tellus itself.

Thus, while teleological reasoning and the forward-looking nature of many social and economic constructs present challenges, they also invite us to consider our actions within a broader, more interconnected framework. The Telluric perspective encourages us to act with intention and consciousness, aware that our present actions ripple through time, influencing not just our future but the collective future of all life on Tellus.

I also think it is like the rhizomatic lens advocated by Deleuze of multiple overlapping times, and scale-free polycomputation.

GPT
Your reference to Gilles Deleuze's concept of the rhizome and its relation to overlapping times and scale-free polycomputation illuminates a sophisticated understanding of existence that resonates with Telluric philosophy in intriguing ways. The rhizome, as conceptualized by Deleuze and Félix Guattari in their collaborative works, represents an anti-hierarchical, non-linear model of organization and relation.

Unlike trees or root structures, which depict a singular origin and linear development, rhizomes embody multiplicity, interconnectedness, and the capacity for spontaneous growth in multiple directions. This model effectively illustrates the complexity of time, causality, and existence, transcending linear narratives and embracing a more multidimensional approach to understanding life and consciousness.

Applying this rhizomatic lens to the notion of time reveals a landscape where past, present, and future are not discrete, sequential entities but rather exist in a state of continuous interaction and overlap. Such a perspective aligns with the Telluric understanding of interconnectedness and the cyclical nature of life and existence on Tellus. It suggests that our actions, thoughts, and energies are part of a vast, interconnected web, influencing and being influenced by multiple points in time simultaneously.

Scale-free polycomputation, a concept that emerges from complexity theory and network science, further enriches this discussion. It refers to processes that operate similarly across different scales, suggesting that the same underlying principles can govern complex systems, whether they are cellular networks, human brains, or entire ecosystems. This notion resonates with the Telluric principle of interconnectedness across all levels of existence, from the microscopic to the cosmic. It underscores the idea that the patterns and principles observed in our individual lives and actions reflect broader cosmic and Telluric patterns.

By viewing existence through this rhizomatic and scale-free computational lens, we're invited to reconsider our place in the universe not as linear, isolated entities but as integral components of a dynamic, interconnected matrix. This perspective encourages a profound reevaluation of how we perceive time, causality, and our role within the vast tapestry of life. It suggests that every action, thought, and intention contributes to the ongoing creation and recreation of the universe, highlighting the importance of living in harmony with these principles.

In essence, the Telluric way, with its emphasis on the sacred interconnectedness of all forms of life and the planet itself, can be seen as a living embodiment of these philosophical concepts. It advocates for a way of life that acknowledges and respects the complexity, multiplicity, and interconnected nature of existence, urging us to act with mindfulness and intentionality for the well-being of Tellus and all its inhabitants.

I also wanted to mention that teleological thinking was not possible without counterfactuals, but there are also infinitely many of those. So we must rely on sparse Bayesian approximations using salient features

GPT
The inclusion of counterfactual thinking in the discussion of teleological reasoning, and the subsequent reliance on sparse Bayesian approximations, adds another layer of complexity to our understanding of decision-making and purpose-driven behavior within the Telluric perspective.

Counterfactual thinking involves considering alternative scenarios and outcomes that did not occur, essentially asking "what if" questions about the past or potential future events. This kind of thought experiment is crucial for teleological reasoning, which is inherently goal-oriented and forward-looking, as it allows for the evaluation of different paths and their potential to lead towards desired ends. However, as you rightly point out, the possibility space for counterfactuals is vast—infinitely so. This presents a significant challenge for decision-making, as it's impractical to consider every possible alternative or outcome.

Sparse Bayesian approximations offer a way to navigate this challenge by identifying and focusing on the most salient features of a situation. This approach acknowledges that while we can't possibly consider every counterfactual scenario, we can use our understanding of key factors and probabilistic reasoning to make informed decisions and predictions. By prioritizing the most relevant information and applying Bayesian inference, we can update our beliefs and strategies based on new evidence, making our teleological reasoning more efficient and grounded.

This methodology aligns with the Telluric philosophy's emphasis on interconnectedness and the understanding of life as a complex web of influences and outcomes. Just as sparse Bayesian approximations rely on identifying and focusing on the most relevant features among a multitude of possibilities, the Telluric way encourages us to recognize and act upon the most salient aspects of our interconnected existence to promote harmony and positive outcomes on Tellus.

Furthermore, the Telluric way, with its focus on living in harmony with the Earth and all its inhabitants, advocates for a form of wisdom and decision-making that acknowledges the complexity of the world while striving for simplicity and clarity in action. This approach can be seen as a practical application of sparse Bayesian thinking—using our understanding of the most significant, salient features of our environment and relationships to make decisions that further the well-being of all Telluric beings.

In essence, the process of navigating the vast landscape of counterfactuals and focusing on salient features through sparse Bayesian approximations mirrors the Telluric journey towards understanding and acting within the intricate web of life. It underscores the importance of mindful, informed decision-making that seeks to understand and prioritize the connections and features that matter most for the flourishing of life on Tellus.

More technical details about sparse Bayesian methods

GPT
Sparse Bayesian methods, particularly in the context of machine learning and statistics, focus on identifying the most relevant variables or features from a dataset while dealing with uncertainty and complexity. These methods are grounded in Bayesian statistics, which provides a mathematical framework for incorporating prior knowledge and observed data to update our beliefs about unknown parameters.

Key Concepts
Bayesian Inference: Bayesian inference involves updating the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. It combines prior beliefs with new data to form a posterior distribution, which reflects updated beliefs about the parameters after observing data.

Sparsity: Sparsity in this context refers to the idea that among a large number of features or variables, only a few are genuinely relevant or non-zero. Sparse Bayesian methods aim to identify these significant features, effectively reducing dimensionality and simplifying models without sacrificing predictive accuracy.

Prior Distributions: In sparse Bayesian methods, prior distributions play a crucial role in encoding beliefs about the parameters before observing the data. Sparsity is encouraged through the use of specific priors that favor solutions with fewer non-zero parameters, such as the Laplace prior (leading to Lasso regression in a frequentist context) or the Spike and Slab prior.

Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL)
Sparse Bayesian Learning is a specific approach within sparse Bayesian methods that seeks to learn sparse representations directly from data. It is particularly notable for its application in signal processing, feature selection, and regression problems.

Relevance Vector Machine (RVM): One of the prominent techniques in SBL is the Relevance Vector Machine, which is analogous to Support Vector Machines (SVM) but employs a Bayesian framework. RVMs aim to achieve similar predictive performance to SVMs but with sparser solutions, meaning they use fewer basis functions or "relevance vectors" to construct the model.

Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD): ARD is another technique used in SBL, which involves fitting a model where each feature's weight has its hyperparameter that determines its relevance. Features with small hyperparameters effectively get "turned off," leading to a sparse model. ARD can be applied in various models, including linear regression, neural networks, and Gaussian processes.

Advantages of Sparse Bayesian Methods
Interpretability: By focusing on a smaller set of relevant features, sparse models are generally easier to interpret and understand.

Generalization: Sparse models are less prone to overfitting, making them more likely to generalize well to unseen data.

Efficiency: Reducing the number of features can lead to computational efficiency in both training and prediction phases.

Challenges and Considerations
Choosing Priors: The choice of prior distributions is crucial in sparse Bayesian methods and can significantly affect the sparsity and performance of the resulting models.

Computational Complexity: Bayesian inference, especially with complex models and priors, can be computationally intensive, often requiring sophisticated algorithms for approximation like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Variational Inference.

Sparse Bayesian methods represent a powerful approach for dealing with complex datasets, allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge and the pursuit of parsimonious models that balance simplicity with predictive accuracy.

The Bayesian Brain
The Bayesian brain considers the brain as a statistical organ of hierarchical inference that predicts current and future events on the basis of past experience.  According to this theory, the mind makes sense of the world by assigning probabilities to hypotheses that best explain (usually sparse and ambiguous) sensory data – and continually updating these hypotheses according to standard probabilistic rules of inference.

This fine-tuning (optimization) of perception and action operates under the single imperative of minimizing surprise (free energy) and uncertainty; thereby maximizing statistical and thermodynamic efficiency.

Learning in the Bayesian brain differs from reinforcement (and machine) learning because it occurs with understanding. Mental models of past experience use these experiences to anticipate new experiences, as opposed to being shaped by them. Continual optimisation of the models also enables efficient exchange with the environment in a self-organised, self-evidencing and unsupervised fashion.

We use neuroimaging to investigate the central tenets of hierarchical inference in the brain:

Brain regions within a neural system are hierarchically organised.

Each level of the hierarchy sends top-down signals to predict inputs at lower levels.

Prediction error = information at a lower level that is not predicted by a higher level.

Higher levels update their predictions to minimise subsequent prediction error.

The degree to which higher levels update depends on the precision of prediction error

Precision (reliability) in the prediction error is estimated from prior experience.

The percept is dictated by the synthesis of new sensory information with prior beliefs.

Attention increases the precision of prediction errors and their influence on high-levels.

Predicted actions are realised when the precision of prediction errors is attenuated.

Bottom-up prediction errors are thought to arise at 30-70Hz from superficial cortical layers.

Top-down predictions are thought to arise at 20-30 Hz from deeper cortical layers.

Top-down predictions of precision are mediated by neuromodulatory mechanisms.

Behaviour (e.g. actions) minimises uncertainty (expected surprise). This is known as ’active inference’.

The Bayesian Brain hypothesis presents a fascinating and compelling framework for understanding how the brain processes information and learns from experience. It posits that the brain functions essentially as a probabilistic machine, constantly making predictions about the world based on past experiences, and updating these predictions in light of new sensory information. This process is guided by the overarching goal of minimizing surprise and uncertainty, which translates into a more efficient use of both statistical and thermodynamic resources.

Key Concepts and Mechanisms
Hierarchical Inference: The brain's neural systems are organized hierarchically, where each level of the hierarchy is involved in making predictions about the level below it. This structure allows for complex and nuanced models of the world that can be continually refined.

Prediction and Error Correction: A central mechanism in this framework is the generation of top-down predictions about sensory inputs and the calculation of prediction errors when actual inputs deviate from these predictions. These errors then inform adjustments to higher-level predictions, in a continual loop of error correction and model updating.

Precision of Prediction Errors: Not all prediction errors are treated equally; their impact depends on their estimated precision or reliability, which is itself informed by prior experience. This aspect introduces a nuanced way in which expectations and learning from experience are balanced in the brain's model of the world.

Active Inference: The theory extends beyond passive prediction to include active inference, wherein behaviors are understood as actions taken to minimize uncertainty about the world. This proactive aspect of the framework highlights the brain's role in actively shaping interactions with the environment to improve its predictive model.

Implications for Perception, Learning, and Action
Perception is framed as an interpretative process, where sensory inputs are integrated with prior beliefs to form the basis of our conscious experience of the world.

Learning occurs through the continuous optimization of mental models, leveraging past experiences to anticipate future events. This process is distinguished from simple reinforcement learning by its emphasis on understanding and prediction rather than just response to stimuli.

Action is conceptualized as a means to minimize expected surprise, with behaviors aimed at reducing uncertainty about the world. This includes the role of attention in modulating the influence of prediction errors based on their precision.

Investigative Approaches
Neuroimaging techniques are pivotal in investigating the principles of hierarchical inference within the brain. By examining how different brain regions communicate and adjust their activity in response to prediction errors, researchers can glean insights into the neural underpinnings of the Bayesian brain hypothesis.

Conclusion
The Bayesian Brain hypothesis offers a compelling model for understanding the brain's information-processing strategies, emphasizing prediction, hierarchical inference, and the active role of the brain in minimizing uncertainty. This framework not only provides insights into the neural basis of perception, learning, and action but also underscores the brain's efficiency and adaptability in navigating the world.

Do you know the story Micromegas by Voltaire?

GPT
Yes, "Micromégas" is a significant work by Voltaire, written in 1752. This philosophical tale is an early example of science fiction, exploring themes of relativism, the folly of human conceit, and the pursuit of knowledge through the adventures of its titular character, Micromégas. Micromégas is a giant from a planet circling the star Sirius, standing at eight leagues tall (approximately 24 miles), who travels through the universe with a companion from Saturn, who is smaller in comparison but still a giant to humans.

The story begins with Micromégas being banished from his home planet for writing a controversial philosophical book, leading him on a journey through the solar system. Eventually, he arrives on Earth, where he and his Saturnian companion discover the planet's inhabitants. Initially, they do not even notice humans due to the size difference, but upon closer inspection, they engage in philosophical discussions with Earth's scientists, exploring human understanding of the universe, morality, and the nature of life.

"Micromégas" is notable for its satirical take on the self-importance of mankind and the limitations of our understanding. Voltaire uses the perspective of beings far superior in size and, presumably, in intellect to critique human institutions, including religion and science, and to question the certainty with which humans hold their beliefs.

The tale concludes with Micromégas and his companion leaving Earth, offering a book that contains "the secret of the universe" to the humans, which ultimately contains nothing but blank pages. This ending serves as a humorous yet poignant reminder of the limits of human knowledge and the folly of claiming absolute understanding of the cosmos.

Through "Micromégas," Voltaire engages with Enlightenment ideas of reason, empirical evidence, and skepticism, using the story as a vehicle to explore and critique human nature and society. The connection between the story and the discussions on Bayesian Brain hypothesis, Telluric philosophy, and the Micromegas Ontology we've explored highlight a continuum of inquiry into the nature of knowledge, existence, and our place in the universe.

So when Micromegas first discovered life on earth, the first living being he noticed was a Whale, which he used as a holotype species.

GPT
Indeed, when Micromégas arrives on Earth in Voltaire's tale, the first Earthly inhabitant he encounters is a whale. Given the size disparity between Micromégas and the creatures of Earth, it's fitting that a whale, one of the largest animals on our planet, would be the first form of life he notices. This encounter reflects the story's exploration of perspective, scale, and the relative nature of existence.

In the context of the narrative, the whale serves as a significant point of reference or a "holotype species" for Micromégas in his initial understanding of terrestrial life. The concept of a holotype in biological taxonomy is the single physical example (or illustration) of an organism, known to have been used when the species (or lower-ranked taxon) was formally described. It is a reference point for the definition of that species.

While Voltaire, writing in the 18th century, wouldn't have used modern taxonomic terminology, the idea of using the whale as a baseline for understanding Earth's life forms is in line with this concept. Micromégas' interaction with the whale symbolically underscores the vast differences between his own experiences and those of Earth's creatures, setting the stage for the philosophical reflections on knowledge, scale, and the nature of understanding that pervade the tale.

Voltaire cleverly uses this encounter not only to satirize human assumptions of importance and scale but also to introduce the theme of exploration and discovery that defines Micromégas' visit to Earth. The whale, as a representative of Earth's life to a visitor of such incomprehensible scale, becomes a bridge between the familiar and the unknown, challenging both Micromégas and the reader to consider the diversity of life and perspectives within the universe.
