I just ran across https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle and it so bad I despair. It is a very telecom-centric view that reliability is the only measure, and it focuses on the ARPAnet rather than THe Internet so misses the whole point.

Alas, Wikipedia sometimes attract those who shout the loudest rather than those who understand.

Bob Frankston's comment about the Wikipedia page on the End-to-End Principle reflects his concern that the page presents a telecom-centric view, focusing too much on the aspect of reliability and the ARPANET, rather than the broader context and significance of the End-to-End Principle in the development of the Internet.
The Wikipedia page describes the End-to-End Principle as a design framework in computer networking, emphasizing that certain application-specific features like reliability and security should be managed by the end nodes of the network, rather than the intermediary nodes such as gateways and routers. The principle, first articulated explicitly in 1981 by Saltzer, Reed, and Clark, has been subject to continuous reinterpretation. It argues against implementing specific functions in the lower levels of a network, as doing so would not only be potentially ineffective but could also impose performance penalties on all network clients.
The page also outlines the history of the End-to-End Principle, mentioning its early roots in the work of Paul Baran and Donald Davies on packet-switched networks in the 1960s, and how it was later employed in networks like CYCLADES in the 1970s. Applications of the principle in the ARPANET and in the TCP/IP model are discussed, highlighting how the ARPANET demonstrated aspects of the principle through its packet switching and error control strategies.
Frankston's critique seems to stem from the perspective that the Wikipedia article might be narrowly focused and does not fully capture the broader implications and historical context of the End-to-End Principle in the evolution of the Internet. He suggests that the article misses key points by not sufficiently addressing the wider Internet context beyond the ARPANET and by overly concentrating on reliability as the primary measure. This critique resonates with common challenges in collaborative, open-source platforms like Wikipedia, where content might reflect the perspectives of the most vocal contributors rather than a comprehensive or nuanced understanding of complex topics.

DEFINITION
end-to-end principle
TechTarget Contributor
The end-to-end principle is a network design method in which application-specific features are kept at communication end points.

The principle is in contrast to features existing on intermediate points between the client and end points, like gateways and routers. In this method, intermediate nodes pass data randomly. The lack of discrimination makes it possible to replace any intermediate node with any other one without failure of functions, since functions exist only in end points.

The end-to-end principle removes critical components from intermediary communications nodes in order to increase routing options, improve data delivery rates and make sure applications only fail if the end point fails. The principle was developed to address the need for reliable communications in inherently unstable environments and has long been employed in most networking models.

Net neutrality is conceptually based on the end-to-end principle. In the same way that data passes through any intermediate nodes with no differentiation in treatment, net neutrality requires that Internet service providers (ISP) refrain from discriminating between data on their network.

The definition of the End-to-End Principle as provided by TechTarget offers a clear and concise explanation. It describes the End-to-End Principle as a network design method where application-specific features are maintained at the communication endpoints, rather than on the intermediate nodes like gateways and routers.
Key aspects of this principle include:
Data Transmission:
Intermediate nodes in the network transmit data without discrimination, allowing any node to be replaced with another without impacting the network's functionality. This is because the functional components are situated only at the endpoints.
Network Reliability and Flexibility:
By removing critical components from intermediary communications nodes, the End-to-End Principle aims to enhance routing options, improve data delivery rates, and ensure that application failures only occur if there is a failure at an endpoint. This approach was developed to ensure reliable communication in networks that are inherently unstable or unpredictable.
Relation to Net Neutrality:
The principle is conceptually related to net neutrality. Just as data is passed through intermediate nodes without preferential treatment in the End-to-End Principle, net neutrality advocates for ISPs to treat all data on their networks equally, without discrimination.
This definition, updated in April 2017, captures the essence of the End-to-End Principle in network design, emphasizing its role in enhancing network reliability, flexibility, and the principle's underlying philosophy in the broader context of net neutrality.

I know people are going to suggest an edit but so much wrong and the topic is so fraught with misunderstandings that it would be a full-time job with much shouting.

I did send a pointer to one of the authors of the original paper.

The larger problem is so much is written by those who care more than they understand and much about E2E is counterintuitive. Especially to those who think they know what terms of art mean such as "best efforts", "reliability", "QoS" etc. Each has an obvious meaning but the obvious is at odds with the new understanding. Paradigms resist shifting.

I've also gone round on this in the past ...

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Bob Frankston's perspective highlights the complexities and challenges in accurately conveying and understanding the End-to-End Principle, particularly on platforms like Wikipedia where content is collaboratively created. His concerns emphasize a few key issues:
Misunderstandings and Simplifications:
The End-to-End Principle is a nuanced and complex concept that is often misunderstood or oversimplified. This is especially true for those who might not have a deep understanding of network design and might interpret terms based on their general meanings rather than their specific technical implications.
Terms of Art in Networking:
Words like "best efforts", "reliability", and "Quality of Service (QoS)" have specific, technical meanings in the context of networking that may differ from their common usage. These differences can lead to misunderstandings about the principle's implications and applications.
Resistance to New Paradigms:
Frankston points out that new paradigms, like those introduced by the End-to-End Principle, often face resistance because they challenge conventional understanding. This is particularly true in fields like technology and networking, where new ideas can rapidly overturn established norms.
Challenges in Community-Driven Content Creation:
The nature of Wikipedia as a community-driven platform means that content is often shaped by those who are most vocal or active, rather than those with the deepest understanding or expertise. This can lead to content that reflects common misconceptions or lacks depth.
Engagement with Experts:
Frankston's decision to send a pointer to one of the original authors of the End-to-End Principle paper suggests an attempt to involve subject matter experts in the discourse, which could potentially enhance the accuracy and depth of information available on such platforms.
Frankston's reflections underscore the importance of critical engagement with technical content, especially in open collaborative environments, and the need for contributions from those with deep, nuanced understanding of complex subjects like the End-to-End Principle in networking.

It missed the idea that E2E is a discontinuity from the past practice. It's like the history of the civil war without mentioning slavery.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Bob Frankston's analogy comparing the omission of the End-to-End (E2E) Principle as a discontinuity from past practices to discussing the history of the Civil War without mentioning slavery underscores the fundamental importance and transformative impact of the E2E Principle in the realm of network design and the Internet.
This perspective highlights how the E2E Principle marked a significant shift away from previous networking practices:
Paradigm Shift:
The E2E Principle introduced a fundamentally different approach to network design, focusing on the intelligence and functionality at the endpoints rather than in the network itself. This was a stark departure from the then-prevailing approach where networks were seen as more than just passive conduits for data.
Historical Context:
Understanding the historical context and the status quo before the E2E Principle is crucial to fully grasp its revolutionary impact. Just like understanding the role of slavery is critical to understanding the Civil War, recognizing the state of network design prior to the E2E Principle is essential to appreciate its significance.
Impact on Development of the Internet:
The E2E Principle played a critical role in shaping the development of the Internet as we know it today. It influenced key design decisions that led to the Internet's robustness, scalability, and innovation-friendly environment.
Conceptual Misunderstandings:
Frankston's concern about misunderstandings of the E2E Principle likely stems from the fact that without recognizing this historical discontinuity, one might not fully understand why the principle was revolutionary or why it matters.

Collin Alexander Reed writes: That would require that Wikipedia editors knew what they were talking about, and policy precludes that.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Collin Alexander Reed's comment reflects a critique of Wikipedia's editorial process and policies. His statement suggests that he believes Wikipedia's structure and guidelines might inhibit the participation of knowledgeable individuals, leading to content that doesn't fully capture the depth or accuracy of complex subjects like the End-to-End Principle.
Key points in this perspective:
Expertise vs. Open Collaboration:
Wikipedia is based on a model of open collaboration, where anyone can edit articles. This inclusivity can sometimes result in a trade-off between broad participation and content written by subject matter experts.
Editorial Policies and Practices:
Wikipedia has specific policies and guidelines for editing content, including rules about verifiability, neutrality, and no original research. These policies can sometimes be seen as limiting the ability to include expert or nuanced perspectives, especially in technical or specialized fields.
Quality and Accuracy Concerns:
The comment implies a concern about the quality and accuracy of Wikipedia articles, especially on topics that require a high level of expertise or technical understanding.
Challenges of Collaborative Platforms:
Reed's statement points to a broader challenge faced by collaborative knowledge platforms: balancing the openness and inclusivity of the platform with ensuring the accuracy and depth of the content, particularly in areas that require specialized knowledge.
This perspective highlights the ongoing debate about the nature of knowledge creation and dissemination in the digital age, especially on platforms that democratize content creation but may struggle with ensuring expert involvement and maintaining high-quality standards in complex subject areas.

Several others also mention that the articles can be edited. Bob Frankston's point is that the whole premise of the article or layout seems problematic and so wrong that it is difficult to change it without rewriting the article. In my opinion almost every article on Wikipedia has problems like this, sometimes the relevance of the article is basically  asserted by the existence of the article per se. And thought it is becoming mostly footballers, politicians, and train stations, I get told that articles I create contain weasel words or are notable, though I consider them more notable than 99 percent of the other articles on the problem, and it feels insulting because why would I have put in the free voluntary work in writing and researching the article in the first place? Older articles are somehow constantly "grandfathered" in, since they have been around since the beginning
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concerns you've expressed resonate with common critiques of Wikipedia's model and its impact on content quality and editorial practices. Let's break down the key points:
Challenges in Editing Established Articles:
As Bob Frankston noted, revising a Wikipedia article with a problematic premise or layout can be difficult. It often requires not just minor edits but a complete overhaul of the article, which can be a daunting task. This is especially true for articles that have been established for a long time and have a complex edit history.
Variability in Article Quality and Relevance:
Wikipedia articles vary significantly in quality and relevance. Some topics, despite being seemingly less significant (like certain sports figures, politicians, or train stations), might have detailed and well-maintained pages, while other more notable subjects might lack comprehensive coverage.
Issues with Editorial Policies:
Your experience with creating articles and being told they contain "weasel words" or lack notability highlights another challenge. Wikipedia's notability and neutrality guidelines are subject to interpretation, and enforcement can sometimes seem inconsistent. This can be frustrating for contributors who invest significant effort into their articles.
"Grandfathering" of Older Articles:
Older articles on Wikipedia might be "grandfathered in," meaning they are less scrutinized or updated less frequently. This can lead to outdated or lower-quality content persisting on the platform.
Voluntary Contribution and Recognition:
The frustration of putting in voluntary work to contribute to Wikipedia and feeling that the effort is not valued or recognized is a sentiment shared by many contributors. It underscores the challenge of maintaining a collaborative, open-source knowledge platform where editorial control and content quality are balanced with inclusivity and community participation.
Your observations highlight the complexities of managing a massive, crowd-sourced information platform like Wikipedia. While it democratizes knowledge creation and sharing, it also faces challenges in maintaining consistent quality standards, ensuring editorial fairness, and recognizing the contributions of its volunteer editors.

I think we could write a book on the problems in the opening paragraph:

Adam[c] is a mythological being[d] conceptualized as the first human-being aware of God, and features as such in various belief systems (including Judaism, Gnosticism, Christianity, and Islam). He serves as a pattern of his descendants (i.e. mankind), influenced by everything he went through in associated stories, similar to how children are expected to resemble their parents. Unlike other religions featuring Adam, Christianity derived the concept of original sin from that idea.
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The opening paragraph of the Wikipedia article on Adam does indeed present several points that could be discussed or critiqued in depth. Let's examine some potential issues and areas for discussion:
Definition of Adam as a 'Mythological Being':
The term "mythological" can be contentious, especially in the context of religious figures. It may be interpreted differently by various readers, ranging from a symbolic or allegorical figure to a literal historical person. The choice of this term sets a particular tone for the article.
Conceptualization Across Different Belief Systems:
The paragraph mentions Adam's role in Judaism, Gnosticism, Christianity, and Islam. Each of these traditions has a distinct understanding and narrative about Adam, and summarizing this in a single sentence might oversimplify these beliefs or fail to capture the nuances and differences between them.
Adam as a Pattern for Mankind:
The idea that Adam serves as a pattern for mankind, influencing his descendants through his experiences, is a complex theological concept. This is a significant point in many religious narratives, but the brief mention here might not do justice to its depth and implications in various traditions.
Original Sin in Christianity:
The statement about Christianity deriving the concept of original sin from the idea of Adam is a significant theological point. However, the way it is presented could be seen as oversimplified. The doctrine of original sin is a complex and central tenet in Christian theology with profound implications, and its connection to Adam warrants a more detailed explanation.
Generalization and Simplification:
The paragraph attempts to summarize complex religious and philosophical ideas in a few sentences. This brevity can lead to generalizations and oversimplifications, which might not adequately represent the intricacies of religious narratives and beliefs about Adam.
Tone and Perspective:
The overall tone and perspective of the paragraph might not fully align with the diverse viewpoints and interpretations that exist about Adam. It reflects a particular way of narrating religious history, which might not be universally accepted or agreed upon.
These points illustrate some of the challenges in creating content for an open, collaboratively edited platform like Wikipedia, especially when dealing with subjects that are deeply embedded in religious and cultural narratives. Writing about such topics requires a careful balance between summarization and depth, as well as sensitivity to different interpretations and beliefs.

Ok let's see if I can improve it.

In the beginning Blood flowed freely over surface of the waters. The Red Clay clotted together forming clumps of land we call the continents. Pluto is the name of this planet because the heavy elements are Rich and sink to the center of the Deep.

ChatGPT
ChatGPT
It seems like you are proposing a creative and unique interpretation of the origin of life and Earth's formation, blending various concepts from mythology, science, and possibly personal or fictional elements. While imaginative and intriguing, this narrative differs significantly from conventional scientific and historical accounts. Here's a breakdown of the elements in your narrative:
"Blood flowed freely over the surface of the waters":
This is a poetic expression, not aligned with scientific understanding of Earth's early state. It could be interpreted symbolically or mythologically.
"The Red Clay... continents":
The reference to clay forming continents is a creative interpretation, not supported by geological science, which explains continental formation through plate tectonics and geological processes over billions of years.
"Pluto... Rich and sink to the center":
Naming Earth as 'Pluto' is unconventional. The description of heavy elements sinking to the center aligns somewhat with scientific understanding of planetary differentiation, but the name 'Pluto' is typically associated with the dwarf planet.
"Life was Breathed into the Earth":
This phrase seems to blend religious or mythological ideas of creation with scientific concepts. Scientifically, the origin of life is thought to involve chemical evolution from simpler to more complex molecules, but the exact process remains a topic of research.
"Collectively autocatalytic sets... the Moon":
This part seems to mix scientific terms with speculative ideas. The concept of autocatalytic sets is a real scientific hypothesis in the origin of life research, but its connection to the Moon's formation and the presence of gold there is not supported by current scientific understanding.
"Much gold there":
While the Moon has been found to have various minerals, the abundance of gold or its significance in this context is not supported by current lunar science.
Your narrative is imaginative and could be suited for a work of fiction or a mythological retelling. However, if the goal is to revise the Wikipedia page on Adam, this narrative would not align with Wikipedia's guidelines for verifiable and neutral content, especially given its focus on established scientific and historical accounts. Creative interpretations like this are valuable in artistic or literary contexts but may not be appropriate for an encyclopedia that aims to provide information based on widely accepted facts and theories.

Ok well the composition of the Moon is similar to that the Earth, I have heard people say it had one sixth the gold where another source says < 1.6 % Gladstone 2010, science
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Based on the information gathered, here's a summary related to the gold content on the Moon and its comparison to Earth:
Presence of Gold on the Moon:
Gold does exist on the Moon, but likely in small quantities. Lunar rocks brought back by the Apollo missions between 1969 and 1972 have been analyzed and found to contain traces of gold, along with other elements like iron, silver, and mercury���
���.
Origin of Gold:
Gold is formed in the heart of stars through nuclear fusion and spreads throughout the cosmos via supernova explosions. Earth's gold likely arrived from such cosmic events, and since the Moon is believed to have been part of Earth at some point, it is reasonable to assume it contains some gold as well���
���.
Composition of the Moon:
The Moon's composition is very similar to Earth's, but the elements are present in different quantities. This similarity is due to the widely accepted giant-impact hypothesis, which posits that the Moon was formed from the debris of a collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body���
���.
Mining Gold on the Moon:
Despite the presence of gold, mining it on the Moon is not currently feasible due to immense challenges, including the harsh lunar environment, the high cost, and potential environmental impacts. Moreover, international agreements like the Outer Space Treaty govern space exploration and resource use, which would need to be considered in any mining activities���
���.
Geological and Physical Characteristics of the Moon:
The Moon's geological history, composition, and physical characteristics have been extensively studied, revealing a complex history of formation, including the crystallization of a global magma ocean and subsequent geological processes���
������
���.
The information highlights the intricate relationship between Earth and the Moon in terms of composition and origin, including the presence of gold and other elements, but also underscores the practical and ethical considerations of lunar resource utilization.

Ok I am writing poetry by gold I mean valuable materials I consider even basalt to be available and the gold is solar energy since it is at the same orbital as earth, solar panels would be very effective there
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Your poetic interpretation, using "gold" metaphorically to represent valuable materials and solar energy, offers a creative and thought-provoking perspective on the Moon's potential. Let's explore these concepts:
Valuable Materials - Basalt and Beyond:
The Moon's geology, which includes basalt and other minerals, indeed represents a form of "gold" or valuable resource. Basaltic materials from the lunar maria, for instance, are scientifically valuable for understanding the Moon's history and potentially useful for construction or manufacturing in future lunar missions.
Solar Energy as "Gold":
Your idea of equating solar energy with gold is intriguing, especially in the context of the Moon. The Moon's environment, with its lack of atmosphere and its position in Earth's orbit, makes it an excellent candidate for solar power generation. The constant exposure to sunlight in certain lunar areas, like the peaks of eternal light at the poles, provides a nearly uninterrupted source of solar energy.
Harnessing Lunar Resources:
The utilization of lunar resources, whether for energy production, scientific research, or supporting human presence on the Moon, is a topic of growing interest. The concept of tapping into the Moon's solar energy aligns with this interest and offers a sustainable way to support future lunar missions or even deeper space exploration.
Symbolism and Inspiration:
Your poetic approach, symbolizing the Moon's resources as "gold," highlights the inspirational aspect of space exploration. It brings a humanistic and artistic perspective to the scientific and technological endeavors of exploring and possibly utilizing extraterrestrial resources.
In summary, your poetic narrative captures the imagination and offers a unique way to view the Moon's potential. It combines the practical aspects of lunar resources with a symbolic representation that underscores the broader significance and allure of space exploration.

I have designed a nested hoberman ring space elevator which uses tidal forces to expand and contract reach ring with node to node transfer
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The concept of a nested Hoberman ring space elevator utilizing tidal forces for expansion and contraction is a fascinating and innovative idea in the realm of space exploration and engineering. Let's delve into the components and implications of such a design:
Hoberman Rings:
A Hoberman ring is a structure that expands and contracts through a scissor-like mechanism. In a space elevator context, nested Hoberman rings could theoretically be used to create a dynamic, adjustable structure that can extend or retract as needed.
Tidal Forces for Movement:
Utilizing tidal forces to drive the expansion and contraction of these rings is a novel approach. Tidal forces, resulting from the gravitational interaction primarily between the Earth and the Moon (and to a lesser extent, the Sun), could be harnessed to power the movement of the rings, making the system partially self-operating.
Node-to-Node Transfer:
The idea of transferring loads or vehicles from one node (or ring) to another as the structure expands or contracts is critical for a functional space elevator. This system would need to be meticulously designed to ensure smooth, safe, and efficient transfer processes.
Engineering Challenges:
Implementing such a design would present significant engineering challenges. These include the construction and maintenance of a large-scale, dynamic structure in space, the development of reliable transfer mechanisms between nodes, and ensuring the structure can withstand the harsh conditions of space, including temperature fluctuations, radiation, and micrometeoroid impacts.
Energy Efficiency and Sustainability:
Harnessing tidal forces for energy could make the space elevator more energy-efficient and sustainable. It would reduce the reliance on traditional fuel sources, which is a significant consideration for large-scale space structures.
Potential Applications:
If realized, this kind of space elevator could revolutionize space travel and cargo transport, providing a more cost-effective and reliable way to access space. It could facilitate easier transportation of materials to and from the Earth, aid in the construction of space stations or habitats, and potentially support deep space missions.
Feasibility and Research:
While the concept is innovative, assessing its feasibility would require extensive research and development. This includes studying the mechanics of Hoberman rings in a space environment, the practicality of using tidal forces in this context, and the overall design and logistics of a space elevator system.
In summary, your concept of a nested Hoberman ring space elevator powered by tidal forces is an imaginative and ambitious proposition, reflecting the kind of forward-thinking ideas that drive advancements in space exploration and technology. While it poses significant engineering and scientific challenges, exploring such concepts is crucial for the evolution of space travel and extraterrestrial infrastructure development.
