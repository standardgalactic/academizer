Welcome to an episode of let's explain why this comment is dumb and I want to
talk about a common comment that I get downplaying the usefulness of
minimalist or suckless software and I want to respond to why it's dumb I
don't want to say dumb comment but why it is a inappropriately informed comment
so yesterday I got I get this kind of comment relatively often but yesterday
I got one example of it so I'll use it as a straw man to talk about so it comes
from the sky Christian now I'm not bullying him or anything like that I'm
just responding to the comment although I reserve the right to read his comment
in the dumb voice so I will so let's read it let me get this right you're
using st from suckless because it's small so why did you apply so much patches
instead of using a terminal where this features already included masochism just
use a terminal like kitty and simply press control shift you and pick search
favorite a smiley too simple alright let's talk about this so no notice the
implicit assumption of comments like this the implicit assumption is people
who use minimalist software or suckless software in particular they're doing it
just to be they're being masochistic they're doing it's just a big meme they're
they're all hipsters they're doing that thanks for no reason and they just want
to make life hard on themselves that mind you this is the same thing that
people who use windows and max say about people who use Linux just bear that
in mind and most of you as Linux users probably think that's a stupid thing to
say so I feel the same way but again that's an understandable thing if you
don't really let me just explain to him why okay so let's take the example he
uses the example of ST versus kitty and inserting emojis so let's do that I
actually have the source code for kitty right here I just downloaded it a second
ago as an illustration and I'm gonna pull up the source code for my ST build
now first off there's a misunderstanding that that minimalist software is just
about lines of code there are some people who care about that I think it is an
issue something it's it's more like a symptom of a deeper problem but in
general yes ST even though I have patched in all these bloat features I
mean people make fun you know they like to people complain where when I use
minimalist software and add-in features I like that's what you're supposed to do
but you'll see that the source code to my ST build the whole thing is 7.3 megs
of course most of that is the get folder so that doesn't really count and if we
look at kitty we will see that it has a good bit more 33 megs now of course most
of that is the get folder as well but and also in kitty's defense they have
things like images and you know lots and lots of documentation but if you
compare even a built-out beefy build of ST you will see to pretty much any
other terminal you'll see that ST is nearly always significantly smaller in
terms of source code it's not an issue about getting rid of features first off
it's an issue of getting rid of bad written code that's one of the things
that suckless is about but let's talk about something more tangible let's talk
about the feature that he mentions that is inserting smiley's emoji stuff like
that okay so first off you'll see in the kitty source code there is quite you
have four and a half megs of that software or of you know of the source
code that is about Unicode input okay compare that that is more than my
entire ST build now I have kitty installed so I'm gonna bring it up so
here it is now let's look at their Unicode insertion thing so again
control shift you gives you this menu in kitty to insert some kind of emoji so I
can pick let's say I want that one that's my face right now or let's say so
the course not everything is here you can go to different tabs stuff like that
you can type in I don't know words from it or something like that right so that
that's a nice way of inserting emojis but it's terribly inefficient okay let me
compare that to what I use to insert emojis now I have no feature in my
ST build to insert emojis no feature whatsoever because I use an external
script for that and I'm gonna explain why that is better here's what my
external script looks like here you know basically just brings up a little
menu with all the emojis and all their names and you just start typing a name
and you get your emoji okay you can insert that simple as that now first
off mine is quite a bit more more ergonomic you just have the menu you
don't have to really think really think about it you just start typing it's
sort of like one of those tabs over here I guess the the yeah F2 tab but here is
the superiority of my system versus theirs and it has to do with it being a
minimalist piece of software the superiority is this is not built into
my terminal it is a general all-purpose script that works on my terminal it works
on my browser it works on a messenger application I might use and works on
email it works on every program or even if I just want to put something in my
clipboard I can always you know use this to get some kind of emoji no matter
what okay it just always works whereas the kitty way of inserting emojis is
specific to kitty now here is the big problem here here is one of the reasons
minimalist software is so much better if you you if you have the kitty mindset
oh we'll just program four and a half megs into our terminal build for inserting
emojis a you have to make sure that's good but then you have nothing for
inserting emojis in other programs so I guess in my environment I'm supposed to
have an emoji insertion mechanism in my terminal build one in my browser one in
my messenger application one in my email one in every single program that I have
the minimalist mindset the suckless mindset is that's stupid that's a waste
of time you should just have one general all-purpose script where you can select
an emoji and insert it or do any kind of operation separate of an each
individual program and insert that and it does not add it's a feature that anyone
including you even if you use none of my software you could download and use this
feature itself so it's not reliant on anything and it is useful for everything
okay so that is why it's a sort of inefficient thing to have now let's
actually compare now I mentioned a second ago let's go back to kitty and we'll
go we'll look again at what was the size of all this okay yeah so four and a half
megs let's compare that to the economicness of my system for doing it so
again I have it in here it's actually well there are two files one is the
emoji file that I have and I'll open that up it's local share larbs emoji and
this is the file I opened up in the last video it is literally just a list of all
the emojis I happen to keep their you know little I don't know hex whatever it
is the Unicode not sequencer whatever and of course a picture of the emoji and
that that's all the input to all the input you need now the script that
actually pops up the menu is this one here D menu Unicode and this is all it
is so they have four and a half megs I just have one single file here which is
let's actually see how big this file is it is less than a single meg okay and
this little script that is 20 lines could probably be way less frankly that
takes the content of that file provides it as a menu with D menu and then allows
you to just type in and whatever you select it copies to your clipboard and
even gives you a little notification just to make sure you click the right
thing that is not even necessary you wouldn't even need to do that so my
feature compared to that four and a half megs it is much more useful because you
can use it with any program at any time and also it is much more minimal it's
basically as minimal as it can get all it is the input is just a file with
emojis and the script that's doing the heavy lifting I mean it's not even that
heavy it just it just does what you want and that's about it so that is what
suckless software is about minimalist software it's not an issue of oh just
deciding oh emojis are bloat I'm not gonna use emojis or something like that
or deciding that this feature or that feature is stupid and you want to make
you make life difficult for yourself so you're not gonna use it that is
absolutely a hundred percent not what it's about it's about thinking where is
the most efficient place to have that kind of operation is it really efficient
to have emojis and stuff like that as as an emoji module in every piece of
software how stupid is that why don't I just have one for everything now mind you
a lot of the other features that ST doesn't have by default the reason you
patch some things into it for example ST does not have a scroll up abilities by
default you might think of that as being a basic feature to terminals and in most
terminals it is and if you want it in ST there's a you just download ST and you
apply the patch for it but the reason ST doesn't have that is because the
thinking is that that in a lot of use cases is totally redundant if you're
talking about people who use T-MUX or something like that because T-MUX has
its own built-in way for doing that so that is the mindset it's not suckless is
in particular is about two things it's about well-written code efficient and
well-written code and it's also about just only having the features that you
need in the best situations okay now additionally to that one final note
especially about suckless stuff is that it is infinitely easier to add features
to suckless software than it is for anything else one thing that I added
you might remember if you've been watching my channel for a while last year
I added the feature let's say I have some output on my terminal I added the
feature with the help of a subscriber where I can just have a key that says
okay select which command you want and once you do that it will copy that output
to your clipboard so if I go in another you know let's say I open up Vim or
something in Vim let's say I open up Vim I can paste in the output of that
command okay so a lot of things that you might take for granted as not being
automatic on other terminals it's easy using a minimalist piece of software an
extensible minimalist piece of software you can easily add in features I didn't
know nothing about you know copying output from the terminal or something
like that but we sat down and did it in an evening okay it's not that hard and
that is the mindset so when you're saying something like that this guy
Christian or anyone else if you're a normie out there you like using Windows
Mac that's fine you think it's easy okay but if you're the kind of person who is
computer oriented I don't know why people say this this kind of stuff like
it using software like this is not like a big joke that people do for no reason
it's something that you can get a lot of bang for your buck out of and I
encourage you to try it and don't just think it's stupid because you don't
understand it okay I mean you don't understand because you're dumb or
something that's not what I'm saying just lurk more and just play around with it
and don't don't knock it till you've tried it that's all I gotta say alright
see you guys next
