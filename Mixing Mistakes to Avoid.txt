Five Ways to Ruin a Mix
We as producers and mixing engineers spend a lot of our time trying to get better at what we do. We look for opportunities to learn something new, and always try to keep up on the newest trends in music and sonic glory.

But in this whirlwind of fast-paced change known as the music industry, it���s easy to get stuck in bad habits and bad decisions that can quickly cripple your ability to make a great end product: a great mix.

Rather than focus on the newest, freshest tip or trick, let���s take a moment to remember how we can stay awesome by avoiding these five easy ways to ruin a mix.

1. Prepping and mixing at the same time

You need to prep your mix first. You know���the naming and organizing and routing and all that boring stuff. If you try to do this while you���re trying to be creative, you will fail. You don���t play your guitar without tuning it first, right?

2. Trying to do fancy techniques when they���re not necessary

Parallel compression is not going to save you if you���re unable to make drums sound great without parallel compression. These fancy mixing tricks are no replacement for great ears or great ability. Get great with the basics���level, panning, EQ, and compression���before you attempt the fancy stuff.

3. Soloing

Don���t solo something unless you have to! You���re here to MIX elements together to build a song, not make guitars sound awesome by themselves. No one is ever going to hear the guitars by themselves, so don���t waste your time!

4. Working too long

You need to take breaks, because your ears aren���t invincible and you���re only human. After a while, your ears will adjust to things you���re hearing, and you���ll start making bad decisions.

It���s good to keep your ears fresh. So take breaks by leaving the room every hour or so, and be sure to listen to other types of music in between your mixing moments to help keep your ears in tune with ���what the world is hearing��� while you work.

5. Running to the internet for advice

So, you���ve been mixing something for four hours and you run to the nearest forum to share with others. You get a ton of very wild opinions and critiques that don���t really seem to help you, because they���re coming from a wide range of perspectives, and with no constructive criticism to back them up. If there is constructive criticism, it seems to push you in the wrong directions.

Don���t make the mistake of involving the internet into your mixing process. It���s not going to help you get anywhere fast. Online forums and critiques are for when you���ve already got a handle on your skills and your tools, and you���re strictly looking for other opinions to broaden your outlook on the job.

I hope these five ways to ruin a mix will help you to prevent yourself from ruining your next mix. Keep mixing with your ears and your gut, that���s the best way to make magic happen!

The article you shared was written by producer, mixer, and engineer Joey Sturgis, and it discusses five common mistakes that can ruin a mix in music production. Here's a summary:
Prepping and mixing at the same time
: Trying to do the groundwork of preparing the mix, like naming, organizing, and routing, at the same time as being creative can result in a failed mix. It's important to first prep the mix, much like how one would tune a guitar before playing it.
Trying to do fancy techniques when they���re not necessary
: Utilizing complex techniques such as parallel compression won't save a mix if basic skills aren't mastered. It's important to first become proficient in the fundamentals - level, panning, EQ, and compression - before attempting more complex techniques.
Soloing
: The focus should be on mixing elements together to build a song, rather than making individual components sound great on their own. No one is going to hear elements like guitars by themselves, so it's unnecessary to spend time on this.
Working too long
: Taking breaks is crucial as listening for extended periods can lead to ear fatigue and poor decision-making. To keep the ears fresh, take breaks every hour or so, and listen to different types of music in between mixing to stay in tune with what others are listening to.
Running to the internet for advice
: Seeking advice from online forums can result in a barrage of differing opinions, which may be unhelpful or even detrimental. Online forums and critiques are better suited for when one already has a solid handle on their skills and tools, and are strictly seeking other perspectives to broaden their outlook.
Sturgis's advice for successful mixing centers on using your ears and trusting your gut instincts to create the best mix.

The tips provided by Joey Sturgis in the article you've shared are primarily geared towards music producers and mixing engineers. However, some of these principles can also be applied to DJs and projection mappers. Here are those principles translated specifically for these roles:
DJs
Preparation is crucial
: Like a mixing engineer, a DJ should know their tracks inside and out. This means spending time in preparation, understanding the structure of the songs, cue points, and creating a logical tracklist.
Master the basics before getting fancy
: DJs should first get comfortable with beat matching, phrasing, and EQing before they jump into more complex techniques like scratching, beat juggling, or using effects. Understanding the basics thoroughly can help ensure a smoother, more professional mix.
Context is key
: As a DJ, you���re playing for an audience, not for yourself. It���s important to understand what works in the context of the dance floor and the overall vibe of the event, rather than focusing on individual tracks in isolation.
Take breaks
: Listening to music at high volumes for an extended period can lead to ear fatigue. It's important to take breaks, even during a set, to keep your ears fresh.
Be careful where you get your advice
: Like the tip for the mixing engineers, DJs should also be wary of the advice they take from online forums. While these platforms can offer a wealth of information, they can also provide misleading advice.
Projection Mappers
Planning and mapping simultaneously can lead to issues
: Just like you wouldn���t mix and prep music at the same time, don���t try to design your projections and map them at the same time. Carefully plan out your design, consider the surfaces you're projecting onto, and then implement your mapping.
Don't use advanced techniques if they���re not needed
: Just because you can do something, doesn���t mean you should. Start with a clear, coherent design, and only use advanced techniques when they enhance your work.
Remember the overall picture
: Don���t get caught up in perfecting small sections at the expense of the larger image. Your audience will see the entire projection, not just one small part of it.
Take breaks
: Visual fatigue can affect your ability to make good decisions, just like ear fatigue in mixing or DJing. Take regular breaks to rest your eyes.
Be selective with advice
: Like music production, projection mapping has many techniques and approaches, and what works for one person may not work for another. Seek advice from experienced professionals when possible, and be selective with the tips and critiques you follow from online forums.

800,000 AD
Give a glossary of scientific terms in everyday usage as chart. Eloi vs Morlock
1 / 1
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
The terms "Eloi" and "Morlock" come from H.G. Wells' 1895 novel, "The Time Machine". In the book, the protagonist travels to the year 802,701 AD and encounters two post-human races: the Eloi, who live above ground, and the Morlocks, who live underground.
Below is a brief glossary of some scientific and related terms that may be relevant in a discussion of these concepts:
Term
Definition
Post-Human
A hypothetical future being whose basic capacities so radically exceed those of present humans as to be no longer unambiguously human by our current standards.
Evolution
The process by which different kinds of living organisms are believed to have developed from earlier forms during the history of the earth.
Dystopia
An imagined state or society in which there is great suffering or injustice, typically one that is totalitarian or post-apocalyptic.
Time Travel
The concept of movement between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space.
Genetic Engineering
The deliberate modification of the characteristics of an organism by manipulating its genetic material.
Biological Adaptation
The process by which an organism or species becomes better suited to its environment.
Surface Dweller (Eloi in context)
An organism that primarily lives on or near the surface of its habitat.
Subterranean (Morlock in context)
Existing, occurring, or done under the earth's surface.
It's important to note that in the context of "The Time Machine", the Eloi and Morlocks are products of social and biological evolution over an extreme timescale, representing a bifurcation of humanity into two distinct species. The Eloi are depicted as beautiful but feeble and intellectually inferior, having lived a life of ease on the surface. In contrast, the Morlocks are depicted as brutish, nocturnal creatures adapted to life underground, but with the technological prowess to support both their own society and the idle lives of the Eloi above, whom they also prey upon.

Eloi ��� Morlocks

Curiosity and imagination ��� Cold machines and technology
Inner space of the mind ��� Outer reaches of the universe
Playful ��� Unyielding
Rebels seeking understanding and cooperation ��� Anti-adultism forces
Striving to conquer ��� Seeking to dominate

ChatGPT
Certainly, the dichotomy between the Eloi and the Morlocks in H.G. Wells' "The Time Machine" can indeed serve as an allegory for various contrasting aspects of human nature, society, and the world. Here's how the terms you've listed might map onto the Eloi vs. Morlocks:
Eloi
Morlocks
Curiosity and Imagination
Cold Machines and Technology
Exploring the Inner Space of the Mind
Venturing into the Outer Reaches of the Universe
Playful, Embodying a Sense of Freedom and Joy
Unyielding, Representing Rigidity and Industriousness
Rebels Seeking Understanding and Cooperation
Forces of Control and Conformity
Striving to Conquer, Highlighting the Human Drive to Overcome
Seeking to Dominate, Illustrating a Desire for Power and Control
This juxtaposition further emphasizes the commentary that Wells was making about the potential bifurcation of human society along lines of class and the possible consequences of technological development without corresponding social and ethical progress.
