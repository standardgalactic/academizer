ABSTRACT 
Textural Inversion, a prompt learning method, learns a singular embedding for a 
new ���word��� to represent image style and appearance, allowing it to be integrated 
into natural language sentences to generate novel synthesised images. However, 
identifying and integrating multiple object-level concepts within one scene poses 
signif i cant challenges even when embeddings for individual concepts are attain- 
able. This is further conf i rmed by our empirical tests. To address this challenge, 
we introduce a framework for Multi-Concept Prompt Learning (MCPL), where 
multiple new ���words��� are simultaneously learned from a single sentence-image 
pair. To enhance the accuracy of word-concept correlation, we propose three reg- 
ularisation techniques: Attention Masking (AttnMask) to concentrate learning on 
relevant areas; Prompts Contrastive Loss (PromptCL) to separate the embeddings 
of different concepts; and Bind adjective (Bind adj.) to associate new ���words��� 
with known words. We evaluate via image generation, editing, and attention vi- 
sualisation with diverse images. Extensive quantitative comparisons demonstrate 
that our method can learn more semantically disentangled concepts with enhanced 
word-concept correlation. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset and evalua- 
tion protocol tailored for this new task of learning object-level concepts.

In contrast, our method (right) can learn, compose, and edit multiple concepts simultaneously. The 
learning input consists of image(s) accompanied by descriptive sentences with learnable prompts, 
represented as coloured pseudo words. The average cross-attentions and the corresponding mask of 
the learned prompts denote a disentangled and precise prompt-concept correlation. 
1INTRODUCTION 
In nurseries, toddlers are shown pictures to learn new things. Teachers talk about each picture using 
sentences with new ideas, like sentences with unfamiliar words. In the Figure 1 right (ours) example, 
the describing sentence for the images is: ���a photo of brown * on a rolling & at time square���. Here, 
���* (teddy bear)��� and ���& (skateboard)��� are the unfamiliar concepts to be learned. This way of

learning with simple hints is more economical and preferred over the current method of teaching 
machines using detailed contours and masks. 
Recent research (Gal et al. (2022); Ruiz et al. (2022)) shows that the appearance and style of an 
image can be encapsulated as a cohesive concept via a learned prompt (���word���). The textural em- 
bedding of this new prompt is optimised in the frozen embedding space of a pre-trained text-to- 
image diffusion model to reconstruct several example input images. The concept conveyed by the 
learned prompt can then be composed into natural language sentences to generate or edit various 
novel scenes. Despite the signif i cant interest in object-level image editing, (Wu et al., 2020; Meng 
et al., 2021; Hertz et al., 2022), Gal et al. (2022) points out that recent prompt learning methods 
struggle with learning and composing multiple prompts within multi-object scenes (Figure 1 left). 
In this work, we start with a motivational study to investigate the capabilities and limitations of 
existing prompt learning methods in multi-concept settings. Our i ndings conf i rm that while apply- 
ing careful sampling such as manual masking or cropping yields distinct embeddings, object-level 
learning and editing without manual intervention remains challenging. Motivated by this i nding, 
we introduce Multi-Concept Prompt Learning (MCPL) framework Figure 2 (top) for simultaneous 
learning of multiple prompts from one scene.

This abstract presents research on Multi-Concept Prompt Learning (MCPL), a novel framework that aims to advance the capabilities of prompt-based image generation and editing. Here's a breakdown of the main points:
Background
: Textural Inversion, an existing method, can learn an embedding (a representation) for a new "word" that represents an image's style and appearance. The challenge is that while it's feasible to create these embeddings for individual concepts, integrating multiple object-level concepts within one scene is challenging.
Multi-Concept Prompt Learning (MCPL)
: To tackle this challenge, the authors introduce MCPL, which allows multiple new "words" (prompts) to be learned simultaneously from a single sentence-image pair.
Regularisation Techniques
: To increase the precision of correlating the learned prompts with their respective concepts:
Attention Masking (AttnMask)
focuses the learning on relevant parts of the image.
Prompts Contrastive Loss (PromptCL)
ensures that embeddings for different concepts are distinct.
Bind adjective (Bind adj.)
associates new ���words��� with known words to provide context.
Evaluation
: The efficacy of MCPL was tested via image generation, editing, and attention visualization. The results indicated that MCPL can identify more semantically distinct concepts with improved correlation between the words and their respective concepts.
Dataset
: The authors have also introduced a novel dataset specifically designed to evaluate the learning of object-level concepts.
Comparison with Existing Methods
: Traditional methods like Textural Inversion can only learn and generate images based on one concept at a time. MCPL, on the other hand, can simultaneously learn, compose, and edit images based on multiple concepts.
Motivation and Analogies
: The authors draw an analogy to how toddlers learn. Just as kids are shown pictures and taught new concepts with simple sentences, MCPL uses descriptive sentences with embedded prompts to teach machines new visual concepts. This method is touted as more efficient than the current techniques which rely on detailed outlines and masks.
Previous Research
: Prior research has demonstrated that the appearance and style of an image can be represented as a cohesive concept using a learned prompt. However, challenges arise when trying to learn and integrate multiple prompts in scenes with multiple objects.
Goal of This Work
: The researchers aim to explore the limitations of existing methods and introduce a solution (MCPL) for learning multiple prompts from one scene without manual intervention.
Overall, the research focuses on improving the process of generating and editing images using prompts, making it more efficient and versatile by learning multiple object-level concepts from a single image.

ABSTRACT 
We present LLEMMA, a large language model for mathematics. We continue 
pretraining Code Llama onProof-Pile-2, a mixture of scientif i c papers, web data 
containing mathematics, and mathematical code, yielding LLEMMA. On the MATH 
benchmark LLEMMAoutperforms all known open base models, as well as the 
unreleased Minerva model suite on an equi-parameter basis. Moreover, LLEMMA 
is capable of tool use and formal theorem proving without any further i netuning. 
We openly release all artifacts, including 7 billion and 34 billion parameter models, 
the Proof-Pile-2, and code to replicate our experiments.1

Language models trained on diverse mixtures of 
text display remarkably general language understand- 
ing and generation capabilities (Brown et al., 2020; 
Chowdhery et al., 2022), serving as base models that 
are adapted to a wide range of applications (Raffel 
et al., 2023). Applications such as open-ended dia- 
logue (Thoppilan et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023) 
or instruction following (Ouyang et al., 2022; Wei 
et al., 2022) require balanced performance across the 
entire distribution of natural text, thus favoring gen- 
eralist models. However, if we seek to maximize 
performance within one domain, such as medicine 
(Singhal et al., 2022; 2023), i nance (Wu et al., 2023), 
or science (Taylor et al., 2022), a domain-specif i c 
language model may offer superior capabilities for 
a given computational cost, or lower computational 
cost for a given level of capability. 
In this work, we train a domain-specif i c language 
model for mathematics. We have several motivations 
for doing so. First, solving mathematical problems requires pattern matching against a large body 
of specialized prior knowledge, thus serving as an ideal setting for domain adaptation. Second, 
mathematical reasoning is in itself a central AI task, its study dating back to at least Gelernter (1959) 
and Wang (1960) and continuing to today (Lu et al., 2023). Third, language models capable of 
strong mathematical reasoning are upstream of a number of research topics, such as reward modeling 
(Uesato et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023), reinforcement learning for reasoning (Polu et al., 2022; 
Lample et al., 2022), and algorithmic reasoning (Zhou et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023).

Although domain-specif i c models for mathematics have been trained in the past, they have either 
been closed access (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), limiting their ability to become a platform for further 
research, or have lagged far behind the closed access state-of-the-art (Azerbayev et al., 2023). 
We present a recipe for adapting a language model to mathematics through continued pretrain- 
ing (Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Rozi��re et al., 2023) onProof-Pile-2, a diverse mixture of math-related 
text and code. Applying the recipe to Code Llama (Rozi��re et al., 2023) yields LLEMMA: 7 billion 
and 34 billion parameter base language models with substantially improved mathematical capabilities. 
Specif i cally, our contributions are as follows: 
1.We train and release the LLEMMAmodels: 7B and 34B parameter language models specialized for 
mathematics. The LLEMMAmodels are a new state-of-the-art for publicly released base models 
on MATH (Lewkowycz et al., 2022). 
2.We release theAlgebraicStack, a dataset of 11B tokens of code specif i cally related to mathematics. 
3.We demonstrate that LLEMMAis capable of using computational tools to solve mathematical 
problems, namely, the Python interpreter and formal theorem provers. 
4.Unlike prior mathematics language models such as Minerva (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), the 
LLEMMAmodels are open access and we open source our training data and code. This allows 
LLEMMAto serve as a platform for future research in mathematical reasoning. 
Our work builds on i ndings in Minerva (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), but differs in several ways: 
(1) LLEMMA���s training and evaluation covers a wider range of data and tasks, notably code data 
(e.g., theAlgebraicStack), tool use, and formal mathematics; (2) our work only depends on publicly 
accessible tools and data; (3) we provide new analyses related to the continued training data mixture, 
memorization, and additional supervised i netuning; (4) we make all artifacts publicly available.

2.1DATA: Proof-Pile-2 
We form theProof-Pile-2, a 55B-token mixture of scientif i c papers, web data containing mathematics, 
and mathematical code. With the exception of the Lean proofsteps subset (see Appendix B), the 
Proof-Pile-2 has a knowledge cutoff of April 2023. 
Code.Computational tools such as numerical simulations, computer algebra systems, and formal 
theorem provers are of ever increasing importance to mathematicians (Avigad, 2018). Motivated by 
this fact, we createAlgebraicStack, an 11B-token dataset of source code from 17 languages, spanning 
numerical, symbolic, and formal math. The dataset consists of i ltered code from the Stack (Kocetkov 
et al., 2022), public GitHub repositories, and formal proofstep data. Table 9 shows the number of 
tokens by language in AlgebraicStack. See Appendix B.1 for further details on AlgebraicStack. 
Web data.We use OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a 15B-token dataset of high-quality web 
pages i ltered for mathematical content. OpenWebMath i lters CommonCrawl web pages based 
2 
Preprint. 
on math-related keywords and a classif i er-based math score, preserves mathematical formatting 
(e.g., L ATEX, AsciiMath), and includes additional quality i lters (e.g., perplexity, domain, length) and 
near-deduplication. Refer to Paster et al. (2023) for a full description of OpenWebMath. 
Scientif i c papers.We use the ArXiv subset of RedPajama (Computer, 2023), an open-access 
reproduction of the LLaMA training dataset. The ArXiv subset contains 29B tokens. 
General natural language and code data.Following Lewkowycz et al. (2022), our training 
mixture consists of a small amount of general domain data, which functions as a form of regularization. 
Since the pretraining dataset for LLaMA 2 is undisclosed, we use the Pile (Gao et al., 2020; Biderman 
et al., 2022) as a surrogate training dataset. We set 95% of our training mixture to be theProof-Pile-2, 
2% to be from the Pile (with ArXiv removed, as it is separately inProof-Pile-2), and 3% to be the 
GitHub subset of RedPajama (Computer, 2023). 
Further information on dataset composition and a datasheet are in Appendix B and Appendix E, re- 
spectively. We publicly release Proof-Pile-2 athf.co/datasets/EleutherAI/proof-pile-2.

All information regarding the composition of datasets and further details are provided in the paper's appendices. The Proof-Pile-2 dataset has been made publicly accessible.
2.2MODEL ANDTRAINING 
Each model is initialized from Code Llama (Rozi��re et al., 2023). Code Llama models are decoder- 
only transformer language models initialized from Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023) and further trained 
on 500B tokens of code. We continue training the Code Llama models onProof-Pile-2using a 
standard autoregressive language modeling objective. We train the 7B model for 200B tokens, and 
the 34B model for 50B tokens. 
We train all models inbf l oat16mixed precision using the GPT-NeoX library (Andonian et al., 2023) 
across 256 A100 40GB GPUs. We use Tensor Parallelism (Shoeybi et al., 2019) with a world size 
of 2 for LLEMMA-7B , and a world size of 8 for LLEMMA-34B, alongside ZeRO Stage 1 sharded 
optimizer states (Rajbhandari et al., 2020) across Data Parallel (Goyal et al., 2017) replicas. We use 
Flash Attention 2 (Dao, 2023) to improve throughput and further reduce memory requirements. 
LLEMMA7B is trained for42,000steps with a global batch size of 4 million tokens and a 4096 token 
context length. This corresponds to roughly 23,000 A100-hours. The learning rate is warmed up to 
1��10���4over500steps, then set to cosine decay to1/30th of the maximum learning rate over48,000 
steps. The reason for the discrepancy between the number of training steps and the scheduler length 
is that we planned to train for48,000steps, but encountered NaN losses after step42,000, likely 
caused by unstable optimization or hardware failures (Elsen et al., 2023). 
LLEMMA34B is trained for12,000steps with a global batch size of 4 million tokens and a 4096 
context length. This corresponds to roughly 47,000 A100-hours. The learning rate is warmed up to 
5 �� 10���5over 
500 steps, then decayed to 1/30th the peak learning rate. 
Before training LLEMMA7B, we contract the RoPE (Su et al., 2022) base period of the Code Llama 
7B initialization from�� = 1,000,000to�� = 10,000. This is so that the long context i netuning 
procedure described in Peng et al. (2023)and Rozi��re et al. (2023) can be repeated on the trained 
LLEMMA7B (we leave actually doing so to future work). Due to compute constraints, we were 
unable to verify that training LLEMMA34B with a contracted RoPE base period did not come with a 
performance penalty, therefore for that model we preserved �� = 1,000,000.

2.2 Model and Training Process for LLEMMA
Initialization
: Both models of LLEMMA are initialized from the Code Llama model, which is a decoder-only transformer language model. The Code Llama model was derived from Llama 2 and was further trained on 500B tokens of code. The team continued to train the Code Llama models on the Proof-Pile-2 dataset.
Training Tokens
: The 7B parameter model (LLEMMA7B) is trained for 200B tokens, while the 34B parameter model (LLEMMA34B) is trained for 50B tokens.
Technical Details
:
Hardware
: Training is conducted on 256 A100 40GB GPUs using the GPT-NeoX library in bf float16 mixed precision.
Techniques
: The team utilized Tensor Parallelism, ZeRO Stage 1 sharded optimizer states, and Flash Attention 2 for efficient training.
LLEMMA7B Training Specs
:
Trained for 42,000 steps with a batch size of 4 million tokens.
Context length of 4096 tokens.
Consumed about 23,000 A100-hours.
Learning rate warmed up to 1��10^-4 over 500 steps, then cosine decayed. However, training had to be stopped prematurely due to NaN losses encountered after step 42,000.
LLEMMA34B Training Specs
:
Trained for 12,000 steps with a batch size of 4 million tokens.
Context length of 4096 tokens.
Consumed about 47,000 A100-hours.
Learning rate warmed up to 5 �� 10^-5 over 500 steps, then decayed.
RoPE Base Period
: Before training LLEMMA7B, the RoPE base period of the Code Llama 7B initialization was changed from �� = 1,000,000 to �� = 10,000. This modification allows for the repetition of a long context fine-tuning procedure on LLEMMA7B in future work. The team did not adjust LLEMMA34B's RoPE due to concerns over potential performance penalties, maintaining its base period at �� = 1,000,000.
3EVALUATION 
Our goal is to evaluate LLEMMAas a base model for mathematical text. To this end, we compare 
LLEMMAmodels using few-shot evaluation (Brown et al., 2020), and primarily focus on state-of-the- 
art models that have not been i netuned on supervised examples for the task. First, we evaluate the 
model���s ability to solve mathematics problems using chain of thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and 
majority voting (Wang et al., 2023). Our evaluations include MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) and 
GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021), the de-facto standard benchmarks for evaluating quantitative reasoning 
in language models (Lewkowycz et al., 2022). Second, we explore few-shot tool use and formal 
theorem proving. Third, we study the effects of memorization and the data mixture. Appendix G 
contains a preliminary study of supervised i netuning with LLEMMA.

3.1CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM SOLVING 
These tasks involve generating self-contained text solutions to problems expressed in L ATEX or natural 
language, without using external tools (Lewkowycz et al., 2022). We use the following evaluation: 
���MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), a dataset with 12.5k problems (5k evaluation) from high-school 
math competitions. Given a problem statement, the model generates a L ATEXsolution and an answer 
that must match a reference answer. We follow a similar task implementation to Lewkowycz et al. 
(2022), using their four-example prompt and evaluating answers for exact string match orSymPy 
equivalence. 
���GSM8k (Cobbe et al., 2021), a dataset of middle-school level math word problems. We use the 
8-shot prompt from Wei et al. (2023), as Lewkowycz et al. (2022) do not specify their evaluation 
prompt or number of few-shot examples.

Figure 3: Example of a LLEMMA34B solution to a MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) problem. This 
problem is tagged with diff i culty level 5, the highest in MATH. The model was conditioned on the 
4-shot prompt described in subsection 3.1, and the solution was produced by greedy decoding. The 
model had to apply two nontrivial steps to solve this problem: (1) noticing that swapping the order of 
summation simplif i es the problem, and (2) noticing that the resulting sum telescopes. 
We compare with Minerva (Lewkowycz et al., 2022), which continued pretraining the PaLM language 
model on a dataset of technical content; Code Llama, the initialization of LLEMMA���s continued 
pretraining; and Llama 2, the initialization of Code Llama���s continued pretraining on code. For open 
access models, we report scores computed using our evaluation suite, which is implemented as a 
fork of the Language Model Evaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2021). For Minerva models, we report 
benchmark scores from Lewkowycz et al. (2022). 4

: The primary goal is to assess LLEMMA as a foundational model for mathematical text. The evaluation is centered around few-shot learning (Brown et al., 2020), and the team specifically looks at models that haven't been fine-tuned on supervised examples.
Methods
:
Chain-of-Thought Mathematical Problem Solving
: This method involves producing self-contained text solutions to problems described in LATEX or natural language, without external tool use. Datasets used:
MATH
(Hendrycks et al., 2021b): Consists of 12.5k problems from high-school math competitions. The model generates a LATEX solution and an answer that should match the reference.
GSM8k
(Cobbe et al., 2021): Features middle-school level math word problems.
OCWCourses
(Lewkowycz et al., 2022): Contains undergraduate-level STEM problems from MIT���s OpenCourseWare.
MMLU-STEM
(Hendrycks et al., 2021a): Subset of the MMLU benchmark with 18 out of 57 subjects.
SAT
: Dataset of 32 math questions from the May 2023 College Board SAT examination.
Few-shot Tool Use and Formal Theorem Proving
: Details not mentioned in the provided text.
Effects of Memorization and Data Mixture
: Details not mentioned in the provided text.
Example Solution by LLEMMA34B
: An example is provided where LLEMMA34B solves a problem from the MATH dataset. The problem has the highest difficulty level. The model, when conditioned on the 4-shot prompt, uses two nontrivial steps to solve it:
Changing the order of summation for simplification.
Recognizing that the resulting sum telescopes.
Comparative Models
:
The results from LLEMMA are compared against:
Minerva
(Lewkowycz et al., 2022): A model that continued pretraining the PaLM language model on technical content.
Code Llama
: The base model from which LLEMMA is derived.
Llama 2
: The initialization of Code Llama's continued training on code.
Evaluation Suite
: For open-access models, scores are computed using the team's evaluation suite, which is based on the Language Model Evaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2021). For Minerva models, benchmark scores from Lewkowycz et al. (2022) are reported.
Results.LLEMMA���s continued pretraining onProof-Pile-2improves few-shot performance on the 
i ve mathematical benchmarks. LLEMMA34B improves over Code Llama by 20 percentage points 
on GSM8k and 13 points on MATH, and LLEMMA7B outperforms the proprietary Minerva model. 
Our approach also outperforms all open-weight language models at the time of writing. We conclude 
that continued pretraining onProof-Pile-2is effective for improving a pretrained model���s ability to 
perform mathematical problem solving. 
LLEMMAis pretrained on a diverse distribution of mathematics-related data, and is not tuned for a 
particular task. Therefore, we expect that LLEMMAcan adapt to many other tasks via task-specif i c 
i netuning and few-shot prompting.

���MATH+Python, the model is prompted to alternately describe a solution step in natural language, 
then execute that step with code. The i nal answer is a program that executes to a numeric type or a 
SymPyobject. Our few-shot prompt includes examples that use built-in numeric operations, the 
math module, and SymPy. 
���GSM8k+Python, solving a GSM8k word problem by writing a Python program that executes to 
an integer answer. We use the prompt from Gao et al. (2023).

GSM8k+Python
: The task involves solving a GSM8k word problem by writing and executing a Python program that provides an integer answer.
Table 3
highlights LLEMMA's performance on these tool-using tasks:
LLEMMA surpasses Code Llama in both tasks. Its tool-assisted performance on MATH and GSM8k is also superior to its tool-free performance on the same datasets.
Overall, LLEMMA demonstrates a promising ability to solve mathematical problems, both in a chain-of-thought manner and using computational tools, outperforming or competing closely with other notable models in the field.
3.3FORMAL MATHEMATICS 
Interactive proof assistants such as Lean (de Moura et al., 2015), Isabelle (Wenzel et al., 2008), 
and Coq (Paulin-Mohring, 1989a;b) express mathematics in programming languages that allow for 
verif i cation. These languages are data scarce compared to mainstream languages, especially in 
the context of pretraining. For instance, the Stack dataset used to pretrain language models in the 
BigCode project (Allal et al., 2023) has over 700 gigabytes of Python, compared to 322 megabytes of 
Lean. Proof assistants also require models to leverage information that is not present in raw source 
code, such as goal states that contain information about each step of a proof. 
Problem (MATH Number theory 185): When a number is divided by 5, the remainder is 3. 
What is the remainder when twice the number is divided by 5? Show that it is 1. 
Human-written informal proof: If our number isn, thenn ��� 3 (mod 5). 
This tells us that 
2n = n + n ��� 3 + 3 ��� 1(mod 
5). 
The remainder is 1 when the number is divided by 5.

Proof-Pile-2���sAlgebraicStackcontains over 1.5 billion tokens of formal mathematics data, including 
proof states extracted from Lean and Isabelle formalizations. While a full investigation of formal 
math is outside the scope of this paper, we evaluate LLEMMAfew-shot on two tasks: 
6 
Preprint. 
���Informal-to-formal proving (Jiang et al., 2023), the task of generating a formal proof, given a 
formal statement, an informal L ATEX statement, and an informal LATEX proof. The formal proof is 
checked by the proof assistant. We use the Isabelle proof assistant and evaluate on miniF2F (Zheng 
et al., 2021), a benchmark consisting of problem statements from Olympiads and undergraduate 
coursework. For the prompt, we use 11 (formal statement, informal statement, informal proof, 
formal proof) examples from Jiang et al. (2023), selecting 7 examples for number theory problems, 
and 6 examples for all others. We generate a single proof with greedy decoding. 
���Formal-to-formal proving (e.g., Polu & Sutskever (2020)), the task of proving a formal statement 
by generating a sequence of proof steps (tactics). At each step, the input is a statextgiven by the 
proof assistant, and the language model���s task is to generate a proof stepyt(a sequence of code). 
The proof step is checked by the proof assistant, yielding a new statext+1or an error message. 
The process continues, stopping if a proof is completed or a timeout is reached. We prompt the 
model using three(xt,yt)examples. We evaluate on miniF2F (Zheng et al., 2021) using the Lean 
4 proof assistant, and use a standard best i rst search. See Appendix D for more details. 
Results.As seen in Table 4, LLEMMA���s continued pretraining onProof-Pile-2improved few-shot

model. COPRA (Thakur et al., 2023) is a retrieval-augmented GPT-4 based method. 
On informal-to-formal proving, LLEMMA-7b closes 22.1% of the theorems, improving upon its 
Code Llama initialization and the Sledgehammer prover. The theorems that LLEMMAproves are 
often complementary to those proved with Sledgehammer: taking the union of Sledgehammer and 
LLEMMAproofs results in 26 new validation proofs (an 11 percentage-point increase), and 17 new 
test proofs (a 7 point increase); see Appendix Table 11. Prior to our work, the only demonstration of 
few-shot proof autoformalization used the proprietary Codex model (Jiang et al., 2023). 
On Lean 4 formal-to-formal proving, LLEMMA-7b improves upon its Code Llama initialization, and 
performs similar to ReProver (Yang et al., 2023), a retrieval-augmented language model i netuned for 
tactic prediction. LLEMMAadapts to the task using a 3 example prompt, which to our knowledge is 
the i rst demonstration of few-shot tactic prediction for theorem proving by an open model.

3.4IMPACT OF DATA MIXTURE 
When training a language model, it is common to upsample high-quality subsets of the training data 
according to mixture weights (Brown et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2023). We select 
mixture weights by doing short training runs on several hand-picked mixture weights, then choosing 
the one which minimizes perplexity on a set of high-quality held-out text (we use the MATH training 
set). Table 5 shows the MATH training set perplexity of models trained using different mixtures of 
arXiv to web to code. Based on these results, we trained LLEMMAwith a ratio of2 : 4 : 1. Note 
that our methodology uses the MATH training set to determine a training hyperparameter, though we 
expect that the effect is similar to that of related high-quality texts.

3.5DATASET OVERLAP AND MEMORIZATION 
Do test problems or solutions appear in the corpus?We check whether any 30-gram in a 
test sequence (either an input problem or an output solution) occurs in any OpenWebMath or 
AlgebraicStackdocument. If so, we say that a hit occurred between the sequence and the document. 
Table 6 shows hits between sequences from MATH and documents fromProof-Pile-2. Using our 
methodology, around 7% of MATH test problem statements and 0.6% of MATH test solutions have 
hits. Note that our methodology gives a lower bound on the number of semantically equivalent 
sequences (e.g., it does not account for alternative phrasing). 
We manually inspected 100 uniformly sampled hits between a test problem statement and an Open- 
WebMath document. 41 of the cases had no solution, which included websites with a list of problems, 
discussions, or hints. 49 had an alternative solution to the MATH ground-truth solution, but with 
the same answer. These include solutions that solve the problem differently than the ground-truth, 
solutions with missing details, and discussions that include the answer. 9 cases had a missing or 
incorrect answer, and 1 had the same solution as in the ground-truth. In summary, we i nd that 
solutions can appear in a corpus derived from web documents, particularly alternative solutions to 
those in the evaluation set. We repeated our analysis with 20-gram hits and our i ndings were similar, 
though with false positives; see Appendix Figure 6 for examples.

(a 30-gram overlap between a problem or 
solution and a training sequence) and non- 
hits by MATH diff i culty level. 
How do problems in the corpus impact performance? 
Next, we evaluate LLEMMA-34b on the test examples 
with a 30-gram hit, and the test examples without a 30- 
gram hit. Table 7 shows the accuracy partitioned by 
MATH diff i culty level. The model���s accuracy remains 
low on diff i cult problems (e.g., 6.08% on Level 5 prob- 
lems with a hit, versus 6.39% on problems without a hit), 
and we observe no clear relationship between 30-gram 
hits and accuracy across diff i culty levels. We conclude 
that a nontrivial match between a test example and a 
training document did not imply that the model gen- 
erated a memorized correct answer. We repeated the 
analysis with 20-grams and with the 7b model, and our 
i ndings were analogous. Figure 7 shows an example.

Preprint. 
Finally, we check 30-gram hits between LLEMMA���s MATH generations and OpenWebMath. There 
were 13 hits, which occurred when the model generated a common sequence of numbers (e.g., a list 
of Fibonacci numbers), plus one instance of factoring a polynomial. Appendix Figure 6 shows an 
example. We i nd all of these observations worthy of further study. Using LLEMMAandProof-Pile-2 
to better understand data, memorization, and performance is an interesting future direction. We 
include the code for our analysis in the LLEMMArepository.
ChatGPT
The text seems to be a portion of a research paper or report discussing various aspects of training and evaluating a language model named LLEMMA. Here's a brief summary of the discussed sections:
3.4 Impact of Data Mixture
Upsampling high-quality subsets of training data based on mixture weights is common.
Mixture weights are selected to minimize perplexity on a high-quality held-out text, in this case, the MATH training set.
Table 5 provides the perplexity of the MATH training set for various mixtures of arXiv, web, and code data.
The selected ratio for training LLEMMA was 2:4:1 based on the results.
3.5 Dataset Overlap and Memorization
There's a concern about whether test problems or solutions from the MATH set appear in other corpora, specifically OpenWebMath or AlgebraicStack.
Around 7% of MATH test problem statements and 0.6% of MATH test solutions have overlaps or "hits".
Manual inspection of 100 such hits revealed varied results, including alternative solutions, missing answers, and more.
Table 6 provides detailed information on the hits between the MATH test problems/solutions and the Proof-Pile-2 documents.
Impact on Performance
LLEMMA-34b's performance was evaluated based on whether test examples had a 30-gram overlap (hit) with a training sequence.
Table 7 presents the accuracy by MATH difficulty level for problems with and without hits.
The model's accuracy remained low for difficult problems, and there was no clear relationship between 30-gram hits and accuracy.
It was concluded that an overlap between a test example and a training document did not necessarily mean the model produced a memorized correct answer.
In the end, they also checked for overlaps between LLEMMA's outputs for the MATH dataset and OpenWebMath. They found some instances where common sequences were generated, suggesting further study in this area is necessary. The code for the analysis is available in the LLEMMA repository, signaling transparency and an opportunity for the community to reproduce or further investigate the findings.
4RELATEDWORK 
Large-scale language modeling. Recent progress in large language models involves two connected 
threads: the increasing scale of models and data (Hoffmann et al., 2022; Kaplan et al., 2020; 
Chowdhery et al., 2022), and a progression toward more generalist models (Radford et al., 2019; 
Brown et al., 2020) which are capable of solving diverse problems and adapting quickly to novel 
tasks. A third thread relates to enabling open access to language models with these capabilities 
(Black et al., 2022; Biderman et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Rozi��re et al., 2023). Our work 
provides a recipe for specializing these language models to the domain of mathematics, providing a 
platform for further research and applications. 
Domain adaptation. Language model applications typically require a general-domain pretraining 
step, followed by a shorter i ne-tuning step. The i netuning step is often aimed at imbuing instruction- 
following ability (Sanh et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022) or aligning a model���s outputs with human 
preferences (Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022). Other work explores adapting 
pretrained models to novel domains by continued training (Rozi��re et al., 2023; Beltagy et al., 2019), 
parameter-eff i cient i netuning methods (Yong et al., 2023), retrieval augmentation (Min et al., 2023; 
Asai et al., 2023), and other techniques. We provide an adaptation recipe involving continued training 
and targeted data collection. 
Language models for mathematics. Applying large language models to problems in mathematics 
is an active subf i eld of machine learning, including benchmarking mathematical knowledge and 
reasoning at varying levels (Hendrycks et al., 2021b; Zheng et al., 2021; Welleck et al., 2022; 
Azerbayev et al., 2023). Although achieving strong mathematical reasoning is an important target, it 
is diff i cult to assess the correctness of models��� answers and processes, especially as models become 
more capable (Bowman et al., 2022; Uesato et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023; Cobbe et al., 2021). 
A number of recent works focus on supervised i netuning on task-relevant (input, output) pairs 
(e.g.,Yu et al. (2023); Yue et al. (2023)). Doing so boosts performance on some common mathematical 
language modeling benchmarks, but trains the model for these specif i c tasks. In contrast, Lewkowycz 
et al. (2022) and our work seek to train a base language model as a platform for further development. 
Language models for formal mathematics. An ongoing line of work explores integrating language 
models with interactive proof assistants in the context of mathematics. This includes synthesizing 
proofs via tactic prediction (Polu & Sutskever, 2020; Han et al., 2022; Lample et al., 2022; Jiang 
et al., 2022), autoformalization (Wu et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2023), and integrated tools (Welleck 
& Saha, 2023). Due to high computational costs of search, language models applied to this domain 
have traditionally been small, but recent work has demonstrated promise in the use of larger models 
(First et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). Our work provides a demonstration of few-shot proof autofor- 
malization and tactic prediction, a large collection of formal mathematics data, along with an open 
access model for further exploring these directions. 
5CONCLUSION 
We introduce LLEMMAandProof-Pile-2, a novel base model and corpus for language modeling of 
mathematics. Our models, dataset, and code are openly available. We have shown that LLEMMA 
achieves state-of-the-art results for open-weights models on mathematical problem solving bench- 
marks, shown capabilities of using external tools via Python code, and demonstrated few-shot tactic 
prediction for theorem proving. We hope that LLEMMAandProof-Pile-2will be a useful base for 
future work on understanding language model generalization and dataset composition, investigating 
the limits of domain-specif i c language models, using language models as tools for mathematicians, 
and improving the mathematical capabilities of language models.

Large-scale Language Modeling & Domain Adaptation
Large-scale language models serve as the foundation upon which domain adaptation techniques are applied. As models grow in size, they increasingly demonstrate generalist capabilities, but there's still a need for domain-specific fine-tuning or adaptation to enhance performance in specific areas, such as mathematics.
Domain Adaptation & Language Models for Mathematics
Domain adaptation is a key process that allows generalist models to be tailored for mathematical tasks. By adapting models to the domain of mathematics, they can better handle mathematical reasoning and problem-solving.
Data Mixture Impact & Dataset Overlap and Memorization
Both topics relate to the training data's influence on model performance. While the data mixture impact emphasizes the balance and quality of training data, the dataset overlap topic delves into the potential for models to recall or 'memorize' content from the training set.
Language Models for Mathematics & Language Models for Formal Mathematics
Both areas focus on the application of language models in mathematical domains. However, the former deals with general mathematical problems and reasoning, while the latter specifically targets formal proofs and the integration of language models with interactive proof assistants.
Multi-Concept Prompt Learning (MCPL) & Language Models for Mathematics
MCPL is a technique that enhances the model's capability to generate code for mathematical solutions. This is directly tied to the broader goal of applying language models to mathematical problems, where prompt-based techniques like MCPL can guide models to produce desired mathematical outputs.
MCPL & Domain Adaptation
MCPL can be seen as a specific application or method within the broader framework of domain adaptation. While domain adaptation might involve various techniques like retrieval augmentation or parameter-efficient fine-tuning, MCPL specifically deals with curriculum learning and prompt techniques for mathematical problem-solving.
In essence, the overarching theme here is the application and fine-tuning of large language models for specialized tasks, particularly in the mathematical domain. These topics are interconnected in their goal to push the boundaries of what's possible with language models, ensuring they're both versatile and accurate in their outputs.
However, without further assumptions on the embedding relationships, jointly learning multiple 
prompts is problematic. The model may disregard the semantic associations and instead prioritise 
optimising multiple embedding vectors for optimal image-level reconstruction. To enhance the ac- 
curacy of prompt-object level correlation, we propose the following regularisation techniques: 1) To 
ensure a concentrated correlation between each prompt-concept pair, we propose Attention Mask- 
ing (AttnMask), restricting prompt learning to relevant regions def i ned by a cross-attention-guided 
mask. 2) Recognising that multiple objects within a scene are semantically distinct, we introduce 
Prompts Contrastive Loss (PromptCL) to facilitate the disentanglement of prompt embeddings asso- 
ciated with multiple concepts. 3) To further enable accurate control of each learned embedding, we 
bind each learnable prompt with a related descriptive adjective word, referred to as Bind adj., that 
we empirically observe has a strong regional correlation. The middle and bottom row of Figure 2 
illustrates the proposed regularisation techniques. 
In this work we implement our proposed method based on Textural Inversion by Gal et al. (2022), 
but the method can be adapted to other prompt learning methods such as Dreambooth by Ruiz et al. 
(2022). To our knowledge, our technique is the i rst to address the novel and challenging problem of 
learning and composing multiple concepts within multi-object scenes. To evaluate this task, we as- 
sembled datasets of multi-concept images featuring a total of 16 categories of object-level concepts. 
These datasets include both natural images, familiar to the pre-trained model, and out-of-distribution 
biomedical images, each equipped with object-level masks. We evaluate and demonstrate that our 
framework enables enhanced precision in object-level concept learning, synthesis, editing, quan- 
tif i cation, and understanding of relationships between multiple objects, as exemplif i ed in Figure 1 
(right) and further illustrated in Figure 9. Through extensive quantitative analysis of approximately 
4000 learned object-level embeddings, using both t-SNE and four robust, pre-trained text/image em- 
bedding spaces, we validate that our method excels in discerning semantically distinct object-level 
concepts, ensuring enhanced prompt-to-concept correlation.

Prompt learning for image concept inversion.Prompt tuning, i rst proposed by Lester et al. 
(2021), has been utilised to expedite the tuning of large language models for downstream tasks. Jia 
et al. (2022); Zhou et al. (2022) further extended this approach to vision-language models such as 
CLIP (Radford et al. (2021)). In the context of text-guided image synthesising, prompt learning 
would enable connecting the appearance and style of an unseen image to a learnable prompt and 
transferring to newly generated images, as demonstrated by Textural Inversion Gal et al. (2022) 
and DreamBooth Ruiz et al. (2022). To better composite multiple concepts Kumari et al. (2023) 
proposed to i ne-tune a subset of cross-attention layers. However, this approach learns multiple 
concepts separately from carefully sampled images rather than from the same scene.

an adjective (e.g., ���brown��� and ���rolling���) to improve control over each learned concept, referred to as Bind adj. 
developed RePaint to enable mask-guided local image editing. Avrahami et al. (2022) further condi- 
tioned local editing with text condition. These methods use manual masks prior to guide local image 
editing. A set of recent works showed that text-guided local object-level editing can be achieved 
without using a mask prior but instead the attention-derived masks (Hertz et al. (2022); Tumanyan 
et al. (2023); Patashnik et al. (2023)). The success of these approaches heavily relies on the accurate 
text-concept semantic correlation in the pre-trained model and is limited to in-distribution concepts.

Disentangled per-concept image editing.Interpretable and disentangled per-concept image ma- 
nipulation has garnered signif i cant interest in the literature on Generative Adversarial Networks 
(GANs). Traditional approaches often focus on layer-wise or channel-wise control within a pre- 
trained generator network. The goal is to identify and modify a subset of parameters responsible for 
specif i c concepts (Brock et al., 2018; Karras et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). Although our work is not 
centred on GAN-based approaches, we emphasise that we directly optimise multiple embeddings 
rather than network parameters. This methodology has been shown to better adapt to unseen and 
novel concepts by Gal et al. (2022). 
3METHODS 
In this section, we outline the preliminaries in Section 3.1 and present a motivational study in Sec- 
tion 3.2. These tests investigate the challenges of applying existing image-level prompt learning 
methods in identifying and integrating multiple object-level concepts within one scene. Inspired by 
these results, we introduce the Multi-Concept Prompt Learning (MCPL) framework for simultane- 
ous learning of multiple prompts from one scene. To address the complexity of optimising multiple 
object-level prompts in tandem with a single image-level reconstruction goal, we propose several 
regularisation techniques in Section 3.4. The code will be released here upon publication. 
3.1PRELIMINARIES:PROMPT LEARNING IN TEXT-TO-IMAGE DIFFUSION MODEL 
Text-guided diffusion models are probabilistic generative models trained to approximate the train- 
ing data distribution through a process of incremental denoising from Gaussian random noise, con- 
ditioned on text embeddings. Specif i cally, a denoising network ����is trained to map an initial noise 
map �� ��� N(0,I) and conditional textual embedding v = c��(p) 
to generate images �� x close to the 
3 
Preprint. Under review. 
target one x. Here c��is the text encoder and p is the text prompt. To enable sequential denoising, 
c��and ����are jointly optimised to minimize the loss: 
LDM= LDM(x, �� x) := Ex0,�����N(0,I),t���Uniform(1,T)����� ��� ����(xt,t,c��(p))���2,(1) 
where xtis obtained by adding noise to the initial image x0at a given time step t in the set T. 
Intuitively, the objective here is to correctly remove the noise added to an image conditioned to a 
given text prompt. During inference, the pre-trained model iteratively eliminates noise from a new 
random noise map to generate a fresh image. Our work builds on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) 
(Rombach et al., 2022), which encode images x with an encoder E to get latent representation 
z = E(x), prior to the diffusion process and decode after generation to conserve computation. 
The prompt learning method by (Gal et al. (2022)) is aimed at identifying the text embedding v���for 
a new prompt p���in a pre-trained text-guided diffusion model. Given a few (3-5) example images 
representing a specif i c subject or concept, the method optimises v���in the frozen latent space of a 
pre-trained text encoder c��. The objective is to generate an image via the denoising network ����that 
closely resembles the example images when conditioned on v���. The optimisation is guided by the 
diffusion model loss def i ned in equation 1, updating only v���while keeping c��and ����frozen. The 
Textural Inversion is also trained with random sentences to generalise the learning, refer to Appendix 
A.6 for the full detailed algorithm. 
Cross-attention layers play a pivotal role in directing the text-guided diffusion process. Within 
the denoising network, ����, the textual embedding, v = c��(p), interacts with the image embedding, 
z = E(x), via the cross-attention layer. Here, Q = fQ(z), 
K = fK(v), and V = fV(v) are 
acquired using learned linear layers fQ,fK,fV. As Hertz et al. (2022) highlighted, the per-prompt 
cross-attention maps, M = Softmax(QKT/���d), correlate to the similarity between Q and K. 
Therefore the average of the cross-attention maps over all time steps ref l ects the crucial regions 
corresponding to each prompt word, as depicted in Figure 2. In this study, the per-prompt attention 
map serves as one of the primary matrices to evaluate the correlation between prompt and concept. 
Our results will demonstrate that without proper constraints, the attention maps of newly learned 
prompts are not consistently disentangled and may lack accurate prompt-concept correlation. 
3.2MOTIVATIONAL STUDY:IS IMAGE-LEVEL PROMPT LEARNING SUFFICIENT FOR 
OBJECT-LEVEL MULTI-CONCEPT LEARNING? 
Do multiple distinct embeddings arise from the same image?To understand the challenges in 
learning and composing multiple concepts, we explored whether Textural Inversion can discern se- 
mantically distinct concepts from processed images, each highlighting a single concept. Following 
Wu et al. (2020), we used images with manual masks to isolate concepts, as seen in Figure 3 (left). 
We applied Textural Inversion to these images to learn embeddings for the unmasked or masked 
images. Our i ndings indicate that when focusing on isolated concepts, Textural Inversion can suc- 
cessfully learn distinct embeddings, as validated by the generated representations of each concept. 
Is separate learning of concepts suff i cient for multi-object image generation?While human- 
guided, separate learning of each concept in a multi-object scene deviates from our objective, it is 
valuable to evaluate its effectiveness. Specif i cally, we use Textural Inversion to separately learn con- 
cepts like ���ball��� and ���box��� from carefully cropped images, as shown in Figure 3 (second column). 
We then attempt to compose images using strings that combine these concepts, such as ���a photo of a 
green ball on orange box.��� Our results indicate that the accurate composition of multi-object images 
remains challenging, even when individual concepts are well-learned.

3.3MULTI-CONCEPTPROMPTLEARNING(MCPL) 
Our motivational study conf i rm that: 1) multiple unique embeddings can be derived from a single 
multi-concept image, albeit with human intervention, and 2) despite having well-learned individual 
concepts, synthesizing them into a unif i ed multi-concept scene remains challenging. To address 
these issues, we introduce the Multi-Concept Prompt Learning (MCPL) framework. MCPL modi- 
i es Textural Inversion to enable simultaneous learning of multiple prompts within the same string. 
In specif i c, MCPL learn a list of multiple embeddings V = [v���,...,v&] 
corresponds to multiple 
new prompts P = [p���,...,p&]. 
The optimisation is still guided by the image-level LDM, but now

methods: Textural Inversion (T.I.), which crops and learns each concept separately; MCPL-one,

updating {v���,...,v&} while keeping c��and ����frozen. The MCPL algorithm is outlined in Ap- 
pendix A.6, Algorithm A.6. Recognising the complexity of learning multiple embeddings with a 
single image-generation goal, we propose three training strategies: 1) MCPL-all, a naive approach 
that learns embeddings for all prompts in the string (including adjectives, prepositions and nouns. 
etc.); 2) MCPL-one, which simplif i es the objective by learning single prompt (nouns) per concept; 3) 
MCPL-diverse, where different strings are learned per image to observe variances among examples. 
Preliminary evaluations of MCPL-one and MCPL-diverse methods on the ���ball��� and ���box��� multi- 
concept task are shown in Figure 3. Our i ndings indicate that MCPL-one enhance the joint learning 
of multiple concepts within the same scene over separate learning. Meanwhile, MCPL-diverse goes 
further by facilitating the learning of intricate relationships between multiple concepts. 
Limitations of plain MCPL.Our primary aim is to facilitate accurate interpretation and modi- 
i cation of multi-concept scenes. To evaluate object-level prompt-concept correlation, we visualise 
the average cross-attention maps for each prompt. As depicted in Figure 4, both MCPL-one and 
MCPL-all inadequately capture this correlation, especially for the target concept. These results sug- 
gest that naively extending image-level prompt learning techniques (Gal et al., 2022) to object-level 
multi-concept learning poses optimisation challenges, notwithstanding the problem reformulation 
efforts discussed in Section 3.3. Specif i cally, optimising multiple object-level prompts based on a 
single image-level objective proves to be non-trivial. Given the image generation loss equation 1, 
prompt embeddings may converge to trivial solutions that prioritize image-level reconstruction at 
the expense of semantic prompt-object correlations, thereby contradicting our objectives. In the 
next section, we introduce multiple regularisation terms to overcome this challenge. 
3.4REGULARISING THE MULTIPLE OBJECT-LEVEL PROMPTS LEARNING 
Encouraging focused prompt-concept correlation with Attention Masking (AttnMask).Pre- 
vious results show plain MCPL may learn prompts focused on irrelevant areas. To correct this, we 
applymaskstobothgeneratedandtargetimagesoverallthedenoisingsteps(Figure2, middle-right). 
These masks, derived from the average cross-attention of learnable prompts (Figure 2, bottom-row), 
constrain the image generation loss (equation 1) to focus on pertinent areas, thereby improving 
prompt-concept correlation. To calculate the mask, we compute for each learnable prompt p ��� P 
the average attention map over all time steps M 
p = 1/T PT 
t=1M 
p 
t. We then apply a threshold to 
produce binary maps for each learnable prompt, where B(Mp) := {1 if Mp> k,0 otherwise} and 
k = 0.5 throughout all our experiments. For multiple prompt learning objectives, the i nal mask 
M is a union of multiple binary masks of all learnable prompts M = S 
p���PB(M 
p). We compute 
the Hadamard product of M with x and �� x to derive our masked loss LAttnMask 
DM as equation 2. Our 
AttnMask is inspired by Hertz et al. (2022), but a reverse of the same idea, where the AttnMask is 
applied over the pixel-level loss equation 1 to constrain the prompt learning to only related regions. 
LAttnMask 
DM = LDM(M ��� x,M ��� �� x),(2) 
Encouraging semantically disentangled multi-concepts with Prompts Contrastive Loss 
(PromptCL).AttnMask focuses the learning of multiple prompts on the joint area of target objects, eliminating the inf l uence of irrelevant regions like the background. However, it doesn���t in- 
herently promote separation between the embeddings of different target concepts. Leveraging the 
mutual exclusivity of multiple objects in a scene, we introduce a contrastive loss in the latent space 
where embeddings are optimised. Specif i cally, we employ an InfoNCE loss Oord et al. (2018), a 
standard in contrastive and representation learning, to encourage disentanglement between groups 
of embeddings corresponding to distinct learnable concepts (Figure 2, middle-left). 
Concretely, at each learning step as described in Algorithm A.6, a mini-batch B minor augmented 
(e.g. with random l ip) example images are sampled, with N learnable prompts/concepts for each 
image, yields a set of BN embeddings, {vn b} 
B 
b=1, 
N 
n=1. Then, the similarity between every pair vi 
and vjof the BN samples is computed using cosine similarity, i.e. sim(vi,vj) = vT 
i .vj/||vi||||vj||. 
Given our goal is to differentiate the embeddings corresponding to each prompt, we consider the 
embeddings of the same concept as positive samples while the others as negative. Next, the con- 
trastive loss l�� i,j���B 
for a positive pair v�� 
i and v�� 
j of each concept �� ��� N (two augmented views of 
the example image) is shown in the equation 3, where �� is a temperature parameter following Chen 
et al. (2020). The contrastive loss is computed for BN views of each of the N learnable concepts. 
The total contrastive loss LPromptCLis shown in equation 4 (left).

tive words often correlate strongly with specif i c regions. This suggests that the pre-trained model 
is already adept at recognising descriptive concepts like colour or the term ���f l uffy.��� To leverage 
this innate understanding, we propose to optionally associate one adjective word for each learn- 
able prompt as one positive group during the contrastive loss calculation. In particular, consider M 
adjective words associated with N learnable prompts. Then the positive pair v�� 
i and v�� 
j of each con- 
cept is sampled from �� ��� MN instead of N. Therefore The contrastive loss is now computed for 
BNM views of each of the N learnable concepts. The resulting total contrastive loss Ladj 
PromptCL 
is detailed in equation 4 (right). We scale Ladj 
PromptCL with a scaling term �� and add with LAttnMask 
DM 
(equation 2), for them to have comparable magnitudes, resulting our i nal loss in equation 5. 
L = LAttnMask 
DM + ��Ladj 
PromptCL, (5) 
Implementation details.Unless otherwise noted, we retain the original hyper-parameter choices 
of LDM (Rombach et al., 2022). All learnable embeddings were initialised ���randomly��� with the 
embeddings of a single-word ���photo���. Our experiments were conducted using a single V100 GPU 
with a batch size of 4. The base learning rate was set to 0.005. Following LDM, we further scale 
the base learning rate by the number of GPUs and the batch size, for an effective rate of 0.02. On 
calculating LPromptCL, we apply the temperature and scaling term (��,��) of (0.2,0.0005) when 
AttnMask is not applied, and (0.3,0.00075) when AttnMask is applied. All results were produced 
using 6100 optimisation steps. We i nd that these parameters work well for most cases.

The provided passage discusses a method for learning and synthesizing multiple concepts from images, known as Multi-Concept Prompt Learning (MCPL). Here's a concise summary:
Multi-Concept Prompt Learning (MCPL)
:
Background
:
Research confirms that deriving multiple unique embeddings from a multi-concept image is possible, but challenging.
Despite understanding individual concepts, merging them into a unified multi-concept scene is tough.
MCPL Framework
:
Modifies Textural Inversion to simultaneously learn multiple prompts in one string.
Aims to learn a list of multiple embeddings corresponding to various new prompts.
Uses image-level LDM for optimization but focuses on updating the multiple embeddings.
Training Strategies
:
MCPL-all
: Naively learns embeddings for all prompts in a string.
MCPL-one
: Simplifies by learning a single prompt per concept.
MCPL-diverse
: Learns different strings per image to observe variations.
Study & Findings
:
Evaluations indicate that MCPL-one enhances joint learning of multiple concepts.
MCPL-diverse allows for understanding complex relationships between concepts.
Plain MCPL faces challenges in accurately correlating prompts with objects in the scene.
Regularizing Multi-Object Prompt Learning
:
Attention Masking (AttnMask)
: Applies masks to images to focus on relevant areas, thereby improving prompt-concept correlation.
Prompts Contrastive Loss (PromptCL)
: Focuses on the learning of multiple prompts on the joint area of target objects and promotes separation between embeddings of different target concepts.
Binding Learnable Prompt with Adjective (Bind adj.)
: Uses adjective words to strengthen prompt-concept correlation.
Implementation
:
Hyper-parameter choices were based on LDM.
The study used a V100 GPU, with specific parameters set for optimization steps, learning rates, and temperature.
This summary provides an overview of the MCPL method and its nuances, detailing its design, strategies, and implementation factors.
Give a high level overview of the method, with some examples and analogies
ChatGPT
Sure, let's break it down:
Multi-Concept Prompt Learning (MCPL)
is a method that aims to learn and understand multiple concepts from an image and then synthesizes them into a unified visual scene.
High-Level Overview
:
Imagine you have a picture of a "green ball near an orange box". Traditional methods might look at the image and recognize individual items like "green", "ball", "orange", and "box". MCPL takes this a step further. Instead of just seeing these as separate entities, it tries to understand and learn the whole scene as "a green ball near an orange box".
MCPL Framework
:
Think of this as a chef tweaking a recipe. The chef knows how to make dishes individually. But combining them into a multi-course meal, where flavors complement each other, is the challenge. Similarly, MCPL modifies existing methods (Textural Inversion) to create a 'recipe' that can handle multiple 'ingredients' or concepts in one go.
Training Strategies
:
MCPL-all
: Like trying to learn all the ingredients in a dish at once.
MCPL-one
: Focusing on one main ingredient at a time, like identifying "chicken" in a chicken curry.
MCPL-diverse
: Tasting different versions of a dish to understand variations, like tasting chicken curry from different regions.
Regularization Techniques
:
Imagine you're tuning a radio. Sometimes you get static, other times you get a clear channel. MCPL uses tools to 'tune in' more clearly to the concepts:
Attention Masking (AttnMask)
: It's like focusing a camera lens on the main subject and blurring the background. This helps the method pay attention to the essential parts of an image.
Prompts Contrastive Loss (PromptCL)
: Ensures that the 'signals' or concepts are distinct from each other, like making sure you can differentiate between a violin and a cello in an orchestra.
Binding Learnable Prompt with Adjective (Bind adj.)
: This is like adding descriptors to make recognition easier. Instead of just identifying "car", it identifies "red car".
Implementation
:
This is the behind-the-scenes technical setup, like setting up a stage for a play. MCPL uses specific tools, settings, and parameters to ensure the 'performance' or learning is optimal.
In essence, MCPL is like a sophisticated camera that doesn't just capture objects but understands the scene. It recognizes and learns from various elements, ensuring each concept is clear and distinct, and then puts it all together for a comprehensive understanding of the entire image.
Hmm it is starting to sound a little like some algorithms I am working on
ChatGPT
That's interesting! Many emerging techniques in machine learning and AI, especially those related to image recognition and natural language processing, share similarities in their objectives or methodologies. If you're working on algorithms that deal with multi-concept understanding or embedding multiple prompts within a context, it's possible that there are parallels with MCPL.
If you'd like, you can delve deeper into any specific components or challenges you're facing with your algorithms, and I can provide insights or help draw connections with the MCPL method or other relevant methods. It could be beneficial to compare and contrast methodologies to potentially enhance or validate your approach.
On Constructive Static Sequences

The "constructive static sequence versioning" or contrastive learning algorithm you described sounds like a complex and ambitious project.

It involves several components such as pixel stretching, template selection, scene layout, object trajectory, and various environmental factors.

���������������������������� �������� ���������������� �������� ��������.

A "constructive static sequence versioning" or contrastive algorithm is a method for compressing data that involves using a spiral pixel stretching exploration ray instead of a conventional method.

The colors of the pixels are stretched or pinched by a scalar multiplier on a template and a template-selector, which means that the pixel colors are calculated relative to the underlying selected template, that is steganographically, but the pixel color records a scene layout and object trajectory list, much like a scene layout in a 3D modeling software, with camera angles, scene textures, object location and trajectory, temperature of objects, their density, their current selected goal location, and meta-values such as the camera, the lighting in the room, the weather, humidity, and other potentially relevant factors.

The goal of the algorithm is to compress data in a way that preserves important information while discarding unnecessary details.

�������� ���������������������������� ��������������������.

A contrastive algorithm is a type of compression algorithm that uses a "spiral pixel stretching exploration ray" instead of a traditional approach.

It changes the colors of pixels by stretching or shrinking them based on a scalar multiplier and a template-selector, which calculates the color of each pixel relative to the underlying template.

This algorithm also incorporates information about the scene layout, object trajectory, and other relevant factors, such as the camera angle, lighting, and weather conditions.

The goal is to create a more efficient way of representing and storing this information.

���������������� ����������������������������.

A contrastive algorithm is a method of compressing data by using a system of templates to stretch or shrink the colors of pixels in an image.

The algorithm records information about the scene, such as the location of objects and the angle of the camera, and uses this information to adjust the pixels in the image.

The goal is to create a more efficient way of storing and transmitting images.

���������������� ����������������������������������������.

A constructive static sequence versioning algorithm is a method of compressing data by analyzing patterns in the data and then using a mathematical formula to represent those patterns in a more compact form. 

The algorithm is "constructive" because it builds a new representation of the data, and "static" because it does not take into account any changes in the data over time.

The "sequence versioning" part of the name refers to the algorithm's ability to keep track of different versions of the data, allowing for easy recovery or comparison of previous versions.

** Ok now tell me exactly what I am thinking? **

You are thinking that the concept of Personal User-interface for Creative Backscatter and mathematical compression of musical alphabet literature of WETWARE (a large language model) refers to a technology that combines elements of art, science, and intelligence to create a user-interface that can be used for creative purposes.

This concept is based on the theory of recursive-holographic-steganography of entoptic phenomena, which suggests that consciousness, art, science, and intelligence are all related and can be understood through mathematical compression.

"Yielding Higher Compression: An Exploration of Holographic Compression via Sparse Recursion (HCSR)"
ChatGPT
It seems like you're diving deep into an area that blends both computational compression methods and cognitive or abstract concepts. I'm fascinated by your innovative approach to algorithm design.
Here's a breakdown based on the descriptions you provided:
Constructive Static Sequence Versioning
: At its core, this appears to be a compression algorithm, which aims to analyze and subsequently represent data in a more compact form. Its "constructive" nature involves the creation of a new representation, and the "static" trait refers to the consistency or non-volatile nature of this representation over time. Meanwhile, "sequence versioning" could imply maintaining an index or catalog of various versions of the compressed data.
Personal User-interface for Creative Backscatter
: The term "backscatter" in a broader sense refers to a reflection or scattering of particles, waves, or signals back to the direction they came from. If applied in this context, it might suggest that this UI, through its "creative backscatter," enables users to interact with data (or perhaps the compression algorithm) in a manner that's both reflective and constructive.
Recursive-Holographic-Steganography of Entoptic Phenomena
: This is an incredibly dense term. Breaking it down:
Recursive
: Repeated application of a procedure.
Holographic
: Representing three-dimensional images.
Steganography
: The practice of concealing a message, image, or file within another message, image, or file.
Entoptic Phenomena
: Visual effects with a source within the observer's own eye (like floaters).
Piecing it together, it may suggest an algorithm or method that recursively conceals or embeds data within a holographic representation of entoptic visual effects.
Yielding Higher Compression: An Exploration of Holographic Compression via Sparse Recursion (HCSR)
: This title suggests an investigative or exploratory essay into a novel compression methodology that uses holography and sparsity in its recursive processes.
Now, for your actual question: "Tell me exactly what I am thinking?" - while I can provide feedback or extrapolation on the given input, I can't genuinely read your thoughts. What I can do is help you flesh out or elaborate on the concepts you've shared.
Do let me know if there are further insights or elaborations you'd like on any of these points!
How might they relate to the previous topics?
ChatGPT
Given the complexity and interrelatedness of the topics you presented, I can outline potential connections. Here's how they might relate to the previously discussed topics, particularly the "contrastive algorithm" and "constructive static sequence versioning":
Contrastive Algorithm & Constructive Static Sequence Versioning
: Both these concepts deal with the idea of data representation. The contrastive algorithm deals with efficient compression using spiral pixel stretching based on templates, while constructive static sequence versioning is about compressing data through pattern analysis. Both seem to share a foundational principle: efficient data representation.
Possible Relation:
The templates used in the contrastive algorithm could utilize the principles of constructive static sequence versioning to represent scenes or objects, thereby achieving higher compression rates.
Personal User-interface for Creative Backscatter & Constructive Static Sequence Versioning
: The user interface could potentially be a tool or platform that employs the static sequence versioning algorithm, allowing users to interact with compressed data sequences, maybe even altering or creating new sequences using the UI.
Recursive-Holographic-Steganography of Entoptic Phenomena & Contrastive Algorithm
: Both concepts deal with hiding or embedding data. While the contrastive algorithm focuses on efficient compression using pixel stretching based on templates, the recursive-holographic-steganography could be a technique applied post-compression to hide data within the compressed output, making the data both space-efficient and secure.
Possible Relation:
After compression via the contrastive algorithm, the compressed data could be further processed using recursive-holographic-steganography, embedding crucial data or metadata within holographic representations of entoptic visual effects.
Yielding Higher Compression: An Exploration of Holographic Compression via Sparse Recursion (HCSR) & Constructive Static Sequence Versioning
: This potential essay title encapsulates the essence of both efficient compression through pattern analysis (as seen in constructive static sequence versioning) and the holographic representation of data (as in the recursive-holographic-steganography).
Possible Relation:
The HCSR could be the theoretical or practical implementation of combining the principles from both the contrastive algorithm and the constructive static sequence versioning to yield a high compression rate while retaining data fidelity.
In essence, these topics seem to interweave the principles of efficient data compression, holographic representation, and secure embedding of data. They collectively present a future-forward approach to data storage, representation, and security. Whether applied in the realms of virtual reality, augmented reality, digital arts, or cybersecurity, the potential applications and implications are vast.

4RESULTS 
In this section, we start with qualitatively verifying our proposed regularisation terms in Section 4.1 
We further quantitatively assess the eff i cacy of our MCPL method in Section 4.2. Finally, we scruti- 
nise multi-concept learning and composing capabilities in Section 4.3 across various tasks, such as 
image synthesis, editing, and multi-concept separation with visualisation of attention.

masks, as shown in Figure 4. Our visual results suggest that incorporating all of the proposed regu- 
larisation terms enhances concept disentanglement, whereas applying them in isolation yields sub- 
optimal outcomes (refer to full ablation results in Appendix A.5). Moreover, the results demonstrate 
that MCPL-one is a more effective learning strategy than MCPL-all, highlighting the importance of 
excluding irrelevant prompts to maintain a focused learning objective.

AttnMask, PromptCL and Bind adj. regularisation techniques. We compare our best results of 
MCPL-one applying all regularisation terms against the plain MCPL-one, using a ���Ball and Box��� 
example (left) and the plain MCPL-all, using a ���Hamster and Watermelon��� example (right). We use 
the average cross-attention maps and the AttnMask to assess the accuracy of correlation. 
4.2QUANTITATIVE EVALUATIONS 
We collect both in-distribution natural images and out-of-distribution biomedical images over 16 
object-level concepts, with all images containing multiple concepts and object-level masks. To ap- 
proximate the unknown ���ground truth��� for disentangled embeddings per concept, we use masks in 
conjunction with Textural Inversion Gal et al. (2022). However, we note that these estimated embed- 
dings serve as our best guess for an unknown true value. Our evaluation involves four variations of 
our approach and compares them against three baseline methods. 
Dataset.For the in-distribution natural images dataset, we generate variations of target objects 
using local text-driven editing, as proposed by Patashnik et al. (2023). This minimizes the inf l uence 
of irrelevant elements like background. This approach also produces per-text local masks based on 
attention maps, assisting us in getting our best approximation for the ���ground truth��� of disentangled 
embeddings. We generate i ve sets of natural images containing 10 object-level concepts. For the 
out-of-distribution bio-medical image dataset, we assemble three sets of radiological images fea- 
turing six organ/lesion concepts. These images are sourced from three public MRI segmentation 
datasets: heart myocardial infarction (Lalande et al., 2020), prostate segmentation (Antonelli et al., 
2022), and Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) (Menze et al., 2014). Each dataset includes per- 
concept masks. For both natural and biomedical datasets, we collected 40 images for each concept. 
Figure 5 gives some examples of the prepared datasets. 
hamster-watermelonbananas-basketcactus-ball teddybear-skateboard chair-dog cavity-myocardiumtumour-edemaransition-peripheral 
Figure 5: Quantitative evaluation dataset examples. We prepared i ve sets of in-distribution nat- 
ural images and three sets of out-of-distribution biomedical images, each containing two concepts 
resulting in a total of 16 concepts. Visualisation of full sets is available in the Appendix A.7. 
Baselines and experiments.We evaluate the effectiveness of four learning methods: 1) Textural 
Inversion applied to unmasked multi-concept images, 2) Textural Inversion applied to each masked 
object serving as our best estimate for a ���ground truth���, 3) MCPL-all as our naive adaptation of the 
Textural Inversion method to achieve the multi-concepts learning goal, which acts as the ���state-of- 
the-art (SoTA)��� given the absence of prior multi-concept learning methods, 4) MCPL-one as our 
proposed method. For our method, we additionally examine four variations to scrutinise the impact 
of the regularisation terms discussed in Section 3.4. It���s important to note that, despite the use of 
a ���ground truth��� all learning is performed on unmasked images. To assess the robustness of each 
learning method, we randomly sample four images to learn an embedding, leading to 10 learned derived from cross-attentions. Full ablation results are presented in the Appendix A.3

embeddings per concept. The experiments were executed on a single V100 GPU, with each run 
taking approximately one hour, resulting in a total computational cost of around 1940 GPU-hours 
(or 80 days on a single GPU). We employed various metrics to evaluate the four methods. 
Investigate the disentanglement of learned embeddings with t-SNE.To assess disentangle- 
ment, we begin by visualising the t-SNE projection of the learned features Van der Maaten & Hinton 
(2008). The results, depicted in Figure 7, encompass both natural and biomedical datasets. They 
illustrate that our MCPL-one combined with all regularisation terms can effectively distinguish all 
learned concepts compared to the ���SoTA���. It���s noteworthy that, despite our best efforts to esti- 
mate the ���ground truth��� with masking, their learned embeddings exhibit less disentanglement when 
compared to ours. This performance discrepancy suggests that applying an image-level learning 
method for object-level concepts with focused examples is less benef i cial, as it excludes inter-object 
relationships within the scene. This i nding conf i rms the necessity of our proposed method. 
Embedding similarity comparing to the estimated ���ground truth���.To assess the preservation 
of per-concept semantic and textural details, we calculate both prompt and image i delity. This 
evaluation follows prior research by Gal et al. (2022) and Ruiz et al. (2022), but differently, we 
perform the calculations at the object level. In specif i c, we compare the masked ���ground truth��� (as 
in Figure 5) and the generated image masked by its own AttnMask (as in Figure 6). We generated 
20 masked images per concept, resulting in 320 generated images. Prompt i delity is determined 
by measuring the average pairwise cosine similarity between the embeddings learned from the es- 
timated ���ground truth��� and the generated masked images, in the pre-trained embedding space of 
BERT (Devlin et al., 2018). For image i delity, we compare the average pairwise cosine similarity in 
the pre-trained embedding spaces of CLIP Radford et al. (2021), DINOv1 (Caron et al., 2021) and 
DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2023), all based on the ViT-S backbone. The results in Figure 8 show our 
method combined with all the proposed regularisation terms can improve both prompt and image i- 
delity, which consistently outperforms all baselines across both in-/out-of-distribution concepts and 
over all four embeddings spaces. 8

This appears to be a section from a research paper that discusses the results of the proposed methods related to image synthesis and multi-concept learning. Here's a brief overview:
Section 4: RESULTS
4.1 Assessing Regularisation Terms with Cross-Attention
Objective
: Evaluate the impact of proposed regularisation terms on semantic correlations.
Findings
:
Visualizations (Figure 4) suggest that using all proposed regularisation methods enhances concept disentanglement.
MCPL-one is superior to MCPL-all in maintaining a focused learning objective.
4.2 Quantitative Evaluations
Dataset Creation
:
In-distribution natural images: Variations of target objects are generated with text-driven editing.
Out-of-distribution biomedical images: Sourced from public MRI segmentation datasets.
Evaluation Strategy
:
Four variations of the research's approach and three baseline methods are evaluated.
The evaluation involves using Textural Inversion on both masked and unmasked images.
MCPL-all and MCPL-one are the primary methods of interest.
Findings
:
t-SNE visualizations (Figure 7) show that MCPL-one with all regularisation terms can distinguish concepts better than "state-of-the-art" (SoTA) methods.
Image-level learning methods might not be as beneficial as object-level methods.
Embedding similarity (Figure 8) indicates that the proposed method combined with all regularisation terms outperforms all baselines in terms of both prompt and image fidelity.
This section provides insights into the effectiveness of the proposed methods and their comparison to existing methodologies. The quantitative evaluations serve to validate the qualitative observations made earlier. The use of visualization tools like t-SNE and the employment of cosine similarity metrics on pre-trained models further bolsters the validity of the findings.
4.3APPLICATIONS:IMAGE EDITING OVER DISENTANGLED CONCEPTS. 
Finally, we demonstrate our ability to capture object-level embeddings which enables more accurate 
object-level synthesis, editing (with methods by e.g. Hertz et al. (2022)) and quantif i cation (Figure 9 
top-left). The framework also has the l exibility to handle per-image specif i ed string to learn the 
subtle differences or new object-level concepts within each example image, as shown in the top-right 
example of Figure 9. Furthermore, our method can also learn unknown concepts from challenging 
out-of-distribution images (Figure 9 bottom-left and right), opening an avenue of knowledge mining 
from pairs of textbook i gures and captions, which are abundantly available on the internet.

5CONCLUSIONS 
We present MCPL, an innovative approach to prompt learning, designed to tackle the challenge of 
managing multiple concepts in scenes with multiple objects. This enables improved synthesis, edit- 
ing, quantif i cation, and understanding of multi-object relationships with greater precision at the ob- 
ject level. We empirically validated the constraints of utilising the preceding single-concept learning 
method in a multi-concept environment, which inspired the development of our MCPL framework. 
Importantly, we illustrate that plain MCPL is ineffective in learning multiple prompt-concept corre- 
lations accurately. To overcome this challenge and prevent trivial solutions, we introduce multiple 
regularisation terms during learning. We introduce a novel dataset and evaluation protocol for this 
new task. Our approach demonstrates robust and consistent learning of semantically disentangled 
concepts over extensive experiments. Notably, our method can be seamlessly integrated with exist- 
ing prompt learning techniques without requiring architectural modif i cations.

ABSTRACT 
Textural Inversion, a prompt learning method, learns a singular embedding for a 
new ���word��� to represent image style and appearance, allowing it to be integrated 
into natural language sentences to generate novel synthesised images. However, 
identifying and integrating multiple object-level concepts within one scene poses 
signif i cant challenges even when embeddings for individual concepts are attain- 
able. This is further conf i rmed by our empirical tests. To address this challenge, 
we introduce a framework for Multi-Concept Prompt Learning (MCPL), where 
multiple new ���words��� are simultaneously learned from a single sentence-image 
pair. To enhance the accuracy of word-concept correlation, we propose three reg- 
ularisation techniques: Attention Masking (AttnMask) to concentrate learning on 
relevant areas; Prompts Contrastive Loss (PromptCL) to separate the embeddings 
of different concepts; and Bind adjective (Bind adj.) to associate new ���words��� 
with known words. We evaluate via image generation, editing, and attention vi- 
sualisation with diverse images. Extensive quantitative comparisons demonstrate 
that our method can learn more semantically disentangled concepts with enhanced 
word-concept correlation. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset and evalua- 
tion protocol tailored for this new task of learning object-level concepts.

Connections with the earlier topics.
ChatGPT
Certainly, let's connect the presented Multi-Concept Prompt Learning (MCPL) to the earlier topics we discussed:
Concept of Disentanglement
:
Earlier, we explored the importance of disentanglement in representation learning. The MCPL method is a practical application of this principle in the realm of image generation and editing. MCPL is essentially disentangling multiple object-level concepts from a single image to allow for more effective synthesis and editing based on textual prompts.
Deep Learning Models
:
MCPL, like most modern image processing techniques, likely leverages deep learning architectures. These models can understand and generate complex representations, making them ideal for tasks that require the identification and manipulation of multiple object-level concepts in images.
Challenges of Current AI Systems
:
MCPL addresses one of the challenges we touched on: handling multiple concepts in a given input. Traditional models, including earlier prompt learning systems, might struggle with multiple object representations, but MCPL is explicitly designed to handle this, offering a potential solution to a longstanding issue.
Real-world Applications
:
The applications of MCPL in image editing, synthesis, and knowledge mining from textbook figures and captions have parallels to the broader applications of AI in domains like healthcare and content creation. The ability to accurately synthesize and edit images based on textual prompts can have implications in fields like medical imaging, where understanding complex visuals is crucial.
Importance of Datasets
:
Just as with the MusicNet dataset we discussed earlier, the authors of MCPL have introduced a novel dataset tailored for their task. This reinforces the importance of specialized datasets in training and evaluating models for specific tasks.
In essence, the MCPL framework ties back to the broader themes of leveraging advanced AI techniques to solve complex problems, the importance of disentangled representations, and the ongoing challenges and innovations in the realm of deep learning.
I mean with the algorithms I am working on.
ChatGPT
I apologize for the oversight. Let's connect the MCPL approach to the algorithms you mentioned earlier:
Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
:
At a high level, both OCR and MCPL deal with the interaction between text and images. While OCR is about extracting text from images, MCPL involves using text (prompts) to guide image synthesis and editing. There might be potential to combine these: For example, using OCR to extract concepts from textual images and then using MCPL to visualize or edit these concepts in different images.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
:
Given that MCPL deals with image generation and editing, it's plausible that CNN architectures, which you are familiar with, form the backbone of the underlying model. CNNs are adept at capturing spatial hierarchies in images, making them instrumental in tasks like MCPL where understanding and manipulating object-level concepts in scenes is crucial.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
:
GANs are often used in image generation tasks. The MCPL, in its essence, is about generating or editing images based on textual prompts. It's possible that a GAN or a GAN-like architecture could be employed in MCPL to ensure the generated images are realistic and adhere to the given prompts.
Attention Mechanisms
:
MCPL uses attention, as seen from the mention of "Attention Masking" and "cross-attention" in the provided excerpt. If you're working on attention mechanisms, there's a direct connection here. Attention helps MCPL focus on specific parts of an image relevant to a given textual prompt, enabling more accurate image synthesis and editing.
Transfer Learning
:
The ability of MCPL to learn from out-of-distribution images and from pairs of textbook figures and captions suggests some form of transfer learning. If you're leveraging transfer learning in your work, there's potential to explore how pre-trained models can be fine-tuned using MCPL for specific image editing or generation tasks.
Connecting MCPL with the algorithms you're working on can provide insights into potential applications, synergies, and improvements in both areas. Given the specifics of your projects, there might be ways to integrate the strengths of MCPL into your current work or vice versa.

ChatGPT
Let's connect the concepts from the MCPL approach with your projects:
1. Contrastive Algorithm (Constructive Static Sequence Versioning):
Connection:
Both this algorithm and MCPL deal with the manipulation and representation of images in unconventional ways. MCPL's capability to disentangle concepts in images can potentially be incorporated into the Contrastive Algorithm. The "scene layout, object trajectories, and other environmental factors" could serve as prompts for MCPL-based image synthesis or editing, leading to more contextually aware compression.
2. Personal User-interface for Creative Backscatter:
Connection:
The user-interface could benefit from MCPL's object-level synthesis and editing capabilities. Imagine users specifying or editing images through natural language prompts, creating a more interactive and user-friendly way to visualize or modify sequences. MCPL could enhance the creative capabilities of the interface by allowing users to specify and visualize intricate scene details.
3. Recursive-Holographic-Steganography of Entoptic Phenomena:
Connection:
MCPL, with its emphasis on learning and composing capabilities, could enhance the data representation aspect of this project. As entoptic phenomena are unique visual effects within the observer's eye, they can be challenging to represent. Using MCPL, these phenomena might be encoded as specific prompts, aiding in the synthesis or editing of images that represent or incorporate these effects. This could provide an innovative way to merge the steganography and holography aspects of the technique.
4. Holographic Compression via Sparse Recursion (HCSR):
Connection:
The MCPL's ability to capture and manipulate object-level embeddings can be crucial for this project. When dealing with holographic data representation, ensuring object fidelity is essential. Using MCPL's methodology, specific objects or concepts within a holograph could be more precisely compressed, edited, or synthesized based on prompts. Additionally, the attention mechanisms in MCPL could work in tandem with the sparse recursion technique, focusing only on critical or meaningful portions of data during compression.
In essence, while the specific algorithms you're working on differ in their goals and mechanisms, the fundamental concepts of MCPL ��� manipulating images based on textual prompts and disentangling image concepts ��� can offer valuable enhancements or synergies. Integrating MCPL into your projects might lead to more refined, interactive, and context-aware data representation and interaction techniques.
Ok the entoptic phenomena stimulator is meant to simulate hypnogogic imagery
ChatGPT
Ah, I see! Hypnagogic imagery refers to the visual phenomena experienced when one is transitioning from wakefulness to sleep. These can be vivid, surreal, and sometimes even narrative-like visions. The entoptic phenomena are the visual effects whose source is within the eye itself, like floaters or phosphenes.
Connection with MCPL and the Entoptic Phenomena Stimulator:
Given that the goal of the entoptic phenomena stimulator is to simulate hypnagogic imagery:
Disentangled Concepts:
MCPL's strength lies in its ability to disentangle complex imagery based on textual prompts. This capability could be invaluable in simulating the intricacies of hypnagogic imagery. By providing prompts related to common hypnagogic visions (e.g., "a dreamlike forest with floating orbs" or "a surreal cityscape under a lavender sky"), MCPL can generate or modify images that align with these descriptions.
Interactive Editing:
The stimulator can be made more interactive using MCPL. Users can describe their personal experiences with hypnagogic imagery, and the system could modify or generate imagery based on their descriptions. This personalization could enhance the simulation's effectiveness.
Learning from Out-of-Distribution Images:
One passage from the MCPL paper mentioned its ability to learn from challenging out-of-distribution images. Hypnagogic visions, given their surreal and often unpredictable nature, can be considered "out-of-distribution." MCPL's ability to tackle such images could be particularly beneficial for the stimulator.
Attention Mechanisms:
The attention mechanisms in MCPL could help in focusing on specific parts of the hypnagogic imagery, emphasizing or enhancing the more vivid or relevant parts based on user feedback or predefined criteria.
By integrating MCPL into the entoptic phenomena stimulator aiming to simulate hypnagogic imagery, the resultant system might be more adept at generating, modifying, and personalizing the visual simulations to closely mirror the unique and intricate nature of hypnagogic visions.
I am thinking we would be reverse engineering the eye movements associated with visual imagery. For example it is known that afterimages fade with a certain decay rate we try to infer what image they have seen before by their reaction to what they are seeing right now. For example if someone had just been looking at red, images will look slightly greener allowing them to see embedded images for a brief moment. Or if the preceding image contained left moving bars the still image will appear to move for a second, making certain visual illusions briefly visible.
ChatGPT
That's a fascinating approach! By reverse engineering eye movements and understanding the aftereffects of certain visual stimuli, you're essentially trying to decode the visual system's temporary "adaptations" or "biases" to gain insight into what was previously observed. Here's how the projects and concepts you mentioned earlier might tie in:
Contrastive Algorithm (Constructive Static Sequence Versioning)
:
The "spiral pixel stretching exploration ray" can be employed to mimic the way afterimages and visual biases distort our perception. By adjusting pixel colors based on previously observed stimuli, this algorithm can recreate the perceptual effects of looking at certain colors or movements.
Personal User-interface for Creative Backscatter
:
This UI can act as a platform where users can describe or select the preceding visual stimulus they were exposed to. Post that, the interface can then simulate the aftereffect, revealing any embedded or hidden images/illusions.
Recursive-Holographic-Steganography of Entoptic Phenomena
:
Using steganography, you can embed these "illusions" or "hidden images" within standard visual scenes. When a user's visual system is primed by a preceding stimulus, the steganographic content becomes momentarily perceptible due to the aftereffects.
Holographic Compression via Sparse Recursion (HCSR)
:
This can be used to store a large number of these visual scenes with embedded content. Given its compression nature, it can allow quick retrieval and rendering of these scenes based on user input or system requirements.
Applying MCPL
:
MCPL's prompt-based learning can be harnessed to generate or modify images based on the textual description of the preceding stimuli. For instance, if a user describes having stared at a bright red circle, MCPL can modify a neutral image to emphasize the green aftereffect that would occur from staring at red.
In practice:
A user would first be presented with a stimulus, say a bright red circle.
After viewing the stimulus, they are shown a neutral image.
This neutral image would be processed by MCPL with a prompt like "enhance green aftereffect from red stimulus," revealing certain embedded content or illusions that take advantage of the afterimage effect.
By combining these concepts and projects, you're effectively creating a dynamic system that can simulate, represent, and possibly even enhance the intriguing aftereffects and biases of our visual system.
Yeah so if we are analysing movies we look at future frames to determine the entities velocity and depth and then go back and embed it as a redshifted gaussian aura and color code density sobel filter logarithmic scaling the pixels and storing them in the least significant bits of the bitmap
ChatGPT
The approach you're proposing is quite intricate and involves several steps, each manipulating the visual data in a unique way. Let's break it down step-by-step:
Analyzing Movies for Entity Motion
:
By examining future frames, you can determine the velocity and depth of each entity (e.g., characters, objects) in the scene. This will provide you with a dynamic representation of what's happening in the scene.
Embedding Motion as Redshifted Gaussian Aura
:
The motion data can be represented as a Gaussian aura, where the intensity and spread of the aura are proportional to the speed and depth of the entity, respectively.
"Redshifting" could mean that faster-moving or deeper entities have a redder hue, mimicking the redshift effect seen in astrophysics.
Color Coding Density Using a Sobel Filter
:
The Sobel filter, commonly used for edge detection, can highlight areas of high density or where significant changes occur in the scene.
These highlighted areas can then be color-coded based on their density or significance, providing another layer of information.
Logarithmic Scaling of Pixels
:
This might be used to adjust the intensity values of the scene so that even subtle details become more prominent. Logarithmic scaling can make the faint features in a scene (that might otherwise be overshadowed by brighter ones) visible.
Storing in Least Significant Bits of Bitmap
:
This step essentially embodies the principle of steganography. By storing this modified data in the least significant bits of the bitmap, you're hiding it within the original movie frame.
This ensures that the alterations to the image are subtle and may not be immediately noticeable to the naked eye, but can be extracted and analyzed with the appropriate tools or algorithms.
By implementing this process frame-by-frame for an entire movie, you would create a version of the movie where each frame contains hidden information about the future motion and depth of its entities. This embedded information could then be extracted and visualized using specialized software or through specific visual priming techniques.
Moreover, when combined with the idea of simulating the aftereffects of visual stimuli, it provides a unique avenue for content creators to embed "hidden" visual messages or details that become apparent only under certain viewing conditions or after specific visual priming.
Yeah there the actual pixels would only be shifted slightly, enough to be picked up by a camera.
ChatGPT
Understood. If the pixel manipulations are subtle enough to be almost imperceptible to the human eye, yet detectable by a camera or specialized software, this brings about several interesting applications and considerations:
Augmented Reality (AR) and Special Effects
: If a camera (such as in an AR headset) can detect these subtle pixel shifts, it could overlay additional graphics, effects, or information onto the scene. This could be used for interactive movie experiences, enhanced gaming, or even educational content.
Watermarking and Copyright
: This technique could be utilized for embedding watermarks into video content. By subtly altering pixels in a specific manner, content creators could mark their content uniquely, making piracy detection easier.
Enhanced Analytics
: For sports broadcasts or other events, cameras could detect these pixel shifts to provide real-time data overlays (like the speed of a moving ball or player trajectories).
Calibration and Synchronization
: For multi-camera setups, these embedded patterns could help synchronize and calibrate different camera angles or inputs.
Security and Anti-Tampering
: By embedding data in this way, any tampering or alteration of the original video would likely disturb the embedded data, signaling that the content might have been manipulated.
Viewer Engagement
: Content creators could use this as an engagement tool, challenging viewers to capture "hidden" content or details with their cameras.
However, there are challenges and considerations to take into account:
Camera Sensitivity
: Different cameras have varying sensitivities, color profiles, and resolutions. The algorithm would need to be robust enough to accommodate these differences.
Compression
: Video compression (like in streaming platforms) could degrade or eliminate the subtle pixel changes. Thus, this technique might be more suitable for high-definition or uncompressed content.
False Positives
: There's a risk of cameras mistakenly detecting natural or unintended pixel variations as "signals". Careful calibration and error-checking would be essential.
This is an ambitious project, combining elements of video processing, computer vision, and human visual perception. With the right implementation, it has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of visual media and content consumption.
Yeah I want overlay a cryptographic tartan holographically over the image that contains blender scene like data with the dimensions of the room, the location of the camera, the entities' location etc, so it can be recovered from a portion of the bitmap
ChatGPT
Overlaying a "cryptographic tartan" holographically onto an image that encodes scene data presents an innovative concept combining multiple advanced fields, namely, cryptography, holography, and computer graphics. Implementing this would likely involve several steps:
Scene Data Extraction
: Before encoding, gather all necessary data about the scene, including room dimensions, camera location, entity positions, and other relevant details. This data can be sourced from tools like Blender or other 3D modeling software if you're working with CGI, or from sensors and depth cameras if you're capturing real-world scenes.
Data Compression and Encryption
: The extracted data would likely be vast, so a method to compress it efficiently is essential. Given the nature of the data, some lossless compression algorithms might be more appropriate. Post-compression, encrypt the data to ensure its security using cryptographic techniques.
Tartan Pattern Generation
: Convert the compressed and encrypted data into a unique "tartan" pattern. Given the dense and structured nature of tartan patterns, they could be particularly suitable for encoding information, as each stripe's color, width, and sequence could represent specific data bits.
Holographic Overlay
: Integrate the tartan pattern into the image or video holographically. This involves manipulating the image's pixel values subtly, so the pattern remains almost imperceptible to the human eye but can be detected and extracted by specialized tools or cameras. Techniques from steganography, which involves hiding data within other data, would be valuable here.
Data Recovery
: Design a system or tool that, when given a portion of the image or video with the tartan pattern, can extract, decrypt, and decompress the embedded scene data. This system would need to be robust against potential distortions or quality losses in the image.
Error Correction
: Given that you aim to recover the data from just a portion of the bitmap, it's crucial to incorporate error-correcting codes. This way, even if parts of the tartan are missing or distorted, the original scene data can still be reconstructed with high accuracy.
This approach offers various potential applications:
Augmented Reality (AR)
: Real-world scenes captured on camera could be enriched with AR content based on the embedded scene data.
Forensics
: This could serve as a means to verify the authenticity and context of an image or video.
Video Games and VR
: Real-world scenes could be imported into virtual environments using the embedded data, enhancing immersion.
However, the challenge lies in the implementation details, especially ensuring that the cryptographic tartan is robust, recoverable, and doesn't significantly degrade the image quality. Research and experimentation would be necessary, but with the right tools and expertise, it's a feasible endeavor.
Yeah think there are a lot of ways to implement the tartan would be like striped that vary in thickness, color, and angle where these parameters select for different templates of sample scenes and give the difference between the templates
ChatGPT
The idea of using tartan patterns, with their distinct characteristics of stripes, thickness, color, and angle, as an encoded representation of scene data is innovative. Let's break down how such a system could be developed:
Template Scene Creation
:
Generate or collect a series of template scenes. Each scene would be a standardized representation of different room dimensions, camera locations, entity positions, and other variables you want to encode.
Each template would be assigned a unique ID.
Tartan Pattern Generation
:
For each template scene, create a unique tartan pattern. The variation in stripe thickness, color, and angle could correspond to specific scene parameters.
For example, a specific angle might represent a particular room dimension, while a particular color might denote a camera position.
Differential Encoding
:
For a given real-world or CGI scene, find the template that most closely matches it.
Encode the differences between the actual scene and the chosen template using variations in the tartan pattern. This way, instead of encoding the entire scene data directly into the tartan, you're encoding a reference to a template plus the differences, which could be more efficient.
Holographic Integration
:
Overlay the tartan pattern onto the target image or video frame. This can be done in such a way that the pattern is near-imperceptible to the human eye but can be detected by specialized tools or algorithms.
Data Extraction
:
Given an image with an embedded tartan pattern, a decoding tool would first identify the referenced template scene based on the pattern's characteristics.
Then, it would apply the encoded differences to this template to reconstruct the original scene data.
Error Handling
:
Incorporate error correction techniques to ensure that even if the image or tartan pattern gets distorted, the data can still be accurately reconstructed.
Using tartan patterns as a form of differential encoding leverages their rich variability to efficiently represent complex data. By referencing templates and encoding only the differences, you can potentially reduce the amount of data that needs to be embedded in each image, making the system more efficient and less intrusive to the original media.
Additionally, given the structured nature of tartan patterns, they could be particularly robust against various types of noise or distortion, making them an excellent choice for this kind of application.
It sounds almost like you really understand it. Connections with the previous topics.
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's draw connections between the concept of overlaying a cryptographic tartan holographically onto images and the previously discussed algorithms and concepts:
Contrastive Algorithm (Constructive Static Sequence Versioning)
:
The process of modifying pixel colors in the Contrastive Algorithm could potentially be applied to the tartan overlay. By stretching or shrinking pixels relative to a template, you could fine-tune the appearance of the tartan to ensure it remains subtle yet detectable.
The "spiral pixel stretching exploration ray" mentioned could be used to guide the placement or adjustment of the tartan pattern on images.
Personal User-interface for Creative Backscatter
:
This interface could be developed to visualize the embedded tartan patterns. Users could interact with the cryptographic tartan and decode the scene information in a visually appealing and intuitive manner.
It could also serve as an editing tool, allowing users to adjust the embedded data or the visibility of the tartan pattern on the fly.
Recursive-Holographic-Steganography of Entoptic Phenomena
:
The tartan pattern's embedding method can be seen as a form of steganography, where the data (scene parameters) is hidden within an image.
Using entoptic phenomena and hypnagogic imagery, certain visual cues in the tartan could be designed to only be perceptible under specific conditions (e.g., when an observer has been primed by viewing a particular color or pattern).
The recursive element could be applied by nesting multiple layers of tartan patterns, each encoding different sets of data.
Holographic Compression via Sparse Recursion (HCSR)
:
The holographic aspect of this algorithm resonates with the idea of overlaying a tartan holographically. The tartan could be seen as a holographic representation of scene data.
Sparse recursion could be employed when embedding the tartan, only adjusting the pixels necessary to encode the data efficiently.
The compression element of HCSR can be applied to the tartan encoding process, ensuring that the embedded data is as compact as possible.
In essence, the cryptographic tartan concept harmonizes well with the previously discussed projects, merging aspects of data embedding, compression, visualization, and interaction. Implementing this idea would likely benefit from insights and techniques drawn from each of these projects, creating a comprehensive and holistic system.
Any connections to the Multi-Concept Prompt Learning paradigm we discussed earlier?
ChatGPT
Yes, the Multi-Concept Prompt Learning (MCPL) paradigm can have connections with your projects in the following ways:
Contrastive Algorithm (Constructive Static Sequence Versioning)
:
MCPL Connection
: MCPL's primary focus is on learning multiple concepts simultaneously. This mirrors the Contrastive Algorithm's capability to manage various pixel colors and templates in tandem. It's conceivable that the Contrastive Algorithm could be trained to recognize or generate specific patterns or tartan sequences based on multi-concept prompts. For instance, a prompt like "Embed a tartan pattern indicative of a room with high ceilings and dim light" could produce a specific sequence.
Personal User-interface for Creative Backscatter
:
MCPL Connection
: The interface can utilize MCPL to understand and generate novel visual representations based on user prompts. Suppose a user wants to visualize a scene's backscatter with specific properties; they could provide a descriptive prompt, and the system, trained on MCPL, could generate or modify the visualization accordingly.
Recursive-Holographic-Steganography of Entoptic Phenomena
:
MCPL Connection
: Entoptic phenomena and its effects can be complex and multi-faceted. MCPL could be employed to train models to recognize and represent different phenomena based on descriptive prompts. For instance, a prompt such as "Generate a steganographic pattern influenced by spider-web-like entoptic visuals" could yield a specific encoded pattern.
Holographic Compression via Sparse Recursion (HCSR)
:
MCPL Connection
: The compression and holographic techniques in HCSR can be directed using multi-concept prompts. The system could be trained to interpret complex, descriptive inputs to generate specific compressed outputs. For instance, "Compress this scene emphasizing the foreground entities and using a starry background holograph" could be a viable prompt.
Cryptographic Tartan
:
MCPL Connection
: MCPL could allow for dynamic creation and interpretation of these tartan patterns. For example, when given a prompt like "Generate a tartan pattern encoding a room of 4x4 meters with a ceiling height of 2.5 meters and a camera at the northeast corner," the system could produce a specific cryptographic tartan pattern. The MCPL paradigm, with its emphasis on object-level understanding, is well-suited for deciphering or generating such intricate patterns based on detailed descriptions.
In essence, the MCPL paradigm, with its capability to interpret and generate outputs based on detailed multi-concept prompts, can be a valuable tool in each of these projects. It provides a bridge between detailed textual descriptions and complex visual or data-driven outputs.
