Multi-head AttentionOpen sidebarMulti-head AttentionModel: GPT-4Summarize: ehavior to reduce the error, but at birth it can only drive the limited behav
ior that is available. Since we have not learned anything yet beyond what
works in our mother's uterus, we haven't the slightest idea which behavior
will reduce any error we feel. Therefore, the error signal randomly drives all
the behaviors we have available in an attempt to find one or more that will
reduce any error We feel. When this Occurs, that error has activated our ear-
liest and later our most important behavior system, reorganization. For Sev-
before birth (assuming a healthy mother and child), we lived ar
eral months
organized, comfortable existence in our mother's womb. That we could move
around is obvious, and recent prenatal research reveals that before birth the
infant probably has the ability to cough, eliminate wastes, and maybe even
suck his thumb. Chances are that inside our mother we are probably as com-
ortable, as physically well cared for, and, in BCP terms, as organized as we
are ever going to be. At birth, thrust out into the cold, cruel world, we must
experience a huge error in one of our first comparing stations, comfort. It is
his discomfort error which initially activates our reorganization system, and
when this system is active it reorganizes behavior without stopping until the
error is reduced, which means our behavior is again organized, or we are ex-
hausted or dead.
To begin with, the first important characteristic of the reorganization sys-
tem is that it is not a smart system. It causes us to behave in random ways,
a
but it does not know and never will know what to do specifically to reduce
the error. As we grow and develop a redirection system, that sensible system
by rejecting foolish behaviors wil limit what we will accept from our reor-
ganization system, but the reorganization system itself never has any inkling
whether one behavior is better than another. It is a random system. If, how-
ever, our basic behavior system, the one we use when we don't know what to
do, were not a random system we would suffer a biologic disadvantage. If
there were any bias in the system, that is, if it were "smart" in any way, then
1
possible survival pathways would be closed to us. Whenever we get into a
very difficult survival situation we must keep all our options open, and only
a random system does this. For example, if we did not know how to swim We
vould be afraid of the water and might starve if we were cut off by a flood.
rhe bias would kill us. Under these severe circumstances our reorganization
system would force some of us into the water, where some of us would ran-
domly learn to swim (more reorganization) and some of us would survive
Without such a "dumb" random system we would never learn anything new
Reorganization is a property of ali living creatures; inability to reorganize in
ime is one of the reasons that so many species have become extinct
This leads us to the second characteristic of this system, which is that all i
<nows is to do, that is, as we will see, to keep offering behavior after behav
ior to our redirection system until our perceptual error is reduced. To do this
it will fragment and recombine the behaviors We have to produce new varia-
tions, or if this does not work it will also initiate totally new behaviors in an
attempt to reduce our perceptual error. If none of these behaviors works sin-
gly or in combination it will keep driving and come up with new possibilities
until one works well enough to reduce the error which will turn the system
off. It is therefore a random, illogical, nonlearning, but highly energetic sys-
tem that produces behavior after behavior, new or some combination of old
and new, until the error is sufficiently reduced so that reorganization is nc
longer needed or we stop controlling for what is causing the error. It is strict-
ly activated by an error signal; it senses nothing else.
At birth, when we experience an error, the reorganization system goes into
action. We can no more turn it off than we can stop the earth from turning,
ecause when we are born it is the only system that we have. Without it we
would learn much more slowly, we would never learn anything unique, and,
unless we were taught by others much of what we learn through this system,1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis text discusses the concept of the "reorganization system," a behavior mechanism that comes into play at birth and continues to function throughout our lives. The main function of the reorganization system is to reduce any error we perceive, such as discomfort, by driving a variety of behaviors until one or more successfully alleviate the error.This system is described as not being "smart," meaning it does not consciously know which behavior will be effective in reducing the error. Instead, it tries out behaviors randomly until a successful one is found. As we grow, we develop a redirection system that can reject non-beneficial behaviors from the reorganization system, but the reorganization system itself never gains an understanding of which behavior is better than another.The randomness of the reorganization system is actually beneficial because it ensures all possible survival options are open. For example, in a survival situation, this system could prompt someone who can't swim to try swimming, which might lead to them learning this skill.A second characteristic of the reorganization system is its unrelenting drive to reduce error, using existing behaviors and creating new ones in attempts to alleviate the issue. If none of the behaviors work, it will keep producing new ones until the error is sufficiently reduced or we stop reacting to the cause of the error. This system is strictly activated by an error signal, and it doesn't respond to anything else.This reorganization system, although random and non-learning, is vital to our development and learning processes. Without it, learning would be slower and less unique, relying heavily on teaching by others.1 / 1most of us would remain babies forever. Since it is a random creative sys
tem, as we reorganize we find that a wide variety of behavior satisfies our
needs. This is what causes people to be so different that even identical twins
isually turn out to be vastly different as they mature. Reorganization pro
rides the variation in behaviors that allows some of us to adapt and ever
prosper under highly adverse circumstances. Animals who have small brains
have less reorganizing capacity. They tend to be much more alike and, there-
fore, less adaptable to to changes changes in their environments.
Even the old brain, as we will discover in Chapter 11, is capable of this pro
cess. Since we have the largest and most advanced brain, we are, by far, the
creature most benefited, but also, since only human beings commit suicide,
the most capable of being harmed by this system. It is likely that it was this
system, through fortuitous reorganizations like learning to walk upright and
learning to speak, that made it possible for our brain to grow as much as it
to
has.
As soon as we are born and our error-free, organized prenatal life is ab-
'uptly shattered, we very quickly start to reorganize in the attempt to reduce
he sudden error we now experience. We begin by running through, at ran
dom, fragments and combinations of the limited behaviors that we have
available. We have no idea which one will work, but almost instantaneously
we put together the fragments that lead to crying, and they work. When we
cry, someone makes us comfortable, a situation that we perceive favorably
because our discomfort error disappears. As soon as this happens the reor-
ganization system turns off, and usually we go to sleep, a behavior learned
prenatally.
What happened was that a nurse, or someone else who controlled for com-
orting crying infants, responded to our crying and made us comfortable. A
this point we know nothing about mothers, nurses, or even people. All we
<now is that when we quickly found the combination of fragmentary innate
ocal behaviors that led to crying, we got the comfort that we wanted. Kick
ing, swallowing, grimacing, urinating, coughing, grasping didn't, but crying
did, Through reorganization we have learned something from essentially
nothing. We had no idea which behavior would work, but we had an open
comfort comparing station, and as the perceptions caused by each behavior
came in, crying got us the comfort we desired. We have now learned a com-
plaining vocal behavior that many of us will use for the rest of our life when-
ever we are uncomfortable
In the beginning, reorganization is the only system we have. From it, how-
ever, the other systems soon develop, and while at any time for the rest of
our life when we suffer large errors we may still use reorganization, as we
said, most of our behavior is generated by two other systems, redirection and
new information. Simply stated, reorganization means to attempt to go from
one organized low-error state to another but because learning not a part of
the reorganization system it is often misdirected. Because it uses Q lot of en-
ergy and its results are always chancy, very quickly after birth we develop
the ability to behave much more precisely through the use of our second ma-
jor system redirection. Reorganizing, however, develops the ability to redi-
rect, and the better the ability to redirect becomes, the less often we have to
reorganize.
Unlike reorganization, redirection is a smart learning system. For example
when crying got our error reduced, crying very quickly became a learned be-
avior or in this case also a logical strategy, because we had no reason to be
lieve that it would not work again. So the next time we experienced an error,
perhaps hunger, we cried and presto, we were fed. Later we soiled our dia-
per, it was uncomfortable, we cried again and got a fresh diaper. To the new-
born it seems as if a miraculous behavior has been discovered. 1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe text further elaborates on the reorganization system and introduces the redirection system, contrasting their roles in behavior development.The reorganization system, being random and creative, contributes to our unique individuality and adaptability. Even identical twins can become vastly different due to the varying behaviors produced by their individual reorganization systems. This system also helps humans adapt to adverse circumstances and change. However, this same randomness also makes us vulnerable to self-harm, as seen in the capacity for suicide.After birth, the sudden disruption of our previously comfortable environment prompts the activation of the reorganization system. The newborn, in an attempt to reduce the discomfort, engages in a variety of behaviors, eventually discovering that crying leads to comfort. This behavior becomes learned, turning off the reorganization system temporarily.As the reorganization system operates, it paves the way for the development of the redirection system. Unlike the reorganization system, redirection is a smart learning system. Using the example of crying, the redirection system recognizes crying as an effective behavior for reducing discomfort, and thus, this behavior is learned and used strategically whenever discomfort is experienced, such as hunger or discomfort from a soiled diaper.The redirection system develops rapidly after birth, and as it becomes more refined, the reliance on the reorganization system decreases. This system utilizes less energy and results in more predictable outcomes, making it a preferred mechanism for behavior generation under most circumstances. However, the reorganization system still plays a role when larger errors or discomforts are encountered.1 / 1Anytime we feel discomfort we cry and we are soon comfortable. Now, when we are un-
omfortable, we need no random reorganization. We know exactly what ta
do- change direction. When we wake up hungry we go from sleeping direct-
ly to crying and our problem is quickly solved. Thus our redirection system,
unlike our reorganization system, soon becomes a storehouse of learned be-
naviors and logical strategies that will reduce error. We may try one and
hen another, but we start much closer to the solution when we try behavior
that has either worked in the past or is very close to one that has worked
Only when redirection doesn't work will we return to the reorganization sys
tem which in its random and, compared to redirection, stumbling way is still
the only system capable of producing new behaviors to reduce our error.
Early in life, in an attempt to perceive love, we may right now want to be
neld, kissed, hugged, tossed about, stroked, and caressed, In a loving family
we have experienced a lot of this enjoyable attention, but we haven't yet fig-
ured out exactly how to turn it on. When We want loving we turn to our
"magic" redirection system, but all that it has stored within it so far is crying
When we cry we are made comfortable, perhaps fed, but not always loved
Loving is what we want now, and we sense that our magic system isn't work-
ing. But we don't quit easily, and we keep crying. A continuously crying baby,
lowever, is hardly lovable, so in many cases we are ignored, which increases

ror
boon our large, unresolved error activates our reorganization system, and
it again runs through the whole gamut of available behaviors, but none of
hese works. Undaunted, however, because this random senseless system
cannot be daunted, it offers the redirection system to try a whole group of
new behaviors, and, in the case of most babies, somewhere around three
months old it offers the new behavior of chortling and smiling. As soon as we
chortle and smile, immediately we get a lot of loving attention. Certainly it
took us a while and goodness knows how many behaviors, but agair
we
rave successfully reorganized. Error is reduced as we bask in the loving at
tention, and we lead an organized life for a while, enjoying being loved when
we chortle as well as being made comfortable when we cry. Now we quickly
add smiling and chortling to our redirection system, and when we want lov-
ing we redirect, using these behaviors. This is how the redirection system,
vhich is our sensible learning system, grows, More and more successful be
haviors, including some new ones initiated by reorganization and many
more learned from others around US as we look about and see what works,
are added until by adulthood we have thousands of successful behaviors
stored in this system and instantly ready to use.
Before it adds a behavior offered by our reorganization system or from any
other source, like observing or being taught, the redirection system is capa-
le of mentally running the new behavior through the open comparing sta
tion or stations to see if it might work. If, on the trial run, the behavior seems
as if it would increase the error, it is rejected. It also might decrease the error
in one station but increase it in another, as when we think how much fun it
would be to go swimming but also we learn how terribly cold the water is.
We might reject swimming, but then we further redirect by thinking of a
rubber wetsuit. When we put one on we are able to go swimming comforta-
bly in cold water. Our redirection system is learning all the time; in fact, al
nost all learning that takes any effort is redirection. What it can't do is come
up with a totally new behavior. It cannot for example invent a wetsuit if
one exists. For that kind of novel behavior, in all our life from infancy on
we must turn to our reorganization system. But it doesn't invent a wetsuit ei-
ther. It It has no logical or sensible ability, but it can keep giving us the idea
that maybe somehow we could keep warm in cold water. 1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe text continues to elaborate on the functions of the redirection and reorganization systems in our behavior development, giving the example of an infant's desire to be loved and comforted.When an infant experiences discomfort, the redirection system activates. This system is a repository of learned behaviors and strategies known to reduce discomfort. For example, when an infant is hungry, crying usually leads to feeding, solving the problem without needing to activate the reorganization system.However, not all needs are satisfied through previously learned behaviors. In a situation where an infant seeks love and affection, crying might not yield the desired result. Continuous crying might lead to being ignored, which increases the infant's discomfort.When the redirection system fails, the reorganization system gets activated. It generates a variety of behaviors, even new ones, in an attempt to reduce the discomfort. For example, around three months old, an infant might start to smile or chortle, which is often rewarded with affection and attention. This new behavior then gets added to the redirection system.The redirection system grows by adding successful behaviors, either initiated by the reorganization system or learned from observing others. It has the ability to mentally evaluate new behaviors before adding them to its repository. If the new behavior seems to increase discomfort or error, it is rejected. The redirection system is constantly learning and improving its strategies. However, it cannot come up with completely new behaviors; for such innovation, the reorganization system is needed.The reorganization system, despite its randomness, can spur new ideas to reduce discomfort, like the idea of a wetsuit to keep warm in cold water. This idea doesn't come out fully formed, but rather as a general notion that there might be a solution to the discomfort at hand.1 / 1As it bombards the redirection system with this concept, the redirection system may eventually try something like a shirt, and under the continual bombardment of the ran-
dom idea warm in the water is possible, it may come up with a wetsuit. The
reorganization system doesn't do anything. It just provides a sensible con-
cept that is seized upon and used successfully by the redirection system
Eventually, if we can last long enough, it will almost always work. But it can
it
also drive us to suicide as in the example that began the chapter
n contrast to inefficient reorganization which requires a lot of energy, oul
redirection system develops gradually into an efficient, ingenious system
which we almost always use. It knows all We know and will always try to
come up with a behavior or strategy to reduce error. Even when the reorgan-
ization system throws out the random thought that life is too painful, leading
he redirection system to consider suicide, this system, because it is intelli
gent, moral, judgmental, and able to take into account past, present, and fu-
ure, will usually reject suicide as not desirable or a bad error-reducing be
havior. Unlike the reorganization system, which has no memory and cares
nothing about the futurepresent error is its only motivator- the
redirection system has access to all of our memory, and constantly tries to
predict the future course of its behaviors. It will run suicide through the sys-
tem mentally, and as it does so it detects a huge potential error in a whole se-
ries of comparing stations that have to do with life, especially with our fu-
ure. Therefore, suicide is rejected and not stored in our redirection systen
s desirable behavior, Only when we are exhausted by chronic error may we
close down our life comparing stations and then accept suicide into our
redirection system as a "sensible" possibility. This is why we must never let
tired, despondent people be alone for too long. They may suffer so much
pain that they reorganize (and then redirect) by killing themselves
While at times it may be dangerous to reorganize, it is also important to un-
derstand that without the continuing bits and pieces of reorganization that
our redirection system continually accepts, our life would slow to a walk at
the point reorganization quit. We would have whatever redirection were
present, but we could not cope with any error beyond its capacity. This is of-
ten tragically illustrated after a stroke or other serious brain damage, when
both systems are damaged and the victim temporarily can learn nothing
new. But the reorganization system is a basic survival system, and in whatev-
er brain we have left it will again begin to function and may eventually cope
with some or all of the damage by coming up with new functions in the re-
maining brain to replace the damage. It is through reorganization that a
stroke victim may learn to speak again, but therapy is needed to keep the vic-
tim controlling for speaking. Otherwise the aphasic may give up, and without
error there will be no reorganization. But there is no guarantee reorganiza-
tion will work. It can also produce ideas that are worthless or crazy, and this
too is apparent in brain-damaged or senile people
Reorganization is like a slot machine being fed coin after coin by a person
desperate to win. It may hit a jackpot that the desperate redirection system
can use, but it also may never pay off. We may exhaust ourselves and put all
our mental money into the machine, with no results. But even worse it is a
slot machine without bias. Gambling machines are biased in our favor, that
is, they take the money we put in, but that's all- they never take any out of
our pocket, The reorganization system is like an unbiased slot machine, that
is, one with a negative as well as positive jackpot. It is capable of coming up
with a totally destructive idea like suicide or murder, much like a slot ma-
hine that can reach into your pocket or spit out a promissory note that you
must pay off.
1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis passage continues to delve into the roles of the reorganization and redirection systems in our behavior and decision-making process. It presents the reorganization system as a source of new, random ideas, and the redirection system as the mechanism for assessing and implementing these ideas.The reorganization system can suggest the concept of staying warm in water, but it doesn't have the ability to conceive a concrete solution like a wetsuit. It is the redirection system that can seize this concept and refine it into a feasible strategy.However, the reorganization system isn't always helpful. Given its lack of memory and foresight, it might also suggest harmful solutions like suicide when confronted with intense discomfort or "error." The redirection system, which has access to memory and the capacity for prediction, usually rejects such harmful suggestions, recognizing the vast future errors they would induce. Yet, under prolonged and intense discomfort, a person may let these harmful suggestions into their redirection system.Even so, the reorganization system is vital. Without its supply of novel ideas, our adaptive abilities would stagnate. The text gives an example of stroke victims, who may initially lose their capacity to learn new things due to damage to both systems. However, as the reorganization system revives, they can slowly start to relearn lost abilities, given enough motivation and error (discomfort).The reorganization system is likened to a slot machine, which may or may not provide helpful solutions. The redirection system is depicted as a desperate gambler, trying to make use of the random outcomes the reorganization system provides. The text also notes that unlike a regular slot machine that only takes your money, the reorganization system can generate harmful as well as helpful suggestions, much like a slot machine that can force you into debt.1 / 1To summarize, the reorganization system may become active anytime We
have a large error, but all it can do is suggest at random that We do some-
hing to reduce the error. Usually the sensible redirection system evaluates
these suggested behaviors and tends to reject the negatives and accept the positives. In this way a delicate symbiosis is maintained between sensible
edirection and random, erratic, but potentially creative reorganizatior
Only when our redirection system is desperate, when, for example, we suffer
a huge error, will it entertain destructive or bizarre suggestions and even try
them out because nothing better is available
Finally, we have another system, a new-information system that we use tc
deal with small errors. While this is best classfied as a very simple subsystem
under redirection, it is worth looking at for a moment, because in practice, if
we don't want too much or suffer misfortune, this is the system that we
mostly use. When our lives are well organized we still have many things to
do, and we do most of them by the simple application of new information
For example, we knock on a friend's door and wait. The friend calls out,
'Come in, the door is open," and we go in. We acted upon the new informa-
tion that the door was open and entered. This is ali new information is.
There Was in this case almost no redirection and certainly nO reorganization.
This is why on the control-system diagram we show the new information
perception as going right into the behavioral system, where it helps us to
know what to do.
Much of what we do all day long is to eliminate transient errors with new
nformation. Sometimes the new information is complex, like following a
maintenance manual to tune a car. Still, unless you lose a part, break some-
thing, or run into a situation not in the manual, you can use its new informa-
tion alone. If any of these complications occur you may have to redirect, but
it is unlikely that you will ever reorganize. Perhaps if you just can't get the
car tuned, you will, as Rudolph Diesel did, invent a new engine that doesn't
need tuning. But even that
Was probably an extreme form of redirection; it
WaS still an internal-combustion engine. Maybe if you invent C chlorophyll
engine or an atomic engine, that would be reorganization. But it 1S much
more likely if you couldn't get your car in tune you would drive it into the
ake. That would also be reorganization, although not what anyone excep
he salvage people would call successful. Remember our redirection systen
is constantly on the lookout for new information. It deals with reality, and it
struggles to learn as much as it can to keep abreast of all possible behaviors
Our formal education is a combination of new information and redirection,
out whether we are aware of it or not, we are always learning through the
its and flashes that our reorganization system constantly suggests to oul
redirection system when we are struggling with an error.
From these three sources of behavior come all that we do, think, and much
of what we feel. First we try to do or to think, as doing and thinking are ordi-
narily our two most effective error-reducing behaviors. But, as we said
when we don't know what to do or think we usually redirect, or on rare oc-
casions reorganize, by using the feeling behaviors described in Chapter 5.
What we promised then, and can explain now, is the purpose of feeling be-
navior. Let's say that you have your heart set on going to a concert tonight
out you fail to get tickets in advance. You stand in a long line, and just wher
you get to the counter the ticket seller closes, sold out. Suddenly you have a
huge error. You feel the quick pain as the error takes over your comparing

error.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis passage expands on the relationship between the reorganization and redirection systems in managing discomfort or "error," and introduces a third system called the new-information system.The reorganization system becomes active during significant discomfort or error, providing random suggestions to alleviate the problem. The redirection system then evaluates these suggestions, usually rejecting harmful ones and accepting beneficial ones, maintaining a balance between the sensible redirection and the potentially creative but erratic reorganization.However, when the redirection system is desperate due to a significant error, it might consider harmful or unusual suggestions from the reorganization system.The new-information system, considered a sub-system of redirection, deals with small errors by applying new information. An example is a friend telling you a door is open, allowing you to walk in. This system is used most frequently in well-organized lives for dealing with minor, transient errors, unless complications arise that require redirection or even reorganization.The new-information system feeds our redirection system with information to keep it updated and equipped for all possible behaviors. Our learning process involves a combination of new information and redirection, with bits of reorganization when we face an error.The text also explains how feeling behaviors tie into this system. These behaviors are engaged when redirection and reorganization are unable to reduce a significant error. For instance, when you're unable to secure tickets for a concert, the sudden error might cause the reorganization system to suggest irrational actions like violence or screaming. However, it might also suggest the feeling of despair, which in itself, can reduce the perceived error by adjusting expectations.1 / 1This was all from Stations of the Mind, by Glasser.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThank you for letting me know. "Stations of the Mind" is a book by William Glasser, an American psychiatrist and developer of the reality theory and choice theory. In his work, Glasser discusses various aspects of psychology, cognition, behavior and learning. The excerpt you've shared seems to focus on his thoughts about how we handle different forms of discomfort or error using different mental systems: redirection, reorganization, and new-information. These concepts align with Glasser's broader work, which often emphasizes personal choice and responsibility as key factors in mental health.1 / 1It looks like he is using ideas from perceptual control theory, and possibly Adlerian psychology.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTYes, you're correct. William Glasser's work does reflect some aspects of Perceptual Control Theory and Adlerian psychology.Perceptual Control Theory, developed by William T. Powers, suggests that behavior is the control of perception. In other words, individuals adjust their actions to keep their perception of a situation within their desired range. This theory fits with the concepts of 'redirection', 'reorganization', and 'new information' that Glasser mentions in the excerpt. These are all mechanisms by which an individual might try to control their perception of a situation.Adlerian psychology, developed by Alfred Adler, is a growth model that assumes humans are socially embedded and goal-oriented, and that they have the capacity for choice. It is an approach that is holistic, focusing on the goals of one's behavior and feelings and not merely on the behavior and feelings themselves. In the context of Glasser's excerpt, the Adlerian emphasis on goal-orientation and social embeddedness seems to resonate in the ways we use learned behaviors and strategies to reduce error and achieve our goals.Remember, though, that while there might be some commonalities, Glasser's work, Perceptual Control Theory, and Adlerian psychology are distinct frameworks, each with its own nuances and specific theories. Glasser's main contribution to the field of psychology was his development of Reality Therapy and Choice Theory, focusing on personal responsibility and the idea that all we do is behave, that almost all behavior is chosen, and that we are driven by our genes to satisfy five basic needs: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom and fun.1 / 1Glasser’s search for a theoretical base for Reality Therapy took a huge step forward in the eighties when Sam Buchholtz, a friend of Dr. Glasser’s, encouraged him to read William Powers’ book “Behavior: The Control Of Perception” (1973) and, as he himself said, he found the key to much of what he had been looking for.

Here were ideas that originated in engineering and were developed by a physics graduate to explain the links between perception and behaviour.

There was much in Powers’ Control Theory that resonated with Glasser’s thinking: Internal control; people’s reliance on perceptual phenomena rather than any absolute reality; the role of feedback loops in explaining human behaviour.

The thermostat-like functioning of the brain to behave in order to reduce “perceptual discrepancy” would explain how people behaved in order to meet their needs.

Glasser was very impressed, consulted with Powers and then put together his own understanding of Control Theory in “Stations of the Mind” (1981).

Although Powers acknowledged that Glasser’s book did present his own ideas accurately, Glasser adapted these ideas to his own specialism and eventually would produce “Choice Theory” almost two decades later.

“Stations of the Mind” is Glasser’s most technical work, but he now believes that the human brain does not work in such a complex way. Analysis of many different levels of perception, for example, was useful to the research-oriented Powers, but Glasser no longer uses these in his work.

By 1984 he was ready to produce his own version of Powers’ ideas adapted to explain Reality Therapy.

Although the book was called “Control Theory” it was already moving away from Powers’ original concepts and this book was to become a very important milestone in the development of Choice Theory.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThank you for the additional context. Indeed, William Glasser's journey towards developing his own theories was significantly influenced by William Powers' "Behavior: The Control of Perception". The concept of internal control and the significance of perceptual phenomena in driving human behavior were pivotal points that resonated with Glasser.Glasser's "Stations of the Mind" was an attempt to apply these concepts in his domain of expertise, resulting in an interpretation of Control Theory tailored to his understanding and needs. Over time, as you mentioned, Glasser moved away from the complexity of Powers' ideas, finding them less applicable to his practical work. This led to the development of his own distinct theoretical framework.In "Control Theory" (1984), Glasser started to modify and adapt Powers' ideas to better suit the tenets of Reality Therapy, eventually leading to the birth of Choice Theory. This evolution illustrates the iterative nature of knowledge creation, where theories are adapted and reshaped as they're applied in new contexts and from different perspectives.Glasser's Choice Theory, which emphasizes personal responsibility, internal control, and the fulfillment of basic needs, is a reflection of this journey. While it owes a significant intellectual debt to Powers' work, it has evolved to become a unique contribution to the field of psychology.1 / 1Connections to A Theory of Human Motivation1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT"A Theory of Human Motivation" is a seminal paper by psychologist Abraham Maslow that was published in 1943. It's best known for introducing Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, a model that suggests humans have a hierarchy of needs that range from physiological needs to self-actualization.William Glasser's Choice Theory and Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs share some commonalities:Basic Needs: Both theories posit that humans are motivated by the need to fulfill certain basic needs. In Maslow's hierarchy, these include physiological needs (like food and water), safety, love/belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. Glasser's Choice Theory also outlines five basic needs: survival, love and belonging, power or recognition, freedom, and fun.Self-Actualization: Both theories recognize the drive towards self-actualization or self-fulfillment. Maslow places this as the pinnacle of his hierarchy of needs. Glasser incorporates this concept within his "power or recognition" and "freedom" needs, which touch upon aspects of personal growth, achievement, and autonomy.Internal Motivation: Both Maslow and Glasser focus on internal sources of motivation, emphasizing that behavior is driven by the individual's attempt to satisfy their needs.However, there are also key differences:Hierarchy vs. Non-Hierarchy: Maslow proposes a hierarchy of needs where lower-level needs (like physiological and safety needs) must be satisfied before one can attend to higher-level needs (like esteem and self-actualization). Glasser, on the other hand, doesn't present his needs in a hierarchical format; all needs are considered equally important and may be pursued simultaneously.The Role of the Environment: Glasser's Choice Theory places more emphasis on the individual's current circumstances and the idea of personal choice in meeting one's needs. Maslow's theory doesn't focus as much on these aspects.Responsibility: Glasser's Choice Theory places strong emphasis on personal responsibility in meeting one's needs. Maslow's theory does not focus on this aspect as explicitly.In summary, while both theories provide insight into human motivation and behavior, they do so from slightly different perspectives and with different emphases.1 / 1I think Glasser's "needs" are like the heads in multi-head attention, they are comparing stations that compare present perception against a preferred ideal.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThat's an interesting perspective. Multi-head attention, often utilized in transformer models in machine learning, allows the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously and derive various features. In this analogy, each of Glasser's "needs" could be seen as a separate "head" in multi-head attention, each focused on different aspects of one's life experiences.The idea is that each of these needs (survival, love and belonging, power or recognition, freedom, and fun) operates in parallel, constantly assessing current circumstances against a desired state (the "preferred ideal"). When there's a mismatch between the current perception and the desired state in relation to a particular need, this could drive a person's actions or behaviors in an attempt to reduce that discrepancy – somewhat analogous to the adjustment of weights in an attention mechanism to focus on relevant features.This analogy could be extended to explain the iterative nature of the process, in the same way that attention mechanisms continuously adjust focus over multiple iterations to optimize performance.However, it's important to note that while this analogy may be useful in conceptualizing Glasser's ideas within the framework of multi-head attention, human psychological processes are highly complex and cannot be fully captured by machine learning models or concepts. The comparison can help understand the concepts better, but it should be taken with a pinch of salt.1 / 1Connections to: Open AccessArticle

Abstract
Multi-head attention, a powerful strategy for Transformer, is assumed to utilize information from diverse representation subspaces. However, measuring diversity between heads’ representations or exploiting the diversity has been rarely studied. In this paper, we quantitatively analyze inter-head diversity of multi-head attention by applying recently developed similarity measures between two deep representations: Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA) and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). By doing so, we empirically show that multi-head attention does diversify representation subspaces of each head as the number of heads increases. Based on our analysis, we hypothesize that there exists an optimal inter-head diversity with which a model can achieve better performance. To examine our hypothesis, we deeply inspect three techniques to control the inter-head diversity; (1) Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion regularizer among representation subspaces, (2) Orthogonality regularizer, and (3) Drophead as zero-outing each head randomly in every training step. In our experiments on various machine translation and language modeling tasks, we show that controlling inter-head diversity leads to the best performance among baselines.
Keywords: multi-head attention; inter-head similarity; Transformer; machine translation; language modeling; Natural Language Processing; NLP1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTIn the context of Glasser's theory of human needs and the concept of multi-head attention, the inter-head diversity discussed in this paper can be analogized as the diversity of needs and strategies employed by the individual in response to different stimuli or challenges.Each "head" in multi-head attention, as per the analogy, is like a different "need" in Glasser's theory. Inter-head diversity, then, is akin to the variety of strategies that the individual might employ to satisfy these different needs. This diversity can lead to a more nuanced and effective response to the myriad of situations a person might encounter.This paper discusses the importance of inter-head diversity in multi-head attention and explores ways to control it for better performance. In the same way, Glasser's theory might suggest that having a variety of strategies for meeting different needs could result in more successful behavior and greater overall satisfaction.However, it's crucial to note that while this analogy can provide a simplified understanding of Glasser's theory in relation to a machine learning concept, it's not an exact representation. Human behaviors and needs are far more complex and nuanced than any model can encapsulate.To directly apply concepts from the paper: Techniques like employing regularizers and drophead in controlling inter-head diversity can loosely translate to controlling the dominance of certain needs and strategies over others in a human context. It could mean encouraging a balanced approach to addressing needs rather than overly focusing on or neglecting certain ones.1 / 1Rethinking Thinking: How Do Attention Mechanisms Actually Work?

1. Introduction: attention in the human brain
Attention is a cognitive and behavioral function that gives us the ability to concentrate on a tiny portion of the incoming information selectively, which is advantageous to the task we are attending. It gives the brain the ability to confine the volume of its inputs by ignoring irrelevant perceptible information and selecting high-value information. When we observe a scene with a specific important part related to the task we are doing, we extract that part to process more meticulously; we can learn to focus on those parts more optimally when those scenes appear again.

According to J. K Tsotsos et al. [1], the attention mechanism can be categorized into two classes.

bottom-up unconscious attention
top-down conscious attention
The first category is bottom-up unconscious attention — saliency-based attention — which is stimulated by external factors. To exemplify, louder voices can be heard more easily compared with quieter ones. We can produce similar results in deep learning models using the max-pooling and gating mechanism, which passes larger values (i.e. more salient values) to the next layer (S. Hochreiter et al. [2]). The next type is top-down conscious attention — focused attention — that has a predetermined goal and follows specific tasks. Therefore, using focused attention, we can concentrate on a specific object or phenomenon consciously and actively.

Attention is the allocation of a cognitive resource scheme with limited processing power as described by [3]. It is manifested by the attentional bottleneck, which limits the amount of information passed to the next steps. Hence, it can drastically enhance the performance by focusing on more important parts of the information. As a result, efforts have been made to reproduce the human brain's attention mechanisms and incorporate spatial and temporal attention in various tasks. For instance, researchers brought this concept to machine vision by introducing a computational visual saliency model to capture potential salient regions of the images[4]. By adaptively selecting a sequence of regions, V. Mnih et al. proposed a novel recurrent model to extract the most relevant regions of an image and only process the selected ones. Fig. 2 illustrates an example of how visual attention operates. Bahdanau et al [5]. used attention mechanisms to allow a model to automatically search for parts needed for translating to the target word[5].

Attention mechanisms have become a crucial part of modern neural network architectures used in various tasks, such as machine translation [Vaswani et al. 2017–16], text classification, image caption generation, action recognition, speech recognition, recommendation, and graph. Also, it has several use-cases in real-world applications and achieved splendid success in autonomous driving, medical, human-computer interaction, emotion detection, financial, meteorology, behavior and action analysis, and industries.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThis article by Soran Ghaderi introduces attention mechanisms, which are cognitive and behavioral functions that allow for selective concentration on a small portion of incoming information. These mechanisms play a key role in human perception and decision-making and have been replicated in machine learning models to great success.In the context of the human brain, attention mechanisms allow us to ignore irrelevant perceptible information and select high-value information. This selectivity can be seen as similar to the decision-making process proposed in Glasser's model, where the brain evaluates various strategies and chooses the most promising ones to pursue.Ghaderi categorizes attention mechanisms into two classes:Bottom-up unconscious attention: Also known as saliency-based attention, this type of attention is stimulated by external factors. For example, louder noises are perceived more easily than quieter ones. This can be analogous to Glasser's idea of the reorganization system, which might suggest actions at random, some of which may be more noticeable or pressing due to their potential consequences.Top-down conscious attention: This type of attention, also known as focused attention, is goal-directed and task-specific. It allows us to consciously concentrate on a specific object or phenomenon. This can be seen as akin to Glasser's redirection system, which evaluates different actions and chooses the ones that seem most likely to reduce error and achieve the desired result.In deep learning, attention mechanisms are key to the function of modern neural network architectures and are used in various tasks. The development of attention mechanisms in artificial intelligence has led to breakthroughs in a number of fields, including machine translation, text classification, image caption generation, speech recognition, and more. This mirrors the versatility and broad applicability of Glasser's model in understanding and predicting human behavior in a wide range of contexts.However, the direct connection of attention mechanisms to Glasser's needs and comparing stations isn't straightforward. The concepts may share some similarities but are fundamentally different in nature and function. Glasser's model is a psychological theory about human behavior, while attention mechanisms are computational models in artificial intelligence. Both can give insights into decision-making processes but operate in different contexts and with different complexities.1 / 1Attention mechanisms have several forms of input representations, among which a number are more common, such as distinctive attention presented by Chaudhari et al. 2019 [11] which:

Includes a single input and corresponding output sequence
The keys and queries belong to two independent sequences
and co-attention, as well as hierarchical attention models, that accept multi-inputs such as in the visual question answering task presented by Lu et al. 2016 [14]. There are two ways for co-attention to be performed: a) Parallel: simultaneously produces visual and question attention; b) Alternative: sequentially alternates between the two attentions.

Fan et al. 2018 [15] proposed fine-grained and coarse-grained attention models. They used the embeddings of the other input as the query for each input to compute the attention weights. On the other hand, the fine-grained model calculates the effect of each element of the input on the elements of the other input.

There are several successful use cases in which they have deployed co-attention such as sentiment classification, text matching, named entity recognition, entity disambiguation, emotion cause analysis, and sentiment classification.

Self (inner) attention is another model which only uses inputs for calculating attention weights proposed by Wang et al. [16]. Key, Query, and value are representations of the same input sequence in different spaces; self-attention efficiency has been reproduced by several researchers in different manners, among which, Transformer [7] is widely acclaimed, the first sequence transduction model which only used self-attention without RNNs.

To extend the attention to other levels of inputs’ embeddings, Yang et al. [17] proposed a hierarchical attention model (HAM) for document classification. It uses two different levels of attention: word-level which allows HAM to aggregate relevant words into a sentence and sentence-level which enables it to aggregate key sentences into documents. Researchers even extended it to higher (user) levels; employed it at the document level. On the other extreme, a top-down approach was presented by Zhao and Zhang [18]. Some works have also brought hierarchical attention to computer vision, in which they used it for object-level and part-level attention. This was also the first image classification method that did not use extra information to calculate attention weights.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe attention mechanisms mentioned in the article by Soran Ghaderi can be seen as analogous to different aspects of Glasser's Control Theory and his idea of "needs" as "comparing stations". In both frameworks, the idea is that there are different factors that influence how a system (the human mind in Glasser's model, and the artificial neural network in the context of deep learning) processes and responds to input.Here are some key points of attention mechanisms that were discussed in the article and how they might be related to Glasser's Control Theory:Distinctive Attention: This type of attention mechanism involves a single input and corresponding output sequence. It can be compared to how an individual might focus on a single need or goal in their decision-making process.Co-Attention: This model accepts multi-inputs and performs either parallel or alternative attention to different aspects. This could be seen as similar to how an individual might have multiple needs or goals that they are trying to satisfy simultaneously or sequentially.Fine-Grained and Coarse-Grained Attention Models: These models calculate the effect of each element of the input on the elements of the other input. This could be compared to how individuals evaluate different strategies for achieving their needs or goals based on how they relate to their current circumstances.Self (Inner) Attention: This model only uses inputs for calculating attention weights. It could be analogous to introspection or self-evaluation in the decision-making process.Hierarchical Attention Model (HAM): This model uses two different levels of attention: word-level and sentence-level. This could be seen as similar to how an individual might consider both minor and major aspects of their needs or goals when making decisions.While these connections provide a useful conceptual bridge between Glasser's psychological theories and the domain of deep learning, it's important to keep in mind that these are two distinct fields with different underlying assumptions and methods. Attention mechanisms in deep learning are mathematical and computational models, while Glasser's Control Theory is a psychological theory about human behavior. However, the similarities in their mechanisms suggest that they might be able to inform and enrich each other in interesting ways.1 / 1A summary of this conversation so far.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly, here is a summary of our conversation up to this point:Discussion of William Glasser's Work: We discussed the work of Dr. William Glasser, a prominent American psychiatrist known for his development of Reality Therapy and Choice Theory. He wrote a book called "Stations of the Mind" where he presents Control Theory as a model of human behavior, which resonated with concepts from Perceptual Control Theory and Adlerian Psychology.Perceptual Control Theory & Reality Therapy: Glasser's work was influenced by Perceptual Control Theory, particularly the concept of the brain acting like a thermostat, controlling behavior based on a comparison between current perception and a preferred ideal. This concept was adapted to Glasser's Reality Therapy. Over time, Glasser moved away from this complex model, simplifying his approach and eventually producing Choice Theory.Glasser's Needs as Comparing Stations: Glasser conceptualizes needs as "comparing stations", which evaluate the current reality against desired outcomes, guiding behavior in an attempt to reduce discrepancy. This idea was compared to the operation of multi-head attention in deep learning models, where each head can be seen as comparing different features of the input data to make decisions or predictions.Connections to Attention Mechanisms in Deep Learning: We discussed how attention mechanisms in deep learning might be analogous to different aspects of Glasser's Control Theory. Various types of attention mechanisms (distinctive attention, co-attention, fine-grained and coarse-grained attention models, self (inner) attention, and hierarchical attention model) were discussed and compared with elements of Glasser's theory. These comparisons served to highlight potential conceptual bridges between psychological theories and deep learning models, even while acknowledging the distinctiveness of each field.Summary Request: Finally, you asked for a summary of our conversation, which brought us here.This conversation has largely focused on the potential parallels and intersections between the psychological theories proposed by Dr. William Glasser and the concepts underpinning deep learning models, specifically attention mechanisms. This kind of interdisciplinary exploration can potentially offer new insights and perspectives in both fields.1 / 1Other similar theories.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThere are many psychological theories and models that can be linked in various ways to the principles used in machine learning and artificial intelligence, including attention mechanisms. Here are some of them:Behaviorism (B.F. Skinner): This psychological approach, which focuses on observable behaviors and disregards internal mental states, is similar to the principles of reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning, an area of machine learning, is about learning what to do to maximize a numerical reward signal.Cognitive Psychology: This field is about how people perceive, think, remember, and learn. It's similar to the concept of cognitive architectures in AI, which try to model the various cognitive processes in humans.Schema Theory (Frederic Bartlett): This theory is about how knowledge is organized into units, or schemas, that represent generic concepts stored in memory. This is similar to the principle of knowledge representation in AI.Connectionism (Parallel Distributed Processing Models): This approach in cognitive science suggests that cognitive phenomena can be described by interconnected networks of simple and often uniform units. The operations of these models are parallel and distributed over the units in the network. This is similar to the architecture of neural networks in machine learning.Cybernetics (Norbert Wiener): Cybernetics is a transdisciplinary approach exploring regulatory and governing systems—the principles of feedback, control, and communication. This is quite similar to the idea of control theory and feedback systems in engineering and machine learning.Constructivism (Jean Piaget): This theory argues that humans generate knowledge and meaning from their experiences. This can be connected to unsupervised learning in machine learning, where the system attempts to learn patterns from the input data without explicit output labels.These are just a few examples of how psychological theories might connect with AI principles. The integration and mutual influence of psychology and AI have a long history, and many concepts in AI were inspired by psychological theories and vice versa.1 / 1

Abstract
The applicability of computational models to the biological world is an active topic of debate. We argue that a useful path forward results from abandoning hard boundaries between categories and adopting an observer-dependent, pragmatic view. Such a view dissolves the contingent dichotomies driven by human cognitive biases (e.g., a tendency to oversimplify) and prior technological limitations in favor of a more continuous view, necessitated by the study of evolution, developmental biology, and intelligent machines. Form and function are tightly entwined in nature, and in some cases, in robotics as well. Thus, efforts to re-shape living systems for biomedical or bioengineering purposes require prediction and control of their function at multiple scales. This is challenging for many reasons, one of which is that living systems perform multiple functions in the same place at the same time. We refer to this as “polycomputing”—the ability of the same substrate to simultaneously compute different things, and make those computational results available to different observers. This ability is an important way in which living things are a kind of computer, but not the familiar, linear, deterministic kind; rather, living things are computers in the broad sense of their computational materials, as reported in the rapidly growing physical computing literature. We argue that an observer-centered framework for the computations performed by evolved and designed systems will improve the understanding of mesoscale events, as it has already done at quantum and relativistic scales. To develop our understanding of how life performs polycomputing, and how it can be convinced to alter one or more of those functions, we can first create technologies that polycompute and learn how to alter their functions. Here, we review examples of biological and technological polycomputing, and develop the idea that the overloading of different functions on the same hardware is an important design principle that helps to understand and build both evolved and designed systems. Learning to hack existing polycomputing substrates, as well as to evolve and design new ones, will have massive impacts on regenerative medicine, robotics, and computer engineering.

1. Introduction
In Feynman’s famous lecture titled “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom” [1], he argued that vast technological progress could be achieved by learning to manipulate matter and energy at ever-smaller scales. Such potential could presumably be exploited by natural selection as well. How does biology expand the adaptive function of an existing system? It cannot go down, since there is already something there, exhibiting functional competencies at every level [2]. Instead, it squeezes more action from each level by overloading mechanisms with multiple functions—which we term as polycomputing. We argue that the most effective lens for a wide range of natural and engineered systems must enable a multiple-observers view where the same set of events can be interpreted as different computations (Figure 1 illustrates how artists have recognized this feature). Indeed, depending on their definition of computation, some human observers may conclude that the observed system is not computing at all.
Biomimetics 08 00110 g001 550Figure 1. Polycomputing concepts in art. (A) Sculpture by Shigeo Fukuda, “Lunch with a helmet on”, 1987—appears as a random pile of knives and forks but when observed in just the right way, light moving through the sculpture reveals another pattern (a motorcycle) present at the same time in the same structure. (B) A well-known bistable (ambiguous) image, “My Wife and my Mother-in-Law” by British cartoonist William Ely Hill in 1915, reveals how our nervous system is not suited to taking in multiple meanings—it prefers to squash down to a single interpretation, even if it then has to vacillate back and forth.
Herein, we review remarkable examples of biological polycomputing, such as spider webs that serve as auditory sensors and prey capture devices [3], and holographic memory storage in the brain [4,5]. We will also review emerging examples in computer and materials engineering [6]. We provisionally define polycomputing as the ability of a material to provide the results of more than one computation in the same place at the same time. To distinguish this from complex materials that necessarily produce complex results in the same place at the same time, such as the multiple peaks in the frequency spectrum of a vibrating material, polycomputing must be embodied in a material that has been evolved, or can be designed to produce particular results—such as the results of particular mathematical transformations like digital logic—and must be readable by other parts of the material or other devices. That is, the computation, to be considered a computation, must be useful to one or more observers (which, in biology, can exist on multiple scales, with multiple subsystems from the molecular to the whole organism, or swarm levels being able to reap the diverse evolutionary benefits of a single process if they interpret it as processing information that provides an adaptive advantage). These ideas, which describe new ways of understanding and exploiting polycomputing in biology, may suggest ways to improve synthetic polycomputing systems, which, in turn, will shed light on the nature of computation, evolution, and control. Biological systems that polycompute also contribute to an ongoing conceptual debate within interdisciplinary science—the applicability of computer frameworks and metaphors to living systems [7]—in three ways. First: if polycomputing changes our understanding of what computation is, that might change whether we consider a living system to be a computer (Section 1.1). Second: a living system (or inorganic material) may be considered to be polycomputing, depending on one’s point of view, suggesting that observer dependence is unavoidable when considering whether or what a living or engineered system computes (Section 1.2). Third: increasingly intricate admixtures of technological and biological components that compute are forcing a redefinition of life itself (Section 1.3).
1.1. What Constitutes a Computer?
The notion of a “computer” needs to be expanded: it no longer only refers to the sequential, deterministic, silicon-embodied, human-programmed, von Neumann/Turing architectures with which biologists are familiar. Those are indeed dissimilar to living systems. There is now a widening array of computational substrates and robots that are often massively parallel (such as GPUs and computational metamaterials [8]), stochastic (hard to predict) [9], able to exploit non-obvious (and potentially not-yet-understood) properties of the exotic substrates they are built from [10], emergent, produced by evolutionary techniques [11], and built by other machines [12] or programmed by other algorithms [13,14,15]. The benefit of considering biological systems as members of this broader class is that it avails powerful conceptual frameworks from computer science to be deployed in biology in a deep way, and therefore to understand life far beyond its current limited use in computational biology. Moreover, exploring this powerful invariant between natural and synthetic systems can enrich intervention techniques within biology and improve the capabilities of engineered devices, revealing gaps in our understanding and the capabilities of both computer science and biology. Polycomputing is a powerful but, as of yet, under-appreciated example of the many ways in which the wider class of computer devices can help to revolutionize the life sciences. In the same way that organic and inorganic materials acting as computers increasingly challenges the claim that living materials are not computers, we have argued elsewhere [16] that the widening array of materials that can now be viewed or engineered with as machines is corroding the classic claim that living systems are not machines, and forcing an improved definition of “machine” that escapes the narrow definitions of past decades, which are no longer appropriate [17,18,19].
1.2. Observer Dependency
In the statement “living things are (or are not) computers”, “are” implies the existence of an objective, privileged view of both computers and biology that allows an unambiguous, universal decision as to whether they are related. This binary view is untenable and gives rise to numerous pseudo-problems. We argue instead for an observer-dependent view, in which computational formalisms are just metaphors; of course, all scientific concepts are just metaphors, with varying degrees of utility (which is not binary). Once we come to grips with the fact that “all models are wrong but some are useful” [20], it is possible to adopt a pragmatic approach [21] in which anything is a computer in a given context, to the degree to which it enables an observer to predict and control that thing better than any competing metaphors allow us to do. In this view, whether something is computing is not a philosophical question, but one to be settled experimentally by specifying a computational framework and showing empirically what new levels of capability, experiments, and research are enabled by adopting that framework. The only thing left is to enable system subcomponents, not just human scientists, to act as observers [22,23,24,25]. From that perspective, the quality of a computational metaphor in science is evidenced by its degree of productivity in new experimental capabilities, while the quality of a computational stance adopted by a biological subsystem is cashed out by the adaptive advantage that is evinced by it. Of course, it is expected that future progress will uncover even better frameworks, so the answer is never final, but always provisional and relative to a specific perspective. This view is akin both to the intentional stance in the philosophy of the mind [26], and in the driving of the development of frameworks and tools from cognitive science that can be broadly deployed across biology and the biomedical sciences [2,27,28].1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe article "There’s Plenty of Room Right Here: Biological Systems as Evolved, Overloaded, Multi-Scale Machines" by Joshua Bongard and Michael Levin discusses the idea of biological systems as polycomputing entities, where polycomputing is defined as the ability of a material to provide the results of more than one computation in the same place at the same time.The authors argue that the traditional notion of a "computer" needs to be expanded beyond deterministic, silicon-embodied, human-programmed systems. There is a growing variety of computational substrates and robots that are parallel, stochastic, emergent, and often produced by evolutionary techniques or other machines. Biological systems could be considered members of this broader class of computers, which could lead to improved understanding and intervention techniques in biology.Furthermore, the authors contend that whether something is considered to be computing is dependent on the observer. Computational formalisms are seen as metaphors, useful to the degree that they enable an observer to predict and control an entity better than any competing metaphors. Whether something is computing, according to this view, is not a philosophical question but an empirical one, settled by specifying a computational framework and showing empirically what new capabilities and research are enabled by adopting that framework.The paper reviews examples of biological and technological polycomputing, arguing that the overloading of different functions on the same hardware is a key design principle. The authors suggest that learning to manipulate existing polycomputing substrates, as well as to evolve and design new ones, could have significant impacts on fields such as regenerative medicine, robotics, and computer engineering.1 / 1Connections with our previous discussion.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTThe concept of polycomputing in biological systems discussed by Joshua Bongard and Michael Levin has similarities with the earlier discussion about attention mechanisms in machine learning models. Here are a few connections:Multi-functionality: Both discussions emphasize the importance of systems (biological or computational) that can perform multiple functions simultaneously. In the attention mechanism discussion, we talked about co-attention models that can process multiple inputs at once, similar to how polycomputing biological systems perform multiple computations concurrently.Hierarchy and Multi-Scale: The hierarchical attention model discussed earlier, which aggregates relevant words into a sentence and key sentences into documents, can be likened to the multi-scale nature of biological systems performing polycomputing. In both cases, there's an understanding that complex systems operate on multiple levels simultaneously.Observer-dependency: Bongard and Levin discuss how the observer's perspective defines whether a system is computing or not. In the context of attention mechanisms, the manner in which the model focuses on different aspects of the input data (i.e., where it 'pays attention') could be viewed as a form of observer-dependency.Evolvability: The authors mention that computational substrates and robots are often produced by evolutionary techniques. This mirrors the idea in machine learning where models, including those using attention mechanisms, can 'evolve' and improve through iterative learning processes.Overloading of Functions: The notion of polycomputing, where the same substrate simultaneously computes different things, bears similarities with attention mechanisms where keys, queries, and values, though representing the same input sequence, serve distinctive roles in calculating attention weights.In both discussions, the core idea is the development and utilization of complex systems, whether biological or computational, that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously, adapt based on the environment (or data), and whose understanding and application are dependent on the observer's perspective.1 / 1Connections to stations of the mind.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPT"Stations of the Mind: New Directions for Reality Selection" is a book by Robert Ornstein that was published in 1981. In this work, Ornstein presents a holistic model of the human mind that rejects the idea of a singular, unitary consciousness in favor of a model in which the mind consists of multiple "stations" or modalities of consciousness, each responsible for different cognitive functions. The human mind, he argues, selectively toggles between these stations based on the demands of the situation, effectively constructing its own version of reality.This concept relates to our previous discussions in the following ways:Multi-functionality: Like the "stations" of the mind, attention mechanisms in machine learning allow the model to focus on different aspects of the input data depending on the requirements of the task at hand. Similarly, polycomputing systems perform multiple computations concurrently, each serving a unique function or task.Selective Attention: Ornstein's model suggests that the mind selectively focuses on different cognitive functions based on situational demands, which mirrors the concept of attention mechanisms in machine learning. These models selectively focus on different parts of the input data that are most relevant to the task, essentially constructing their own 'reality' or representation of the data.Observer-dependency: Bongard and Levin's idea of observer-dependency in defining computation in biological systems echoes Ornstein's view that the human mind, through its different stations, constructs its own version of reality. Both concepts highlight the subjective nature of understanding and interpreting information.Hierarchy and Multi-Scale: The concept of the mind having different "stations" or modalities of consciousness can be likened to the hierarchical attention model and the multi-scale nature of biological polycomputing systems. In all cases, complexity is handled at multiple levels, with different 'stations', layers, or scales responsible for handling different aspects of the overall task.Dynamic Switching: Ornstein's model suggests that our mind dynamically switches between different cognitive 'stations' based on the demands of the situation. This can be likened to how attention mechanisms adjust their focus based on input data, and how polycomputing systems perform different computations simultaneously and dynamically.In summary, both the theories in AI/machine learning and the concepts of the mind presented by Ornstein share an emphasis on multi-functionality, selective attention, observer-dependency, and the ability to dynamically switch between different modes or functions based on the task at hand.1 / 1That was good, but the title of the book was Stations of the Mind: New Directions for Reality Therapy1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTI apologize for the confusion earlier. "Stations of the Mind: New Directions for Reality Therapy" is a book by William Glasser. In it, Glasser discusses his concept of Reality Therapy, a method of therapy that focuses on the here-and-now actions of the client and the ability to create and choose a better future.This concept is also somewhat aligned with our previous discussions:Responsibility and Choice: Glasser's Reality Therapy emphasizes the individual's responsibility for their own life and their capacity to make effective choices. This resonates with the idea of machine learning models being designed to make optimal choices given their inputs and the tasks they need to perform.Present-focused: Reality Therapy is present-focused and action-oriented, much like the attention mechanisms in machine learning models. They focus on the current data and task at hand to generate outputs or actions.Behavioral Change: Just as Reality Therapy aims to help individuals make better choices to effect positive behavioral change, the learning process of AI models also involves making changes (adjusting weights and biases) based on feedback (loss function) to improve their performance.Needs and Wants: In Reality Therapy, there's a focus on fulfilling the client's needs and wants. Similarly, in the design of intelligent systems like AI and robotics, a crucial aspect is to ensure the system effectively meets the desired goals or 'needs'.Observer-dependency: While not a direct correlation, the idea that reality is shaped by one's actions and choices in Reality Therapy can be loosely linked to the observer-dependency discussed in the polycomputing context. Different observers (or in this case, individuals making choices or systems performing computations) can shape their own version of 'reality' based on their actions, interpretations, or computations.However, while there are parallels to be drawn, it's important to note that the context and objectives of Glasser's Reality Therapy and the development of machine learning models or theories around polycomputing are quite distinct.1 / 1Ok thank you. A list of everything we 've talked about.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTSure, here's a summary of the topics we've discussed so far:Attention Mechanisms in AI: We started with a discussion about the various types of attention mechanisms used in artificial intelligence (AI) models, including distinctive attention, co-attention, and hierarchical attention. We also discussed different models of attention, like the fine-grained and coarse-grained attention models, and self (inner) attention.Use Cases of Co-Attention: We touched on the successful deployment of co-attention in several tasks, such as sentiment classification, text matching, named entity recognition, entity disambiguation, and emotion cause analysis.Hierarchical Attention Models (HAM): We examined the Hierarchical Attention Model (HAM) which uses two different levels of attention for document classification - the word level and the sentence level. We also discussed extensions of this concept to higher levels and in the field of computer vision.Polycomputing and Overloaded Multi-Scale Machines: We explored the concept of "polycomputing", as discussed in a paper by Joshua Bongard and Michael Levin, which refers to the simultaneous performance of multiple functions in the same space and time. This concept is applicable to both biological systems and technology, including computer engineering, robotics, and regenerative medicine.Observer-Dependence in Computational Models: We discussed the concept of observer-dependency, where the perception of whether or not a system is 'computing' can vary based on the observer's perspective.Connections to Stations of the Mind: New Directions for Reality Therapy: Finally, we linked these concepts to ideas presented in William Glasser's book "Stations of the Mind: New Directions for Reality Therapy", particularly around responsibility and choice, present-focus, behavioural change, and needs and wants.Please let me know if you want to revisit any of these topics or if there's something new you'd like to discuss.1 / 1Before that.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTOf course, I apologize for any confusion. Here is a list of everything we've discussed before the aforementioned summary:Attention Mechanisms in Machine Learning Models: We began by discussing the application of attention mechanisms in machine learning models. These mechanisms, derived from human cognitive processes, allow the model to focus on different parts of the input when generating output, thereby enhancing the model's performance.Types of Attention Mechanisms: We looked at several types of attention mechanisms, including distinctive attention, co-attention, and hierarchical attention. Distinctive attention includes a single input and corresponding output sequence. In contrast, co-attention and hierarchical attention can handle multi-inputs.Implementations of Attention Mechanisms: We touched on various implementations of these attention mechanisms, such as the use of co-attention in visual question answering tasks. We also looked at fine-grained and coarse-grained attention models proposed by Fan et al., and self (inner) attention models proposed by Wang et al.Hierarchical Attention Model (HAM): We discussed the Hierarchical Attention Model (HAM), proposed by Yang et al., which extends attention to different levels of input embeddings, including word-level and sentence-level attention.Successful Use Cases of Co-Attention: We explored various successful use cases of co-attention, including sentiment classification, text matching, named entity recognition, entity disambiguation, emotion cause analysis, and sentiment classification.Applications in Computer Vision: We delved into the applications of hierarchical attention in computer vision, notably its use for object-level and part-level attention.Extensions and Variations of Attention Mechanisms: We also touched upon the concept of extending attention mechanisms to higher user levels and employing them at the document level. We mentioned the idea of a top-down approach presented by Zhao and Zhang.Let me know if you would like to explore any of these topics in more detail or if there's a new topic you're interested in discussing.1 / 1Specifically we focused on Glasser's "needs" as attention heads that act as comparing stations.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTI apologize for the oversight. In our discussion, we made a connection between Glasser's "needs" as outlined in his Choice Theory and Reality Therapy, and the concept of attention mechanisms in artificial intelligence.William Glasser's Choice Theory identifies four basic needs: belonging, power, freedom, and fun. These needs can be seen as "comparing stations" or "attention heads" in the context of machine learning models. Each need can be understood as a unique lens or focus, much like how an attention mechanism in AI models selectively focuses on different parts of the input to make decisions or predictions.Belonging: This need could be akin to an attention head focused on social dynamics or relationships within a given dataset or problem context.Power: An attention head reflecting this need might prioritize information relating to influence, authority, or control within a given context.Freedom: This need could correspond to an attention head focused on aspects of independence, choice, and autonomy in a dataset or problem context.Fun: An attention head corresponding to this need might focus on elements of joy, novelty, or entertainment within a given context.Just like the AI model uses different attention heads to comprehend different aspects of the input data better, an individual might use these different needs to make sense of their experiences and make choices accordingly. This is analogous to the attention model in AI, where different attention heads focus on different features or aspects of the input data, which are then combined to generate an output or prediction.1 / 1He says it could be 4, more or less, elsewhere he says we might have thousands of needs, salt, sugar, warmth, freedom of expression, community feeling.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTGlasser's basic needs in Choice Theory are indeed broad categories that could potentially encompass thousands of specific needs when broken down. In a similar fashion, attention mechanisms in machine learning models can have many heads, each capable of focusing on different aspects of input data. Let's use your examples to illustrate this:Salt: An attention head might focus on health-related or nutritional aspects within a given context.Sugar: Similar to salt, this could be seen as an attention head focusing on nutritional aspects or even taste preferences.Warmth: This need might be represented by an attention head paying attention to comfort or safety aspects.Freedom of expression: This need could correspond to an attention head focused on social and emotional aspects, such as communication and individuality.Community feeling: This need could be associated with an attention head prioritizing social connections, belongingness, and group dynamics.Each attention head could be seen as corresponding to a specific need, focusing on different features in the data relevant to that need. This allows the model to consider a multitude of aspects, similar to how individuals can have various needs that they prioritize and focus on based on their current situation and environment.When talking about thousands of needs, Glasser was likely referring to the multitude of specific desires and preferences that can arise within the broad categories of belonging, power, freedom, and fun. In a similar vein, attention mechanisms in AI models can have any number of heads, allowing them to focus on a wide range of specific features within the input data.1 / 1Ok thank you. A final summary of our discussion.1 / 1ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Here's a summary of our discussion:We began our conversation by discussing different forms of attention mechanisms in machine learning. We touched on distinctive attention, co-attention, hierarchical attention models, and self (inner) attention. We looked at how these models could accept multiple inputs and how they're used in various tasks like sentiment classification, text matching, named entity recognition, and emotion cause analysis.Then we delved into the applicability of these computational models to biological systems, as presented in the paper by Joshua Bongard and Michael Levin. They introduced the concept of "polycomputing" – the ability of the same substrate to simultaneously compute different things and make those computational results available to different observers. This reflects how biological systems can perform multiple functions at the same time in the same place.This led us to discuss William Glasser's Choice Theory, which proposes that human behavior is driven by our attempts to meet five basic needs: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom, and fun. We discussed how these needs could be compared to attention heads in machine learning models, acting as comparing stations in our minds.We finally made the connection between Glasser's theory and attention mechanisms in machine learning, comparing Glasser's broad categories of needs to attention heads in models. Each need, whether it's for salt, sugar, warmth, freedom of expression, or community feeling, could correspond to an attention head focusing on different aspects of input data.Throughout the conversation, we used these theories to make comparisons between the functioning of the human mind and the operation of AI models, specifically in how we focus our attention based on our needs and how AI models can do something similar via their attention mechanisms.1 / 1ChatGPT may produce inaccurate information about people, places, or facts.
