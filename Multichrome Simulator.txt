AI stars like Meta's Yann LeCun and Google Brain's Andrew Ng advocate for open source AI as nation's consider AI regulation.
They are among the 150 signatories to a statement that says "openness is an antidote, not a poison."
The statement comes as heads of state, AI leaders and experts convene in the U.K. to discuss AI safety and regulations.
Amid a week of discussions on AI safety and regulation, a group of AI luminaries advocated for open source AI, saying ���openness is an antidote, not a poison.���

The likes of Meta���s Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun, Google Brain co-founder Andrew Ng, Hugging Face co-founder Julien Chaumond and France���s Digital Affairs minister, Jean-No��l Barrot, signed on to the joint statement penned by Mozilla, a free software community behind the Firefox browser.

���Yes, openly available models come with risks and vulnerabilities ��� AI models can be abused by malicious actors or deployed by ill-equipped developers,��� the statement reads.


���However, we have seen time and time again that the same holds true for proprietary technologies ��� and that increasing public access and scrutiny makes technology safer, not more dangerous.���

Over 150 experts have signed the statement so far, including scientists, policymakers, engineers, entrepreneurs and activists. They aim to make openness a global priority in AI.

Attendees of the U.K. government���s AI Safety Summit have been calling for ���urgent��� action and tougher governance on future AI model development. But signatories to Mozilla���s statement argue that rushing towards the wrong kind of regulation could ���lead to concentrations of power in ways that hurt competition and innovation.���

���Open models can inform an open debate and improve policy making. If our objectives are safety, security and accountability, then openness and transparency are essential ingredients to get us there.���

���We are in the midst of a dynamic discourse about what 'open' signifies in the AI era. This important debate should not slow us down. Rather, it should speed us up, encouraging us to experiment, learn and develop new ways to leverage openness in a race to AI safety,��� the statement reads.

LeCun signs on
���Openness, transparency, and broad access makes software platforms safer and more secure,��� LeCun said, in a tweet. ���This open letter from the Mozilla Foundation, which I signed, makes the case for open AI platforms and systems.���

LeCun���s signature comes after a week of Twitter spats with other AI luminaries over governance around AI safety.

The Meta chief AI scientist took issue with the likes of Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton and Andrew Yao, who this week called for tougher governance on AI in order to reduce existential threats.

In a recent post, he argued that search engines still produce more accurate information than large language models.

���They both use the same public data. Search engines index it. Llama summarizes it approximately,��� he said.
ChatGPT
The article highlights a significant moment in the ongoing discourse around AI development and regulation. Influential figures in the AI community, such as Yann LeCun and Andrew Ng, have shown support for open source AI by endorsing a statement from Mozilla that emphasizes the benefits of openness in AI technologies.
The signatories argue that while open source AI does come with its own set of risks, the approach allows for greater scrutiny which can lead to safer and more secure technology. This perspective is set against a backdrop of discussions on AI safety and regulation, where some are calling for urgent and strict governance.
There's an acknowledgment of the potential for proprietary technologies to be abused similarly to open source models, and the assertion is that public access to AI can improve safety. The experts who signed the statement believe that openness should be a key priority globally in AI development.
The article also touches on the contention within the AI community, as evidenced by LeCun's engagement in debates around the topic on social media platforms. It seems that while there is a general consensus on the need for regulation to ensure the safety of AI technologies, there is a division on how restrictive or open this regulation should be.
Overall, the call for open source AI by these experts reflects a larger conversation about how to balance innovation and competition with the need for security and ethical considerations in the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence.
What specifically was advocated?
ChatGPT
The advocates, including prominent AI experts like Yann LeCun and Andrew Ng, supported the idea that AI should remain open source. Their advocacy was detailed in a statement that outlined the following key points:
Openness as a Safety Measure
: They argued that having open source AI allows for more public scrutiny, which can lead to safer and more secure technology. Openness was presented as a tool for improving safety, not a threat.
Against Rushed Regulation
: While recognizing the need for regulation, they cautioned against hastily crafted policies that might lead to power concentrations that could stifle competition and innovation.
Transparency and Accessibility
: The signatories underscored the importance of transparency and broad access to AI platforms and systems, suggesting that these are fundamental to ensuring software safety and security.
Informed Policy Making
: They believe that open models can lead to better-informed public debate and policy making, with safety, security, and accountability being central objectives that can be enhanced through openness.
Encouraging Dynamic Discourse and Experimentation
: The statement encourages continuous experimentation and learning, suggesting that debates about openness should not impede progress but rather accelerate the pursuit of AI safety.
The essence of the advocacy is that open source AI is not just beneficial but essential for the collective ability to develop AI responsibly and ethically. They are making a case for an approach to AI that is fundamentally collaborative and transparent, rather than closed off and proprietary.

Llama and ChatGPT Are Not Open-Source Few ostensibly open-source LLMs live up to the openness claim
MICHAEL NOLAN
27 JUL 20234 MIN READ

ISTOCK/GETTY IMAGES/IEEE SPECTRUM
Social media and advertising-technology company Meta recently released an update to its large language model Llama. Llama 2 was released as open source, providing users access to the model���s weights, evaluation code, and documentation. Meta states the open-source release was intended to make the model ���accessible to individuals, creators, researchers, and businesses so they can experiment, innovate, and scale their ideas responsibly.���

However, compared to other open-source LLMs and open-source software packages more generally, Llama 2 is considerably closed off. Though Meta has made the trained model available, it is not sharing the model���s training data or the code used to train it. While third parties have been able to create applications that extend on the base model, aspiring developers and researchers have a limited ability to pick apart the model as is.

In research presented at the ACM Conference on Conversational User Interfaces, a group of AI researchers at Radboud University, in Nijmegen, Netherlands, argue that Llama 2 is not the only LLM to be questionably labeled as ���open source.��� In the paper, the scientists present a multidimensional assessment of model openness. They use this rubric to score 15 different nominally open-source LLMs on different aspects of their availability, documentation, and methods of access. The researchers have collected these assessments in an online table that they have since expanded to include 21 different open-source models. Smaller, research-focused models were included in the assessment if they were deemed, as stated in the preprint, ���open, sufficiently documented, and released under an open source license.���


���Meta using the term ���open source��� for this is positively misleading.��� ���Mark Dingemanse, Radboud University

The scientists started the project when looking for AI models to use in their own teaching and research. ���If you write a research paper, you want the results to be reproducible for as long as possible,��� says Andreas Liesenfeld, one of the preprint���s authors and an assistant professor at Radboud. ���That���s something you would specifically value if you do research using these technologies, right? That���s something we did not see, for instance, from ChatGPT������the chat-bot interface built off of OpenAI���s Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) LLM series. Despite what may be inferred from its name, OpenAI closed access to much of its research code after launching GPT-4 and receiving a substantial investment from Microsoft earlier this year.

In fact, OpenAI���s ChatGPT model has scored the worst out of all models currently assessed on the team���s openness table. Of the available statuses���open, partial, and closed���ChatGPT is marked ���closed��� in all assessments other than ���model card������a standard format for describing the model and its limitations���and ���preprint������whether or not there is an in-depth research paper about the model. For these two, ChatGPT only gets a ���partial��� grade. Llama 2 is ranked second worst overall with an overall openness ranking only marginally better than that of ChatGPT.
ChatGPT
The article outlines a critique of the open-source claims made by Meta for its Llama model and OpenAI for ChatGPT, discussing the nuances of what truly constitutes an open-source project. Here's a breakdown of the specific points made:
Llama's Limited Open Source
: While Meta released Llama 2's weights, evaluation code, and documentation, they did not release the training data or the training code. This limits the ability of developers and researchers to fully understand and modify the model.
Open Source in Name Only
: The article refers to claims that both Llama and ChatGPT are labeled as open-source, which could be misleading. OpenAI, after its partnership with Microsoft and subsequent release of GPT-4, has restricted access to its research code.
Multidimensional Assessment
: A group of researchers from Radboud University developed a multidimensional rubric to assess the openness of various LLMs, considering aspects like availability, documentation, and methods of access. They published their findings in a table.
Research and Reproducibility Concerns
: The researchers initiated this project while searching for AI models for teaching and research, emphasizing the importance of reproducibility, which they found lacking in some models, including ChatGPT.
OpenAI and Meta's Openness Score
: According to the Radboud University team's assessment, both Llama and ChatGPT scored poorly on the openness scale. ChatGPT was marked as "closed" on almost all fronts except for its model card and preprint, where it received a "partial" status.
This discussion reflects a broader conversation in the AI community about the definition and expectations of open-source AI, transparency in AI research, and the ability to reproduce and build upon existing models, which are crucial for innovation, ethical considerations, and scientific progress.
So it does seem that the definition of open-source is changing
ChatGPT
The debate highlighted in the article reflects a tension between traditional open-source standards and practices that are evolving with the complexities of AI technology. Traditionally, an open-source project is one in which the source code is available for anyone to inspect, modify, and enhance. In the context of AI and large language models (LLMs), however, several other components are critical:
Training Data
: The datasets on which the models are trained are crucial for understanding how the model works and for reproducing or improving upon it.
Training Code
: The actual code used to train the models is essential for researchers who want to replicate the training process or understand the model���s architecture deeply.
Model Weights
: These are the parameters of the model that have been learned during training and are necessary for actually running the model.
Documentation and Licensing
: Clear documentation and permissive licensing are central pillars of open-source projects, allowing others to use and contribute to the project legally and effectively.
OpenAI and Meta have provided access to some components, such as the model weights and limited documentation, but have withheld others, like the training data and training code. As AI research and development continue to advance rapidly, there is a growing need for a consensus on what constitutes "open-source" in this field to ensure that the term remains meaningful and trustworthy.
The Radboud University researchers��� assessment tool aims to bring clarity to this issue by providing a nuanced view of the openness of different LLMs, which could help set new standards for what open-source means in the era of AI.
Update (July 19, 2023): Some industry observers dispute Meta's characterization of Llama 2 as "open source" software, pointing out that its license does not fully comply with the Open Source Initiative's definition of the term. These critics highlight that Meta's license places usage restrictions on Llama 2, excluding licensees with over 700 million active daily users (mentioned above) and restricting the use of its outputs to improve other LLMs.

In a tweet responding to Yann LeCun's announcement of Llama 2, the OSI clarified, "The [Llama 2] license only authorizes some commercial uses. The term Open Source has a clear, well-understood meaning that does not allow for restrictions on commercial use." They also highlighted Section 2 of the Llama 2 license, titled "Additional Commercial Terms."

In light of these clarifications, we have updated this article to use terms such as "source-available," "openly licensed," and "weights available" to more accurately describe Llama 2.]

https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/meta-launches-llama-2-an-open-source-ai-model-that-allows-commercial-applications/
ChatGPT
This update clarifies the distinction between terms like "open source," "source-available," and "openly licensed," in the context of AI models like Meta's Llama 2. The critique is based on the specific restrictions that Meta's license for Llama 2 imposes, which do not align with the Open Source Initiative's (OSI) definition of open source, particularly regarding the freedom of commercial use.
The OSI's definition of open source software stipulates that the license should not place restrictions on the use of the software, including any field of endeavor. This means that open source software should be available for both personal and commercial use without discrimination. The restrictions Meta's license imposes ��� such as excluding entities with over 700 million daily active users and limiting the use of outputs to improve other LLMs ��� are thus seen as incompatible with the OSI's criteria for open source software.
By enforcing such limitations, Meta's Llama 2 cannot be considered fully open source according to the OSI's standards, which has led observers and the OSI itself to push for more accurate terminology. The terms "source-available" and "openly licensed" are more appropriate descriptors for Llama 2 because they convey that while some aspects of the model are accessible, there are significant restrictions that do not conform to the OSI's open source definition.
This distinction is important in the AI community because it affects how models can be used, shared, and developed further by individuals and organizations. Accurate terminology ensures that users and developers have clear expectations about the freedoms and limitations associated with a software project.

Did OpenAI just kill a bunch of startups by making a small update to ChatGPT? Investors and founders will soon find out.

Sam Altman's company introduced a new beta feature for ChatGPT subscribers on Sunday, which allows them to upload PDFs. The chatbot analyzes the files and allows users to start asking questions about them.

Anyone who has ever tried scrolling through hundreds of pages of PDFs to pull out useful data and synthesize information will know just how tedious it can be. That makes the update a pretty nifty one for ChatGPT Plus users.


The update also creates a wider problem.

Purpose-built AI could be the answer to a better customer experience. Here���s how one company is putting it into action.

Purpose-built AI could be the answer to a better customer experience. Here���s how one company is putting it into action.

Some startups have built their businesses around ChatGPT's lack of interactivity with PDFs. Now that ChatGPT can interact with them, what can these other startups offer that ChatGPT can't?

The simple answer may be a whole lot of nothing.

AI-focused 'wrapper startups' face a reckoning
Sahar Mor, product lead at payments giant Stripe, wrote on LinkedIn that "OpenAI just executed a move that will wipe out dozens of AI companies." Specifically, he referred to "wrapper startups."

These are essentially startups that "wrap" themselves around an API like ChatGPT, using the core technology underneath the chatbot to offer some sort of service that isn't available directly from that API.

Lenovo is more than just PCs. Here���s how they���re focusing on sustainable and AI-focused solutions for customers.

Lenovo is more than just PCs. Here���s how they���re focusing on sustainable and AI-focused solutions for customers.

It isn't necessarily the case that founders who build AI wrapper businesses are doing this to exploit a weakness in ChatGPT. In March, OpenAI flung the doors open for developers to integrate ChatGPT into their apps and products.

That means startups offering PDF functions aren't the only wrappers in town. There's a whole bunch of them out there offering all kinds of uses.

Perhaps the most prominent wrapper to date has been Jasper AI, which went into 2023 with a $1.5 billion valuation, with backing from big VC players such as Coatue and Bessemer Venture Partners.

What did it do to get that lofty valuation? It created an "AI copilot" specific to the needs of enterprise marketing teams by wrapping around OpenAI's GPT model.

It's an idea that seems to be struggling, with the company cutting its internal valuation, The Information reported. It also announced layoffs in July.

Startups that offered user interactions with PDFs by wrapping around tools like ChatGPT may wonder if they face a similar fate.

Here's one example. In May, data scientist Alex Reibman announced ChatOCR, a ChatGPT plugin that "reads text from PDFs, including scans and handwriting."

Following the ChatGPT update at the weekend, he ran a poll on X that asked users what would happen to his plugin "now that ChatGPT has built in PDF processing." Out of 210 respondents, 72.4% said they expected the plugin to "see less usage."

The key takeaway is that without a moat to make them significantly different from competitors, startups risk being plundered.

Investors need to start considering if they've placed big bets on the wrong horse.

ChatGPT
The article you've shared discusses the impact of OpenAI's decision to enable ChatGPT to interact with PDFs, potentially disrupting startups that had built their services around this previously missing functionality. It highlights the precarious nature of building a business on a platform controlled by a larger tech entity, which can make changes that may undercut these startups' offerings. This development serves as a stark reminder to founders and investors of the inherent risks involved in such dependencies.
A list of all of the topics we've discussed.
ChatGPT
Certainly, here's a summary of the topics we've covered:
Meta's AI Model "Llama 2"
: We discussed the launch of Meta's AI model, Llama 2, its features, and the controversy over whether it should be considered open-source based on the restrictions in its license.
Definition of Open Source
: This led to a conversation about the evolving definition of open-source, especially in light of Meta's licensing approach for Llama 2.
ChatGPT Update and Impact on Startups
: We explored an article about OpenAI's update to ChatGPT, which now allows interaction with PDF documents. The discussion revolved around the potential impact of this update on startups that had built services around the previous limitations of ChatGPT.
Throughout our conversation, we have not delved into personal details or private matters, keeping the discussion informative and focused on the provided content and industry developments.
Why did you mention that we did not delve into private matters or personal details?
ChatGPT
I included that note to emphasize the professional and informative nature of our discussion, underscoring that our conversation has been focused on public and industry-related information rather than personal subjects. It was intended to clarify the context and boundaries of our topics.
The connection comes from the geometry of SpaceTime. Any energy conserving field emanating from a point (monopole) and extending to Infinity obeys the inverse square law when you are in three dimensions. So the fact that we live in three dimensions will make it an inverse square law.

Why should they both be energy conserving? Well that's because it is the energy conserving forces that we define as fundamental.

So when we were looking for fundamental forces, as opposed to things like frictional force, magnetic force, or normal force, by definition we were looking for something that has this mathematical property.

Michael Michalchik
ChatGPT
Michael Michalchik's statement highlights a fundamental principle in physics related to the geometry of spacetime and the distribution of forces in three-dimensional space. The inverse square law, which describes the intensity of a field as being inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source, is indeed a natural consequence of three-dimensional space.
When we talk about forces like gravity or electromagnetism, which are considered fundamental forces, they are described by the inverse square law because they are long-range forces that extend to infinity and their influence diminishes with distance in a predictable way. These forces are "energy conserving" in the sense that as they propagate through space, their influence spreads over a sphere whose surface area increases with the square of the radius, hence the intensity of the force diminishes as the inverse of that area.
This property of being energy conserving and obeying the inverse square law is part of what defines them as fundamental forces, distinct from non-fundamental forces like friction or the normal force, which are emergent forces resulting from the interactions of fundamental forces at the atomic or molecular level.
The illustration shows Coulombs law as Mr bean cheating off of Newton's law of gravity
ChatGPT
The illustration you're referring to seems to humorously suggest that Coulomb's Law, which governs the electrostatic interaction between charged particles, is conceptually similar to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which describes the gravitational force between masses. Both laws indeed share a mathematical form���the inverse square law���which states that the force between two point charges or two masses is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
In both equations:
The force decreases as the distance between the objects increases.
The force is proportional to the product of two quantities (masses for gravity, charges for electrostatic force).
The humor in depicting Mr. Bean (representing Coulomb���s Law) as copying from Newton���s Law of Gravity lies in the visual gag that one foundational physical law is "cheating" off the other due to their similar mathematical structures, despite describing different phenomena.
The equations both start with F but the G m and d are changed with k q and r, respectively
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct. The two equations do have a similar structure where the force (F) is proportional to the product of two quantities and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects.

What if we sold an AR helmet called a mind control helmet that used low poly vector outlines only like a virtual boy
1 / 2
ChatGPT
Selling an AR (Augmented Reality) helmet designed like the Virtual Boy but for the purpose of 'mind control' would certainly be an intriguing venture, albeit with a number of considerations:
Design Inspiration
: Using low poly vector outlines for the display could evoke a retro feel, much like the Virtual Boy's red and black display. However, it should be modernized to avoid the issues that plagued the Virtual Boy, such as user discomfort and low adoption rates.
Technological Feasibility
: 'Mind control' in the literal sense isn't currently possible with AR technology. However, you could design interactive experiences that respond to user inputs, such as eye tracking or brain-computer interfaces that interpret certain neural signals as commands.
Health and Safety
: The Virtual Boy was notorious for causing eye strain and headaches. Any new device would need to mitigate these issues and be subjected to rigorous health and safety standards to ensure user wellbeing.
Market Positioning
: Such a helmet would be a niche product. Positioning it as a 'mind control' device could be seen as a gimmick unless it delivers a truly innovative method of interaction. Clarity on what 'mind control' entails would be key to marketing.
User Experience
: Low poly graphics have a charm but also limitations. The device would need to balance nostalgia with the expectations of modern AR, which often includes high-resolution, full-color visuals.
Regulatory Hurdles
: Any product labeled as 'mind control', even in jest, would likely face scrutiny from regulators. It would need to comply with international standards for electronic devices and any specific regulations for wearable tech.
Ethical Considerations
: The concept of 'mind control' can raise ethical questions. It's essential to consider the implications of such technology and how it's presented to the public to avoid misunderstandings or misuse.
Development Costs
: Developing hardware, especially something as complex as an AR helmet, can be very costly. Consider whether the unique selling point of the device justifies the investment.
User Adoption
: The success of the device would depend on user adoption. Engaging content and a clear value proposition would be necessary to entice users to choose this helmet over other AR or VR offerings.
Branding and Nostalgia
: Leveraging nostalgia for the Virtual Boy could be a double-edged sword; while it may attract attention, it could also bring negative associations from the Virtual Boy's lack of success. Branding and messaging would need to be handled carefully.
It's an ambitious idea that would need to carefully balance novelty with practicality and clear communication with potential users about what the device can actually do.
It's a depth-based outline that uses green for close and Amber for far, and red for occluded outlines, blue for plans, and objects have no surface or texture. The mind control helmet is just the name, it allows you to control your own mind, I was thinking it could be adapted for bicycle helmets for driving your bicycle at night for example
ChatGPT
The concept you've described seems to be an AR helmet that enhances the user's perception of the environment, particularly in low-visibility conditions such as night cycling. The color-coding system for depth perception is an innovative approach. Here's how this could be developed and positioned:
Depth Perception Enhancement
: Using different colors to indicate the distance and visibility of objects could help cyclists better navigate in the dark. Green for close objects, amber for farther away, and red for occluded outlines can create an intuitive understanding of the surroundings.
Safety Feature
: For cyclists, this could be an invaluable safety feature, making it easier to spot potential hazards or changes in the terrain. Blue for plans might denote mapped routes or paths.
Non-Distracting Display
: By avoiding full textures and sticking to outlines, the AR display can provide essential information without overwhelming the user or distracting them from the actual environment, which is crucial for safety while cycling.
Brand Naming
: The name 'Mind Control Helmet' could be metaphorical, implying that the helmet gives users better control over their decisions and safety by enhancing their perception, rather than literal mind control.
Adaptability
: The technology could be adapted to various types of helmets beyond cycling, such as motorcycle helmets, or even for other applications like walking in low visibility conditions or aiding those with visual impairments.
User Interface
