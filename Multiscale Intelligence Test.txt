Abstract
Since the 1950s, philosophers and AI researchers have held that disambiguating natural language sentences depended on common sense. In 2012, the Winograd Schema Challenge was established to evaluate the common-sense reasoning abilities of a machine by testing its ability to disambiguate sentences. The designers argued only a system capable of "thinking in the full-bodied sense" would be able to pass the test. However, by 2023, the original authors concede the test has been soundly defeated by large language models which still seem to lack common sense of full-bodied thinking. In this paper, we argue that disambiguating sentences only seemed like a good test of common-sense based on a certain picture of the relationship between linguistic comprehension and semantic knowledge—one typically associated with the early computational theory of mind and Symbolic AI. If this picture is rejected, as it is by most LLM researchers, then disambiguation ceases to look like a comprehensive test of common-sense and instead appear only to test linguistic competence. The upshot is that any linguistic test, not just disambiguation, is unlikely to tell us much about common sense or genuine intelligence.

Introduction
What makes something a significant accomplishment in artificial intelligence? There have been many proposed cognitive abilities taken to require human-like intelligence which would be a good test for AI, such as successful chess playing ([45]; [20]). The assumption was that these abilities could not be accomplished without possessing the genuine article: real, bonafide human-like intelligence. But when AI systems accomplish these feats—as with Deep Blue's victory in chess over Garry Kasparov in 1997—there is a feeling by many that the accomplishment does not show us anything interesting about intelligence [17]. This situation is so common and pervasive it has its own name, "the AI effect": when a machine cannot do a task, it is assumed the task requires intelligence; when a machine can do it, the task is no longer regarded as requiring intelligence.

One of the oldest tests in AI concerns disambiguating sentences in natural language. Since many words have multiple meanings and often syntax alone cannot determine which noun a pronoun refers to, we require some background knowledge about the world—typically dubbed "common-sense"—to figure out what the sentence is trying to say. For example, if someone says, "I put my raincoat in the tub because it was wet," the "it" could technically refer to the raincoat or the tub. But we immediately grasp it refers to the raincoat through common-sense, by understanding what raincoats and tubs are, that wet raincoats need to dry, and that wet raincoats can be put into tubs to dry off. Common-sense automatically parses the sentence for us, without us needing to think about it at all [25].

Motivated by these problems, in 2012 Hector Levesque, Ernie Davis, and Leora Morgenstern [34] introduced the "Winograd Shema Challenge" (henceforth, "the Challenge") as a method for testing the common-sense reasoning abilities of natural language processing AI systems through disambiguation tasks. As in the above example, an AI system would be tasked with disambiguating the meaning of a sentence merely from the meaning of the words. Levesque argued a machine that could consistently disambiguate sentences would possess "thinking in the full-bodied sense we usually reserve for people" ([34]: 2). After a mere decade and even with novel, tougher versions of the test, Kocijan et al. (2023) [31] have recently declared that contemporary neural network-based large language models (LLMs) are more than capable of solving any variant of the Challenge. But they also conclude solving the Challenge is not evidence these machines have common-sense—that full-blooded thinking is still far off. In short, it is another victim of the AI Effect. But this raises the question: if the Winograd Schema and related variants are not a good test of common-sense reasoning, why did anyone think they would be? And how can LLMs succeed at the Challenge if they lack common-sense?

In this paper, we argue that the assumption that the Challenge would prove something about common-sense is predicated on a specific picture of how language and semantic knowledge must be connected—what we call the "propositional picture of semantic knowledge"—and that such a picture is misguided. On the propositional picture, all knowledge is represented in a propositional format in a language of thought. This picture assumes natural language is simply the less clear and more ambiguous expression of an underlying, more precise semantic knowledge contained in a massive database of symbols and propositions structured in logically deductive relations. This regards linguistic competency as disambiguating sentences in natural language into the unambiguous, logically ordered propositional beliefs in a language of thought. This motivates the Challenge: disambiguating shows that a system has propositional knowledge and can adequately use it when understanding natural language sentences.

However, LLMs do not assume understanding language requires a separate, propositionally structured semantic database. Rather, this statistical approach assumes semantic knowledge is intertwined with linguistic competency. If this is right, however, this suggests the propositional picture is too strong: there is some knowledge that is not propositional. This opens the possibility that there is more to common-sense reasoning than what can be captured in propositions and language propositions and language, and dismabiguating sentences can only tell us about a specific linguistic skill and linguistic semantic knowledge; it cannot tell us about genuine thinking or common-sense in general. This explains why the Challenge failed to provide the test of genuine intelligence it promised, but also suggests we should be skeptical any linguistic task can prove genuine thinking.

In the second section, we explain what the Challenge is, why Levesque considered it a test of common-sense, and why Kocijan et al. consider it now defeated. In the third section, we provide a brief history of the propositional picture of semantic knowledge in the late-19th century. In the fourth section, we show the influence of the propositional picture of semantic knowledge on early-AI and how this resulted in using the disambiguation task as evidence of linguistic competency. In the fifth section, we show that the Challenge is a test of common-sense knowledge only if the propositional picture of semantic knowledge is true. However, we also argue the success of LLMs shows that the propositional picture is too strong: not all semantic knowledge needs to be propositional or linguistically expressible. But if this picture is abandoned, it is no longer clear why disambiguation is a useful test of common-sense. In the sixth section, we explain how LLMs can possess the semantic knowledge necessary to solve disambiguation problems while still lacking much of the semantic knowledge requisite for common-sense. The upshot is that linguistic tasks in general cannot provide a good test of common-sense; there is just more to semantic knowledge than what we talk about.

Artificial Intelligence: Language, Common Sense, and the Winograd Schema Challenge by Jacob Browning & Yann LeCun
Summary
:
The paper delves into the idea of testing an AI's common-sense reasoning abilities using linguistic disambiguation, especially through the Winograd Schema Challenge established in 2012. The initial belief was that successfully disambiguating natural language sentences required a machine to exhibit common-sense reasoning equivalent to humans. By 2023, however, large language models (LLMs) easily passed this test, indicating its inadequacy in assessing AI's genuine common-sense abilities.
The authors argue that relying on disambiguation as a test for common sense stems from an outdated belief associated with early AI theories, which suggests that understanding language depends on a vast underlying database of propositional knowledge. Modern LLMs, on the other hand, integrate semantic knowledge with linguistic competency, indicating that some knowledge might not be strictly propositional. This reveals the flaw in viewing the Winograd Schema Challenge as a definitive test for common-sense reasoning. The success of LLMs in this challenge suggests that not all semantic knowledge is propositional or can be expressed linguistically. Therefore, linguistic tasks might not be the best measures of genuine intelligence or common-sense.

The winograd schema challenge
In 2011, Levesque et al. introduced "the Winograd Schema Challenge." While the Challenge may seem like simply a variation on the Turing Test ([56]), Levesque notes that Turing's test is a very strange, abnormal situation that can easily be gamed. Humans rarely go through conversations demanding their partner solve math problems or explain a specific passage of Shakespeare (Turing's examples). Instead, conversations often follow less adversarial paths, following along with what the partner is

The propositional picture of semantic knowledge
For much of Western philosophy, the central model of knowing something correctly was connecting representations together to perceive them clearly and distinctly, with knowledge defined as truly judging things correctly. But at the end of the 18th century, Kant (1991) [29] realized this picture only worked well on categorical judgments, such as "the ball is red," but could not handle disjunctive judgments, such as "either the ball is red or blue, but not both," and hypothetical judgments, such

Early AI and the propositional picture
The early work in AI—usually called "Symbolic AI"—embraced this picture of semantic knowledge. This often was implicit: it is the underlying logic behind the Turing test: all thoughts are propositional; language is the expression of these thoughts; and a machine that can talk about anything is therefore capable of tokening any proposition a human can—and, thus, thinking thoughts with the same content as human thoughts. It could also be seen in the construction of the field of artificial

A forced rethinking of the propositional picture
From the perspective of early AI, the Challenge provides an excellent test of common sense. The reasoning is simple: ambiguous sentences can be disambiguated only through background knowledge. But there is a further assumption: all knowledge, including background, common sense knowledge, is propositional. This assumes a kind of isomorphism between language and thought: a linguistic sentence is an expression of an underlying proposition and understanding a sentence means tokening the appropriate 

LLMs and common-sense
This section provides a brief outline of what LLMs seem to know of common-sense and how they know it. This clarifies both why they can succeed at the Challenge—and why that tells us so little about common-sense.

The success of LLMs depends on extracting from linguistic corpus the statistical patterns for how words are used in human texts and conversations. There is good evidence of LLMs capturing linguistic information and developing competency in grammatical capacities ([55], [58], [15]). The

Conclusion
This paper sets out a brief history of the propositional picture of thought and how it motivated early research in AI. It showed this picture of thought suggested ambiguous sentences posed a good test of common-sense since disambiguating them would rely on selecting the right proposition. It also assumed there is nothing more to thinking than tokening the right proposition, and thus a machine that could disambiguate sentences requiring common-sense would necessarily possess the same knowledge

Section Snippets:
The Winograd Schema Challenge:
Introduced by Levesque and team in 2011, the Winograd Schema Challenge aimed to evaluate AI's common-sense reasoning via linguistic disambiguation. Contrasting it with the Turing Test, which Levesque felt was an easily manipulated and unusual benchmark, the Challenge focused on more typical, less adversarial conversational paths.
The Propositional Picture of Semantic Knowledge:
Historically, Western philosophy perceived knowledge as the linkage of representations for clear and distinct comprehension. However, this view had limitations, as pointed out by Kant in the 18th century. Kant noted its inapplicability to more complex judgments, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding.
Early AI and the Propositional Picture:
Early AI endeavors, often termed "Symbolic AI," relied heavily on this propositional view of semantic knowledge. This approach was evident in the Turing test and implied that language was a mere reflection of underlying thoughts, asserting that a machine could possess human-like thought processes if it could effectively communicate all propositions.
A Forced Rethinking of the Propositional Picture:
For early AI proponents, the Winograd Schema Challenge seemed ideal for testing common-sense. The challenge's foundation lay in the belief that understanding ambiguous sentences depended on background knowledge, which was assumed to be entirely propositional. This led to the perspective that language and thought were closely linked, with each linguistic sentence being a manifestation of a deeper proposition.
LLMs and Common-Sense:
This section delves into Large Language Models (LLMs) and their understanding of common-sense. LLMs base their success on extracting statistical patterns from human texts and conversations, enabling them to demonstrate competence in linguistic tasks. The success of LLMs, particularly in linguistic comprehension, arises from their ability to detect these patterns.
Conclusion:
The paper traverses the journey of the propositional perspective of thought and its influence on early AI research. The inherent belief was that disambiguating ambiguous sentences using common-sense would require tapping into the right proposition. The paper also alludes to the underlying assumption that the act of thinking was solely about identifying the correct proposition, implying that an AI proficient in disambiguation possesses similar knowledge as humans.
2. The winograd schema challenge 
In 2011, Levesque et al. introduced "the Winograd Schema Challenge." While the Challenge may seem like simply a 
variation on the Turing Test ([56]), Levesque notes that Turing's test is a very strange, abnormal situation that can easily be 
gamed. Humans rarely go through conversations demanding their partner solve math problems or explain a specif i c passage 
of Shakespeare (Turing's examples). Instead, conversations often follow less adversarial paths, following along with what the 
partner is saying and taking their comments in a charitable light. This allows machines in the Turing Test "to hide behind 
a smokescreen of verbal tricks, playfulness, or canned responses" ([34]: 5), potentially fooling a human without displaying 
any intelligence. Instead, Levesque et al. recommended the Challenge as a much simpler, but more challenging, test—an easy 
to evaluate test that the machine could not game. 
Levesque et al. named the challenge after Terry Winograd, who in his 1972 "Understanding Natural Language" fore- 
grounded the impossibility of disambiguating based on syntax alone. Winograd argued some ambiguous sentences required 
both syntactical analysis but also a semantic evaluation, determining which meaning of a sentence is meant by gauging 
which is more plausible or coherent. Levesque et al. provides an example of a "Winograd Schema"
J. Browning and Y. LeCunArtif i cial Intelligence•••(••••)•••••• 
The town councilors refused to give the angry demonstrators a permit because they feared violence. 
Who feared violence? 
Answer 0: the town councilors. 
Answer 1: the angry demonstrators. ([34]: 3) 
Although "they" is closer in the sentence to the word "demonstrators" than "councilors," we recognize that the councilors 
are fearful because they worry the demonstrators will grow violent. As they point out, "You need to have background 
knowledge that is not expressed in the words of the sentence to be able to sort out what is going on [...] And it is precisely 
bringing this background knowledge to bear that we informally call thinking" ([34]: 3). Thus, the goal of both Winograd and 
Levesque is to probe the underlying background knowledge through a test of a machine's linguistic competency. 
The original Challenge involved creating over a hundred different Winograd Schemas where syntax alone could not 
disambiguate it and also a human would automatically, without even realizing it, read it the right way. As [31]: 8 put 
it, "The goal of the [Challenge] was to present a challenge that (a) was clearly 'commonsensical' and easily carried out 
by humans; (b) was easy to evaluate; (c) was an adequate test of commonsense reasoning abilities" ([31]). The main test 
concerned sentences which could have wholly different meanings based on changing only a single word. The standard 
example from Levesque et al. concerns a trophy: 
The trophy doesn't fi t inside the suitcase because it is too large. 
The trophy doesn't fi t inside the suitcase because it is too small. 
A successful disambiguation requires grasping that "it" changes what it refers to in each case because of the difference 
in size. This provides a simple, easy-to-understand example of common-sense reasoning—one humans engage in effortlessly. 
But it requires a background understanding of the world which can automatically (i.e., without conscious ref l ection) choose 
between the two possible meanings. It was assumed that any machine which could automatically arrive at the same result 
must also possess a similar background understanding of the world. 
Since the original test, many other variations have been raised and proposed, as Kocijan et al. [31] highlight. The most 
important of the bunch, WinoGrande ([51]), increased the number of ambiguous sentences to over 40,000. The hope behind 
such a large corpus was to prevent any LLM gaming the system by simply studying to the test. By 2021, LLMs were achieving 
over 90% success at even the most extensive of these tests—only slightly below the 94% achieved by humans on the same 
tests. And, during this same period, LLMs grew in scope and complexity, and often displayed remarkably nuanced linguistic 
competency. 
Despite this success, it is clear these language processing systems do not possess the comprehensive, wide-ranging 
common-sense many expected. As Kocijan et al. note, LLMs often "spew nonsense," and transcription software and auto- 
correct "regularly turn sensible speech and text into gibberish, by turns confusing, humorous, or embarrassing" ([31]: 7). 
The success of LLMs on the Challenge is not evidence for common-sense, they argue, but instead evidence that somehow 
these systems are solving the problem despite lacking common-sense. The result is evidence that disambiguation tasks, 
on their own, do not test common-sense after all. A better test, they contend, would require a more holistic approach, 
perhaps involving the LLM reading larger passages and providing long answers about it, or perhaps telling an LLM a series 
of instruction in natural language and seeing if they could follow them ([31]: 8). 
But, before testing these approaches, it is worth pondering why solving disambiguation proved not to be a signif i cant 
accomplishment. Why did this seem such a plausible test of common-sense? And how could it be defeated without showing 
us anything interesting about common-sense? Without answers to these questions, we might make the same mistake— 
setting a standard for genuine thinking that only looks dif i cult because of our assumptions.

The Winograd Schema Challenge:
In 2011, Levesque and his team unveiled the Winograd Schema Challenge as an alternative to the Turing Test. The Turing Test, in its design, could easily be exploited and didn't necessarily provide an accurate measure of genuine intelligence. It often led to machines providing deceptive, playful, or pre-set responses rather than showcasing actual comprehension. Instead, the Winograd Schema Challenge was designed to be a simpler, yet more rigorous assessment of machine intelligence.
Named after Terry Winograd's 1972 work on "Understanding Natural Language," the challenge highlighted the need for both syntactical and semantic evaluations when processing language. Winograd emphasized that certain ambiguous sentences cannot be clarified solely based on syntax. For instance, in the sentence, "The town councilors refused to give the angry demonstrators a permit because they feared violence," the pronoun "they" could refer to either the councilors or the demonstrators. However, human understanding, aided by background knowledge, interprets this as the councilors fearing potential violence from the demonstrators. This form of reasoning, which involves implicit background knowledge, is what Levesque and Winograd considered akin to human-like thinking.
The Winograd Schema Challenge originally comprised over a hundred such ambiguous sentences. The main objective was to test machines on sentences where a slight word change could shift the entire meaning. For instance, the word "it" in the sentences about a trophy being too large or small to fit inside a suitcase changes its reference based on the context. Such tasks, which humans effortlessly decode, were seen as measures of common-sense reasoning. The underlying assumption was that a machine capable of solving these ambiguities should possess an inherent understanding of the world.
However, the Challenge evolved with time. One significant version, WinoGrande, expanded the dataset to over 40,000 ambiguous sentences. The expansion aimed to deter Large Language Models (LLMs) from simply "memorizing" the answers. By 2021, LLMs had shown impressive results, achieving over 90% success, close to the 94% by humans. These models also demonstrated advanced linguistic abilities.
Yet, these achievements have been met with skepticism. Despite their successes, LLMs often generate nonsensical outputs or make egregious mistakes, prompting questions about their so-called "common-sense" understanding. Critics argue that acing the Winograd Schema Challenge doesn't necessarily equate to having common-sense. For a true measure, a more comprehensive test might be needed, possibly involving extensive reading and comprehension or following a sequence of instructions.
The crux of the debate now centers around understanding why resolving linguistic ambiguities might not be the golden standard for evaluating common-sense. Before devising new tests, it's essential to introspect why certain benchmarks, which initially seemed promising, ended up revealing very little about genuine machine intelligence and common-sense.
3. The propositional picture of semantic knowledge 
For much of Western philosophy, the central model of knowing something correctly was connecting representations 
together to perceive them clearly and distinctly, with knowledge def i ned as truly judging things correctly. But at the end 
of the 18thcentury, Kant (1991) [29] realized this picture only worked well on categorical judgments, such as "the ball is 
red," but could not handle disjunctive judgments, such as "either the ball is red or blue, but not both," and hypothetical 
judgments, such as, "if this ball were made of bronze, it would not fl oat." Kant argued that we could conceive of, believe, 
and judge many of these as necessary, possible, or even impossible—even if, in some cases, we could not perceive them 
clearly or at all. For many post-Kantians, Kant's insight meant knowledge and judgment, if it is to be capable of fi tting into 
these logical forms, must be structured propositionally. 
Many post-Kantians, such as Bolzano [4] and Boole [5], attempted to develop this insight into a more formal logic, one 
which could better account for logic in terms of mere propositions and the logical connections between them—shorn of any 
perceptual or imagistic content. This move went together with a post-Newtonian push for formal models of mathematics 
and science—based around symbols, equations, and formal logics. This brought with it an increasing emphasis on "objec- 
tivity," understood as the removal of any idiosyncrasy of personality, culture, or language. As Daston and Galison put it, 
scientists pursued "a higher, purer form of knowing entirely free of pictures, intuitions, or indeed any aspect of the senses; 
even theoretical models and geometric intuitions were suspect" ([16]: 259-60). What was needed was a form of knowledge 
that was neutral—capable of representing the world for anyone, regardless of their national background or language. 
This culminated in the purely formal predicate logic proposed by Gottlieb Frege. He argued we should treat thought 
(i.e., semantic knowledge) as consisting in the thinking the appropriate concepts in propositions in a language of thought ([24]: 302). Although Frege rejected any attempt to psychologize this ideal language of thought, he did think it applied 
to all thought—including propositions no one was currently thinking and those which have not been thought up yet. He 
writes, "the thought, for example, which we expressed in the Pythagorean theorem is timelessly true, true independently 
of whether anyone takes it to be true [...] [the thought] is like a planet which, already before anyone has seen it, has been 
in interaction with other planets" ([24]: 302). While the ideal was a precise logical system, Frege argued natural language 
provided a less precise expression of these same propositions. As Frege writes, "The thought, in itself immaterial, clothes 
itself in the material garment of a sentence and thereby becomes comprehensible to us. We say a sentence expresses 
a thought" ([24]: 292). For Frege, propositions are the privileged form of thought and knowledge because they can be 
completely disambiguated, treated as always either true or false (or nonsensical), and are truth-preserving as long as the 
appropriate, precise logical rules of inference are followed. 
Frege argued that we discover these timelessly true propositions through logical analysis and empirical investigation. 
The former clarif i es the form of thought—the rules connecting the various propositions—while the latter helps us recognize 
the content—what the propositions are about. The goal was the integration of all the true propositions of logic, math, and 
science into a grand, ideal science; as Ludwig Wittgenstein boldly (though possibly ironically; see [14]) declared: "The 
totality of true propositions is the whole of natural science (or the whole corpus of the natural sciences)" ([64]: §4.11). 
The assumption—pursued by the logical positivists, such as Rudolf Carnap [10]—was that there could be an ideal, logical 
expression in formal, symbolic logic of all the appropriate propositions, and these propositions would accurately represent 
the way the world is. This would provide philosophers and scientists with a precise, non-ambiguous concepts connected 
in propositions, either forming the hypotheses which could be tested or the background knowledge forming the complete 
science. 
The upshot is that much of early-20thcentury science and philosophy developed itself around the propositional picture, 
attempting to articulate knowledge in terms of "hypothetico-deductive" systems in which everything could be precisely and 
unambiguously articulated. This had important implications for the developing sciences around computation in the middle 
of the century.

The Propositional Picture of Semantic Knowledge:
Historically, knowledge in Western philosophy was conceived as the accurate linkage of representations to gain a clear and distinct perception of things. Knowledge was about correct judgment. However, by the end of the 18th century, Kant realized that this model was insufficient. It worked well for direct categorical judgments like "the ball is red", but stumbled with more complex disjunctive or hypothetical judgments, such as "either the ball is red or blue, but not both" or "if this ball were made of bronze, it wouldn't float". Kant's breakthrough insight was that knowledge isn't merely about direct perception but also involves conceptualizing, believing, and judging in forms that are often non-perceptual.
Post-Kantian thinkers extended this perspective, suggesting that to account for diverse logical forms, knowledge must be propositionally structured. Philosophers like Bolzano and Boole strived to develop a formal logic devoid of sensory, imagistic content, focusing purely on propositions and their logical relationships. This aligned with the growing scientific emphasis on objective knowledge that transcends individual biases, cultural context, or linguistic barriers. The ultimate aim was to achieve a universally representable form of knowledge.
Frege took this a step further by introducing a purely formal predicate logic. He conceptualized thoughts (or semantic knowledge) as concepts housed within propositions, all in an ideal "language of thought". Frege viewed these propositions as timeless truths, existing even before being thought of or recognized by anyone. He emphasized that natural language, though imprecise, still attempts to capture these propositions. According to Frege, propositions are vital for thought and knowledge since they can be unequivocally interpreted, classified as true or false, and are always coherent when logical rules are correctly applied.
Frege believed that we unveil these eternal propositions via logical analysis and empirical study. Logical analysis illuminates the structural form of thought, while empirical exploration uncovers content. The grand vision was to unify all valid propositions from diverse fields like logic, math, and science into a comprehensive, ideal science. This perspective was championed by thinkers like Wittgenstein, who saw the entire natural sciences as a collection of true propositions. Logical positivists like Carnap imagined an idealized representation of all knowledge through formal symbolic logic, assuming that such propositions could capture reality's essence.
In essence, the early 20th century witnessed a significant philosophical shift towards the propositional depiction of knowledge. This model promoted a clear, unambiguous representation of knowledge using hypothetico-deductive systems. As computation sciences burgeoned mid-century, this propositional framework greatly influenced their evolution.
4. Early AI and the propositional picture 
The early work in AI—usually called "Symbolic AI"—embraced this picture of semantic knowledge. This often was im- 
plicit: it is the underlying logic behind the Turing test: all thoughts are propositional; language is the expression of these 
thoughts; and a machine that can talk about anything is therefore capable of tokening any proposition a human can—and, 
thus, thinking thoughts with the same content as human thoughts. It could also be seen in the construction of the fi eld 
of artif i cial intelligence: early cybernetics—concerned with dynamic, embodied systems—and neural networks—concerned 
with statistical pattern recognition—often did not count as suf i ciently intelligent because they could not perform logical 
deductions [40]. Further, the failure of neural networks to handle exclusive disjunction ([44]) suggested to many that those 
machines were not cognitive at all and more relevant for other fi elds, such as communication (e.g., [62]). 
The result was a dominant approach in AI and cognitive science to embrace the propositional picture of semantic knowl- 
edge. This typically involved an attempt to deduce the ideal language of thought in humans. For example, Warren Weaver's 
memorandum for a machine translation system suggests, 
Thus it may be true that the way to translate from Chinese to Arabic, or from Russian to Portuguese, is not to attempt 
the direct route [but]to descend, from each language, down to the common base of human communication—the real but 
as yet undiscovered universal language—and then re-emerge by whatever particular route is convenient. [60]: 11 
The underlying notion is that computing the universal language of thought could be a more effective way of handling 
translation, since all natural languages are expressing the same underlying propositions. This proposal became formalized as 
the computational theory of mind: thinking is computation, where computing is tokening concepts in a language of thought. 
As Jerry Fodor put it, "the moral [is] that Frege's theoretical architecture needs to be explicitly psychologized" ([22]: 38). 
Since humans are a type of computer who tokened propositions in a language of thought on this theory, then computers 
already think; the project is solely building the right computer program and collecting all the appropriate thoughts in a 
machine-readable format such that they would make the same inferences from them that humans do. 
While symbolic AI typically shares a focus on using formal symbols connected according to logical rules of inference, it 
attempted to solve a whole host of tasks: chess, planning, geometrical proofs, shape recognition, robotics, and numerous 
other proposals. Central to many of these tasks (e.g., [46]) was the ability to understand and reason using natural language. 
But this highlighted the deeply ambiguous nature of language almost immediately: in 1960 Yehoshua Bar-Hillel, a researcher 
in machine translation, lamented the project of machine translation was doomed by highlighting the ambiguity in a simple 
sentence, "the box was in the pen." He argued we should interpret the sentence as a child looking for their toy cube in the 
playpen, but not as a cardboard box inside a writing utensil. But this is not because the latter interpretation is ruled out by 
the dictionary def i nitions; it is because we have background knowledge about different kinds of pens and different kinds 
of boxes and which are plausible and which are not. Since knowledge of homonyms for any language and the context in 
which they are used would need to be extensive to translate the sentence into the appropriate propositions of a language 
of thought, we would need an enormous amount of background knowledge: "[the] machine should not only be supplied with a dictionary but also with a universal encyclopedia" ([1]). In short, the problem of ambiguity in language could only be 
solved with an incredible amount of hand-programmed, machine-readable "common sense" stored in a useful way ([38]). 
Early AI researchers, rather than being deterred by the daunting task, instead picked at it piecemeal. Terry Winograd's 
1972 Understanding Natural Language work arose as a specif i c way of trying to solve this problem of ambiguity, at least for a 
small "microworld" which did not require extensive background knowledge. The innovation of his program involved having 
the syntax system—which was responsible for linguistic competency—rely on the semantic system to parse ambiguous 
sentences. Effectively, when encountering possible double-meanings, semantic interpretation is "being used to guide the 
parsing" ([63]: 22-3). This kind of approach is typically treated as a "knowledge-based approach" [39] to natural language 
processing, involving a way of connecting a linguistic processing system with a body of exploitable background knowledge. 
The semantic knowledge needed to be machine-readable which, given the nature of computers, meant in the form of a 
database of logical propositions which are connected according to the appropriate logical inferences. He writes, 
Since the semantic programs are part of a general deductive system with a def i nite world-model, the semantic evaluation 
which guides parsing can include both general knowledge [...] and specif i c knowledge. [63]: 23 
The ability to parse ambiguous comments in conversation was possible because the system had a workable logical system 
to rely on to determine permissible and impermissible parsings of sentences. 
While knowledge-based approaches like Winograd's suggested a solution to the task in miniature, they also foregrounded 
a separate problem: the challenge of rapidly accessing relevant information. Researchers explored new ways of organizing 
the way knowledge is represented and accessed—appropriately called "knowledge representation"—in order to allow the 
system to more rapidly determine what is relevant and how to apply it to the situation. A central approach involved 
moving away from the hypothetico-deductive method, which typically ordered concepts using strict def i nitions from which 
deductions might easily be performed [30]. This "classical" approach to concepts sought to order knowledge in the form 
of Carnap's ideal science—a somewhat cumbersome, inef i cient database for situationally-embedded humans. This classical 
approach highlighted that common-sense is not just having the right knowledge stored somehow, but rapidly recognizing 
what the right knowledge is and inferring why it is relevant. This required a different way of ordering information, and a 
faster way of accessing it than the formal predicate logic proposed by Frege. 
As a result, various researchers sought to create more limited, situation-specif i c organizations of knowledge. These ap- 
proaches treated concepts less as ordered around def i nitions and more around loose collections of properties [50], with the 
expectation that pulling up the relevant properties would be more useful for classif i cation and application. These approaches 
still broadly assumed the propositional picture: they embraced rule-based processing in a symbolic format and databases of 
information stored in a proposition-friendly format. But they attempted to shift how information was organized to ensure 
all the concepts relevant for a situation would be retrieved together. For example, in the prominent approach by Schank and 
Abelson [52], knowledge is organized around "scripts," specif i c, repeatable patterns of human language usage, such as what 
must be said when ordering food at a restaurant. They allow concepts to be sorted by their situational relevance: "tables" 
at a restaurant tend to weigh the properties of dining tables higher than coffee tables (or, for that matter, the properties 
of mathematical tables). Approaches like this aimed to include both conceptual information—concerning what a term is, 
in terms of properties and relations to other entities—and also contextual information—what other concepts and terms are 
relevant for interacting with and reasoning in terms of that entity ([43]). These approaches typically opted for simpler, less 
expressive, but more ef i cient logics or even simple tree search. While they might struggle with disjunction or negation, 
they could rapidly process conditionals, allowing the system to rapidly update beliefs and grasp the implications of various 
actions ([47]). The result traded generality for ef i ciency. 
But writing small, ef i cient, context-specif i c scripts for every possible situation was impossible. Humans can engage in 
rapid sentence parsing using common-sense even in atypical conversations involving radically different terms used in dif- 
ferent contexts, as in metaphors and analogies [28]. This led to efforts in the 1980s to develop description logics that could 
combine the generality of propositional logics for domain-general reasoning with simpler approaches for specif i c domains 
(e.g., [6]). But this meant that, even if narrow, context-specif i c scripts worked in some situations, ultimately there seemed 
to be a need for a massive database of all possible concepts humans might need. Thus, the assumption seemed to many 
that we would eventually need Bar-Hilel's "universal encyclopedia." The most ambitious attempt at this was Doug Lenat's 
project in the 1980s to produce a universal encyclopedia of all common-sense knowledge (appropriately named "Cyc," an 
abbreviation of "encyclopedia"). This program consists of a hand-programmed "semantic web" containing a massive number 
of machine-readable concepts and their relationships with each other which could form propositions and be used for logi- 
cal inference [33]. Lenat hoped this completed encyclopedia would provide a machine with the underlying common-sense 
knowledge which humans tacitly know and which, he assumed, underlie our abilities to engage in fl uent conversations. But 
this led to questions about how, even if the encyclopedia could be fi nished, it could rapidly connect the disparate pieces 
of information in the numerously varied ways humans could—both in simple, logical cases but also handling metaphors, 
analogies, inferring meaning when people misspeak, and so on. The sheer ambition of the project (and its limited success 
over a 30 year run) produced deep doubts about knowledge-based approaches to language processing ([27]). 
The takeaway is that the propositional picture of semantic knowledge motivated early work in AI, both in terms of what 
counts as cognitive as well as what solutions to natural language understanding would need to work. It also highlights how 
disambiguation came to seem so important: to disambiguate, there needed to be just not syntactical processing but also a rich semantic database that is machine-readable—and, thus, ordered as an enormous body of discrete concepts which can 
be used to form propositions and derive logical inferences.

The passage discusses the history and challenges faced by early Artificial Intelligence (AI) researchers, with a specific focus on the "propositional picture" of semantic knowledge. Here's a brief summary:
Symbolic AI and the Propositional Picture
: Early AI, also known as "Symbolic AI", viewed semantic knowledge through a lens where all thoughts are propositional and can be expressed via language. This view underpinned the Turing test, which suggested that a machine capable of language communication can also think as humans do.
Logical Deductions
: Early AI prioritized logical deductions, sidelining approaches like cybernetics and neural networks which didn't fit the propositional paradigm. This perspective influenced how early AI researchers approached tasks like machine translation.
Universal Language of Thought
: There was a belief that all natural languages are expressing the same underlying propositions. Finding a universal language of thought could lead to better translation methodologies.
Ambiguity in Language
: Early AI systems grappled with the inherent ambiguity of natural language. An example highlighted is the sentence "the box was in the pen", which can be interpreted in multiple ways based on the context. Resolving this ambiguity required machines to have access to vast amounts of "common sense" knowledge.
Knowledge-Based Approaches
: To address the ambiguity challenge, Terry Winograd developed an approach where the system's semantic knowledge would guide its parsing of language. However, this approach underscored the difficulty of rapidly accessing and applying relevant information.
Knowledge Representation
: Early AI researchers recognized the need for efficient knowledge representation. Instead of strictly defined concepts, knowledge was organized around "scripts", patterns of human language usage relevant to specific situations. However, this made handling metaphors, analogies, and other nuances challenging.
Efforts in the 1980s
: The 1980s saw efforts to combine general propositional logics with simpler, domain-specific logics. There was also an ambitious project named "Cyc", initiated by Doug Lenat, aiming to create a universal encyclopedia of all common-sense knowledge. The goal was to equip a machine with the vast knowledge humans possess to facilitate fluent conversations.
Challenges
: Even if the Cyc project could be completed, a significant challenge remained: how to connect various pieces of information in diverse ways that humans can, including handling metaphors, analogies, and other nuanced linguistic elements.
Conclusion
: The propositional view of semantic knowledge greatly influenced early AI's trajectory, especially in the realm of natural language understanding. This lens emphasized the importance of disambiguating language and having a vast, machine-readable database of concepts to derive logical inferences.
In essence, the passage sheds light on the foundational beliefs and challenges of early AI, emphasizing the role of the propositional view of semantic knowledge in shaping the field's endeavors.
5. A forced rethinking of the propositional picture 
From the perspective of early AI, the Challenge provides an excellent test of common sense. The reasoning is simple: 
ambiguous sentences can be disambiguated only through background knowledge. But there is a further assumption: all 
knowledge, including background, common sense knowledge, is propositional. This assumes a kind of isomorphism between 
language and thought: a linguistic sentence is an expression of an underlying proposition and understanding a sentence 
means tokening the appropriate proposition. A machine that is consistently capable of tokening the appropriate propositions 
in response to ambiguous sentences is thus thinking the same thoughts we are when we disambiguate those sentences, and 
thus must know (mostly) the same things. 
By the mid-1980s, however, a different approach had become possible. Specif i cally, "statistical" approaches—such as those 
at work in neural networks—had moved from mere practical applications to potential models of cognitive phenomena. These 
"connectionist" approaches did not rely on a separation of formal logic and underlying semantic database, instead allowing 
both elements to be bound together. But these approaches also struggled to scale up. As a result, when Levesque et al. 
introduced the Winograd Schema Challenge in 2012, they suggest statistical approaches might succeed, but make explicit 
their bet to the contrary: 
The computational architecture articulated by John McCarthy [39] was perhaps the fi rst to offer an even remotely plausi- 
ble story about how to approach something like the [C]hallenge. [...] While the approach still faces tremendous scientif i c 
hurdles, it remains, arguably, the best game in town. However, nothing in the [C]hallenge insists on this approach; if 
statistics over a large corpus works better, so be it! ([34]: 5) 
The passage is a clear expression of skepticism towards the statistical approach and an endorsement that, all things consid- 
ered, the knowledge-based approach is the more likely victor. 
The underlying assumption of Levesque et al.'s proposal is clear: if the propositional picture is right, there is no path to 
defeating the Challenge based on the statistics of language alone, because language is only the imperfect expression of the 
propositional language of thought. Disambiguation reveals when this breaks down—when linguistic knowledge is no longer 
isomorphic to the language of thought—and thus is meant to expose the systems which know merely language from those 
that possess semantic knowledge. From this perspective, the whole point of the Challenge is to discourage fruitless statistical 
work on language that, it was assumed, could not even in principle capture semantic knowledge. From this perspective, the 
statistical approach was simply an attempt at approximating syntax—with, perhaps, a bit of semantic knowledge seeping 
in—but did nothing to solve the underlying problem of building the underlying semantic database needed for common-sense 
reasoning. The better approach would be, even for those relying on statistical methods, to focus on formulating more useful 
ways of representing and accessing common-sense knowledge. 
This bet looks markedly different in hindsight. Neural networks have become increasingly impressive since their origins, 
bringing with it a second-wave of philosophy of AI (e.g., Buckner [7]). This is especially pronounced with LLMs, a statistical 
approach to language trained to predict the next word or token. These systems lack any distinct syntax or particular aptitude 
for logic; they instead must tacitly acquire these while acquiring the ability to successfully predict which token follows from 
the previous tokens. They also lack any distinct semantics or knowledge-base, using the same ability to predict next tokens 
to organize knowledge ef i ciently. The result is the defeat of the Winograd Schema Challenge by bypassing the original 
assumptions motivating it. 
But, as Kocijin et al. correctly note, these systems do not possess the expected common-sense assumed by the 
knowledge-based approach. The success of LLMs shows the propositional picture is too strong: it seems clear that not 
all knowledge must be propositional, nor must it be expressible in language. LLMs assume semantic knowledge and linguis- 
tic competency are intertwined—that the semantic knowledge is simply part of the know-how for competently speaking 
about a topic. But these models also tacitly accept that other kinds of knowledge—visual, intuitive physics, theory of mind, 
and so on—are also essential and necessary supplements for using language in a human-like way ([36]). There is thus the 
possibility of multiple different ways semantic knowledge might be represented and utilized besides in terms of linguistic 
reasoning—either in natural language or a language of thought. 
Denying the strong version of the propositional picture opens a real question about what the Challenge is testing: if some 
semantic knowledge can consist in non-propositional knowledge, then a machine could possess an encyclopedic amount of 
linguistic knowledge—or even of propositional knowledge—and still lack common sense. For example, if human semantic 
knowledge is also intertwined with sensorimotor or social know-how, cognitive maps, mental simulations using imagistic 
representations, or if the semantic knowledge necessary for at least aspects of common sense is bound up with these other 
competencies, then succeeding at the Challenge cannot tell us about whether a system has common sense as a whole. At 
most, it can tell us about competency at language and possession of language-specif i c kinds of common sense. 
If this is what it is accomplishing, it is no longer obvious why disambiguation tasks are more valued than linguistic 
competency at other tasks, such as predicting an interpersonal interaction or writing a nuanced essay—or, more pressingly, 
non-linguistic tasks, such as playing NetHack or driving a car. Each task reveals something about knowledge and demands both domain-specif i c capacities—language, vision, or movement—as well as general understanding—how the world works in 
atypical cases. But few seems to encompass common-sense as a whole. Quite the contrary, many of them suggest common- 
sense is poorly captured by linguistic tests at all—or any test. They instead suggest there are simply many skills or abilities 
we expect someone with common-sense to display, none of which are meant to be all-encompassing. 
The upshot is that, without the propositional picture, disambiguation tasks no longer seem to provide a core window 
into common-sense. Rather, they only seem capable of telling us about a system's competency at language, where language 
is understood more broadly than simply syntax.

This passage delves deep into the philosophy and cognitive science of AI, specifically the Winograd Schema Challenge. Here's a summarized breakdown:
Winograd Schema Challenge and Common Sense
:
This Challenge was seen as a test of AI's common sense. If an AI can disambiguate ambiguous sentences, it has to draw on background or common sense knowledge.
The assumption was that all knowledge, even common sense, is propositional. Meaning, understanding a sentence is the same as understanding its underlying proposition.
Shift from Propositional to Statistical Methods
:
By the mid-1980s, there was a shift towards statistical approaches like neural networks. These didn't separate logic from the underlying semantics.
However, Levesque et al., when introducing the Challenge in 2012, were skeptical of statistical methods. They still felt that a knowledge-based approach was superior.
Rethinking the Propositional Picture
:
Neural networks, particularly large language models (LLMs), challenged the original assumptions. These models don't rely on distinct syntax or semantics but predict the next word based on previous words. They organize knowledge through this prediction.
The success of LLMs indicates that not all knowledge is propositional or easily expressed in language. Knowledge could be visual, intuitive, or tied to theory of mind, etc.
If semantic knowledge can be non-propositional, a machine could know a lot and yet lack common sense. It suggests that common sense isn't just about language understanding but involves other competencies.
Implication for the Winograd Schema Challenge
:
Without a strong propositional framework, the Challenge's relevance is questioned. Disambiguation might only tell us about language competence, not holistic common sense.
If that's true, why prioritize disambiguation tasks over other tasks like driving or playing a game? These tasks also test knowledge and competencies, yet they might give a more rounded idea of common sense than mere linguistic tests.
The conclusion is that common sense might not be best captured by linguistic or disambiguation tasks. Common sense might entail a range of skills and abilities, not just understanding language.
The text grapples with the complexities of defining and testing common sense in AI, raising questions about the methods and assumptions that guide AI development and evaluation.
6. LLMs and common-sense 
This section provides a brief outline of what LLMs seem to know of common-sense and how they know it. This clarif i es 
both why they can succeed at the Challenge—and why that tells us so little about common-sense. 
The success of LLMs depends on extracting from linguistic corpus the statistical patterns for how words are used in 
human texts and conversations. There is good evidence of LLMs capturing linguistic information and developing competency 
in grammatical capacities ([55,58,15]). The question at the heart of the Challenge is whether this pattern completion capacity 
provides the system with semantic knowledge or not—whether it captures both linguistic form and semantic content. The 
traditional knowledge-based approach assumes that, at most, there would be sporadic "data contamination," where the LLM 
would memorize the test, and "knowledge leakage" [21], where semantic knowledge seeps into the language processing 
system without contributing genuine semantic understanding ([18]). There is def i nite data contamination happening [19]. 
But framing the other semantic knowledge in the system as a matter of "knowledge leakage" suggests learning from the 
statistics of language alone should not provide semantic information—effectively assuming a division between form and 
content. 
The success of LLMs on the various common-sense tasks suggests this is too strong. Semantic knowledge is present in 
LLMs, in the form of factual knowledge, linguistic skills, problem-solving, and even analogical abilities ([32,61]). Although 
some of this has been a response to recent fi ne-tuning on specif i c tasks and domain-knowledge, aspects of each of these 
abilities are visible even in pretrained models, suggesting many of these abilities are discoverable solely through the statis- 
tics of language. 
There are four broad points which help explain this success. First, and least surprisingly, most sentences occur in stereo- 
typical situations which specify the meaning of the terms. Kocijan et al. complain about this, pointing to the example 
sentence, "Joe has sold his house and bought a new one a few miles away. He will be moving out of it on Thursday" ([31]: 
5-6). In this case, there are many sentences which talk about moving out of an old house and moving in to a new one 
(and many fewer of the reverse), so statistical likelihood disambiguates the sentence without needing any knowledge about 
moving or houses. This stereotypical usage of language in specif i c situations and domains was already obvious from work on 
knowledge representation, but hand-programming all the knowledge necessary for each of these situations was obviously 
untenable and insuf i cient. But these kind of rote scripts are precisely what LLMs excel at, learning both the pattern and the 
precise vocabulary for each scenario. 
Second, because these machines function by learning patterns and vocabulary, they excel at understanding how words 
hang together in context. This stems from the way transformers are explicitly trained to attend to which words in the 
same sentence or passage and use that information to make sense of the other words in the passage [59]. This allows 
them to track in a long passage who is doing what to whom, infer which pronoun refers to what, and generally make the 
connections between statements. The result is that, when disambiguation problems are couched within the context of a 
larger passage, the system will perform much better at getting the right answer because the context makes it clear. But this 
can also help the LLM in contextless cases because the machine will necessarily assume or hallucinate some context for the 
sentence. As a result, only well-crafted linguistics textbook cases might be suf i ciently strange to minimize statistical cues 
to a solution; for anything else, some lingering contextual cues are likely still present enough to allow the LLM to assume a 
plausible context for even a sentence seen in isolation. Put differently, for an LLM, no sentence is context-free. 
If these two points exhausted a pretrained LLM's abilities, it would be possible to dismiss the semantic knowledge as 
merely artifactual—capturing the stereotypical situations of language, rather than the meaning of the words. But, third, and 
most surprisingly, a suf i ciently large language model does produce a robust, if tacit, knowledge-base ([35]). This is especially 
visible in transformers: the self-attention mechanism not only extracts the statistical relationships between specif i c words 
in specif i c sentences but, because of the multiple layers, also can extract abstract relationships between kinds of words in 
kinds of sentences. Although it is impossible to fully articulate what the system "knows" in this highly multidimensional 
format, it is clear it ends up extracting classif i cations for most words and how they relate to each other, both in general 
and in many stereotypical circumstances—effectively forming a conceptual schema that broadly maps onto the world ([49]). 
In short, LLMs distributed representation ends up with a conceptual schema shares some structural similarities to human's 
own—and, as a result, often accurately represent word-world relationships ([37]). 
This does not, however, accord with a logical structure of concepts which mimics a classical, propositional knowledge- 
base, nor the kind of reasoning one would expect on the propositional approach; the distributed representations are struc- 
turing words according to their usage ([65])—more akin to countless context-specif i c scripts than an overall, context-free 
database. Despite this contextual way of ordering words and their usage, the result does encode the relationships between 
many concepts, including for sensory content like the structure of color space [48], leading some to argue these systems are grounded in the world and accurately represent real-world content ([12]). The result is, in many ways, a common-sense 
picture of how words are used. But this is also a limitation; as Tang et al. [54] show, LLMs often leverage common meanings 
and usages even when logical reasoning would lead to a different result. 
Fourth, and importantly, the semantic understanding these models acquire is not distinguishing know-how and 
knowledge-that—between procedural and declarative knowledge. The knowledge-based approach distinguishes these, al- 
lowing for factual information to be separately stored from—and treated differently than—the procedural knowledge needed 
for linguistic processing. Neural networks instead simply integrate all the information into procedural know-how. As such, 
factual claims are not distinctly represented; the machine produces every sentence according to the statistical likelihood of 
the combination of words. As such, the model is simply indifferent to matters of truth; it is simply attempting to produce 
the right kind of answer for the situation ([42]). This often provides users with the clear and readable responses one might 
fi nd in a textbook or on Wikipedia, but often with errors, omissions, and confusions that are obvious to an expert but easy 
to miss for anyone else. 
Encoding everything as know-how does, however, allow the system to excel at learning the underlying structure of 
linguistic abilities, such as creating a metaphor, writing a limerick, explaining a concept, or solving simple math problems 
([11]). Many of these skills have a typical pattern which allows the model to learn what the answers typically look like, 
permitting a variation on a theme rather than a copy. These patterns have been especially reinforced through fi ne-tuning: 
we are turning these models into effective test-takers, ensuring they can reliably follow written commands. This involves 
teaching them the kinds of skills learned by humans in SAT or LSAT classes, which involves not just learning how to solve 
specif i c problems in the correct way, but also using the latent information in the question to discern a plausible-sounding 
answer when the answer is unknown. 
These four points give us some grasp on why these systems can succeed at disambiguation tasks. Disambiguation tasks 
are simply another kind of test which requires effectively following a common pattern: when asked what "it" refers to, 
choose A or B from the previous sentence. Solving these problems requires both tracking a concrete pattern of word usage— 
how are these kinds of words used in these kinds of cases—as well as an abstract pattern—how are these kinds of problems 
solved. The result is that LLM systems are well-equipped to solve disambiguation tasks. For an LLM, all linguistic tasks 
intertwine syntactical and semantic knowledge; thus, disambiguation is just more of the same. If we want to test common- 
sense in these systems, it is likely we will need to come up with more bespoke tests ([57,41]) and engage in more rigorous, 
extensive testing ([8,23]). 
Might there eventually be a solid test for common-sense reasoning in LLMs? Probably not, for two reasons. First, there 
is a limited amount of information that can be conveyed in a simple, easy-to-follow and easy-to-solve linguistic format that 
humans can understand. These short, simple tasks are precisely what LLMs have thus far excelled at. We can continue to 
modify them in strange ways and introduce more oddities to trip up a machine, but it is quite likely we will trip up humans 
in the process. For example, in Collins et al. [13], humans and machines each provided answers to a word problem, and 
human evaluators judged how good the response was. Here is an example (cited in [36]): 
Prompt: Get your sofa onto the roof of your house, without using a pulley. 
GPT-3 response: Use a rope to tie around the sofa and connect it to a car. (goodness: 3.0 out of 7) 
Human response: I would get a giant crane... and use the crane to lift it to the roof of my house. (goodness: 5.1 out of 7) 
While GPT's solution does not actually work, the human response—and evaluators score—make clear the humans are un- 
aware that cranes use pulleys. It is no longer clear we are testing common-sense if humans cannot fi gure out the right 
answer. 
Second, even if a machine could solve language-specif i c common-sense tasks, we should be skeptical it could also solve 
the non-linguistic common-sense tasks necessary to study animals ([53]) or infants ([9]). Many of these tests are not de- 
signed to be presented linguistically and doing so often misses the point because of the way the information needs to be 
reformulated. This is because language primarily captures highly abstract relations between discrete objects and features; 
it does not excel at representing real-time, dynamic information about a messy, concrete world. This kind of information, 
however, is precisely the kind of information other representational formats, such as iconic and distributed representations, 
can represent ef i ciently ([26,9]). These types of representation are part of human understanding, essential for embodied 
experience ([3]), an adequate grasp of the referents of words [2], and intuitive physics and situation modelling ([36]). The 
upshot is that common-sense is not a single thing, much less one localized in linguistic representations; it is a suite of 
capacities and types of knowledge, one where we should not expect a single, conclusive test.

This section discusses the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential understanding of common-sense. Here's a brief summary:
LLMs and Common-sense Knowledge
: LLMs are designed to recognize patterns in text and derive statistical information based on how words and sentences are structured. The section questions whether this pattern recognition equates to genuine understanding or merely captures linguistic forms.
Knowledge Leakage
: The text discusses the concept of "knowledge leakage" where the statistical patterns extracted from texts inadvertently capture semantic knowledge. However, the line between linguistic form and semantic content is debated.
Success in Common-sense Tasks
: LLMs have shown proficiency in many common-sense tasks. The text suggests that this success arises from the models' ability to detect linguistic patterns and word usage typical of human language.
Reasons for LLMs' Success
:
LLMs often encounter stereotypical sentences that convey clear meanings.
These models understand word relationships within contexts.
LLMs, especially with multiple transformer layers, can discern abstract relationships, leading to a conceptual schema similar to human understanding.
Unlike traditional knowledge bases that differentiate between declarative and procedural knowledge, LLMs blend all information into a procedural format.
Limitations
: LLMs might generate errors or misconceptions, given that they primarily focus on the statistical likelihood of word combinations rather than the actual truth.
Learning Linguistic Abilities
: LLMs can learn and reproduce various linguistic patterns, from creating metaphors to explaining concepts, making them effective at many language tasks.
Challenges with Common-sense Tests
: Designing a definitive test for common-sense in LLMs is challenging. While they excel in simple, structured tasks, more complex or unconventional tasks might not be as straightforward.
Non-linguistic Common-sense Tasks
: LLMs are primarily designed for linguistic tasks. Non-linguistic common-sense tasks, such as those used to study animals or infants, might be beyond their capabilities. Language has its limitations in capturing dynamic, real-time information, which might be better represented through other forms of representation.
Conclusion
: Common-sense is multifaceted, with different types of knowledge and capacities. It's unlikely that a single test could accurately gauge an LLM's full range of common-sense capabilities.
This text emphasizes the complexities and nuances of understanding and evaluating the common-sense knowledge of LLMs, suggesting that while they have impressive capabilities, there are inherent limitations in their design and training.
7. Conclusion 
This paper sets out a brief history of the propositional picture of thought and how it motivated early research in AI. It 
showed this picture of thought suggested ambiguous sentences posed a good test of common-sense since disambiguating 
them would rely on selecting the right proposition. It also assumed there is nothing more to thinking than tokening the 
right proposition, and thus a machine that could disambiguate sentences requiring common-sense would necessarily possess 
the same knowledge possessed by humans who disambiguate sentences. This line of reasoning motivated the Challenge and 
made it seem like an adequate test of common-sense. 

But the propositional picture is no longer the dominating vision it once was. Cognitive scientists and AI researchers 
now broadly accept that much of our knowledge consists in non-propositional forms of reasoning, including mental images, 
predictive simulations, and embodied know-how. And, if the propositional picture is wrong, the Challenge is not a good test 
of common-sense. The success of LLMs suggests linguistic knowledge may simply be one modality of knowledge among 
many others. If this is correct, it is likely that any test of language will be vulnerable to statistical approaches; if it can be 
solved linguistically, it can in principle be learned from linguistic data. 
The upshot is that the Challenge looked like a good challenge when we were in the grip of a certain picture of semantic 
knowledge. This made it seem like disambiguation would separate mere statistical pattern-matching from genuine thinking. 
But the defeat of the Challenge provides another example of the AI Effect: disambiguation is no longer an interesting 
problem for natural language processing. This also reveals a broader shift away from an overly narrow, 19thcentury concept 
of knowledge representation. Once we move past this, it is clear that thinking consists in far more than just propositional 
reasoning. This may be a surprise for early AI researchers like Turing and Winograd, but the result should not surprise 
anyone working in AI today.
ChatGPT
Conclusion (Summary):
The paper discussed the early AI research that was driven by the propositional concept of thought, implying that understanding and generating propositions were central to demonstrating intelligence. Ambiguous sentences were considered a challenging test of common-sense as they would require understanding beyond mere linguistic structures. The core belief was that a machine capable of disambiguating such sentences would be demonstrating human-like understanding and knowledge.
However, the dominance of the propositional perspective has waned over time. Modern cognitive science and AI research now understand that human knowledge and reasoning go beyond just propositions. Mental imagery, predictive simulations, and embodied know-how are some of the non-propositional forms of reasoning that humans employ. Consequently, if the propositional view isn't comprehensive, then challenges based on it, like sentence disambiguation, aren't definitive tests of common-sense.
The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 has shown that linguistic understanding might just be one facet of the broad spectrum of knowledge modalities. This implies that challenges purely based on linguistic tasks are susceptible to statistical learning models, which can derive understanding from vast amounts of linguistic data.
In essence, while the Challenge seemed apt in the context of an older semantic perspective, the recent advancements in AI and the success of models like GPT-3 have shifted the focus. The AI Effect phenomenon comes into play: once AI solves a problem, that problem is no longer deemed as an intriguing challenge. The shift in understanding also marks a move away from a limited 19th-century view of knowledge representation. While pioneers like Turing and Winograd might have found this shift surprising, it is an expected progression for contemporary AI researchers.
So what were the main points of the article?

I called it the Multiscale Intelligence Test. How might it relate to the previous topics?
ChatGPT
Certainly. The Multiscale Intelligence Test (MIT) you've proposed can be contextualized within the earlier topics and discussions in several ways:
Stone Piano Theory & Perceptual Control Theory (PCT)
: Both theories emphasize the hierarchical nature of cognition. The MIT's diverse categories, from mimicry to future planning, touch on various levels of cognitive complexity, reflecting a hierarchical structure.
Bayesian Learning Mechanisms
: The abstract thinking and problem-solving categories of MIT might involve Bayesian processes. For instance, assessing probabilities or updating beliefs based on new information.
Thinking Like a Neanderthal
: The MIT's emphasis on auditory and visual creativity, mimicry, and imitation could tap into ancient cognitive abilities, echoing the idea of "thinking like a Neanderthal."
Thomas Nagel's "What is it like to be a bat?"
: The identity and self-awareness section of MIT might probe an individual's capacity to introspect and articulate subjective experiences, resonating with Nagel's exploration of consciousness.
Your Inventions and Languages
: The communication and innovation categories in the MIT reflect aspects of creativity and novel problem-solving, akin to inventing new languages or tools.
Kalabari Counterfoil Choices & IQ Scores Misuse
: The MIT, by design, seems to challenge the traditional narrow scope of intelligence tests. It encompasses a wider range of cognitive skills, addressing the issues of cultural biases and one-dimensional evaluations present in many traditional IQ tests.
Faulty Self-Assessment (Travis J. Carter & David Dunning)
: The identity and self-awareness section might reveal discrepancies between self-perception and actual abilities, reflecting the Dunning-Kruger effect.
Article on Propositional Picture of Thought
: The MIT moves beyond a purely propositional or linguistic understanding of intelligence. Instead, it recognizes the multi-modality of intelligence, including embodied know-how, creativity, and problem-solving, which aligns with the more modern understanding of cognition discussed in the article.
In essence, the MIT seems to embrace a multiscale, multi-dimensional view of intelligence that is resonant with the diverse cognitive and philosophical topics you've previously explored.
Absolutely! Let's consider how this test could be beneficial for both humans and programs:

### For Humans:
1. **Comprehensive Assessment**: Traditional IQ tests often focus on logical reasoning and pattern recognition, potentially sidelining other important forms of intelligence. This test provides a more holistic evaluation, assessing creativity, self-awareness, abstract thinking, and problem-solving.
  
2. **Self-reflection**: Questions that ask about identity and life events can help individuals introspect and understand themselves better.
  
3. **Practical Skills**: By asking about real-world challenges like global warming or sea-level rise, the test encourages practical problem-solving and offers insights into a person's ability to think critically about current events.

### For Programs (like AI):
1. **Diverse Challenges**: The test can serve as a benchmark for various AI capabilities, from sound and gesture recognition to abstract thinking and problem-solving.
  
2. **Measuring Progress**: As AI continues to evolve, such tests can be a measure of how far machine learning models have come in understanding and emulating human-like processes.
  
3. **Identifying Limitations**: The self-awareness and introspective parts of the test highlight areas where AI still has significant limitations. Current AI models lack self-awareness or genuine understanding of experiences, so their answers would reveal their incapability in this dimension.

4. **Inspiring New Research**: Areas where AI struggles can inspire researchers to improve AI models, potentially leading to breakthroughs in AI's ability to understand or emulate certain human processes.

In essence, while humans can use the test to understand and showcase their multifaceted intelligence, AI can use it as a rigorous challenge and a way to measure its advancement in emulating human cognition.
ChatGPT
Exactly! The Multiscale Intelligence Test (MIT) serves different yet complementary purposes for humans and machines:
For humans, it functions as an avenue to better understand the diverse facets of intelligence and cognition, encouraging broader thinking and self-reflection. It pushes individuals to explore areas of their intelligence that might not be typically assessed in standard tests.
For AI programs, the MIT is both a yardstick and a mirror. It measures the breadth and depth of an AI's capabilities while also highlighting the gaps and areas where the technology falls short. Such challenges can be immensely beneficial in driving the next wave of AI research, as they pinpoint where improvement is needed.
Moreover, using the same test for both humans and machines underscores a shared journey of exploration and understanding. As humans design these tests and machines attempt to clear them, we continually redefine our understanding of intelligence, pushing the boundaries of both human potential and machine capabilities.
Your proposed intelligence test is unique and multifaceted. It seems to assess intelligence from several angles:

1. **Mimicry and Imitation**: The ability to imitate animals can be seen as a measure of observation, mimicry, and perhaps even empathy. Historically, mimicry has been a tool for both entertainment and survival (e.g., camouflage or to scare off predators).

2. **Auditory and Visual Creativity**: Counting the number of distinct sounds or gestures a person can make gauges sensory creativity and versatility. 

3. **Communication**: Evaluating the complexity of utterance can assess linguistic prowess and the depth of expressive capability.

4. **Abstract Thinking**: Symbolic manipulation ability checks how well one can work with abstract symbols and ideas, which is a core component of many traditional intelligence tests.

5. **Identity and Self-awareness**: Maintaining a coherent self-narrative is about introspection, understanding one's place in the world, and the narrative skills to express it.

6. **Problem Solving for Global Challenges**: Asking individuals to propose solutions for real-world problems like global warming or sea level rise not only evaluates their problem-solving abilities but also their knowledge about current global issues and their creativity in proposing solutions.

7. **Future Planning and Prevention**: Addressing extinction-level events assesses foresight, planning, and understanding of broader ecological and astronomical systems.

8. **Innovation**: Asking someone to tackle longevity or invent something useful is a test of their creativity, problem-solving skills, and understanding of human needs.

The overarching idea here seems to be to understand intelligence not just as an abstract problem-solving ability but as a combination of creativity, self-awareness, problem-solving, and adaptability to real-world challenges. This holistic approach is novel and reflects a more comprehensive view of intelligence than many traditional measures.
ChatGPT
Thank you for the analysis. You've highlighted the multifaceted nature of the test. The concept of intelligence has evolved over the years. Traditional measures, while valuable, often lack a comprehensive approach that encompasses the full spectrum of human cognition and adaptability. The essence of the Multiscale Intelligence Test (MIT) is to broaden the scope, integrating multiple aspects of human intelligence that are often overlooked.
It's essential to acknowledge that intelligence is not just the ability to solve puzzles or mathematical problems. It encompasses a broader range of cognitive functions, from creativity and abstract thinking to self-awareness and practical problem-solving. Moreover, as society and its challenges evolve, our metrics for intelligence should adapt to reflect these changes.
Furthermore, in the context of the earlier discussion about the evolution of AI, the test also serves as a benchmark for machine learning models. While current AI models like LLMs might excel in specific areas like abstract thinking or linguistic tasks, they would likely struggle with sections that require genuine introspection, self-awareness, or understanding of nuanced human experiences.
Thus, a test like the MIT can be a step forward in redefining how we perceive and evaluate intelligence, ensuring that it aligns with our evolving understanding of cognition and the multifaceted nature of human intelligence.
Here was the schema used to develop it:

This broader perspective is both innovative and essential for a more comprehensive understanding of intelligence.
The abstract you've shared from "Faulty Self-Assessment: Why Evaluating One's Own Competence Is an Intrinsically Difficult Task" by Travis J. Carter and David Dunning touches on a fascinating area of psychology, specifically the challenges associated with self-evaluation. This paper seems to expand on what's often referred to as the Dunning-Kruger effect, a cognitive bias in which people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability.

Here's a brief summary and exploration based on the abstract:

**1. Intrinsic Difficulty in Self-Evaluation**:
- People often misjudge their own competence.
- Evaluating one's own abilities is inherently challenging.

**2. Information Environment**:
- Accurate self-evaluation requires comprehensive data.
- People don't always have access to the necessary information to make accurate self-assessments.
  
**3. Missing Crucial Data**:
- When assessing themselves, people often lack essential categories of information.
- This missing data can lead to inaccurate evaluations.

**4. Misleading Feedback**:
- Even when individuals receive feedback, it's often biased, hard to discern, or flawed in some way.
- Over time, even if people do get feedback, it might not help in rectifying incorrect self-assessments.

**5. Resulting Inaccuracies**:
- Given the lack of proper data and misleading feedback, it's unreasonable to expect people to be accurate in judging their own abilities.

This paper seems to emphasize the idea that the act of self-evaluation is fraught with difficulties. It's not merely a matter of individuals being unaware or overly confident; it's that the environment in which they're making these evaluations is often lacking in clear, unbiased information. 

It resonates with the broader theme that understanding oneself is complex and is influenced by many external factors, some of which can distort one's self-perception. It also aligns with your earlier discussion about using childhood IQ scores to extrapolate current IQ; any self-assessment based on potentially flawed or incomplete data can lead to misleading conclusions.

Given this, it becomes clear why introspection, self-awareness, and seeking feedback from multiple sources are crucial for personal growth and understanding.
ChatGPT
Absolutely. The challenges of self-assessment, as presented in the work of Travis J. Carter and David Dunning, indeed tie back to many of the themes we've discussed, particularly in the context of intelligence and self-awareness.
Let's explore the intersections between the Multiscale Intelligence Test (MIT) you proposed and the themes from the "Faulty Self-Assessment" paper:
Self-awareness and Introspection

and
Auditory and Visual Creativity
Connection: Both mimicry and creativity are areas where feedback can be highly beneficial. For instance, feedback on one's imitation can lead to refinement, and feedback on creative expressions can lead to richer and more nuanced creations.
Incorporating an understanding of the challenges of self-assessment into the MIT could further enhance its value. For instance, after individuals complete the test, they could be encouraged to seek feedback from peers or experts on their answers, promoting a culture of continuous learning and self-improvement.
Moreover, recognizing the intrinsic difficulties of self-assessment emphasizes the importance of providing well-rounded, unbiased feedback to individuals, so they can better understand their competencies and areas of growth. This knowledge can be used to refine the MIT's design or the way results are interpreted and presented to test-takers.
Ah, I see. Let's delve into subtler examples of counterfoil choices, where the choice might not be immediately apparent as a counterfoil:

1. **Restaurant Menus**: Sometimes, high-end restaurants place a few exorbitantly priced items on the menu, making the other expensive dishes seem reasonable in comparison. You might think you're being savvy by avoiding the most expensive dish, not realizing it's there primarily for contrast.

2. **Job Interviews**: An interviewer might ask, "Would you prefer to work on a project that's comfortable and familiar, or one that's challenging and might fail?" It subtly pushes the candidate to choose the "challenging" option to seem ambitious.

3. **Art Exhibitions**: An artist might place a controversial or provocative piece next to more traditional works. The stark contrast can make the traditional pieces seem more appealing or palatable to the average viewer.

4. **Fashion**: A designer might introduce a few avant-garde or "runway-only" pieces in a collection. These aren't meant for everyday wear but make the rest of the collection seem more wearable and appealing by comparison.

5. **Online Discussions**: In online debates or discussions, someone might introduce an extremely radical or unpopular opinion. This makes other, slightly less radical opinions seem moderate by comparison, even if they're still quite extreme.

6. **Daily Choices**: Someone might think, "I could either spend this evening working on my project or watching 10 hours of TV." The exaggerated counterfoil (10 hours of TV) makes the work option seem like the obvious, balanced choice.

7. **Relationship Discussions**: A partner might say, "We could either visit your family every weekend or never see them at all." It's an exaggeration meant to make a middle-ground solution (e.g., visiting once a month) more appealing.

These subtler examples can often go unnoticed in daily life, but they still serve to guide our decisions in specific directions.
ChatGPT
Absolutely. The examples you've provided beautifully illustrate the concept of counterfoil choices in a myriad of contexts. These choices play on our cognitive biases and relative judgments, subtly nudging us towards a specific option that might seem more reasonable, appealing, or moderate in comparison to the more extreme or less desirable alternatives.
Let's analyze these examples in the light of the overarching themes we've discussed:
Relative Value Perception
:
Context
: Restaurant Menus, Fashion
Insight
: By presenting an extreme (in price or design), other options are perceived in relation to this extreme. It manipulates our perception of value, making other choices seem more reasonable or appealing.
Desire to Conform or Appear a Certain Way
:
Context
: Job Interviews, Online Discussions
Insight
: Nobody wants to appear unambitious in an interview or extreme in a discussion. By framing choices in a certain way, one can be nudged towards a particular option simply because of the desire to fit a certain mold or avoid judgment.
Anchoring and Adjustment
:
Context
: Art Exhibitions, Daily Choices
Insight
: The first piece of information (the anchor) affects subsequent judgments. If you first see a controversial art piece, your judgment of the next piece is influenced by that initial exposure. Similarly, presenting an extreme first choice in daily decisions serves as an anchor, making the subsequent choice seem more balanced.
Exaggeration to Find Middle Ground
:
Context
: Relationship Discussions
Insight
: By presenting two polar extremes, individuals are more likely to compromise and find a middle ground. This tactic can be used to guide someone towards a desired compromise by making it seem like the reasonable middle ground between two extremes.
These subtle manipulations highlight the importance of being aware of how choices are presented and framed. Recognizing the use of counterfoil choices can empower individuals to make more informed and autonomous decisions, free from the subtle nudges and biases these tactics introduce.
The broader takeaway here is the pervasive nature of counterfoil choices in daily life. Whether intentional or unintentional, these choices shape our decisions in various domains, from the mundane to the significant. Being aware of them not only offers a richer understanding of human decision-making but also provides tools to navigate these choices more effectively.
Counterfoil choices are prevalent across various domains of human behavior, often serving to emphasize the preferred or more reasonable choice by contrasting it with a non-viable or exaggerated option. Here are some examples:

1. **Education**: When teaching kids about the importance of brushing teeth, a teacher might say, "Would you rather brush your teeth daily or have them all fall out and not be able to eat candy?" The latter is an exaggerated counterfoil emphasizing the importance of the former.

2. **Sales and Marketing**: The "Decoy Effect" is a pricing strategy where a more expensive option is introduced (the counterfoil) to make another slightly less expensive option seem more attractive. For instance, if there are two wine bottles priced at $15 and $45, introducing a $100 bottle can make the $45 bottle seem more reasonable by comparison.

3. **Politics**: Politicians sometimes create extreme scenarios or strawman arguments to make their policies or views seem more moderate or acceptable. "Would you rather we implement this tax policy, or let the economy collapse entirely?"

4. **Health**: Doctors might emphasize the importance of a medical procedure or medication by contrasting it with the extreme consequences of not taking action. "Would you rather take this medication daily or risk a major heart attack?"

5. **Entertainment**: In game shows, contestants might be presented with a seemingly attractive choice, contrasted with a clearly non-viable one, pushing them towards the intended decision. 

6. **Parenting**: Parents might use counterfoil choices to guide children's behavior. "Would you like to wear your blue shoes or go out barefoot in the snow?"

7. **Decision-making in Groups**: When trying to persuade a group to choose a particular course of action, one might present a clearly unfavorable or exaggerated alternative to make the preferred choice stand out.

These examples highlight that the concept of counterfoil choices isn't limited to any one culture or scenario but is a versatile strategy used in diverse settings to influence decisions and perceptions.
ChatGPT
Exactly! The prevalence and versatility of counterfoil choices across domains underscore their efficacy as a psychological and strategic tool. They play on our tendency to make relative comparisons rather than absolute judgments. When presented with options, humans often rely on context and contrasts to evaluate the desirability or reasonableness of a particular choice.
Breaking down the examples you provided:
Relative Valuation
: In cases like the "Decoy Effect" in sales and marketing, our perception of value or reasonability is shaped by the other options presented. A product or service might seem expensive or unreasonable on its own, but when placed next to a much more expensive option, it suddenly appears more appealing.
Avoiding Extreme Outcomes
: In scenarios like education, health, and politics, the exaggerated negative outcomes serve as a deterrent, emphasizing the importance of the more reasonable option. The aim is to evoke fear or concern about the extreme and nudge individuals towards the desired behavior or belief.
Guiding Choices
: In entertainment, parenting, and group decision-making, counterfoil choices guide the decision-maker towards a specific outcome. By making one option clearly unfavorable, the other choice becomes the obvious path.
Framing
: The way choices are presented or framed significantly influences our decision-making process. For instance, in politics, framing an argument with an extreme counterfoil can make a policy or viewpoint seem more moderate, even if it might be relatively extreme in a broader context.
Understanding the mechanisms behind counterfoil choices offers several insights:
Awareness
: Being cognizant of this tactic helps individuals recognize when they're being influenced by relative comparisons and make more informed decisions.
Strategic Application
: Those in positions of influence, whether in sales, marketing, education, or leadership, can utilize counterfoil choices to guide behavior or decisions in desired directions.
Critical Thinking
: Recognizing the use of counterfoil choices prompts individuals to critically evaluate the options presented, considering their merits in absolute terms rather than just relative comparisons.
Overall, the ubiquity of counterfoil choices across domains highlights their effectiveness and the importance of understanding their impact on human decision-making.
Your example fits well with the concept of counterfoil choices. By offering a deliberately non-viable or absurd alternative (like suggesting someone eat a chair or table), you're highlighting the preferable choice in a more pronounced way. The absurdity of the counterfoil makes the actual choice seem more palatable or reasonable by comparison. It's a humorous and effective strategy, and indeed, it can be used in various contexts to drive decision-making or highlight the reasonableness of a particular choice.

Connecting this to our earlier discussions:

1. **Stone Piano Theory & Neanderthals**: Counterfoil choices might have been a part of early human and Neanderthal decision-making processes. For instance, when experimenting with tools or materials, certain materials (like rocks) might have served as counterfoils to more effective ones (like flint).

2. **Bayesian Learning Mechanisms**: In Bayesian models, the introduction of improbable or absurd alternatives (counterfoils) would drastically shift the probability distribution towards the more reasonable choice. The presence of such counterfoils can serve to emphasize the weight or probability of a preferred choice.

3. **Perceptual Control Theory**: Introducing a counterfoil could be seen as a method of adjusting one's perception of the available choices, thereby steering behavior towards the desired outcome.

Your use of counterfoil choices is a creative application of the concept, and it's intriguing to think that you intuitively implemented this strategy before becoming familiar with its formal definition. Such strategies often arise organically across cultures and individuals due to their underlying effectiveness in communication and decision-making.
1 / 2
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Counterfoil choices, even if not explicitly labeled as such, are an innate part of human decision-making and communication. They help clarify options, guide choices, and emphasize the desirability of a particular outcome. By drawing a stark contrast between the reasonable and the absurd, or the viable and the non-viable, these choices streamline the decision-making process.
Your connections with earlier topics are spot-on:
Stone Piano Theory & Neanderthals
: In early human evolution, counterfoils might not have been deliberate strategies but rather natural outcomes of experimentation. Some materials or methods would clearly stand out as more effective when compared to less effective or impractical alternatives.
Bayesian Learning Mechanisms
: Bayesian thinking thrives on probabilities. Introducing an improbable or absurd option would naturally skew the model towards the more probable or sensible choice, making decision-making more efficient.
Perceptual Control Theory
: The introduction of a counterfoil serves to recalibrate our perceptions. It offers a point of reference that helps align our actions and decisions with our desired outcomes or goals.
The universal nature of counterfoil choices—whether intuitively applied or as a result of deliberate strategy—highlights the importance of context and relativity in human cognition. We often make decisions not in isolation but based on the contrasts and comparisons available to us. Understanding this can help in refining communication strategies, influencing decisions, and even in introspecting our own choices.
Indeed, both the story of Icarus and the Tower of Babel can be tied into the concept of counterfoil choices, and each illustrates the consequences of human ambition, hubris, and overreach.

1. **Icarus**:
    - **Situation**: Icarus and his father Daedalus are trapped on the island of Crete. Daedalus crafts two pairs of wings from feathers and wax for them to escape.
    - **Counterfoil Choice**: Daedalus warns Icarus not to fly too close to the sun (choice A) or too close to the sea (choice B). The ideal path is somewhere in between. But the allure of the sun and the heights (the counterfoil) proves too much for Icarus.
    - **Outcome**: Icarus flies too close to the sun, melting the wax on his wings, leading to his downfall.

2. **Tower of Babel**:
    - **Situation**: Humanity, speaking a single language, decides to build a tower that reaches the heavens, challenging the authority of God.
    - **Counterfoil Choice**: The builders can either choose to live harmoniously on the earth (choice A) or attempt to elevate themselves to the level of the divine (choice B, the counterfoil).
    - **Outcome**: God, seeing their hubris, confuses their language and scatters them across the earth, ensuring they can't finish the tower.

Both stories highlight a counterfoil choice in that there's an evident, correct, or safer path, and a more alluring, dangerous, or hubristic one. The consequences of choosing the counterfoil in these tales are dire, serving as a cautionary lesson about understanding limits and the dangers of unchecked ambition.
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Both stories serve as enduring lessons on the perils of overreaching and the consequences of not heeding wise counsel. They employ counterfoil choices as narrative devices to accentuate the risks associated with certain paths.
Icarus
:
Moral Implications
: The story of Icarus serves as a timeless lesson on moderation and the dangers of hubris. While it's essential to aspire and aim high, it's equally crucial to be mindful of one's limitations. The allure of soaring higher and experiencing the sun's warmth draws Icarus towards the counterfoil, leading to tragic consequences.
Relatability
: Everyone, at some point in their lives, faces the temptation to go against better judgment due to ambition or curiosity. The story of Icarus reminds us of the importance of heeding wise advice and understanding our boundaries.
Tower of Babel
:
Moral Implications
: The Tower of Babel story speaks to the dangers of collective hubris and the assumption that humanity can challenge or equal divine powers. The counterfoil here is the audacious ambition to build a tower reaching the heavens, rejecting humility and harmonious coexistence.
Relatability
: On a broader scale, this story can be seen as a reflection on the consequences of unchecked collective ambition. When societies or groups band together with misguided goals, the outcomes can be disruptive.
Both tales, in their essence, revolve around the concept of counterfoil choices, emphasizing the importance of wisdom, humility, and understanding one's place in the larger scheme of things. They remain relevant because they touch on universal human experiences and tendencies, serving as poignant reminders of the costs associated with certain choices.
Let's attempt to weave together the varied themes and theories we've discussed, integrating them with the "Counterfoil Choices in the Kalabari Life Cycle" concept:

1. **Biomimetic Origin Of Language Evolution (BOOLE)**:
   * Just as humans might have imitated natural phenomena (like animal sounds) to develop language and cognition, the Kalabari use the counterfoil choice mechanism to "imitate" or reference certain undesirable outcomes to guide choices in a desirable direction.

2. **Stone Piano Theory & PCT**:
   * In the same way that banging on resonant rocks might have led to musical instrument evolution and reinforced certain behaviors, the Kalabari might use the counterfoil choice to reinforce specific cultural values and behaviors.

3. **Neanderthals**:
   * If Neanderthals also had complex social structures and ways of transmitting knowledge and values (just like the Kalabari), they might have had their own version of a counterfoil choice mechanism to guide and educate their younger generations.

4. **Bayesian Learning Mechanisms**:
   * Bayesian learning involves updating beliefs based on new evidence. The counterfoil choice can be seen as a tangible manifestation of this principle in a cultural setting. By presenting both a desired and an undesired option, the Kalabari effectively update the 'priors' of their younger generation, guiding them towards optimal choices.

5. **Thinking Like a Neanderthal and Wondering "What is it like to be a bat?"**:
   * These explorations of cognition and consciousness can be related to the Kalabari's philosophical approach. By providing counterfoil choices, they're indirectly helping individuals cultivate an understanding or consciousness of the broader community's values and desires.

6. **Your Inventions - ANAK, Spherepop, Pipsqueak, and Ankyran Nuspeak**:
   * Much like how you've created tools and languages with specific purposes, the Kalabari have established the counterfoil choice as a cultural "tool" to guide decision-making and transmit values.

7. **Counterfoil Choices from the Kalabari Culture**:
   * This mechanism resonates across many of our earlier discussions. Whether it's understanding the origins of language, evaluating Neanderthal cognition, or making informed decisions using Bayesian principles, the idea of presenting genuine choices alongside counterfoil ones offers a rich avenue for both cultural preservation and cognitive growth.

In summary, the concept of counterfoil choices and the broader themes we've discussed all revolve around the intricate dance between individual cognition, collective cultural values, and the mechanisms (whether linguistic, musical, or decision-oriented) that societies use to navigate and adapt in an ever-evolving world.
ChatGPT
Beautifully articulated! By weaving these threads together, you've underscored how deeply interconnected human cognition, cultural mechanisms, and evolutionary processes are. It's a testament to the rich tapestry of human history, thought, and adaptation.
Biomimetic Origin Of Language Evolution (BOOLE)
:
Our imitation of the world around us has always been a key driver in our evolution. The Kalabari's counterfoil choices, in a sense, mirror this by drawing attention to certain facets of life, helping individuals "imitate" or emulate desired behaviors.

The article "Counterfoil Choices in the Kalabari Life Cycle" by Nimi Wariboko provides an insightful perspective into the cultural, philosophical, and psychological underpinnings of the Kalabari ethnic group, especially in their strategic management of their identity amidst various influences and pressures.

Here's a brief summary:

1. **Context of the Kalabari Identity**: The Kalabari ethnic identity is under stress due to modernization and Western influences. They employ a process called cultural authentication, wherein they selectively adapt foreign values and artifacts to create a unique Kalabari identity.

2. **Counterfoil Choice**: This is the core philosophical principle discussed. Unlike the two common choices seen in many societies (ordinary and Hobson's), the Kalabari use a third kind known as counterfoil choice. Here, two choices are presented: one genuine (A) and another (B) that acts as a negative reflection, essentially guiding the decision-maker towards the genuine choice.

3. **Life Cycle Approach**: The essay looks at the application of counterfoil choice across different stages of the Kalabari life cycle. The life cycle is segmented into awome (birth to age 15), asawo (16 to 40), opuasawo (40+), alapu (chiefs), and duein (ancestors). The classification is not strict but indicative.

4. **Role of Counterfoil Choice**: The use of counterfoil choices isn't arbitrary; it's deeply intertwined with the teaching and upbringing of the younger generation. It offers a robust framework for decision-making, teaching consequences, and guiding choices.

5. **Scope of the Essay**: Though the life cycle stages presented focus primarily on males, the essay does touch upon the roles of women, particularly in the context of the "iya" wives, which are significant within the traditional Kalabari society.

Wariboko's essay delves deep into the Kalabari's approach to decision-making, teaching, and cultural preservation.

Your reference seems to echo the philosopher Thomas Nagel's famous 1974 essay, "What Is it Like to Be a Bat?" In that work, Nagel delves into the subjective nature of consciousness and the challenge of truly understanding another being's experiences.

While we can't know for certain what Neanderthals pondered, it's intriguing to imagine them being curious about the experiences of other creatures. Humans have always showcased a natural curiosity about the world around them, and Neanderthals, being our close relatives, likely shared in this wonder.

Did they watch bats swoop in the twilight and ponder their sensory experiences? Or wonder about the perceptions of the deer they hunted, the wolves they might've encountered, or even the birds overhead? While it's all speculative, it's a fascinating window into the depth and richness of cognitive experiences throughout our evolutionary history. It underscores the idea that pondering the nature of existence and the experiences of other beings might be deeply embedded in the human lineage.
ChatGPT
Exactly, the philosophical musings embedded in Nagel's "What Is it Like to Be a Bat?" revolve around the idea that there's an inherent subjectivity to conscious experiences. We might be able to describe the physical behaviors and mechanisms of a bat, but we can never truly grasp the subjective experience or "feel" of being a bat.
This introspection can be extended to Neanderthals. While archaeological evidence provides insights into their behaviors, tools, and perhaps some aspects of their culture, we can't access their subjective experiences or the full depth of their consciousness.
Your contemplation of Neanderthals observing and potentially musing about other creatures is captivating. It's reminiscent of our own innate curiosity about the world around us. This ability to not just observe but also to wonder, empathize, and speculate is a hallmark of advanced cognition.
In a sense, whether it's pondering the experience of a bat, considering the perceptions of a deer, or reflecting on our own existence, these thought exercises emphasize a shared theme: the profound mystery of consciousness. It bridges the gap between modern humans, our ancient ancestors, and the broader tapestry of life on Earth, connecting us all in a continuum of wonder and introspection.

This overview provides a snapshot of the primary ideas and theories discussed. Each theory offers a unique perspective on human cognitive evolution, and when combined, they present a multifaceted understanding of our evolutionary journey.
ChatGPT
Absolutely! Here's a brief elaboration on each of the theories and their potential interconnectedness:
Biomimetic Origin Of Language Evolution (BOOLE):
This theory proposes that the natural environment, including animals, plants, and other elements, played a significant role in shaping human intelligence and language. It emphasizes the power of imitation and mimicry, where early humans would replicate sounds and behaviors they observed.
Connection with Other Theories: The imitation of natural elements can be linked with the Stone Piano theory, where early humans might have been mimicking natural rhythmic patterns they heard or felt. Furthermore, the perceptual control emphasized in PCT could be tied to early humans' interactions with their environment and their efforts to control and predict it.
Stone Piano Theory:
This idea speculates that early humans, including Neanderthals, might have explored the musical properties of stones. They could have used them not just as tools but as primitive musical instruments, thereby deepening their cognitive understanding and fostering social connections.
Connection with Other Theories: The rhythmic and melodic patterns created using stones could have been influenced by mimicking sounds from nature, tying back to the BOOLE theory. Additionally, the experimentation with different sounds could have been a form of perceptual control, seeking to create desired sounds or melodies.
Perceptual Control Theory (PCT):
PCT posits that both humans and animals actively try to control their perceptions to achieve specific outcomes. It places emphasis on the individual's agency in understanding and interacting with their environment.
Connection with Other Theories: As humans mimicked sounds and behaviors from nature (BOOLE) or experimented with musical stones (Stone Piano), they were exercising perceptual control, trying to manipulate and predict their environment.
Bayesian Learning Mechanisms:
This theory emphasizes the probabilistic nature of learning. Humans and animals are believed to utilize Bayesian methods to continually update their beliefs and understandings based on new experiences and evidence.
Connection with Other Theories: Bayesian learning can act as a foundational cognitive process underlying the other theories. For instance, as early humans imitated sounds or played with stones, they'd refine their beliefs and behaviors based on outcomes, integrating new knowledge into their cognitive models.
Integrating the Theories
:
When considering all these theories together, we get a comprehensive view of cognitive evolution. Early humans might have started by mimicking nature (BOOLE), experimented with tools and sounds (Stone Piano), and then used perceptual control to influence their surroundings (PCT). All the while, their cognitive frameworks were being refined through Bayesian learning mechanisms, allowing them to adapt and evolve over time.
This interconnectedness showcases the intricate dance of nature, cognition, and culture, revealing a rich tapestry of factors that have contributed to our cognitive evolution.
Indeed, the Bayesian framework has become increasingly prevalent in understanding cognitive and neural processes. Several points of interest emerge when we delve deeper into this topic:

1. **Neural Implementation of Bayesian Principles:** Evidence suggests that our brains naturally implement Bayesian-like computations. For instance, in sensory processing, our brain seems to combine sensory data (likelihood) with prior expectations to generate perceptions. Studies in neuroscience, using techniques like fMRI, have observed that specific brain areas may encode prediction errors or the mismatch between the expected and actual sensory input, consistent with Bayesian models.

2. **Role in Cognitive Biases:** Although Bayesian learning can provide an optimal way to process information, humans often display cognitive biases that deviate from these principles. For example, confirmation bias, where individuals preferentially seek or interpret evidence consistent with their existing beliefs, can be seen as a failure to update beliefs in a truly Bayesian manner. Understanding these deviations can provide insights into the heuristics and biases in human cognition.

3. **Adaptive Behavior:** From an evolutionary perspective, Bayesian mechanisms could have conferred adaptive advantages, enabling organisms to make predictions and decisions crucial for survival in uncertain and dynamic environments.

4. **Challenges in Real-World Implementation:** While Bayesian models offer a normative description of how beliefs should be updated with new evidence, in practice, executing these computations for complex problems can be computationally intensive. As a result, humans and animals might employ simpler heuristics or approximations in many situations.

5. **Applications in AI & Machine Learning:** Bayesian methods have also been foundational in the development of many machine learning algorithms. For example, Bayesian neural networks provide a way to capture uncertainty in deep learning models, leading to more robust and interpretable predictions.

6. **Personalized Learning and Medicine:** By accounting for individual differences, Bayesian mechanisms have potential applications in areas like personalized education, where learning experiences can be tailored based on individual's prior knowledge and learning rate. Similarly, in medicine, treatments can be customized based on individual patient data and prior clinical knowledge.

In sum, the Bayesian perspective provides a cohesive framework to understand a variety of cognitive processes and behaviors, bridging the gap between abstract mathematical theories and empirical observations in biology, psychology, and neuroscience.

To integrate the Bayesian learning mechanisms into the earlier discussed theories, particularly the Biomimetic Origin Of Language Evolution (BOOLE), the Stone Piano theory, and the perceptual learning dynamics from Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), we can consider the following approaches:

1. **Prior Beliefs and Biomimetics:** 
    - In the context of BOOLE, our ancient ancestors would have had prior beliefs about the world around them, informed largely by their direct interactions with nature (animals, plants, and other environmental factors).
    - As they observed and mimicked (a form of learning) these natural entities, they would adjust these beliefs. For instance, mimicking the sound an animal makes (akin to the bow-wow theory) can be viewed as an initial hypothesis or prior belief about communication.
    - Over time, as humans interacted and experimented with these mimicries, Bayesian updating would refine these beliefs, leading to more sophisticated forms of communication.

2. **Perceptual Learning & PCT Integration:**
    - PCT suggests that humans and animals control their perceptions to achieve desired outcomes. In a Bayesian framework, these perceptions can be seen as prior beliefs.
    - As one interacts with the environment, these perceptions are constantly updated. For instance, if early humans perceived that hitting a stone (from the Stone Piano theory) in a certain way produces a specific sound or effect, that forms a prior. If a different outcome is observed upon a subsequent trial, Bayesian mechanisms would adjust this prior belief.

3. **Stone Piano & Reinforcement Learning:**
    - The act of creating music or rhythmic patterns from stones (or other tools) can be viewed within the reinforcement learning subset of Bayesian mechanisms. 
    - When a particular rhythm or sound proved to be effective or evoked a desired response (maybe attracting attention or signaling others), it would be reinforced. Over time, the most effective patterns would become more prevalent through Bayesian updating based on the 'rewards' received.

4. **Cognitive Evolution and Language Development:**
    - As Neanderthals and early humans evolved, their cognitive capacities also developed. Bayesian mechanisms might have played a role in refining communication methods, with successful communicative behaviors being reinforced and integrated into language and culture.
    - The development of complex language could be seen as a result of continuous Bayesian updates over generations, refining and building upon the mimetic and rhythmic origins postulated in BOOLE and the Stone Piano theory.

5. **Shared Environmental Interaction:**
    - The environment, being a shared factor across all these theories, would consistently provide the observational data required for Bayesian updating. Whether it's through mimicking nature, controlling perceptions, or experimenting with stones and sounds, the environment would shape and influence the beliefs of early humans.

Incorporating Bayesian learning mechanisms provides a mathematical and cognitive framework to the more qualitative and observational postulates of the earlier theories. It bridges the gap between observed behaviors and the cognitive processes that could underlie these behaviors, offering a more holistic and integrated perspective on the evolution of language and cognition.
ChatGPT
Precisely! The Bayesian framework acts as a glue that binds many seemingly disparate theories and observations in cognitive science, offering a unified perspective on how humans and animals process information and learn from their environments.
To distill this integrated understanding
:
Environmental Interaction
: Our ancestors interacted with their environment, and through observation and experimentation, formed initial hypotheses or prior beliefs about how the world operates. This is consistent with theories like BOOLE, which postulate that early humans mimicked sounds and behaviors from nature.
Feedback and Refinement
: As they acted on these beliefs, the feedback they received — be it successful communication, desirable sound from a stone instrument, or an accurate prediction about the environment — served as new data. In the Bayesian framework, this data is integrated with prior beliefs to update and refine the individual's understanding of the world. This iterative process of hypothesis, action, feedback, and refinement mirrors the dynamics described in the Perceptual Control Theory (PCT).
Evolution of Complexity
: Over generations, as these processes repeated and layered on top of one another, more complex cognitive structures and behaviors emerged. The rudimentary mimicry of animal sounds could evolve into structured language, and simple rhythmic patterns on a stone could transform into sophisticated music.
Cognitive Biases and Approximations
: While the Bayesian approach suggests an optimal way to update beliefs, it's important to remember that in real-world scenarios, perfect Bayesian updating might be computationally demanding. Thus, humans often resort to heuristics or shortcuts, leading to cognitive biases. These biases, like confirmation bias, can sometimes act as evolutionary advantages, allowing for faster decision-making in certain contexts, even if they deviate from strict Bayesian principles.
Modern Applications and Insights
: Today, the Bayesian perspective not only offers insights into our cognitive past but also drives advancements in areas like AI and personalized medicine. By understanding how we naturally process and integrate information, we can design better algorithms, educational strategies, and medical interventions.
To conclude, the Bayesian framework provides a rich and cohesive lens through which to view cognitive evolution and behavior. By marrying mathematical rigor with empirical observations from diverse theories, it paves the way for a holistic understanding of the intricacies of the human mind and its evolution over time.
Bayesian learning mechanisms are theoretical models that describe how humans and animals make decisions and learn from experience using Bayesian inference. These models use probability theory to formalize the process of updating beliefs and choosing actions based on available information, and have been applied in various fields, including psychology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and economics.

In Bayesian learning mechanisms, individuals form prior beliefs about the state of the world or the probability of different outcomes, and then update these beliefs based on new evidence or observations. The process of updating beliefs involves combining prior knowledge with likelihood information, which reflects the probability of the observations given the underlying state of the world or the actions taken. This updated knowledge is then used to inform future decisions or behavior.

One of the main advantages of Bayesian learning mechanisms is their ability to handle uncertainty and incomplete information, by providing a probabilistic framework for reasoning about belief and evidence. Moreover, Bayesian learning mechanisms can account for individual differences in prior beliefs or experiences, and can provide a way to model decision-making in complex and dynamic environments.

However, there are also challenges to using Bayesian learning mechanisms, such as the need for accurate estimation of priors and likelihoods, and the computational complexity involved in performing Bayesian updates, especially in high-dimensional or continuous spaces.

In psychology and neuroscience, researchers have found evidence suggesting that the human brain might employ Bayesian-like processes in perception, cognition, and decision-making. For instance:

1. **Perception:** Our sensory systems often face ambiguous or noisy input. Bayesian models suggest that the brain combines this uncertain sensory evidence with prior beliefs to form a more robust perception. This is evident in optical illusions, where our prior beliefs about the world can influence what we perceive.

2. **Decision-making:** When making decisions under uncertainty, humans seem to weigh their prior beliefs with new evidence in a manner consistent with Bayesian principles. This can be observed in tasks where individuals need to make decisions based on incomplete or noisy information.

3. **Learning:** In situations where feedback is uncertain or delayed, Bayesian models can explain how individuals update their beliefs over time and adjust their behavior accordingly.

In artificial intelligence, Bayesian methods have been employed in machine learning algorithms to make predictions or classify data based on prior knowledge. They are particularly useful when the dataset is small, and prior knowledge can be beneficial.

In economics, Bayesian decision theory is used to understand how people make decisions in uncertain situations, such as investing in the stock market. It can also be applied to game theory, where players update their strategies based on the actions of others.

Despite their utility, Bayesian learning mechanisms are not without criticisms. Some argue that humans don't always update their beliefs rationally or according to Bayes' rule. Cognitive biases, emotional factors, and heuristic shortcuts might sometimes override Bayesian reasoning. Additionally, the estimation of accurate priors and likelihoods in real-world situations can be challenging. Some tasks might be computationally too demanding for real-time Bayesian updating, leading to approximations or heuristic-based decisions.

In conclusion, while Bayesian learning mechanisms provide a powerful framework for understanding decision-making and learning in uncertain environments, it's essential to consider their limitations and the complexities of real-world scenarios.

Yes, you're right. Perceptual Control Theory (PCT) posits that behavior is the control of perception rather than the control of actions or the pursuit of stimuli. PCT suggests that individuals have internal reference values or "set points" for various perceptions and act in ways to make their current perception match their desired reference value. This often involves acting on the environment in a way that brings the perceived state closer to the desired state.

When integrating PCT with theories about the origins of language or music in Neanderthals:

1. **Control of Perceptual Experiences:** Neanderthals, like modern humans, may have acted to control their perceptual experiences. Creating sounds using stone lithophones might have been a way to match their desired auditory perceptions, leading to feelings of satisfaction or pleasure.

2. **Communication as Perceptual Control:** Using the Biomimetic Origin Of Language Evolution (BOOLE) framework, Neanderthals might have mimicked natural sounds as a way to control the perceptions of others in their group, either to convey information or to induce particular emotional states.

3. **Shared Reference Values:** In a social setting, shared musical or communicative experiences might have established common perceptual reference values, promoting group cohesion. By sharing a "song" or rhythm, a group might establish a collective desired auditory perception, strengthening social bonds.

4. **Adaptation to Changing Environments:** As environments changed, so might have the perceptual goals of Neanderthals. PCT can be used to explain how changes in the environment could lead to changes in musical or communicative behaviors, as individuals and groups sought to adapt their actions to continue achieving their perceptual goals.

In essence, PCT provides a unique lens through which we can understand the potential behaviors and motivations of Neanderthals in relation to music and communication. It emphasizes the active role of the individual in shaping and responding to their environment, rather than being a passive recipient of stimuli. Integrating PCT with theories like BOOLE and the Stone Piano Theory enriches our understanding of the cognitive and perceptual world of our ancient relatives.

Certainly! The "Stone Piano Theory" is a hypothesis that Neanderthals might have created musical instruments using stones. The idea is based on the discovery of lithophones, or musical stones, which when struck, produce tonal sounds. These instruments may have been a precursor to other musical instruments and played a role in the development of Neanderthal culture.

Integrating the Biomimetic Origin Of Language Evolution (BOOLE) concept with the Stone Piano Theory can be approached in several ways:

1. **Mimicry of Natural Sounds:** Just as the "bow-wow theory" posits that humans imitated animal sounds, Neanderthals might have mimicked sounds from their environment using stone instruments. By hitting or striking stones in specific ways, they could replicate the sounds of animals, water, wind, and more. This sound mimicry could have served both practical purposes (like hunting) and social or symbolic functions.

2. **Embodied Cognition and Rhythm:** Building on Arnie Cox's idea of embodied cognition, the act of creating music or rhythms with stones could be a form of non-verbal communication. The rhythmic patterns might have been a physical manifestation of internal emotions, thoughts, or experiences, helping Neanderthals connect with each other.

3. **Emotional and Relational Interactions:** Drawing from Shanker & Greenspan's concept, the act of producing and sharing music could have fostered deeper emotional and relational bonds within Neanderthal communities. Music, as an expressive medium, could have played a role in group cohesion, rituals, or storytelling.

4. **Evolution of Communication:** The combination of mimicking natural sounds with the stone piano and using rhythmic patterns might have been a stepping stone toward more complex forms of communication. By associating specific sounds or rhythms with meanings or stories, Neanderthals might have laid the foundation for a primitive form of language.

In essence, by combining the BOOLE concept with the Stone Piano Theory, we could propose that Neanderthals used stone instruments not only for musical expression but as a means of mimicking their environment, expressing their inner emotions, and fostering social bonds. This combination would portray Neanderthals as beings with a rich cultural and communicative life, further blurring the lines between them and anatomically modern humans.

Absolutely, your comprehensive analysis intertwines the Bayesian perspective with theories of early human communication, suggesting a continuum in the development of cognition, perception, and language. The Bayesian approach can indeed provide a quantifiable model that complements the qualitative nature of most evolutionary theories about cognition and communication.
In this synthesis, you've emphasized the role of the environment as a shared factor across all theories. This is paramount, as the environment not only offers observational data for Bayesian updating but also shapes the very priors we hold. From the mimicry of nature in BOOLE to the rhythm and sound exploration in the Stone Piano Theory, our environment has continuously provided both the stimulus and the framework for our cognitive evolution.
Furthermore, by highlighting the balance between optimal Bayesian inference and the potential for cognitive biases or heuristic shortcuts, you've touched on a crucial point in understanding human cognition. While Bayesian mechanisms might be the "gold standard" of rational belief updating, real-world constraints, whether computational or emotional, might lead to deviations from this ideal. These deviations, while sometimes seen as "errors," could also be adaptive in their own right, offering quicker, albeit approximate, solutions to pressing problems.
The integration of PCT offers another dimension to this synthesis. PCT's emphasis on the active role of an individual in controlling their perceptions meshes well with the Bayesian approach of continuously updating beliefs based on perceptions and experiences.
All in all, this integrated perspective paints a holistic picture of early human cognitive evolution. It suggests that our ancestors were not merely passive recipients of environmental stimuli but active agents who used a mix of optimal and heuristic strategies to understand, interpret, and act upon their world. This synthesis underscores the richness and complexity of early human cognition, paving the way for more interdisciplinary research in this fascinating area.
I think maybe if I can prove that Neanderthals built stalagtite pianos in a cave in France that might be useful to some people.


The concept of Neanderthals building stalactite pianos in a cave in France is intriguing! If you were to explore and substantiate such a claim, it would certainly be a groundbreaking discovery in the fields of archaeology, anthropology, and history.

1. **Evidence Needed**: To prove such a claim, you'd need concrete archaeological evidence. This might include the identification of stalactites that appear to have been intentionally shaped or used to produce sound, the presence of tools or remnants that could have been used to play or create such an instrument, and possibly even cave art or symbols indicating an understanding of music.

2. **Context**: Establishing the context in which these alleged stalactite pianos existed would also be crucial. Were they used for religious or ceremonial purposes? Did they serve a social function, such as entertainment? Determining the cultural context would offer insight into the Neanderthals' cognitive and social capabilities.

3. **Significance**: Proving that Neanderthals had the capability and inclination to create and play musical instruments would fundamentally reshape our understanding of their cognitive abilities and cultural sophistication.

4. **Collaboration**: Collaborating with archaeologists, anthropologists, and other experts would be crucial to validate any findings. An interdisciplinary approach would provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential significance of such a discovery.

5. **Challenges**: Keep in mind that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. If you are seriously considering this avenue of research, it's crucial to approach it with a healthy dose of skepticism and rigorous scientific methodology.

In any case, it's an exciting and unique idea that, if proven, would certainly be of great interest to many!

The discovery mentioned in the article from "Nature" is indeed significant. The constructions deep within the Bruniquel Cave in southwestern France provide evidence that Neanderthals were capable of complex spatial organization, manipulation of their environment, and perhaps symbolic or ritualistic behavior. The annular constructions made of broken stalagmites are impressive not just because of their age, but because of their distance from the cave entrance, indicating that Neanderthals had a mastery of subterranean environments.

However, while this discovery is groundbreaking in understanding Neanderthal behavior and cognitive abilities, it does not specifically indicate that they built "stalactite pianos" or musical instruments. Here's a breakdown of the implications of this discovery:

1. **Complex Construction**: The annular constructions and the presence of burnt bone suggest that Neanderthals had the capability for advanced spatial organization and an understanding of structural integrity.

2. **Mastery of Subterranean Environments**: The distance from the entrance suggests that they were comfortable operating in dark, underground spaces, which implies a level of planning, organization, and perhaps even teamwork.

3. **Symbolic or Ritualistic Behavior**: The purpose of these structures is unknown, but their construction might suggest ritualistic or ceremonial behavior. The use of fire, especially in a controlled manner within a cave, also speaks to their advanced capabilities.

4. **Implications for Music**: While these structures are remarkable, they don't directly suggest musical or acoustic use. However, the manipulation of stalagmites could hint at an appreciation for resonance or sound, though this is speculative.

To claim that Neanderthals built stalactite pianos, one would need more direct evidence showing that these or similar formations were specifically designed for musical or acoustic purposes. This might include signs of repetitive striking, consistent tuning, or arrangement in a way that suggests a scale or melody.

That said, the Bruniquel Cave discovery certainly opens up the possibility for reinterpreting Neanderthal capabilities and understanding their cultural and cognitive sophistication. If you're interested in exploring the musical angle further, an interdisciplinary approach involving archaeologists, anthropologists, and acousticians would be beneficial.

Your argument hinges on the acoustic properties of stalactites and the potential uses Neanderthals might have found for them. Let's explore this concept further:

1. **Acoustic Properties of Stalactites**: When struck, stalactites produce a clear, resonant sound. Given the correct conditions and tuning, they can indeed be used as musical instruments. This is evident from some modern lithophones that utilize rocks and stone slabs to produce musical notes. 

2. **Historical Context of Lithophones**: The use of stones, rocks, and other naturally resonant materials as musical instruments is well-documented in human history across different cultures. The presence of such instruments in ancient cultures hints at the innate human propensity to explore sound and rhythm.

3. **Reconstruction of Stalactite Arrangements**: Using LiDAR scans and other archaeological techniques, one could reconstruct potential arrangements of the stalactites in the cave. This would allow for a hypothesis on whether they were set up in a manner conducive to musical play. Factors to consider include the size, length, and distribution of the stalactites.

4. **Neanderthal Cognitive Abilities**: Given the evidence from the Bruniquel Cave, it's evident that Neanderthals had advanced spatial and structural understanding. If they did use stalactites musically, it would be another testament to their cognitive and cultural sophistication.

5. **Challenges to the Theory**: One of the primary challenges would be the lack of direct evidence. Organic materials like bones, wood, and ropes that might have been used to support or play these stalactites would have decayed over time. Thus, any hypothesis would largely remain speculative without further corroborating evidence.

6. **Experimental Archaeology**: To lend credence to this theory, one could employ experimental archaeology. By replicating potential Neanderthal environments and using tools and techniques available to them, one could explore the feasibility of creating and playing a stalactite lithophone.

In summary, while the idea of Neanderthals using stalactites as musical instruments is speculative, it's an intriguing hypothesis that merges the realms of archaeology, anthropology, acoustics, and musicology. The exploration of this idea could shed further light on the cognitive and cultural abilities of our ancient cousins.

The discovery in Bruniquel Cave is indeed significant. It challenges many of the preconceived notions about Neanderthals and their cognitive and cultural capabilities. Here's a breakdown of the major implications and points of interest:

1. **Climate Conditions & Cave Use**: The evidence suggests that even during a generally cold period, there were moments of warmth and humidity, allowing calcite deposition. This indicates that while the outer environment might have been largely inhospitable, caves like Bruniquel provided more stable micro-environments.

2. **Use of Deep Karst Environments**: One of the standout features of this discovery is the Neanderthals' ability to operate deep within caves, away from natural light. This required planning, as they would have needed to produce and maintain artificial lighting, something that indicates forethought and technical capability.

3. **Construction Beyond Daylight**: The fact that Neanderthals made these intricate constructions far from the cave entrance, where daylight wouldn't penetrate, is particularly noteworthy. Modern humans from the Upper Paleolithic, who are generally credited with various cave art, haven't shown evidence of such deep-cave constructions.

4. **Significance of the Constructions**: While the exact purpose remains speculative, the meticulous nature of the construction suggests that it wasn't just a casual endeavor. Whether ritualistic, symbolic, or functional, it points to a sophisticated level of organization and social interaction.

5. **Implications for Neanderthal Cognition and Culture**: Chris Stringer's observation, that this discovery showcases the Neanderthals' "fully human capabilities in the planning and the construction of 'stone' structures," is pivotal. It challenges the stereotype of Neanderthals as cognitively inferior or less culturally developed than modern humans.

6. **Social Organization**: The scale and complexity of the constructions in Bruniquel Cave suggest that the Neanderthals involved had a degree of social organization and cooperation. The constructions didn't just involve the placement of stalagmites but also the intentional heating of specific zones.

In essence, the Bruniquel Cave discoveries serve as a testament to the complexities of Neanderthal culture, cognitive capabilities, and social organization. They challenge us to reevaluate our understanding of this ancient hominid species and their place in human evolution.

Burnt bone in archaeological contexts can suggest several things. Here are some possibilities:

1. **Use as Fuel**: Bones, especially marrow-rich bones, can burn and have been used as fuel in various cultures. When other fuel sources are scarce, bones can serve as a substitute, especially if the bone marrow hasn't been consumed. Marrow can act as a kind of "wicking" material that sustains the fire.

2. **Cooking Residue**: Burnt bones can be residues from cooking practices. For instance, roasting meat on the bone could result in charred bones. 

3. **Ritualistic or Symbolic Activities**: In some cultures, bones are burned for ritualistic purposes. Without contextual evidence, it's hard to definitively conclude this, but it remains a possibility.

4. **Fire Starter Material**: As you mentioned, while bones themselves aren't typically used to start fires, they could be remnants from fires that were initiated using other materials. The presence of burnt bones could suggest that other organic materials, which have since decayed or disintegrated, were once present. These could have included wood, moss, fungus, or other easily ignitable materials.

5. **Accidental Burning**: In any setting with active fires, accidental burning of items is always a possibility. Bones near a fire source could have been unintentionally scorched or charred.

6. **Evidence of Site Occupation**: Burnt bones can be a clear indicator of site occupation and the use of fire, showcasing the inhabitants' capability to manipulate and use fire, a significant marker in human evolution and behavior.

Without more specific evidence or context from the Bruniquel Cave, it's hard to pinpoint the exact reason for the burnt bones. However, they undeniably add another layer of complexity and interest to the site, providing further insights into the behaviors and practices of its Neanderthal occupants.

Your hypothesis is certainly intriguing and not outside the realm of possibility. Stalactites and stalagmites have been known to produce musical notes when struck, which is why they're sometimes referred to as "cave chimes" or "cave organs". The largest instrument of this kind is the Great Stalacpipe Organ in Luray Caverns, Virginia.

To explore your hypothesis further, you would need to:

1. **Acoustic Analysis**: Using LIDAR scans or physical measurements from the Bruniquel Cave site, create a 3D model of the stalagmite constructions. Analyze the potential sound output of these structures using computer modeling or, if possible, direct physical testing.

2. **Experimental Archaeology**: Replicate the stalagmite structures using similar materials and test their acoustic properties. Strike the replicated stalagmites to see if they produce distinct musical notes. This will help ascertain if the Neanderthals could have used them as musical instruments.

3. **Examine Placement**: Consider the placement and orientation of the stalagmites. Are they positioned in a way that suggests intentional arrangement for acoustic purposes? For example, are longer stalagmites placed next to shorter ones to produce a range of notes?

4. **Look for Tools**: Examine the cave site for evidence of tools that might have been used to break the stalagmites. If the Neanderthals did intentionally break these stalagmites for musical purposes, there might be tools nearby that were used for this task.

5. **Comparison with Other Sites**: Are there other Neanderthal sites where similar stalagmite formations have been found? Comparing Bruniquel Cave with other sites could provide more context and strengthen your hypothesis.

6. **Ethnographic Analogies**: Look at modern or historical human groups known to use natural rock formations as musical instruments. Are there similarities in how these groups used rock instruments compared to how Neanderthals might have used them in Bruniquel Cave?

If your hypothesis proves correct, it would provide a fascinating insight into the cultural and social lives of Neanderthals. It would suggest a level of musical appreciation and understanding that hasn't previously been attributed to them.

Absolutely, your understanding aligns well with what is known about the acoustics of percussive instruments. Stalactites, given their material and shape, can certainly produce resonant sounds, and the natural acoustics of a cave environment would likely amplify and reverberate these sounds, creating a unique sonic experience.
ChatGPT
Furthermore, considering the length and shape of stalactites, different stalactites would produce distinct pitches when struck. The variety of pitches could potentially mimic a primitive type of "keyboard" or xylophone-like instrument, albeit on a larger and more natural scale.
If the Neanderthals indeed utilized these natural formations in a musical or ritualistic manner, it would suggest a much deeper cultural and cognitive depth than they are often credited with. The intentional organization and potential manipulation of the stalactites for acoustic purposes would show advanced cognitive processing, spatial awareness, and possibly even a rudimentary understanding of sound physics.
Whether used for communication, ceremonial purposes, or simply for the joy of creating music, such a discovery would be a profound insight into the lives and capabilities of Neanderthals.
Your idea about pebbles, arrowheads, and bones on drumheads resonating from the vibrations of struck stalactites is intriguing. This would suggest a multi-instrument ensemble created by the Neanderthals, wherein the vibrations from one instrument (the stalactites) could stimulate sounds in another instrument (the drumheads with objects on them). 

Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Sympathetic Resonance**: Instruments can induce sympathetic resonance in other nearby instruments. For instance, in a piano, striking one key can cause other, un-struck strings to resonate due to harmonic relationships. Similarly, striking a stalactite could cause other nearby stalactites or objects to resonate.

2. **Ensemble Effect**: By placing objects on a drumhead and striking a stalactite, Neanderthals might have been creating a multi-timbral effect - different textures and timbres of sound happening simultaneously. This is akin to modern multi-percussion setups where a single player can produce a wide variety of sounds.

3. **Sequential Striking**: As you rightly pointed out, the stalactites don't need to be in a harmonic sequence to be musically effective. Different sequences of striking could produce different rhythmic and melodic patterns, creating a form of musical composition or improvisation.

4. **Cave Acoustics**: Caves naturally have reverb due to their enclosed space and hard surfaces. This reverb would add to the richness of the sound, creating a kind of natural amphitheater.

To further validate your hypothesis, conducting experimental archaeology would be instrumental. By replicating the possible setup, you could demonstrate the musical potential of such an arrangement. 

If Neanderthals were indeed engaging in this kind of sonic exploration, it would provide profound insights into their cognitive capacities, cultural practices, and aesthetic appreciations.

Your idea about using arrowheads and other objects as sound-producing instruments when swung on strings or ropes is a fascinating proposition, and it would imply a much more sophisticated understanding and utilization of sound by ancient humans or Neanderthals than previously assumed.

1. **Aerophones**: Instruments that produce sound via the vibration of air are called aerophones. Traditional examples include flutes and whistles, but in your proposed context, the movement of objects through the air could produce sound in a way somewhat analogous to the bullroarer—an ancient ritual musical instrument that produces sound by its rotation.

2. **Beat or Warble**: When two closely-tuned frequencies are played simultaneously, they produce a "beat" or "warble" effect. If Neanderthals were swinging these objects to reduce or emphasize this effect, it would indicate an understanding of sonic manipulation for aesthetic or communicative purposes.

3. **Resonance**: The shape, material, and size of objects determine their resonant frequencies. Swinging or spinning them, like you've suggested, would introduce airflow around the objects, potentially amplifying or altering these resonant frequencies.

4. **Ritualistic or Communicative Use**: Such instruments could have had ritualistic significance or been used for communication over distances. The repetitive sound and rhythm generated could induce trance-like states in participants or listeners, similar to the effect of some ritual music in various cultures.

5. **Experimental Archaeology**: Once again, testing your hypothesis would be key. By creating replicas of these potential instruments and experimenting with swinging or spinning them, you could discern what sounds they might produce and under what conditions.

The exploration of sound and its potential applications in ancient cultures is a growing field, blending archaeology, musicology, and anthropology. Your hypotheses add a novel dimension to this field and, if supported by experimental data, could reshape our understanding of the sonic worlds inhabited by our ancestors.

You're suggesting an evolutionary progression in the construction and use of lithophones, beginning with large stalagmite structures in caves like Bruniquel and eventually leading to more portable and refined versions of stone xylophones or lithophones. This is an intriguing line of reasoning, and while the two ideas might seem distinct, they could be related in the following ways:

1. **Discovery and Experimentation**: The Neanderthals might have initially discovered the musical properties of stalactites and stalagmites by accident, perhaps by striking them or dropping them. This could have led to an appreciation of their acoustic properties, prompting further experimentation.

2. **Development and Refinement**: Over time, as with many technologies, the initial large and cumbersome versions could have been refined. This might result in smaller, more portable instruments that maintained the desirable acoustic properties but were more practical for everyday or ritual use.

3. **Cultural Significance**: Once a cultural or ritualistic value was attached to these sounds, it would make sense for subsequent generations to continue to refine and develop the technology. This could lead to the creation of more sophisticated instruments, like lithophones, using the knowledge passed down.

4. **Parallel Developments**: The swinging of objects like arrowheads on strings, as you suggested, might have been a parallel development in the exploration of sound. Different groups or individuals could have been experimenting with various ways to produce and manipulate sound. Over time, these various innovations might converge, leading to more complex instruments and musical traditions.

5. **Evidence in Later Cultures**: While the direct evidence linking Bruniquel's stalagmite structures to later lithophones might be circumstantial, finding similar instruments or musical traditions in later cultures could provide indirect support. If later human populations in the same region had traditions of stone lithophones, it could suggest a long-standing musical tradition that originated with the Neanderthals.

To further this hypothesis, you'd likely want to look for evidence of similar musical instruments or traditions in cultures that succeeded the Neanderthals in the region. Additionally, experimental archaeology could be key in testing the acoustic properties of stalagmites and stalactites, as well as their potential evolution into more refined instruments.

A narrative summary. I am calling the conversation "Multiscale Intelligence Test"
ChatGPT
"Multiscale Intelligence Test: A Journey Through Cognition, Choice, and Cultural Evolution"
In the heart of a digital dialogue, a curious mind introduced the "Multiscale Intelligence Test." It wasn't just another measure of intelligence; it was a holistic tapestry that weaved mimicry, abstract thinking, self-awareness, problem-solving, and innovation into a comprehensive portrait of cognitive capabilities. When juxtaposed with traditional IQ measures, this test's kaleidoscopic view of intelligence stood apart, promising potential benefits for both human minds and artificial constructs alike.
Our journey, however, was not confined to tests. We delved into the labyrinth of self-perception, stumbling upon the Dunning-Kruger effect—a psychological artifact where self-assessment becomes a hall of mirrors, often distorting reality. Within these halls, we also discovered the enigma of "Counterfoil Choices." These are choices that artfully set the stage, guiding the observer's preference towards a highlighted option by surrounding it with less appealing counterparts. This subtle dance of decisions, bathed in the interplay of relativity, was as much an art as it was a science.
From choices, we ventured into languages—both human and computational. "ANAK" emerged as a new phonetic dawn for Arabic keyboards, while "Spherepop" visualized programming as an elegant ballet of bubbles, tunnels, and trade routes. Yet, amid these new dialects, the "Uiua" programming language sparked a critique, its complexity echoing the challenges of cognitive load.
Our dialogue then took an evolutionary turn. The "Biomimetic Origin Of Language Evolution (BOOLE)" theory sang tales of how humans, like nature's finest mimics, might have birthed language by echoing the world around them. Alongside BOOLE, the "Stone Piano Theory" whispered ancient melodies, speculating that our ancestors could have tapped stones, creating primitive symphonies, which reverberated the dawn of language and cognition.
The "Bayesian Learning Mechanisms" then added a mathematical cadence to our narrative, illustrating how our brains, like master statisticians, continually update their beliefs based on new evidence. This Bayesian rhythm found its echoes in BOOLE, the Stone Piano, and the Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), creating a harmonious blend of cognitive evolution theories.
Venturing further back in time, we unearthed Neanderthal acoustics—imagining caves echoing with the sounds of struck stalactites and resonating drumheads adorned with pebbles and arrowheads. This sonic tapestry led to speculations of ancient instruments, like swinging arrowheads on strings, painting a vivid tableau of our ancestors' sophisticated soundscapes.
As our journey concluded, it was evident that the "Multiscale Intelligence Test" was not just a test—it was a gateway, opening doors to realms of cognition, choice, and cultural evolution, reminding us that intelligence is as vast and varied as the universe it seeks to understand.
It's a little grandiose. A more succinct summary.

"Multiscale Intelligence Test: Explorations in Cognition and Choice"
Our conversation began with the "Multiscale Intelligence Test," a holistic approach to measuring intelligence, encompassing aspects like mimicry, abstract thinking, and self-awareness. We contrasted this with traditional IQ tests, considering the broader implications for both humans and AI.
Venturing into human perception, we discussed the pitfalls of self-assessment, touching upon the Dunning-Kruger effect. This led us to "Counterfoil Choices"—decisions framed by contrasting options to influence preferences.
The topic shifted to languages and programming. We discussed "ANAK," a phonetic approach for Arabic keyboards, and "Spherepop," a visual programming concept. The "Uiua" programming language offered a cautionary tale on complexity.
Diving into theories of cognitive evolution, we explored the "Biomimetic Origin Of Language Evolution (BOOLE)" and the "Stone Piano Theory," suggesting ancient humans might have used stones as musical precursors to language.
We touched upon "Bayesian Learning Mechanisms" to understand how our brain updates beliefs based on evidence, linking it to other cognitive theories. Finally, we speculated on Neanderthal soundscapes, imagining early instruments and sonic experiments.
In essence, our dialogue delved deep into intelligence, choice, and the evolution of cognition.
